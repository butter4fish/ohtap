Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask.  They're kind of warm-up questions and just require a short answer.  The first question is, sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I'm not quite sure that's a--I can answer that really with a short answer but let's say, collard greens.

Speaker 1: And, sir, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.
Story_ID: 136760
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side of the family, and I'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mary Belle, obviously, Dawson.  Her maiden name was Smith.  M-A-R-Y, B-E-L-L-E, S-M-I-T-H.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Norwood, Georgia.  I have no idea of her date of birth, and she made sure of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, she didn't tell you--she never told her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Do you have any speculation as to what it might be?
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, and what do you know about her side of the family?  Did she talk about her family much?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother, along with my father [Horace Greeley Dawson], moved to Augusta, Georgia from their home place in Norwood when they were married, which was in their late teens, around the turn of the century, I suppose, and most of the family, on both sides, remained in Norwood.  Some of the siblings, her brother, Thaddeus, moved to Augusta later on and I knew him very well but I didn't get a chance to interact very much with her other siblings who remained in Norwood for most of their lives.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We would visit during the summer, occasionally, but that was about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there any discussion about what the family was doing--
Speaker 2: My mother--my mother's father and her mother were--were sharecroppers for the most part.  They later on owned their own land and farmed it for years until--until their deaths.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they have any stories that go back to slavery days or the Civil War or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I was the baby in the family so I was not privy to many of those tales.  My oldest brother and sister can talk a lot about that but there was very little of that for me when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you know your grandparents at all?
Speaker 2: No, I knew of my grandfather on my father's side who himself moved to Augusta later on but I did not know my grand--maternal grandmother nor my maternal--my paternal grandfather and grandmother because of--of my age, because they had passed on before I--before I was born.
Story_ID: 136761
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your father's side of the family.  What was your father's full name and can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Sure, my father's name was Horace, G-R-E-E-L-Y [sic, G-R-E-E-L-E-Y], Greeley Dawson, who, as I said, was born in Norwood [Georgia] and came to Augusta [Georgia] at an early age, served in the [U.S.] Military for two years.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in--was that World War I?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and came back to Augusta and settled there and spent the rest of his life there working at the railroad station as an express handler.  So my father worked the railroad for all of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Was an express handler for Railway Express [Agency].
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a--
Speaker 2: The only job he ever had, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so he was lucky to be in the same job or, I guess he was, yeah, I suppose he's--
Speaker 2: He stayed for all of his life.  He was--didn't believe in moving around.  He just--he stayed there and made the best of that particular job.
Speaker 1: Well he had a job during the Depression which is significant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, had a job when a lot of folks didn't have jobs.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Is there any significance to him being named Horace Greeley, you know?  We know there's a famous Horace Greeley who worked for one of the New York papers.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly--
Speaker 1: He wrote during the Civil War.
Speaker 2: --and that's for whom he was named.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather Dawson was a slave and somehow managed to purchase his freedom.  He was actually a Wicker, named after the slave owner up in Norwood, Georgia at that time and he somehow saved enough money, as the story goes, because the slaveowner permitted him to--to work--he was a well-digger and somehow he parlayed that skill into enough money to purchase his freedom, and the moment he did so, he changed his name from Wicker to Dawson, and it's not clear why or for whom the Dawson name was changed but it was and so he also named my father Horace Greeley after the person you just described.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum, okay, all right.  So you knew your grandfather, on your father's side, right?
Speaker 2: Briefly.
Speaker 1: Briefly, okay.
Speaker 2: Briefly.  I remember him coming by the house occasionally, after having moved to Augusta in his waning years, to be taken care of by my father's sister who lived there and he has moved to Augusta and I remember him very, very faintly in my early years.  I was probably about three or four when--when he died.
Story_ID: 136762
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how your mother [Mary Belle Dawson] and father [Horace Dawson] met?
Speaker 2: Not that I--not that I know of.  I do know that when he went away to the [U.S.] Military, they had been dating and she promised to--to be there when he returned, of course, as most--most young ladies did when their intended went off to war and he came back and she truly--really was there and they married and moved to Augusta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: So she was really there when he came back.
Speaker 2: She was there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Some people didn't get that.
Speaker 2: She was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fortunately.
Speaker 1: All right, so, now why did they move to Augusta from Norwood [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: All Augusta is--was the largest urban area to Norwood, Georgia, about sixty miles away, and it was the place to go.  It was--if you were looking for a job or if you were looking for a better life, you--you went to--you went to Augusta.  Atlanta [Georgia], in the other direction going West, was much farther, 100 miles or so, Augusta was closer.  And my grandfather, before he retired, and before he stopped work, also worked on the railroad.  He was a--he stoked the boiler for the railroad.  And the train that ran from Norwood to Augusta in those days was frequented by the siblings, his children, who could ride free.  They could get on the train and ride to Augusta.  So they'd seen the big city and they had some idea what was--what was going on there and my father, having been to the military, had seen a little bit more of the world.  So when he returned, Augusta was the place to go.
Speaker 1: Now did your father talk about his military experience and--
Speaker 2: Very, very, very infrequently.  He--he was a very closed-mouthed person about that.  He didn't like violence.  He had no reason to talk about that.  He didn't discuss that with us.  It was just his duty to serve his country.  He did it, it was over and let's move on.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he didn't say anything really about it?  Okay.
Story_ID: 136763
Speaker 1: Now what was your mother [Mary Belle Smith Dawson] like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Mother was a very, very caring person.  She was--family was her life, her family and her church.  She spent all of her time making sure that the children did what they were supposed to do while daddy was away working.  My mother never worked.  She took care of the family.  My father [Horace Dawson] didn't believe that women should be out there struggling when they had children to take care of and so she stayed home with us and we're all the better for it.  She was a warm human being.  She left all the discipline up to daddy.  She would say, "Wait until your father comes."  And he took care of all of that but she took care of all of the scrapes and the bruises and the crying and the school work and took--made sure that we were okay.  She was the neighborhood person to whom people turned for--for conversation, to whom people turned for advice.  Our house was always full of people coming--coming just to--just to talk and so the house was constantly full of people and so we had a very, very warm environment in our home.  We had a--we had a great neighborhood experience and they all centered around my mother.  Now, at one point she did decide she wanted to become an entrepreneur so she started selling, I think it was called, Lucky Heart products [sic, Lucky Heart Cosmetics], sort of a home version of Avon.  You would order things and they would come and, instead of you going door-to-door, people would come to your home.  You had these parties and people would come to your home and you would show your wares and momma did that for a couple of years with it but it didn't work out because there was a--there was a confrontation with the parcel post guy who brought stuff to the home and he was--he was a white guy and he came one day when daddy happened to be there and that was the end of that.  It just didn't work out.  Daddy and he had some words about how he walked into our home as if he lived there and this was--and I was a wee tot at the time.  I was frightened because you just didn't do that in Augusta.  Daddy got away with--he--but that was the end of our mother's career into sales.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Those are the days that--there's a lot of salesmen and deliverymen and that sort of thing and they would just, you know, sometimes they would just come in people's homes--
Speaker 2: Of course, of course, and you wouldn't have thought anything of it.  I think his mistake was he--he called--he opened the door and walked in and he called my mother by her first name and he said, "Belle, Belle," and daddy didn't take kindly to that.
Story_ID: 136764
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Mary Belle Dawson and Horace Dawson] have a chance to go to school when they were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, my mother did go to high school and--in Atlanta [Georgia], at Spelman [High School], by the way.  Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] had a high school during those early days and my mother attended there for a year or two so much so that when she returned to Norwood [Georgia] she was actually certified to teach and did so for a semester or so before coming to Augusta [Georgia], in the normal schools that they called them in those days.  But my father--my father, I think, went as far as the fifth and sixth grade.
Story_ID: 136765
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me how many brothers and sisters do you have?  And now, you're the youngest right?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: I have two brothers and two sisters.
Speaker 1: Can you name them for us--
Speaker 2: Sure--
Speaker 1: --in the order--
Speaker 2: My oldest brother, and the oldest in the family of siblings, was Leslie.  Leslie spent most of his career at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana teaching English after having worked in Georgia and South Carolina before ending up at Southern and Leslie died several years ago after having retired from Southern University.  Next to Leslie was my sister, Mary.  Mary left Augusta [Georgia] at an early age, unlike the others of us, and moved to Newark, New Jersey and spent her life working at the Veteran's Hospital in dietary services in Newark, New Jersey, returned to Augusta about fifteen years ago after spending all of her life there, bought a little home there and spent her last years in Augusta and, believe it or not, we buried her just last Saturday.  So she was the second of the five siblings to die.  Thirdly, my sister, Josephine, was a public school librarian in Augusta and retired several years ago and who lived there all of her life, a couple of blocks from where my sister Mary, whom I just described died, and so she is still in Augusta, retired there.  And then the person who is nearest to me is [HM] Horace [Dawson, Jr.] who is at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], now retired foreign service diplomat.  But I'm the baby.
Story_ID: 136766
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell me about what it was like growing up in Augusta [Georgia].  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I had a very interesting, lively, childhood there.  Remember that there are eight years between me and my brother [HM] Horace [Dawson, Jr.] which means that I pretty much grew up alone, as siblings go, and so my friends were other persons in the neighborhood who were my age.  Horace had gone away to the [U.S.] Military, and if you can think back to those years, so I pretty much grew up with friends in the neighborhood.  I remember we were on an unpaved--unpaved street and during my formative years we finally got indoor plumbing so daddy [Horace Dawson] added another room to the house and indoor plumbing came in.  A couple of years later, the street on which we lived was paved which was a real big deal for us.  It was a great childhood.  I--in spite all of that was encouraged by everybody in the neighborhood to do well.  It was a neighborhood where people took care of each other and while we never had very much in terms of monetary things, we've never--I think--I did my father's income tax the year he retired at sixty--I think daddy was sixty-six and his pay was less than $6,000.  I don't remember the exact dollar figure but my mother [Mary Belle Smith Dawson] never worked.  My father bought a home, he was at the peak of his earning power, was less than $6,000, he sent five of us to college on that salary and we all worked and we all made it.  So we never knew we were poor.  We never missed a meal.  We never had to worry about going to bed hungry.  It was a very, very warm, supportive, connected neighborhood in which I grew up.  Everybody took care of everybody else.  We didn't have a key to the door and that was--I never knew there was a key to our door and--where I grew up in Augusta.  And those days are long gone, of course, but they were very dear to us.  Paine College [Augusta, Georgia] was within spitting distance of the house.  We could, within three blocks, be on the campus up there where we were always welcomed as young-young, aspiring African American kids looking up to the grown ups, going around about the business of education.  Not far from there, in the other direction, was the Bethlehem Center.  The Bethlehem Center was a neighborhood center which was related to Paine College in the sense that it was an arm of the Methodist Church.  The Methodist Church was one of the sponsors of Paine College but it also operated this little neighborhood center which had Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, clubs for us, had a gym.  In fact, the only gym in town where black folk could go was at the Bethlehem Center which was owned by the Episcopal Church.  Paine College played just basketball games there.  So it was a very, very warm and supportive neighborhood and much of the commerce was brought in.  You talk about people who came into the neighborhood going door-to-door, that's how things worked.  Those people who could afford to go out of the neighborhood did so occasionally but everything was--everything was within walking distance, the grocery stores, the launderers--launderers, the newspapers.  There was a black weekly newspaper.  My brother, Horace, before leaving, worked there.  Very, very vibrant neighborhood.
Story_ID: 136767
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're talking about a real cohesive black community in Augusta [Georgia] when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Without a doubt.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: No question about it.  It was a very interactive community and it was a neighborhood where everybody knew everybody else.  There were things that went on in the neighborhood that everybody knew about but they were all supportive activities.  They were all things that sort of lifted people up and made people feel good about themselves and we all supported everybody else within the neighborhood and we grew up knowing that we were somebody.  We grew up knowing that we could achieve.  We grew up knowing that--that hard work was necessary, certainly in our house.  There was no choice in our house.  You had to do that in order to stay there.  Daddy [Horace Dawson] took no prisoners.
Story_ID: 136768
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you growing up?  What were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you would ask that.  I always pushed the envelope.  I was--I was sort of the--I was the maverick in the family.  I always tested the limits.  I always knew when to move back but I sort of took advantage of being the baby, let's just put it that way, and I recognized that I was getting away with a lot of stuff that my brothers [Leslie Dawson and HM Horace Dawson, Jr.] and sisters [Mary Dawson and Josephine Dawson] could never have gotten away with and daddy [Horace  Dawson] mellowed a bit.  I guess he was just tired when I came along but it was a lot of stuff I could do.  I would--I would slip on the bus--slip in the back door of the bus.  The bus finally started coming through our neighborhood and you've heard the story about the Birmingham story and how the black folk would get on and pay their fares and have to get off and come on--come and get in the back door to go in--to go to their seats.  Well, that wasn't true in Augusta [Georgia].  You could still go to--but I was--when the doors opened, I would slip in the back door and take a ride--take a ride downtown.  Just crawl in so the guys--so they wouldn't see me.  I would do--I would do things like that.  I think that was probably the most dangerous thing I did because if you'd been caught, you were in trouble because all the drivers were white, of course, but I would--I would do things that were, sort of prankish, and get away with them because I guess I was the baby and sort of favored.  My sister, Josephine, who was next to me was still living at home and she would sort of cover for me and other things I would--a lot of things I would do.  On the football team I was--I was not a football player I was a basketball player so when the football team would go off and I'd hide on the bus and coach would look up, he'd be halfway from where he's going and I--couldn't take--couldn't put me off.  Things like that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Good things.
Story_ID: 136769
Speaker 1: Now the black community [in Augusta, Georgia] was kind of insular--insulated sort of you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, without a doubt, there were boundaries in the community and it was sort of one area for the most part where most of the black folk lived and, of course, across the railroad tracks was another side where white folks lived.  So, yeah, we were sort of insulated and the community was self-supporting.  Everything you needed was in that--was in that community.  You had the laundries, you had the grocery stores, the theaters, you had the cabs, everything, the clubs, the schools, everything, barbershops, everything that you needed was in that community all owned and operated by blacks.
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, without a doubt, without a doubt, church was a great part of our life.  My mother [Mary Belle Smith Dawson] happened to be Baptist and she never changed.  She came from Norwood [Georgia] as a Baptist.  My father [Horace Dawson] was born, grew up in the A.M.E. [American Methodist Episcopal] Church as did his children.  So we trekked off to church every Sunday with daddy.  Momma walked two blocks to her church, which was Antioch [Baptist Church] which was not far from--a couple of blocks from the house.  But all of us followed the old man down to Bethel A.M.E. Church, so we all grew up there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 135862
Speaker 1: I should ask you this on tape then I guess, we're rolling again. Now you grew up in Augusta, G-A [Georgia] and everybody knows about James Brown so tell us, did you know James Brown coming up?
Speaker 2: I did, I did, I knew James.  I--James and I were not friends but I knew James and I followed his career from the time he left Augusta and hit it big with 'Please, Please, Please' and up until his career today.  He lived in South Carolina and I think still has a home over there in Beech--Beech Island, South Carolina where he moved when he left Augusta.  He had a home in Augusta, a very beautiful home on Walton Way in Augusta and sold it, I think, years ago and then he moved to South Carolina and yeah, I've known him for years and have followed his music all of my life for the most part.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he grew up in the neighborhood--is a little bit older than you--
Speaker 2: Just a tad older, maybe a couple of years older than I but has come back with a vengeance.  As you know, James was away for a while and was incarcerated and spent a little time for income tax evasion, I think it was.  He went through a period there when, every time we looked up, they were after him for something and I think they were really--he was exacerbating a lot of--a lot of these problems, James was having but he spent time on that tax evasion thing, I think, and he came out better than--bigger than he was when he went in and said so to [HM] Brother Al Sharpton who went to visit him.
Speaker 1: Uh-hum.
Speaker 2: That I'm going to be bigger and better and badder when I come out of here.  Don't worry about this, this is just a bump in the road.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, typical James.
Story_ID: 135863
Speaker 1: All right.  Now tell me about school.  Now--was there one school in the black community in Augusta [Georgia] that--
Speaker 2: Actually--
Speaker 1: --all black children went to?
Speaker 2: --actually there were two or three elementary schools in Augusta when I was growing up which we--in our neighborhood--and I went to one of them which was within a couple of blocks from our house called Charles T. Walker Elementary [later, Charles Thomas Walker Traditional Magnet School, Augusta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But until my senior year in high school, there was no high school program in Augusta for black folk.  Now this was as late as the mid-'40s [1940s].  I graduated from high school in 1950 from what is now Lucy [Craft] Laney High School in the first class from that high school in Augusta, Georgia.  If you went past elementary school during those days, you had two options.  You could go to Paine [College, Augusta, Georgia], which had a high school program or you could go to Haines [Institute, Augusta, Georgia] which is where my brother and I attended, [HM] Horace [Dawson, Jr.] and I.  Haines was a private boarding school which was one of many throughout the South and so I'm not describing something that was unique to Augusta.  The pattern repeated itself throughout the Southeast that high schools were boarding schools in our communities which were founded by church-related ministries who came south and started schools for African Americans.  Haines was one such school and it was a boarding school and it had grades one through twelve.  You could also go to elementary school there and many of us commuted because we lived in the community but it was also available to students from other communities as a boarding facility.  And so I went to school there for three years.  It was a Presbyterian church-related institution started by a Mrs. Lucy Craft Laney who was a friend of Mary McLeod Bethune who, as you know, had started what later became Bethune-Cookman College [later, Bethune-Cookman University] in [Daytona Beach] Florida.  And at the end of my junior year, the school went belly up and actually merged with the public school which was then becoming the school of choice in Augusta because the state had finally figured out that we ought to do something about educating these young folk and these two entities came together, Haines Institute which is where I was and A. R. Johnson High School [later, A. R. Johnson Health Science and Engineering Magnet Middle and High School], which was the public school and they merged and formed Lucy Laney High School.  So I actually graduated in 1950 from the first public high school there in Augusta.
Story_ID: 135864
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell me about grade school [at Charles T. Walker Elementary, later, Charles Thomas Walker Traditional Magnet School, Augusta, Georgia].  What did you like about grade school and what didn't you like?
Speaker 2: Everything.  I loved--I loved my work in school.  I was always into books.  I was an avid reader.  I had great teachers.  It was always a lot of fun.  I was three blocks from home and school was where you wanted to be.  I was always sort of saddened when summer came.  I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed the challenge of working and studying and it was something that I--but on the other hand I was--I was a boy.  I was always--time came to play, I played equally as hard.  So it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a full school year there in the black schools there in Augusta?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  In Augusta [Georgia]--Augusta was not a farming community.  It was sort of urbanized so we didn't have to take off to go to the fields and things like that.  So, yes, we had the nine months school year and the summer--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --summer off but no, we didn't have to worry about the truncated year because of the seasonal prerogatives in the South.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: English.  Believe it or not, I loved math also but anything in the area of English and reading, I was always into--I could never get enough of reading.  Anything I could put my hands on, and my teachers discovered that early on, and just fed me stuff.  I mean, I--it didn't make any difference just as long as it was something to read I gobbled it up.
Speaker 1: You didn't have a favorite subject matter to read about?
Speaker 2: Just English, yeah just English and stuff, you know.  Anything like that and you know when I got to the maybe third or fourth grade and started doing math and became fascinated with that.
Story_ID: 135865
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, in high school, you were at the boarding school at first, right?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, yes, for three years but it was in the community.  I commuted.  There was a boarding component there and these were kids from South Carolina.  There were a lot of kids from South Carolina who came--who lived in the dormitories and we had them as far away as New York and New Jersey whose parents, by the way, had gone North years ago, especially the East Coast, New Jersey and New York, who knew about Haines [Institute, Augusta, Georgia] and would send their kids back to the boarding--to high school there at Haines.  And, yes, I went to school there and stayed there for three years and the school, as I said, combined in my senior year with the public school because of the fact that the Presbyterian Church no longer supported--it got out of the high school business, the Presbyterian Church did, and so the school--the school merged but Haines was the school.  Those of us who went to Haines still have--have that as a part of our culture and we felt that this was the place to be if you were in high school.  The learning experiences that we had there were unparalleled in the area of white or black.  We had great teachers.  We had a sense of community.  We were--we were taught that we were as good as anybody else.  We were taken to New York to see Broadway plays.  We did things that young folk these days don't even get as experiences.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the plays you saw on Broadway?
Speaker 2: I really can't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really can't.  I can't think of any of those but I do know that if there was something that was important, we were a part of it.
Story_ID: 135866
Speaker 1: We had a great learning experience there. We had one professor [at Haines Institute, Augusta, Georgia], Mr. Tutt, John Tutt, but when I tell people this, they think I'm crazy.
Speaker 2: What's his--how do you spell his name?
Speaker 1: T-U-T-T, John M. Tutt.  Mr. Tutt was a mathematician.  He's a graduate of Lincoln University [Oxford, Pennsylvania] and he came to work at Haines [Institute].  He taught five classes of math each day.  He was the assistant principal, which means he was responsible for all the discipline in the school.  He coached basketball, football, baseball and track by himself and was the janitor, which means he had to fire the boilers in all of the buildings.  That was his daily responsibility and, when football practice was over, he would take his shower and go home and pick up a case of cloth and in that case was a little round tape measure and he would walk the neighborhood selling suits and trousers to people.  That's how he made his living.
Speaker 2: And he made these suits?  No, he would--
Speaker 1: He would send them off--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --he would measure you and the clothier was in Chicago [Illinois].  It was a Leonard Clothiers [ph.] in Chicago and he would take your deposit, three dollars or whatever, and send it off--your measurements to Leonard Clothiers, and two or three weeks your suit would come.  He would keep the deposit.  That was his take.  He had to do that to supplement the meager salary he was making in teaching at Haines Institute.
Speaker 2: John Tutt.
Speaker 1: John M. Tutt, passed on several years ago but he taught me, and my brother.  By the way, [HM] Horace [G. Dawson] ended up at Lincoln University because Mr. Tutt sent him there which was his alma mater, which was, by the way, very, very special because Mr. Tutt was very careful about persons he sent to his alma mater.  You had to be "special" for Mr. Tutt to put his hands on you and send you to Lincoln University.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: He was quite a guy.
Story_ID: 135867
Speaker 1: All right.  Are there any other teachers or administrators that stand out there [Haines Institute, Augusta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, our school was replete with people who understood what education was about.  There was Mrs. Evans.  Ms. Evans is the person who inspired me to--to study English and literature, quite a teacher herself, and she followed us, certainly me, throughout my career.  Still alive, still in Augusta [Georgia] and still calls me occasionally.  She's--she was very, very inspiring.  There was Mrs. Jamie Lowe who also taught English at Haines .  Those--those three people [Evans, Lowe, and Mr. John M. Tutt] were very, very special in my life and it was a community of people who made sure that you did the right thing, made sure that you worked hard, that was a part of the culture there and if you faltered, you would expect and know that before you went to sleep that night, and phones were not as abundant as one would think, Mr. Tutt was at your door to report to your family the transgression, if there was one.  And if he showed up, everybody in the neighborhood knew there was trouble in that household for that evening.  So the entire culture was intellectual.  That you did what you were supposed to do.  You had to be better than and everything was--you were taught making sure that you knew who you were, that you are--were capable of doing anything anybody else could do and that the sky was the limit and you should aspire to be better than and that's how we--that's how we grew up.  We were very, very fortunate in that sense.  And this is not unusual in the South.  This story I'm telling is repeated hundreds of times over in our communities.
Story_ID: 135868
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in high school activities?  I know you played basketball.
Speaker 2: I played basketball right on through high school and, yes, and I was also involved in the writer's guild.  We had a newspaper.  I became editor of the newspaper and so I was all over the place in high school.  I became a sort of a tutor for some of the kids in elementary school.  We had, as I said, Haines [Institute, Augusta, Georgia] was K-12 and during my free period I would go down to the lower grades and work with the kids in the elementary school, which I loved to do.
Story_ID: 135869
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now was there racial tension in the community on a higher level?
Speaker 2: No, you--the community was just us.  They--Augusta [Georgia] was--you lived on one side of town, white folks lived on the other side of town.  You came in contact with them very infrequently.  They came in contact with you very infrequently.  I like to think about the fact that when I went to Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I encountered my first white teacher.  So from one through twelve, all of my--all of my teachers were black.  Paine College [Augusta, Georgia], by the way, which was just six blocks from my high school, was the only place in Augusta where white folks and black folks came together. The faculty at Paine was, and it's a racial faculty, always has been because the church influence was there and there were a number of missionaries who devoted their life to education who came to work at Paine and several of them lived on campus, many of them lived in the community but many of them were white Methodist who came and brought a different kind of experience to Paine who brought different values and who brought their own sense of community and their own ministry to Paine College.  So when I would go to basketball games, for instance at Paine, you would see whites in the stands looking there at the game.  This was about the extent of it, where they worked at the college and the college was there.  During the civil rights days, when people from the North, whites from the North who would come to the South to work in the Civil Rights Movement, Paine was the only place where they could go.  They would go to the college and that's where that dialogue took place on the campus at Paine College because it was the only place that they were welcomed.  And so Paine became the first, although it's not unusual in the South as you know, for the colleges to have been the place where much of the Civil Rights Movement took place and Augusta was no exception.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, similar to the college in Mississippi, north of Jackson, Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] or is it--
Speaker 2: That's Tougaloo, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And you're right, that pattern exists--it existed there.  So, yeah it's not unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 135870
Speaker 1: Did you know adults involved in the Civil Rights Movement at all or those trying to change--
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon.
Speaker 1: Did you know of any adults involved in the Civil--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, of course--
Speaker 1: Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: --of course, no question about it.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --'cause I know there was no voting right in there in Augusta [Georgia] at that time in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, there's no question about that.  But no, I remember going to and, of course as an adult I'm describing now, but I remember going to the '60s [1960s] and to many activities and many discussions and things like that.  You see I was working at Paine [College, Augusta, Georgia], by the way, in '67 [1967] or eight [1968], I believe it was, don't quote me on that date when during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, when Augusta went up in flames, the riot took place--riots took place in Augusta.
Story_ID: 135871
Speaker 1: Well let's not get too far ahead (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and I was there--
Speaker 1: --but I just want to go back to high school [Haines Institute, Augusta, Georgia].  Now when you were on the verge of graduation, did you--did you know what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Well I knew I was going to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's no question about that, you know, there was never a question in my house about that.  You were going to college.  The question was where and I ended up going to Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Morris Brown is an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school.  I grew up in an A.M.E. church and I remember doing a poem in Sunday School and I remember the minister telling me that they're going to give me a scholarship to Morris Brown and they did.  The church gave me a hundred dollars a year for each of four years while I was in Morris Brown, my home church did.  So I had a scholarship, a hundred dollars, which by the way paid about, close to an eighth--actually it was about $800 a year, when I went to Morris Brown.  That's room, board, tuition, books and everything.  It never got to be a thousand dollars a year, room, board and tuition during my four years at Morris Brown.  So, yeah, I knew I was going to college.  The question was where.  I thought about Paine [College, Augusta, Georgia].  I just wanted to get away from home, I guess, and Morris Brown was an option and the pastor of the church, who himself had graduated Morris Brown, had a pattern of sending those of us who were going away to college from our church there.  And, of course, my father [Horace Dawson] supported that one hundred percent, being an A.M.E. himself, so I ended up at Morris Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you graduate with honors or anything when you graduated from--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't graduate with honors at all.
Speaker 1: Were you a pretty good--
Speaker 2: I graduated without any difficulty--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I didn't graduate with honors.  I had found Atlanta and I worked.  I had fun.  I was all over Atlanta [Georgia].  I took a job at Lockheed [Corporation, later Lockheed Martin].  I worked the graveyard shift.  I worked from twelve at night until six in the--6:30 a.m.  You worked six, you got paid for eight, took a half hour off for lunch and so it was--I made money while I was--while I was in school and I didn't focus as much as I should have on my studies.  I never failed.
Speaker 1: So, did you work most of the time that you--
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Did you work most of your time at school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I worked most of the time I was in school.  Yeah, I did.
Story_ID: 135872
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't find the work that difficult, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, I didn't find it difficult at all.  My classroom work probably dropped off a bit because I was not as focused as I should have been.  I was into--into cars.  I was into athletics.  I was into everything other than what I should have been into.  Of course I never failed anything.  I was on time graduating with the B's and C's and without any difficulty.  More B's than C's but I didn't--I made the honor roll my first semester, let's put it that way and after that I did not but I had a great time.  I had great teachers.  In fact there is a program tomorrow night, actually Saturday night, honoring Dr. [W.F.] Payne, who was a long-time professor at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I happen to be going there to say "hello."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who are some other teachers at Morris Brown?  There's a Dr. Payne, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. W.F. Payne, who was my good buddy.  He taught biology, interestingly enough and he and I became very good friends.  He had one of the only cars on campus. He had been to [U.S.] Military.  He was paying--he's a Morris Brown alum and he had gone to military, done a master's, came back, and he had a new Oldsmobile and at that time he was living in the boys dormitory because he was unmarried and he had a room in the dorm and I became his buddy because I would take his car off and wash it for him.  He loved his car to be shiny and washed and I kept it that way for him.  And in return, he would put a little money in my pocket and took me away whenever the team went away, we were there.  No matter where they went, Dr. Payne and I, as a student, freshman, sophomore student, would go away and follow the football, basketball team everywhere they went.  And so he and I became very close at an early age--at an early stage of my life at Morris Brown.  So, he was--he was just a great guy and an excellent biology teacher by the way, almost convinced me to go to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] pre-med but I stuck to my gun--guns on that one.  Dr. [Thelma] Curl, who taught me English there and inspired me is, I think she is now in Norfolk--at Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], if she has not retired, was also very inspirational to me at Morris Brown.  Morris Brown at the time of my matriculation was a very small as schools go, five, six hundred students' institution and so it was a family, which I enjoyed, which I loved because everybody knew everybody, everybody looked out for everybody else.  We had great teachers.  We had a very, very healthy academic atmosphere there and we had great athletic team, football, basketball, track.  We were sort of the toast of Atlanta [Georgia], in a lot of different ways.  So I spent four good years at Morris Brown and the school prepared me to go anywhere else I wanted to.  I spent summers there on campus even though school--Morris Brown had no summer school but I spent all of my time there.  When I left home, I would go home maybe for Christmas and maybe once or twice during the year, but I spent all of my time on campus.  I worked in the library, I--'cause it afforded me the opportunities to read.  Still I read.  I read everything I could put my hands on, much of it having nothing to do with my class work, you see, but I just was an avid reader.  I still am today, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 135873
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after graduation from Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I went to Hamilton, Georgia, a little town near Columbus [Georgia] and taught English for two years.  I took over the senior class and did a little newspaper for the school and taught English there for two years.  I lived in Columbus so I commuted up to Harris County [Georgia].  School was relatively new at that time.  The principal was a Morris Brown graduate and brought me on to teach there.  I taught there for two years prior to going into the [U.S.] Military.  I was drafted into the [U.S.] Army in 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, '56 [1956].  Now, where did they station you?
Speaker 2: They sent me to Fort Ord, California.
Speaker 1: That's O-R-D?
Speaker 2: O-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I spent my time--then I came back to Fort Hood, Texas and I was discharged from there.  And actually came back to Harris County, the same school, because I came out during the--I think during February or so and the school cycle was already in the swing and so when I did come out at a time where the principal who liked my work arranged for me to come back during the year and gave me a job.  And so I came back there and worked for him for another year and a half, I believe, then I moved to Columbus, Georgia, which was where I was living in the first place.  This was like a thirty miles commute but I was living in Columbus and so I took a job at Carver High School in Columbus, Georgia itself, after that, again teaching English and by that time I was working on a counseling degree so I did some counseling at Carver High in Columbus.
Speaker 1: So this is now around 1960 or--
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960], '61 [1961], yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Stayed there--stayed there a couple of years and ended up after those two years coming home to Augusta [Georgia].
Story_ID: 135874
Speaker 1: I came to Augusta [Georgia] to--again teaching English and I worked at A.R. Johnson High School and became a full-time counselor after a couple of years of English and reading there in Augusta and I started counseling at A. R. Johnson, which was, by the way, a new high school--a new junior high school at the time.  So I was in a junior high school when I was in Augusta as a counselor.  Completed a master's [degree] during that time and Paine College [Augusta, Georgia] beckoned.
Speaker 2: Now, where did you finish your master's?
Speaker 1: Teachers College, Columbia University [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, in New York--
Speaker 1: So I was going summers to Columbia University from time to time.  I was part of that great migration from the South to go to the North, especially the East Coast to teach.  I'm not sure you are aware of the fact that during those segregated days, most of us who did our graduate work did so at Northern universities because our graduate schools would not admit us to take courses over there.  You see, I couldn't go to University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] but Georgia decided that it would send me to Columbia and so--
Speaker 2: So, they actually paid your tuition?
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.  In order to keep me out of the University of Georgia, they said you're a bright young person as well as bright as you can be, being black, you're a bright young person so maybe we ought to send you to school but you can't come here.  We'll give you the money to go to New York.
Speaker 2: Did they ever discuss the--did you ever hear anyone discuss the seemingly illogic in this--
Speaker 1: No, you didn't.  You didn't--well we knew how stupid it was but we took advantage of it.  We said these people are crazy but they're going to pay for me to go to NYU [New York University, New York City] or Columbia which is obviously ranked higher than the University of Georgia in the first place, this is ridiculous.  And that's where we went to school.  Nobody--my brother [HM] Horace [Dawson, Jr.] went to--but of course I don't think this program was in place when Horace went there.  Horace went to Columbia also.  My sister, Josephine, went to NYU.  I went to--I went to Columbia.  And if you look at persons somewhere near my age, and around my age, many of the teachers and principals, you'll find that there--they went to Paine College.  They went to Morris Brown.  They went to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They went to schools like that, undergraduate, but they got their master's from Columbia, NYU, Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because of those programs.  This is not only true in Georgia, it was true in Mississippi.  It was true in Alabama.  Those states paid us to go away, African Americans, to go away to other schools.  Now Georgia had a very interesting thing that it did later on.  So many of us were going away, getting our degrees and coming back to teaching the high schools.  When the schools began to be integrated, we were much well--much more prepared, educationally, than whites.  So the positions that came along that required master's degrees and things like that, we competed very, very well because we already had our degrees and so we were much more educated than the whites in the system because of that program.  Georgia decided there were so many of us were going away, to put a cap on the program by saying--by trying to say, you first must be eligible to go to University of Georgia.  So what happens, they instituted a program whereby, and this was true when I came along, you had to apply to University of Georgia, be admitted, receive your admission, and they said, okay, you're admitted, but you can't come here, you've got to go somewhere else.  So you had to qualify academically, graduate record exam [Graduate Record Examination, GRE] schools, etc., etc.
Speaker 2: That wasn't difficult though was it to--
Speaker 1: Of course, not.
Speaker 2: But would they slide another kind of--
Speaker 1: Well, it was, you know--
Speaker 2: --trick to keep you out?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the whole idea was to weed out those who they thought were not going to.  See, just the fact that you graduated from an accredited college was sufficient for the most part to do that but this was an additional hurdle that came along later.  Now, if you went to Columbia or NYU, all you had to do, of course, was meet their admissions requirement and that was have your GPA and do the graduate record exam and do well on it, sure, but that's why I went away to school--
Story_ID: 135875
Speaker 1: By that time that I was back in Augusta [Georgia], I was in the public schools, Paine College [Augusta, Georgia] beckoned and asked me to come to work there, which I did.  I think I probably went to Paine about 1966, '65 [1965] or '66 [1966] and I went there as a counselor but I also took the responsibility of directing the Upward Bound Program, which had just started at Paine.  It was the first year of the Upward Bound Program so I became the first Upward Bound Director that Paine hired on the campus.  And so I stayed there for three very, very good years, I think three or four years, and at my last year I became dean, my last year of the college--at the college, and took a position subsequent to that here in Washington, D.C. and I became regional director for Upward Bound, for the [U.S.] Department of Education.  So I moved from the college experience to the government experience over Upward Bound for the ten Southeastern states--
Speaker 2: About what year--
Speaker 1: --here in Washington.
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: I'm at '69 [1969] now, somewhere there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Upward Bound is important for black students all over the country.
Speaker 1: Without a doubt.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was one of the first national efforts aimed at moving persons through high school to college and it's been very, very effective, continues until today doing yeoman work in helping young disadvantaged folk know that there is a better way to do this and giving them the skills and the wherewithal to go to college.  And so I took over Upward Bound for the Southeast, here in Washington [D.C.], stayed with the Department three years, I suspect, and at the time I started on my doctorate at George Washington [University, Washington, D.C.], here, going to school at night and on Saturdays.  So I was in school and working for the Department for a while.
Story_ID: 135876
Speaker 1: And I left the [U.S.] Department [of Education] probably about '71 [1971], '72 [1972] to take a job with the [Robert R.] Moton [Memorial] Institute, which was just beginning to work with historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs] in helping them improve management systems and helping them learn how to get more grants and contracts from the federal government and having had both the college level experience and the government experience, it seemed to be a natural in terms of my progression to put those two experiences together at the Moton Institute which is what I decided to do.  So I went to the Moton Institute, stayed there doing what we call, "federal relations,", teaching people on the campuses how to do grantsmanship things, how to wite proposals, also helping them understand how to negotiate the federal bureaucracy here in Washington [D.C.], how to make that happen and that was a very, very good experience for us.  So I did a lot of traveling to the campuses and we did generic workshops in different parts of the country and we also did one-on-one kind of on-campus technical assistance things.  And so I worked there for several--several years and probably in--let me--let me stay there a minute.  The Moton Institute was a brainchild of Dr. F.D.. Patterson [Dr. Frederick Douglass Patterson].  Dr. Patterson was the second president of Tuskegee University [then, Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] following--well, actually the third, he followed R.R. Moton, after Washington, R.R. Moton and then Dr. Patterson took over as president of Tuskegee University.
Speaker 2: Well, and Robert Russa Moton.
Speaker 1: He started in 1944, the United Negro College Fund, that was his--
Speaker 2: It's Dr. Patterson?
Speaker 1: Dr. Patterson did--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --that was his baby but he also, in later years, founded the Moton Institute which had as its mission what I just described, helping HBCUs learn how to do federal relations, helping HBCUs do management programs, financial management, financial aid management, things like that.  And so I actually went to work for the Moton Institute when Dr. Patterson was--is chair.  Down in Gloucester, Virginia, right on the York River, was the home of Dr. Moton who was the president of Tuskegee University.  You see, Mr. Moton went to Tuskegee after having been at Hampton [Institute, later Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  He was the Colonel of Cadets at Hampton when they were doing--when they had the Military program there.  And so he went to Tuskegee from there but he had a home right on the York River in Gloucester County, Virginia which he--which he lived in until his death.  Dr. Patterson married into the family.  Dr. Patterson married Moton's daughter and so she inherited the home and Dr. Patterson then began--developed that property into a conference center which it is today. Built the motel units, he built a conference facility there, meeting rooms and things like that.
Speaker 2: What's it called today, it's a conference center?
Speaker 1: It's called the, "Moton Conference Center"--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Gloucester, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is where we took our training activities.  We would bring groups of persons from various colleges down to the Moton Conference Center and that's where we did all of our training activities.  A beautiful place, right on the York River.  I'm not sure in what repair it is these days because it is passed from the Moten Institute to the United Negro College Fund.  The College Fund owned it at a time and Chris Edley [Christopher Edley] was there.  And I think now it's in private hands.  I know the College Fund divested itself of it so I know the conference center is in private hands now and I'm not sure what it's mission is and what's going on there but it was a very vibrant place and a very, very excellent place where the kinds of--kinds of things we were doing during that time.
Story_ID: 135877
Speaker 1: I left the [Robert R. Moton Memorial] Institute in '79 [1979] or so, maybe '80 [1980], probably '78 [1978], '79 [1979] and joined the United Negro College Fund.  I opened the Washington [D.C.] office for federal relations and for the College Fund.  The College Fund has regional offices--fundraising.  An office in Chicago [Illinois].  An office in Atlanta [Georgia].  Office--offices Dallas [Texas], office around the country with the fundraising offices.  The College Fund started getting into federal advocacy stuff--policy stuff and needed an office here in Washington [D.C.], which I was into at that time.  So I made a shift into policy and left fundraising and came on the policy side.  And so I started the first federal relations policy work here in Washington for the United Negro College Fund.  And so I stayed there and we did a lot of management activities with the schools during those years.  That was the height of our interaction with the UNCF schools of which, at that time, there were forty-one.  We've since lost, two I think, there are thirty-nine but we would--we did a lot of management activities with those schools.  A lot of financial aid management, improvement programs, work with governing boards and all of that.  That was the height of the work that the College Fund did during those days.  And so I stayed with the College Fund until '85 [1985], when I was called to come to Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina].
Story_ID: 135878
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did that take place?  How were you called to become the president of Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Ah, that's interesting.  Voorhees is sixty miles from Augusta, Georgia, where I grew up.  I played ball against them when I was in high school because Voorhees had a high school also.  Voorhees was one of the schools that came through that--that transgression from primary school to high school to junior college and finally a four-year institution.  And so when it was a high school, I was in high school.  So I knew the school and I knew about Voorhees and it was also one of the schools in the United Negro College Fund family while I was with the College Fund and while I was with the [Robert R.] Moton [Memorial] Institute and so I've been on campus on several occasions.  I knew some of the people there but more importantly the school had been on hard times, it was about to close, it's an episcopal church related school, as you know, and it was about to close and the person who had been responsible for moving Voorhees from a junior high--junior college to a four-year degree granting fully accredited institution, Dr. John Foster Potts, who was in retirement at the time, was asked to come back to see what he could do about "righting the ship."  The school was financially insolvent and had gone through some bad times.  He had retired to North Carolina and was up in years, probably about seventy-five when he decided--when he was asked to return, but he was in fairly good health.  He and I had had a relationship throughout the years because when I left the federal government to join the Moton Institute, Dr. [F.D.] Patterson [Dr. Frederick Douglass Patterson], who was the chair of the Moton Institute, had hired him as his executive director to take over the Moton Institute.  So when I actually left the college--the federal government, I came to the Moton Institute to work for him.  He then retired for good and went to--well he retired and went to Flat Rock [North Carolina], which is where his home was.  So when he was asked to come back to Voorhees, where he had been early on, prior to coming to Washington [D.C.], he called me and said, "I've been asked to do this, I think I might, I want you to succeed me if I do."  The rest is history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did and so I went along after he stayed two years and he passed the reins on to me.  I went in August, 1985.
Story_ID: 135879
Speaker 1: Okay, so Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina] was established when?  Give us--
Speaker 2: Eighteen ninety-seven [1897].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It started in 1897--
Speaker 1: And it sort of started as a junior college and high--
Speaker 2: No, it started as a school to teach twelve little black children to read and write on the back of a white man's grocery store.  That's how it started.  Elizabeth Evelyn Wright, a female who had gone to school at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], who had a dream of going somewhere and starting a school similar to Tuskegee, found her way somehow to Denmark, South Carolina.  The record is not clear on how that happened but she ended up in Denmark and decided that's what she wanted to do.  She went there armed with a normal [teaching] degree from Tuskegee and started Voorhees.  Found a sympathetic guy who owned a grocery store who gave her some benches and she would bring kids there and she started teaching them to read and write on the steps of this store and later on, and would go around from churches, begging money to start a school.  Somebody told her about a blind philanthropist in New Jersey, in Clinton, New Jersey, whose name was [Ralph] Voorhees.  She took a train there, sight unseen, no letter of invitation, no nothing, and knocked on this man's door and left with a promise of $5,000 to start a school if she could get Booker [T.] Washington to vouch for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know he was in charge of all of us during those--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --those days.
Speaker 1: Now this is what--what year is this now?  This is nineteen--
Speaker 2: Well, she started school in 1897, yeah--
Speaker 1: Eighteen ninety-seven [1897], okay.
Speaker 2: --but I'm fast-forwarding now probably about three years--about the turn of the century--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because she'd been fiddling around from here to there.  So when she returned to Denmark, she had a promise to purchase the land for this $5,000 and the guy who owned the land obviously knew there was nowhere in the world this little black woman was going to come up with $5,000 but when she came back and told him that she had it coming, he went up on the price.  He said, "No, no, I told you seven."  Remember we were talk--we were corresponding by mail during these days so she wrote her benefactor and he sent a letter which is in the archives now.  So I'm sending you this $5,000 check, go and give it to this gentleman and remind him of his promise which, under the law, is a contract.  If he refuses, I will have my lawyers look into this situation.  Listen, listen man, this is what I'm talking--telling you.  I'm talking about--I'm talking about the turn of the century but the frail twenty-six year old, twenty-seven year old black woman going to this white landowner in Denmark, South Carolina with the letter from a Yankee in Clinton, New Jersey, with a $5,000 check, man, that's dangerous business I'm talking about.  You know, that's serious business but it worked.  The threat of the law here, right in the back office.  So the $5,000 purchased 350 acres of land on which the college presently sits.  That's the story Voorhees took beginning with the college.  And so she died at thirty-two by the way.  She was frail and she--there was actually no cure for pneumonia.  She died at thirty-two.  So--but the dream had taken hold and so it grew from that little August beginning on 350 acres of land from twelve students sitting on milk crates to the four-year institution, fully accredited, a thousand students--
Speaker 1: What was her name again?
Speaker 2: --what it is today.
Speaker 1: What was her name again?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Evelyn Wright. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story.
Speaker 2: It is a story.
Story_ID: 135880
Speaker 1: So, how did it [Voorhees College, Denmark, South Carolina] become an Episcopal school?
Speaker 2: Good question, good question--
Speaker 1: Voorhees, okay.
Speaker 2: --years later in the '30s [1930s] to 1932 to be exact--the Negro fundraising that was going on was happening through the churches, throughout the state of South Carolina and they just couldn't raise enough money to keep the school going and the president at the time, I can't think of who was president at that time, but actually he was a principal because see the school was not at that time a college so we're talking about a high school, a normal [teaching] school, in the '30s [1930s] and so he went to--around the churches getting--raising money to keep the school open and somehow somebody told him he should try to get a national church to sponsor the school and that had--you see most of the schools in the South were founded by church denominations.  Voorhees was different.  It was founded privately and came into community with the church only later.  So the--he was introduced to somebody within the Episcopal Church and petitioned the church to take over the school.  The church was happy to do so because the school had assets, 350 acres of land, right?  So, it was very clear that this was an investment worth, you know, worth looking into and so both the diocese of South Carolina--South Carolina is divided into two Episcopal dioceses, there's the diocese of South Carolina and the--what--the upper diocese and the lower diocese.  So it's spread geographically which means that there are two bishops and two sets of clergy, etc., etc.  And so they both agreed to support the school--
Speaker 1: Now when was this?
Speaker 2: --at the national church.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: When was this?  What year was this?
Speaker 2: Thirty-two [1932], 1932 if I'm not mistaken.
Story_ID: 137104
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's an interesting history, you know, for Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --but the school's kind of fallen on hard times before you got involved?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, it was--it was about three million dollars in debt, accumulative deficit, enrollment had plummeted but Dr. [John Foster] Potts came in in 1983 and he stayed two years and he sort of righted the ship which was what he was asked to do in the first place.  He came in and he sort of held things together, restored some goodwill in the community and certainly within the church.  The church had--Episcopal Church had sort of given up on the school but Dr. Potts, being the person that he was and the people who knew him from his first incarnation at the school, who was sort of considered the Godfather at Voorhees, came back and sort of did a maintenance job that was very, very good.  And so he paved the way for me to come in in '85 [1985].  I inherited this deficit.  I inherited enrollment, which was--the faculty had been downsized, asked to take a ten percent cut in salary the year before, buildings in disrepair and, you know, so I took on a challenge.  My promise to Dr. Potts was I would come if he asked me to, and he did, after having stayed there two years.  So I felt that I had the kind of background and experience to do what needed to be done.  Obviously, I'd never done it before, I never tested it in the real world but I had some ideas about how to go about resuscitating this school.  I had a lot of good feelings about the school because of my prior relationships with many of the people who worked there and certainly my respect for John Potts.  And so I agreed to go.  The chairman of the board, whose name was Jerry Screen, is a graduate of the school, promised me his support and that he would be there with me and stayed true to his word all of my--all of my time there.  So, when I went in, we set about the business of trying to restore what had been once been a proud academically great institution which had done excellent work with the--in that community which was a pulse of the community.  Voorhees is a very small town, less than 4,000 people.  It's a farming community.  Everything sort of revolved around Voorhees College.  All of the culture.  All of the economic driven initiatives came out of--came out of that college.  So it was a very vital part of the community and its demise would have been catastrophic for that community.  So we went in and rolled up our sleeves and set to work.
Story_ID: 137105
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the first task on the agenda?
Speaker 2: Well, the first task was, obviously, to try to put the school [Vorhees College, Denmark, South Carolina] on sound financial footing.  The deficit was there.  We had vendors calling on a day-to-day basis and so I had to restructure the fiscal operation entirely.  We didn't run from folks, we returned telephone calls and we made sure people understood that we were--we were going to pay them what we owed them.  They just had to give us some time.  And so we went about vendor to vendor to vendor, laying out payment plans, developing options and people were very happy to work with us.  They understood, they knew that they were going to take some loss but they knew that, and felt that they were going to recover some of the money that was owed to them.  So they were only happy to work with us.  We didn't have a single one to refuse to do that.  Now, looming over that all, that current debt, was the deficit that we were dealing with and much of what we owed had to do with major liabilities to the federal government, funds that had been somehow misapplied, nobody had accused anybody of stealing any money or anything like that, it was a case of inadequate revenue and over ambitious expenditures.  And so the bottom line was deficit and so you couldn't pay your current operations because you were always in a deficit posture.  So we owed the federal government, oh, a million dollars.  We had the obligations that we had to do.  So we had to negotiate those debts.  And people were willing to work with us, including the government, and so we laid our payment plans and started--same time we were trying to restore our faculty, our credentials, people who had the right credentials to teach in the school who saw an association requires a certain number of Ph.D.s and student enrollment was a problem.  So we had to tackle everything at once but the fiscal was overriding, the fiscal was the lynchpin and we had to get a handle on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so, how was that done?  I mean, you had to raise--
Speaker 2: Well, we went into an aggressive fundraising--fundraising program and it was actually--actually door-to-door.  We knocked on the church's doors.  We knocked on foundations doors and we were--it was not an easy sell because they'd heard this before but this time we were sure about it and we did find some few people willing to make investments.  My strength at the time was that I had been more recently in the private sector, working for the United Negro College Fund, I knew the foundation world.  I knew the folk who gave money in the foundation world because I had recent interactions with them as a member of the United Negro College Fund staff.  So I knew the Mellon Foundation.  I knew the Ford Foundation.  I knew the people at Kellogg [Foundation].  I knew the major foundations who supported higher education.  And on the other hand, my experience within the [U.S.] Department of Education had given me the background to know how to negotiate debt, to know how to come to the table and negotiate with the people within the department and I knew what could be done and what couldn't be done.  So I had a lot of support on both sides of the aisle and those things began to take hold after people understood that we were serious and we were about business.  We recruited more business people and more people who had financial acumen and financial wherewithal on our board of trustees.  And so it was an overhaul from top to bottom.  It wasn't easy.  It didn't happen overnight but within three years we had completely turned the deficit around.  Enrollment had begun to creep up and we were--we were on our way.
Story_ID: 137106
Speaker 1: Okay, now the physical structure of the place [Voorhees College, Denmark, South Carolina] was kind of deteriorating too, if I understand that--
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, yes, yes, yes.  We inherited a really, really deteriorated physical plan.  There were three boarded up buildings on campus which we needed.  The dormitories had--were in need of a total facelift so we knew immediately that a physical recovery plan was necessary and we prioritized what we wanted to do.  The first thing we wanted to do was to do something about the place where our students lived, the dormitories.  And so our first $750,000 loan, which we got, went into those dormitories, to make it livable for our students.  We secondly moved to the academic buildings where the students had to--had their classes in and spent most of their time.  And so we raised funds, both from within the church and outside of the church, to rehab our academic buildings.  And the third phase, of course, was new construction, which we were able to do.  I think we put up about $10 million in my tenure there, of debt-free construction, which is unheard of.  We were fortunate enough to be able to build and pay off debt at the same time.  So, we were very happy to that--that we were able to do that.  We built a healthy human resources center, complete with swimming pool.  We added an Olympic-size track to the physical inventory of the college.  We built a humanities center and we built a conference center on the campus, which is the hub of the activity in the--in that part of the state right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so enrollment increased too, from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Enrollment increased while we were there.  When I left I think it was--the school was right at about 850 students.  When I went to Voorhees back in '85 [1985], there were less than 300 students on campus.  So we--we had--we went to close to a thousand at one point and dropped down because of tightened restrictions on financial aid about 1999 but I understand that it's back up to about a thousand now.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during those years, from '85 [1985] through '98 [1998], we went from less than 300 students to close to a thousand.
Story_ID: 137107
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you were at Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina] for a--
Speaker 2: I was at Voorhees for sixteen years.  I went in '85 [1985] and left in 2000--June 2001.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--it was a good run.  I decided to retire.  My wife [Laura Dawson] had moved to Virginia where we built our retirement home in Richmond, and she had moved there and was starting a business there and it was demanding a lot of her time but more importantly she suggested that it needed me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --up on this end of the country.  So I retired in June 2001 and came here.  Almost immediately, before I could unpack my bags, I was invited to come here in Washington [D.C.] to work for the White House Initiative which I am presently doing and happily so.
Speaker 1: It was recently announced that, I think, President [George W.] Bush approved a million dollars for [Federal] Pell Grants in the United States.
Speaker 2: Well, I think he approved an increase--
Speaker 1: Increase of a million dollars, right.
Speaker 2: --across the board in Pell Grant dollars for all students.  And I think it averages out to be about $150 a year per student which means that there is a maximum amount that any student can get for Pell and I think he increased the maximum.  I think it's right at about $4,000 a year, now, which pays for a person who goes to Voorhees, let us say, what room, board and tuition is at about $12,000, twelve maybe thirteen, which by the way is the best bargain in town.  Pell pays about--a student who gets a total Pell, can pick up about a third of his total cost--his or her total cost at Voorhees.  So, Pell is a very important component when you're trying to put together a financial aid package for low income students because it is the grant that is used to base a lot of other aid on.  In other words, if you're a Pell Grant eligible, a lot of other aid comes to you automatically.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So if you don't get that, you'd probably won't get anything else.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  If you don't qualify for Pell because of income, and as you know it's income driven, that means you don't qualify for these other forms of aid either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Pell is the lynchpin.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you influence those kinds of decisions?
Speaker 2: Have no influence--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on those whatsoever.  I have recommendation input into what I think ought to happen with Pell but [U.S.] Congress makes the decision about what it's going to do given other funding priorities, year, after year, after year and the President "requests" from his lofty perch, increases in various programs, including Pell.  But in the final analysis, Congress makes the call.
Story_ID: 137108
Speaker 1: Okay, so what's a--how would you define your job now with the [U.S.] Department of Education?
Speaker 2: My job now is one of doing what I did at Voorhees [College, Denmark, South Carolina] for 105 schools.  The 105 HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] that participate in our program.  And our job, in the White House Initiative, is to encourage thirty-one agencies--that thirty-one agencies that relate to us, [U.S.] Department of Agriculture, [U.S.] Department of Treasury, Department of Education, the thirty-one different agencies that are part of our program, our job is to encourage these agencies to provide more access, more dollars, more support, more grants, more contracts, to HBCUs, that's our job.  So, the assumption is that the HBCUs provide an excellent opportunity for the students that they serve within the country.  So national resource is to the country's advantage and to its benefit to support these institutions and our job is to see to it that the Department of Defense, for instance, looks into its programs and divide those dollars up and to make sure that the HBCUs get their fair share.  That's our role, and we take it very seriously.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any stories or victories in this regard to, you know--
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, I've been here a year and a half, I've seen--I've seen some instances in which agencies have begun to understand a bit more about what it is that we're about.  Ours is a constant selling job.  I'm very pleased that our new chair, chair of our board--the White House Initiative is a presidentially appointed--has a presidentially appointed board.  President [George W.] Bush appointed twenty-one members to a board, to oversee the work that we do.  And [HM] Dr. Louis Sullivan, who was president emeritus of Morehouse School of Medicine, was appointed as our chair, and he's taken this very seriously so much so that he has asked each cabinet head, Secretary [Donald] Rumsfeld, Secretary [sic, Attorney General John] Ashcroft, to meet with him, individually, to talk to him about what they are doing for HBCUs.  He's made seventeen of those visits already and I'm encouraged by the reception that he's gotten, I'm encouraged by the interest that has been shown by the other secretaries and the agency heads and I'm sure that it cannot help but benefit in the long run because these guys control the purse strings.  What happens to the dollars that get into the pipeline to help these schools?  And I'm responsible as liaison to the board for organizing those visits and making sure that they happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 137109
Speaker 1: Sir, what are--what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community to you today in general?
Speaker 2: I would hope that we would see this community, the black community, again as just a microcosm of a larger community.  The day is not going to come when it is going to be the same kind of community I grew up in and probably shouldn't but I would like to see a community that is drug-free, where our youngsters are not killing each other every day, where there is respect for the elderly, respect for each other and I think that we have to work together through all of our organizations, through all of our agencies to bring about a change in attitude in our young people and the people who mentor them and restore faith in our systems that we have in our communities.  I think there is a lack of trust, a lack of faith in many, many of our systems even extending as far as the church, and I don't have to recount to you what's--what's been going on in the churches recently.  So I think we've got a lot of work to do in our communities but I think that we have the resources there and the will to do it.  I talked to you earlier about our dear friend, Silas Purnell, whose funeral I just--just the other day--
Speaker 1: Yes, Silas Purnell of Chicago [Illinois], right?
Speaker 2: We need more Silas Purnells in Chicago, who gave of himself without asking for anything in return.  He understood how important it is to empower young people and that's what he dedicated his life to doing.  And we need more--we need more of that.  We need to forget about a lot of the things that we have--what--we need to focus more on helping ourselves.  We need to focus more on doing the things that are important for our young people because they're our future and we're not getting through to them in a lot of different instances.  My daughter, who's teaching science and just walked away because--from teaching because she felt that it was a waste of her time.  She wasn't getting through to the--I'm talking teaching in seventh, eighth and ninth grade, a dedicated person.  There's something wrong with that picture and we have to reverse that for now.
Story_ID: 137110
Speaker 1: Sir, at this juncture, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know I, you know, I leave that for other people.  I just hope that I touched somebody somewhere.  I hope that I made a difference in somebody's life.  I hope that I instilled in some people that it's important to do well.  That life is what you make it and I hope that I've done some of that.  I'd like to think that some of the schools that I have been related to in a lot of different ways are better off that I passed this way.
Story_ID: 137111
Speaker 1: Okay, is there anything that you would do differently, you think?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I guess if I had more time to think about, I probably could come up with something but it's not going to make that much difference.  No, I think I've done it the only way I know how.
Story_ID: 137112
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question is basically, it's similar to legacy but sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just as a person who traveled this way.  A person who tried to do the right thing and one who has a lot of hope and one who has a lot of--who believes that the community is important and that young people need to be nurtured.  That my belief in the goodness of man is still--is still there.
