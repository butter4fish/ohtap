Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions I am compelled to ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, ma'am, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I'm--I've flunked already (laughter).  I have lots of food--favorite foods but you need one favorite food, is that it?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

Speaker 1: Describe--
Speaker 2: Not any requesting sound but usually as a--as a, a response.
Speaker 1: Response to the world's--
Speaker 2: To, to whatever is going on, Lord have mercy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I think--that's the only--that's the only thing I can really think of because--that I use often.
Story_ID: 283432
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Claude Woodson] side.  Now, we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Celia, C-E-L-I-A, Trotter--I'm sorry, you want me to give her your--the middle name?
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you would.
Speaker 2: Agatha, A-G-A-T-H-A, Trotter Woodson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: O'two, twenty-six, fifteen [February 26th, 1915]. Place of birth, Liberty, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's near Pulaski [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes, right outside, twelve miles [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace those?
Speaker 2: Well, we know quite a bit about--on my mother's side.  First, I knew a lot about my mother's side because she was my own private historian.  She talked about her family and was constantly, you know, giving me information and telling me the stories that her father [Harry Trotter] told her, and, and her mother [Celia Westmoreland Trotter], and she was the youngest of ten children, so she had lots to relate.  And then we began having family reunions and my cousin, one of my cousins, Pamela Lowe [ph.], was, was just an excellent researcher--began to research all of these, you know, our names.  And I developed the first family tree and then we began to look up our, our family members.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what do you know about them?  How far back can you trace 'em?
Speaker 2: We can go back to the early 1800s.  She wants to go to, I guess it's Virginia.  There's some other places that she wants to go to research where she says, you know, there are archives and things.  But we do have them where some of them--we thought they were all from Tennessee, but they were in Alabama and also in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So more than likely started in Virginia and moved, moved--.
Speaker 2: Right and moved down, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, we found, you know the lineage when--found out a lot about the material that she got from the Civil War records and we didn't know that, you know, we had grandparents who served, great-grandparents who served in the Civil War, and that was very exciting.  We found the information, the, the land--the information on the land sales.  My grandfather at one time he and his--from--with his father and all, they had over one thousand acres in that area and, and we found the bills of sale and the conditions for those sales, which were kinda--it was really kind of interesting.  One person that he purchased from, my grandfather, great-grandfather purchased from and grandfather, said that if their cows got over the fence or got beyond this designated area, this fenced area that he would forfeit the sale, that he would forfeit the sale of the land and all of the animals that got across that wandered into--on--back onto his land would also become theirs.  But if any of their cows or, you know, whatever went on their land, the sale would be null and void.  I mean, just strange conditions like that, which I'm sure he assumed that he would--that money--I mean, not money, but that, that the animals would come on and he could get the land back.  I mean, he was just so sure that this person could not, you know, keep up his payments, which he did, and told the amount of money, two thousand dollars that he had to pay, either 2000, 1800, these large amounts prior to 1900 and we were saying, gee, where'd he get all that money?  But he worked for it, you know?  I mean, they worked and just worked very hard and made, you know, of course, and the land is still in our--in our family today.
Story_ID: 283433
Speaker 1: You had a [maternal] great-grandfather that served in the 110th colored Tennessee infantry [110th Regiment Colored Infantry], I believe, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Joseph Westmoreland was one and a great-great-grandfather--it would've been a great-great grandfather, Bland Brown.  There were two of them, two, and they served in--
Speaker 1: What's the second one's name, I'm sorry, again?
Speaker 2: Bland, B-L-A-N-D, Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were from two sides of--on my [maternal] grandmother [Celia Westmoreland Trotter]--these are my grandmother's people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I was trying to remember that Pulaski, Tennessee, is the home of Nathan Bedford Forrest, that's who it is.
Speaker 2: That was one you were talking about.
Speaker 1: And he's the founder of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].
Speaker 2: Klan.
Speaker 1: Ku Klux Klan was founded there I think in 1868 [sic. 1865-1866], I believe?
Speaker 2: Nathan Bedford Forrest.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.  He's the one that founded the Klan, right, in Pulaski, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Are there any stories about, about him that come down through the family--
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: --or the founding--
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: --of the Klan or anything?
Speaker 2: Nothing has come down about that.  My--of course with my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] being the youngest, maybe a lot of those stories didn't get to her, but I don't remember any of that being, being a part of things that she told.
Speaker 1: Of, of family history.
Speaker 2: No.  No.  There was just always a, a--or should I say there was sort of a rule of thumb that, you know, you stay on the straight and narrow because, you know, you're in hostile territory in a sense that, you know, there were certainly--she didn't--you know, in terms of lynchings or any of that, she never related any of that to me because I think it probably wasn't related to her in that way.  My grandfather was a--was--because of his, you know, involvement in, in--sort of in the community and the land that he owned, he had tenant farmers and that sort of thing, and he was on the school board.  They did have a school board and--
Speaker 1: In Pulaski?
Speaker 2: In--yeah, in their area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not in Pulaski but in the rural area where they were prospect, I guess you would say.  And, of course, the schools were segregated, but he was still on the school board.  And--
Speaker 1: What, what was your--
Speaker 2: --this would've been in the '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Harry--
Speaker 1: Harry.
Speaker 2: --Benton Trotter, B-E-N-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he, he owned the two thousand acres of land and, and--
Speaker 2: A thousand, right.
Speaker 1: A thousand acres.
Speaker 2: A thousand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah, he and his brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It finally went to them.  Brother lived right across the road.  We know a lot of that.  We, we just--we looked at the census.  I think we had 1910.  We had the 1920 census, too.  I think they did it every ten years.  And we could just go right down the road.  You know, the families--you didn't move across town or anything, you just moved right to the--in the next--on the next lot, I guess you would say.  So our cousins would be right--you know, all down the road.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All on your father--
Speaker 2: From the house.
Speaker 1: --on your, your father's land--your grandfather's land?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would all be--
Speaker 1: Great-grand--great-grand--
Speaker 2: --associated with, with that land--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and associated lands, right.
Story_ID: 283434
Speaker 1: You showed me a house that he [Woodson Reid's maternal grandfather, Harry Trotter] built too before we started and it was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --amazing, large house.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, the first house that I showed you that was--that was photographed in 1906, was with my grandmother [Celia Westmoreland Trotter] and my grandfather and my uncle, one of my uncles, my uncle Roy [Trotter].  And he was the fourth oldest--fifth--maybe fourth oldest.  And on the back of the picture, my grandfather described the house and he, he said the house was white, white house, galvanized roof, and then he described what my grandmother wore and the colors.  It was, was really beautiful; you know, it was written.  And my grandmother died when my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] was eight and so I have all those, you know, stories and recounting.  But at any rate, that house, they had a, a film, early film, kind of a--I guess for lack of a better word, camera, but the kind where you showed the film and you had the candle in there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--yeah what they call--
Speaker 2: The rotary, whatever.
Speaker 1: What do they call that?  I know--yeah.
Speaker 2: You know what I--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well at any rate, that caught on fire.  The, the, the candle caught onto the film.  And one thing, you know, went to the other.  Maybe they went out of the room or something.  But at any rate, it caught on fire and they're out in the country so there's no fire department to call.  So the house caught on--you know, it was on fire and one of my aunts was trap--two of them were trapped upstairs and they got--they did break a window out and got a ladder and got them out.  My mother remembers the fire.  And--but they did get all the children out but, of course, the, the house burned to the ground.  So when my grandfather built the second house, the one that you commented on, he said he would never build a house with one staircase again, so it was the eight-gabled; it was a huge home. But he had two staircases and roofs to go out on and porches all around.  So it was designed for safety as well as in--you know, in the style of the day.
Story_ID: 283435
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] grow up in that house?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she talk about growing up--what it was like for her growing up there?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And she was--as I said, she was the youngest of ten.  They were--my grandad [Harry Trotter] was a farmer and he had, you know, all of the various crops and, you know, the watermelons and the orchard, and, you know, the hay and everything they grew, all the things they grew.  And the reason I mentioned watermelon is mother said they had so many watermelons, they would just--on the way to school in the morning, they just--they could go out to the patch and just pick up the watermelons, drop 'em on the ground, reach in, pull out, eat the heart, and keep going (laughter).  It was just--there were so many.  You know, they'd take 'em and feed 'em to the hogs and all of that.  But my grandfather had a tannery on his property, which I saw and, you know, the smokehouse and he had the house for the--for the harnesses, and he had all of those.
Speaker 1: Stable, yeah, like a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but he had a--he had these small outbuildings that were notched and they weren't nailed.  You know, they were--he cut 'em and they cut--notched and grooved.  They were really beautiful, the wide-planked and, you know, kind of things.  But he, you know, had a very successful--he was a very successful farmer.  So they were--whether she, you know, she churned the butter.  She wasn't--she was never the cook because she was too young to cook.
Story_ID: 283436
Speaker 1: And then she [Woodson Reid's mother, Celia Trotter Woodson] talked about when the boys, her older brothers got older, they went to West Virginia to work in the mines and to seek their fortunes elsewhere.  They--he [Woodson Reid's maternal grandfather, Harry Trotter] only had one son--well, he had four sons and six daughters, so he had one son that came back to farm.
Speaker 2: It would seem like farm life would be better than life in a mine.  I don't know.  I mean, I guess in those days, maybe the mine seemed better.
Speaker 1: Well, the money was there.  They went to West Virginia.  They made a lot of money.  And so two of my uncles remained in West Virginia, you know, the two oldest or--yeah, the two oldest boys--the two second oldest boys.  The oldest returned.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, it, it was a--I guess--well, this is during the time of the [Great] Depression--
Speaker 1: The '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: --basically, right?
Speaker 1: Pre--yeah, '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: The '20s [1920s] or '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Twenties [1920s].
Speaker 2: Twenties [1920s]?
Speaker 1: Twenties [1920s] into the '30s [1930s], right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So cash money is why they were going to the mine.
Speaker 1: Yes.  They made a lot of money.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you could get--you know, there's plenty of food on a farm but no money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  You've got--you've got everything you wanted to eat but there's no money.  And so they would go and come back each summer.  You know, go, go and come back and--or I shouldn't say each summer.  They'd go and come back and forth, but they settled there.  They finally settled there.
Story_ID: 283437
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] talk about going to school in--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My, my mother's oldest sister went to college. They went to live in Nashville [Tennessee] to go to the normal, I guess they called it, or teaching school, two year, probably a two year--.
Speaker 1: Was that the precursor to Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee] or, or the--was, was it the--
Speaker 2: I'm not certain.  Could've been, I'm not certain.  But by the time it got to her--all of her, her sisters went, the boys didn't wanna go; her brothers didn't wanna go.  So her older sister went and the others, as time went on, they got married, and she wanted to go.  But at that time--well, her mother [Celia Westmoreland Trotter] died when she was eight, but my mother did very well in school.  But she wanted to go away to school and my grandfather [Harry Trotter] I think because she was the youngest and all, I think he did not necessarily want her to go and she was--she felt very badly about that.  She always talked about, had she--she really wanted the opportunity to go to college.
Speaker 1: So she never got a chance to go?
Speaker 2: But she didn't go, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he did not send her.
Speaker 1: So what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, she got married, met my father [Claude Woodson] and married at twenty-one.
Story_ID: 283438
Speaker 1: My dad worked for the McKissack funeral home, Queen Ann Funeral Home [Pulaski, Tennessee].  Are you familiar with the McKissacks?
Speaker 2: The McKissacks have a--yeah, a big--
Speaker 1: The architectural.
Speaker 2: --architectural firm--
Speaker 1: Well, he's a part of that.
Speaker 2: --and construction activity.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a part of that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --family.  But he remained in Tennessee and he remained in--you know, he remained with the funeral home.  But my dad was the secretary there for the--they had a burial club which was in essence a, a--an insurance--
Speaker 2: An insurance--yeah.
Speaker 1: --thing, right.  An insurance kind of--.
Speaker 2: Now, now what is your father's full name and can you spell--
Speaker 1: Claude--
Speaker 2: All right.  Claude--.
Speaker 1: C-L-A-U-D-E, Elwood, E-L-W-O-O-D, Woodson.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: His date of birth is two, seven, nineteen ten [February 7th, 1910].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now--and was he born in--
Speaker 1: He was born in--I--it's called Prospect [Tennessee], Pulaski [Tennessee]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but he was born there.  And I--and they had a small farm as he--his parents had a small farm.
Speaker 2: Now, now what can you tell us about the ancestors on your, your father's side of the family?
Speaker 1: Okay, well that one--that one I didn't bring up with me.  At any rate, they've--
Speaker 2: Was his mother a McKissack?  Is that--
Speaker 1: No, no.  No, no.  That was--that was through marriage. Okay.
Speaker 2: That McKissack relationship was through marriage.  But--I'm trying to think, his roots, too, are from Virginia.  His great-great-grandfather was an Adams, Harry Adams, and his owner, his--the person who had enslaved them, was an Adams and my--I wanna make, make sure I get it straight--and he changed his name to Woodson.  He bought his freedom and his, his wife's freedom.  His name was Harry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he, he changed his name after he bought his freedom?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Woodson.  And I'm trying to get those names correct.  I didn't--that's the book I didn't pick up today.  But he worked on the railroad; he was a railroad worker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he had eight or ten sons, eight sons; it was a big family of them and them--and one was my grandfather, John Woodson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather, all right, was John Woodson and--
Speaker 2: And my grandmother was Tennie, T-E-N-N-I-E, Woodson, Tennie Simpson Woodson.  She'd been married before.
Speaker 1: Are, there any, any stories that this side of the family that tells about that part of Tennessee or--?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My dad didn't--you know, I--. You know, sometimes I think the stories seemed to come through the women for the most part. And my aunts really didn't relate to me because they didn't--they lived--my, my dad's sister lived in Tennessee, remained in Tennessee, so I didn't hear a lot of those--I didn't hear a lot of those stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that--you know, but my--that my great-great-grandfather did work on the--he was a, a railroad man.  And that's--you know, that was the--that was the--really the number of--it was really the big story that I knew on that lineage.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories about him with the railroad?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I didn't--nothing, nothing was ever brought down on that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, about that.
Speaker 1: And your, your--now, how is your father related to the McKissacks as a--
Speaker 2: It's my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] that's related.
Speaker 1: It's your mother, okay.
Speaker 2: My mother is related to the McKissacks.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: My father worked for a McKissack, Abraham McKissack.  He owned the funeral home, Queen Ann Funeral Home.  And he, he married--through marriage, he married the, the sister of my mother's--he married my, my mother's step-mother's sister [Sarah Lacy McKissack], so it was kind of an off--but it was by marriage that the family--
Story_ID: 283439
Speaker 1: Did your father [Claude Woodson] talk about growing up?  What it was like for him growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, he was always interested and, you know, was kind of a studious person.  And he had--he was the youngest, too.  Both he and my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] were the youngest in their families.  And I do know the, the story of when he went to--he went to the local school and their--they only--the school only went--high school only went--for blacks, it only went to the eleventh grade.  I mean, such subterfuge (laughter).
Speaker 1: So far enough to get to--but not graduate.
Speaker 2: You would--no, no you couldn't graduate.  And so he went to Pulaski [Tennessee] to high school.  So it meant you had to go and board, find a place to go.  And so he went to--not Pulaski, I'm sorry, he went to Chattanooga [Tennessee].  He moved--he--
Speaker 1: To, to finish high school?
Speaker 2: To finish high school.
Speaker 1: To finish that one year?
Speaker 2: That one year he had to finish.  He played football.  He was, you know, very active.
Speaker 1: So if you didn't have just a lot of determination, you weren't gonna get outta high school.
Speaker 2: You weren't gonna get outta high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean--and from what you tell me about the history of--that little bit of history of Pulaski--no, it was--it was quite--it was ridiculous.  It was terrible.  And my mother--my mother was in the first class at the high--at the high school that had a twelfth grade, so she graduated.  My father was older than my mom, so--but up to that time, nobody--. And what would--I mean, here you are out on a farm, what would the likelihood be that you could go and find a place to stay in--you know, you have to go to a city.  You have to go--so if you were in Pulaski, you went to Nashville [Tennessee], but I guess he knew people and he went to Chattanooga.  He probably had cousins or something there 'cause that's where my aunt went, too.  That's where she ended up staying in Chattanooga.
Story_ID: 283440
Speaker 1: So you say your parents [Celia Trotter Woodson and Claude Woodson] met in Nashville [Tennessee] or, or they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no they met--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They met in Pulaski [Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at a, I guess a church picnic, picnic.  And my dad was, was there.  He was the--maybe--the picnic or the fair, whichever one.  But they had a--a band was playing and he knew some of the members of the band, so he was like going with the band to, you know, just out in the--on a picnic, and that's when he met my mother.
Story_ID: 284192
Speaker 1: Start that again about your mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, and just talking about things, and she would--but she had beautiful gardens and beautiful flowers, and she would turn the soil.  You know, my dad [Claude Woodson] was--he was working, you know. But she kept all the yard--the yard was hers.  And she turned the soil and all that and I'd say, mother, how, how can you do that?  You, you do it so easily.  I mean, you know, I do it and my foot would turn and, and, you know, and I wouldn't chunk the--you know, I'd get the pitch fork and wouldn't get the, the, the dirt to get all the big clogs out of the dirt and everything.  And she said, you forget I'm a country girl (laughter).  You know, I mean, I--she loves that, that soil.  And so when she--when my sons [Khari Benton Reid and Senghor Elwood Reid] would help her, she would show them how to turn the dirt and do all of that.  But it was during those times and then other, you know, times when we were in the kitchen and she's baking and all of these things that she would just always refer--she always referred to her growing up and what her grandfather told her, and all of the things she remembered about her mother [Celia Westmoreland Trotter].  And her mother was--she said her mother raised turkeys to--for her money.  You know, how you'd say she had her--they had the farm stuff, but she did things, too, for herself.  So she had the turkeys.  So when her little turkey crop came in, they were--they were not quite as easy to raise as the chickens.  And so she'd get--they'd all gather around and sit on her lap and everything, and they'd go through the Sears [Roebuck and Co.] catalog and pick out the, the fabrics they were gonna get, and we pick--they'd pick all the things out.  So when the fabrics came in, she'd sew all their clothes.  So my mother sewed a lot.  And from my mother sewing, I did--so I--my mother did a lot of--she sewed on the machine but she also did a lot of handwork, and as a result, I, you know, picked up and did a lot of sewing and stitching and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 284193
Speaker 1: How many people were, were in your household when you grew up?
Speaker 2: When I grew up?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, it's your mother [Celia Trotter Woodson], father [Claude Woodson], yourself and--
Speaker 2: My, my mother, father, my brother [Curtis Elwood Woodson] and I, and we had a, a roomer for a while.  And my uncle lived with us for a while, you know, when they'd come up from the South and they would stay.  And one really wonderful person, he was actually my dad's friend, his name was Marsh, last name was Marsh, L.V. Marsh, the initials L.V., and he had worked in Pulaski [Tennessee], and he was the chauffeur and the pastry cook for these two sisters, these two wealthy sisters that lived there.  And, I mean, his cooking was just impeccable.  But my mother told me he was the pastry cook, which meant it was another cook (laughter) for the other food.  You know, I just said, a pastry cook?  But he drove them around and--but his--he, he--and then when he came here, he came here to work in the plant.  And I think he worked at Dodge, I think it was.  My dad worked--was at Ford [Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan].  And, but his--and he taught my mother--as a result, he taught her how to bake the pastries and they were really exquisite.  The closest that I've--that would come would be to a Danish pastry, that flaky, that really thin, not the big heavy crust, that, you know, really wonderful baking of not cakes but pies, you know, the pies and the custards and that was all specialty--
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: --that that developed.
Story_ID: 284194
Speaker 1: Now when did your family move to Detroit [Michigan]?  When did that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We moved here in 1936.
Speaker 1: And what, what, what caused--is there a story behind them moving to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they wanted--they heard about the, the better life, economics.  My dad [Claude Woodson] was working for--we called him Uncle Abe--Abe--Abraham McKissack.  Worked for the--for them and, you know, that wasn't probably a whole lot of money, but their--they just thought they--felt they would come--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--
Speaker 2: --to Detroit.  My mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] had--my mother's sister was here and her family.  In fact, three sisters were here and their families, older sisters, and so they knew that they could come to Detroit.  Jobs were here and they could come and, you know, seek, seek their fortune.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was a big step.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, so where, where did you all move to when you moved--
Speaker 2: We moved--we moved in with my aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With one of my aunts.
Speaker 1: Was this, this on the West Side of Detroit?
Speaker 2: West Side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the--did the neighborhood have a particular name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're on the--right on the West Side.  In fact, it's part of, I don't know if you're familiar with, they've done a whole thing on the, the history of the West Side, Detroit.  They've published and they've had TV programs on and all.  But anyway, it's--we moved on Whitewood [Street].  And my--we moved with my aunt--Paul [Rhodes] and Azzilie Rhodes. That's my mother's sister, was Azzilie and she had seven children, and we moved into their house.  And we were there for a year, and then we moved on Tillman [Street].  And we lived--we moved into--we, we roomed with the Johnsons in a big four-family flat.  It's under the freeway now. And we stayed there probably for I think two years. So I was three there, two and three.  Then we moved on Kirby [Street].  We were on--moved to a--from a room, we moved to a flat.  And my mother was doing day work and--on Tillman and the lady that we stayed with would babysit for me.
Story_ID: 284195
Speaker 1: Now do you have a first childhood memory?  An earliest childhood memory.  What's the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: I remember Tillman [Street, Detroit, Michigan].  I remember being on Tillman.  I don't remember being with my aunt [Azzilie Rhodes], but I remember being on Tillman.  So I guess I was two and a half.
Story_ID: 284196
Speaker 1: I know you, you moved to a few places, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, number one, I was always--I was the only--after I left my aunt's [Azzilie Rhodes] house with all my cousins, I was the only child.  I didn't move any--there was nowhere else that I moved, to the second location where there were children in the house, so we moved to this big four-family flat, and they were all adults.  And I just sort of would go from one space to another and enjoy whatever, talk with them.  And I remember the--you know, we'd get on the streetcar, I remember that.  I remember on Tillman [Street] or was that at Kirby [Street], I think it was Tillman; that was on Tillman.  There was this sweet shop and one of the ladies from that--I can't remember if she worked there or not, Lena Watts [ph.].  I don't know if she--maybe she didn't.  But at any rate, we would walk around to the sweet shop, I always remember.  And I remember the curly--the ice cream parlor chairs, you know, the, the wire backs and the round seats and all that.  And you could get--you know, we'd go there and my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] would take me there and we'd get ice cream.  We walked back and I just remember, you know, kids in the block. But that was when we moved--that's when we moved on--that's when we moved on Kirby.  I just remember it being really exciting.  We--Belle Isle [Park] was very important in our--whenever people came to Detroit [Michigan] to visit or if we visited people, we'd go to Belle Isle and take pictures around the fountain. I showed you some of those.  You know, big cars, church--Sunday school, I don't remember too much of that.
Story_ID: 284197
Speaker 1: --What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: St. Stephen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --A.M.E. Church [St. Stephen A.M.E. Church, Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is one of the West Side [Detroit, Michigan] churches. I'm still a member there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've been a member your whole life--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at St. Stephen's, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was, was church a big, big part of--big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Probably after I started school, it was maybe we'll say from the age of probably eight or nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was--it was definitely a part of our life because my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] was very active in--you know, in the church and her club and everything. So I was--you know, in terms of being involved with that adult group as well.
Story_ID: 284198
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Talkative, inquisitive, social.  I was summoned by the police--I was--the police were summoned for me on, what two, two or three--two occasions.
Speaker 1: Were summoned--
Speaker 2: To find me.
Speaker 1: --to find--oh.
Speaker 2: I was--I was a, a child who was in a harness.  My mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] bought a harness for me finally after losing me in--I went to Sears [Roebuck and Co.] with she and my dad [Claude Woodson], and they looked around, I was gone.  And they found me, I was on the second level looking--not looking for them (laughter), looking, you know, looking at the pots and the pans and the furniture or whatever I was--you know, I was wandering.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was probably three or four.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I--I do remember the harness and she would just put it right on me just like you do a little dog (laughter), like you harness a puppy (laughter).  And I always remember being at length, at the full length of it.  My mom never--she did not--now they slap the (laughter)--if they walk away, they knock the kids out (laughter).  She didn't do that.  She just said, okay, well if you're gonna go--and I was adventurous.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had an--did you take after your mother more, more or your father do you think?
Speaker 2: Probably a little bit of both.  Probably my mother was, you know, very social and act--they were both active, but, of course, I was with mother a little more 'cause my dad was at work.  Yeah, but very, you know, very adventurous and, you know, interested in things.
Story_ID: 284199
Speaker 1: Now what were the--your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: English, writing, literature, art, music.
Speaker 1: Now did you--when you were a, a little girl, did you ever consider becoming an artist, I mean a professional artist?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Did you think about it?
Speaker 2: Early on.  I was very interested in music, too, but I made up my--my mind was made up.  I had a choice of becoming a great pianist or a great artist, so I said, I don't think I wanna practice as much as I would, would have to for piano.  I was not--I was okay with piano but nothing strong.  But, no, really, art was the strongest--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --area.
Speaker 1: Did you draw a lot when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What materials would, would, would you use to draw on?
Speaker 2: To draw?  Crayons--pencils, crayons.  I may have had a paint set or something like that, but basically crayons.  And, and I did a lot of--I sewed a lot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and putting things together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your favorite subjects to draw?
Speaker 2: Oh, figures, people, models, you know.  Usually boys did the--now, they call 'em superheroes, they'd do all the comic book--you know, they would do comic book characters and cartoons and everything.  I didn't really like that.  I liked to draw models and clothing and things of that sort.  And in school, I get--I was known as the, the artist in the class and I would do the--if they needed pictures for the hall or something like that.  I remember doing the big Thanksgiving sort of a mural concept for Thanksgiving or Christmas or things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you ever make any, any of the clothes that you drew?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I didn't--I didn't carry it that far.  It was just the, the visual.  I was the designer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Somebody else would have to--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah right, I designed clothes, but somebody else made 'em.  I didn't--I didn't go that next step.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I knew that was another whole--
Speaker 1: Now, did you--
Speaker 2: --process.
Story_ID: 284200
Speaker 1: What was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: Sherrill [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], S-H-E-R-R-I-L-L.  My first one was Columbian [Primary School, Detroit].  That was the--I just went there for kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Columbian for, for, for kindergarten--
Speaker 2: Right.  And then Sherrill--
Speaker 1: --and then Sherrill for--
Speaker 2: --from kindergarten through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did you have any teachers there that, that were like special to your development and who really encouraged you?
Speaker 2: I suppose my--Miss, Miss Davis [ph.] was my first--I remember every teacher (laughter).  Miss Davis was always encouraging.  You know, I was--she was, what, second grade?  First--Davis may have been first grade.  And then Miss Shaw [ph.] in sixth grade, Miss, Miss McCrathen [ph.] fifth grade.  She was very--I would say her.  I would say that teacher.  But I, I pretty much--Miss Holmberg [ph.] who was my art teacher and then I went to special art classes and--when I was recommended--
Speaker 1: Were, were--
Speaker 2: --for that.
Speaker 1: Were they at the DIA [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan] or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went there.
Speaker 1: The, the Detroit Institute for the Arts [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 284201
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware--now we were talking about this earlier.  Were you aware of the--I know Diego Rivera came to Detroit [Michigan] and Frida Kahlo back in the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s]--
Speaker 2: Forties [1940s], right.
Speaker 1: I guess, and--
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of that.
Speaker 1: You would have been in grade school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the time.
Speaker 2: But I didn't know about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what I did know about was in the early '50s [1950s] when the [General Douglas] MacArthur era came up, I was taking classes there, and Ford [Motor Company, Dearborn, Michigan] sponsored that, you know, that mural ['Detroit Industry Murals'].  I won't say--because it was a Ford Motor Company.
Speaker 1: The Diego Rivera--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --mural in the--
Speaker 2: Mural, right.
Speaker 1: --in the DIA [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: It's of the Ford.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had already condemned that--the one ['Man at the Crossroads'], you know, the Rockefeller Center [New York, New York] or wherever that was in New York [New York], and they tore that one down.  They destroyed that one.  But there was a, a big plaque that they put right in Rivera Court, we did in Detroit.  And they--the Fords said that--I guess it was Edsel Ford, said that there would be no disruption, you know, that art and the political thing had nothing--that this was far beyond whatever political concepts were going on at the time, and they refused.  So I'm sure--and of course it's still there and people come from all over, but they, they did take the one down in Manhattan [New York, New York]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 284202
Speaker 1: Well, you went right from Sherrill [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] to high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Chadsey High School [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, how do you spell--
Speaker 2: C-H-A-D-S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: C-H-A-D--
Speaker 2: S-E-Y.
Speaker 1: S-E-Y, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Is that on the West Side of [Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now when you were in high school, did you--was art still your favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was an art major.  Everybody--you either had art or music.  I did art.  I had art all the way through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had a--but I had--the--my other support for it was that I still went every Saturday to the Art Institute [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan] for the Saturday classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I did that.
Story_ID: 284203
Speaker 1: Oh, I did want to relate back to the, the high school [Chadsey High School, Detroit, Michigan] in terms of history.  I was gonna--in terms of the historical concept.  We--in our house, we had like five books that were on a little shelf in the living room. And one was the--one was a--on a--a book on a guy I never heard of.  I can't remember him, but I remember we had that book on him--on this one person.  And we had the, the I volume of--from some encyclopedia (laughter).  And--
Speaker 2: You know, most families have the A--
Speaker 1: A.
Speaker 2: --because you can get it at the supermarket, you know, free?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: So everybody had A.
Speaker 1: A (laughter).
Speaker 2: But they, you know--
Speaker 1: We had an I.  I don't know (laughter) what happened to the rest of it, so--but somehow we had an I.  And we had the--a hymnal, brown, brown covered hymnal in there, and we had a small pamphlet on Harriet Tubman--
Speaker 2: Can you remember--
Speaker 1: --and maybe one of--
Speaker 2: --who, who wrote it?
Speaker 1: No.  Oh, do I ever.  I wish I had it (laughter).  I don't--you know, we've looked through it.  You know, I don't know, but it--you know, and I may come across it.  But this was on Harriet--we had it on Harriet Tubman.  And, of course, you know, I'm reading, reading in the library all the time, but came, I would read my--the I, look that up.  And when I was in the fifth grade, my dad [Claude Woodson] gave me a--it was a Christmas gift, a--an atlas, a world atlas and that was like--really opened up everything.  It was a big, oversize book.  But the importance of that Harriet Tubman, you know, you just--that kinda set--that was always there and I would read it all the time and we talked about the Underground Railroad and what all of that meant, and, and that sort of thing.  And I gave a report on it in school.  I went to school.  It was predominantly white school, predominantly white neighborhood, and there were three streets.
Speaker 2: Now this is high school?  Or, or grade--
Speaker 1: I'm back in grade school, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Elementary.
Speaker 2: So this is Sherrill [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Sherrill.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so it's all white students and there were three streets where blacks lived at that time.  Well, actually--yeah, two.  And two of the three streets--one of the--one of--two of the three streets had some industry in there, so it's a very small number.  So I remember coming home and saying I've got--working on my book report.  And my mother [Celia Trotter Woodson] said, well--. And I brought some--went to the library and got something on somebody.  And she said--I said, I'm giving my report on this person.  She said, well why are you giving your report on that person?  That's not a important person.  She says why don't you give it on--at the time, she says why don't you give it on a--on a Negro person that--you know, someone who has really done something?  And I said, oh, we got this Harriet Tubman.  She says, well write, write your report on that.  So I wrote my report on that and that was sort of the first time that I had ever--it was sort of like a statement with--statement with the report--in a statement in terms of--it was a oral report that you had to give.  At the time, I was in the seventh grade and that was--you know, how you are in your middle school.  You're kinda--you wanna be correct with everything, you know?  But I remember giving this report on Harriet Tubman.  No one else gave any report on anybody that--of--you know, any other African American.  But I just felt very--I felt very strong and very right, you know, about doing that, in this--in the setting of, you know, very few whites and major--very few blacks, majority white, and, of course, teacher.  I didn't have--I didn't have a, a, a African American teacher 'til I got to college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I, I can take it then black, black history month was not a--was not--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: --celebrated.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: It was Negro History Week [Black History Month] then, I think, but it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, could've been.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Could've been.  But we didn't do it at our school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was just--
Speaker 2: Okay, so no black teachers--
Speaker 1: --out there.
Speaker 2: --even in the all black schools.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  There were--of course, the majority of teachers would be white, but--yeah, there would be cases of all black schools with all white teachers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: East and west.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 284204
Speaker 1: Were you involved in other high school activities like clubs or did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: --run for office?  Or--
Speaker 2: I, I was in the Y-Teens in high school.  And was another thing, I'm gonna go back to grade school [Sherrill Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan] really--just--it was very interesting how you look at sort of the super structure I think of now.  They had a Bible class and the majority of the kids in our neighborhood--well, they were of--but a lot of Polish, they were all different, but--you know, pretty heavy Polish, and--but when they had the--came to the Bible class, the only kids that went to the Bible class were black.  It was very interesting.  But the people who gave the class were--I don't know if they were The Christophers [Inc.], I don't know who they were, but they had a--they were able to come into the schools after school.  It was an after-school program.  It was very interesting.  But what I loved about it is they told the Bible stories, the various Bible stories, is they used the felt--they had these large panorama things.
Speaker 1: Felt boards?
Speaker 2: Felt boards.  And they'd put up the sky and they'd put up all--of course, that was art, so (laughter) so I would just love that and the figures, and they'd put the figures up and they had the felt back, but beautiful sunsets.  And I said, oh, I've got to do that (laughter), you know?  So it was like--it was an art only religious but in a--in another--kind of another--but it was along with--that's what--when I--you said--Y--when I said Y-Teens, that was the same thing.  Because it's sort of the same thing with the Y-Teens, the Y-Teens at, at the Chad- at Chadsey [High School, Detroit, Michigan], what--it was like, the main people that were interested in that were African American girls.
Story_ID: 283810
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were just talking about the Y-Teens and--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What, what other--
Speaker 2: Well, I was--
Speaker 1: Any other groups?
Speaker 2: Y-Teens, I was a member of the--I was a cheerleader.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  It was big.  It was a big deal.  I was captain of the cheer squad for a couple of months, for a season, I guess.  And so that was wonderful involvement there.  And--you know, and then of course, again, my--the arts.  Saturday was sort of--with high school was very involved in that, but then also I was still a part of the museum program, so my Saturdays were there meeting kids from other schools and--you know, and that sort of, kind of broadened my view I think.
Speaker 1: Now did the museum program give you a chance to use mediums [sic. media] and, and have access to materials you couldn't get in high school [Chadsey High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Sort of.  We used them in a different way.  It was a little freer.  And what I would do, what I learned in--on Saturdays, I would come back and do it in my own class.  We didn't have sculpture.  We didn't--we didn't have sculpture or jewelry or--basically, the program was a drawing and painting program.  I didn't get those other things 'til I got to college [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now did you get a chance to meet professional artists, you know?
Speaker 2: Somewhat, other, other art teachers.  You know, we had other art teachers that were--you know, that were interesting.
Speaker 1: Did they ever let the kids come to openings and that sort of thing or meet the--meet the artists who were displaying the work in the DIA [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  No.  We weren't--we didn't--we didn't do that.  We would see the exhibitions but not the openings.
Speaker 1: Now some of the exhibits, you know, I guess would acquaint you with world art, you know, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, it did.  I'm just saying that--I mean, I--my view was really broadened, you know.  You know, you say, well who was your favorite artist?  You know, I was introduced to [Henri] Matisse and I always remember that, and then the Dutch artists.  And it was just, just--I think I had another--a broader perspective going there and seeing how different kids worked.  And I know one of the classes was an oil class.  One teacher taught portraiture and he taught it in Rivera Court.  What you see now in Rivera Court is not what Rivera Court looked like.  And they had it--even with the murals ['Detroit Industry Murals'] up, it was a--sort of an Italian garden with fountains and a lot of plants and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so they--what it--the way it looks now is a recent redesign of the space.  So--you know, so kids would--you know were painting portraits in oil.  They were--there was an oil class.  And they did do some sculpture, but I wasn't in that class either.  But, no just the freedom to, to move around and look at the art.
Story_ID: 283811
Speaker 1: And that was when I started my collection of postcards.  You get a postcard, two for a nickel, the black and white, so I would have money.  I would--every week, I would buy two new postcards.
Speaker 2: How did you--how did you get the idea of collecting postcards?
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to have some of that art to take home.  You know, it was like right there in the--you know, you go to the little bookstore or it wasn't really--.  It was sort of an out--kind of a--it wasn't anything as elaborate as they have now, you know, where you have gift shops.  It was just sort of a, a little space where they sold cards and sort of like souvenirs on your way out of the--you know, out of the museum [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan] near the front entrance.
Speaker 2: Now did you have a favorite artist of all the, the masters' work that you saw in the museum?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I liked the--as I said, I always remember the [Henri] Matisse.  It was sort of a interior.  It was a room.  I always remember that one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Now were you aware in those days of Aaron Douglas or any of the--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: --other--.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  In those days as I grew up, I knew I was gonna be the first African American woman artist.  I knew I was gonna be the first, whatever.  I think I heard--.
Speaker 2: So you didn't know of any others at that, that point.
Speaker 1: Weren't in the books.  Nobody said anything.  They weren't on the walls (laughter).  It wasn't there so, therefore, it doesn't exist, right?  And it wasn't until I got into--I do remember I had a teacher that I met there, very important person, turned out to be a good friend of mine.  She was my teacher.  Her name was Cyril Miles.  She was my teacher there and we remain friends.  I eventually taught with her at Highland Park College [Highland Park Community College, Detroit, Michigan].  But she introduced the name to me of Wifredo Lam.  Are you familiar with him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's Cuban, African Cuban artist, W-I-F-R-E-D-O, Wifredo Lam, L-A-M, and--
Speaker 2: L-A-M?
Speaker 1: L-A-M. Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Wifredo Lam.  And she introduced me to that name and I think it was during high school [Chadsey High School, Detroit, Michigan] that I became--I was introduced to the name of Jacob Lawrence.  I heard of him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did--
Speaker 1: But, but no one else.  No, no Douglas, no Catlett [HistoryMaker Elizabeth Catlett], no--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --Edmonia Lewis or--none of that.  I didn't--I didn't--I didn't learn about any of that until I graduated from college, after college.  And I was an art--and I--and I had--and in college at Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], I was an art history minor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I went to the School for the Art Institute of Chicago [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 283812
Speaker 1: How did you decide to go to Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan]?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I was--
Speaker 1: It doesn't seem like a stretch but (laughter), being in Detroit [Michigan] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  Everybody was--well, no, I, I went there, you know, to take--to study, you know, to, to study art after graduating from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you a, a good student in high school or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a good student.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you, you went on to Wayne State.  Was the idea to major in art at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, to be an art major.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I was going to--.
Speaker 1: So--oh, just one second.  You graduate--what--when did you graduate from Chadsey [High School, Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: From Chadsey?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 283813
Speaker 1: That was quite a year on the political scene, Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] and all that, but--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --did your--did your parents [Celia Trotter Woodson and Claude Woodson] talk about civil rights at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And I think the--you know, the turning point for everybody, I just remember being in tears over Emmett Till.  I remember just--first at the knowledge when we, we heard they were--you know, he was being--was looking for.  And then when the Jet photos came out and I guess after that, Ebony but certainly when those Jet photos came out and that was--that was just mind boggling.  I remember being--'cause, you know, at that time, nobody had--nothing could come on the national scene with any of--anything, so, you know, horrific for a child.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--so to that point, I mean, was, was that the first lynching you really had heard of, that--.
Speaker 2: Yes, that, that I--that--not that I heard of.  You know how you hear of it, oh, I knew about lynchings and I knew about them, but that was the first one that somebody my age or near my age 'cause he was fourteen, you know, that--and for doing--you know, I mean, mean for doing anything, but just it was--we, we were definitely, definitely--
Speaker 1: Is that--is that--
Speaker 2: --impressed by that.
Speaker 1: Is that the first time that you'd seen a photo of someone who was a victim of a lynching or was it--
Speaker 2: Like that.
Speaker 1: --you know some--yeah.
Speaker 2: Like that.  Yes, like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, you--the anonymous person in the tree kinda thing, but--and I'm sure I had, but it--nothing--it really--that stuck.  You kinda knew it was out there and you knew about there were riots in the--you know, that--those early riots in Detroit [Michigan] in the early '40s [1940s].  I mean, I was a child, a baby, but still.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had the big riot here in, what was it, 1943 or something like that?  Supposedly someone threw a baby off the Belle Isle Bridge [Douglas MacArthur Bridge] and--yeah.
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But--and I always remember having--being vocal about, you know, that wasn't anything that the high school kids talked about, you know, but I remember at, at--whenever the time--when, when it--when it was appropriate, I seemed to have a perspective on it.
Story_ID: 283814
Speaker 1: In '54 [1954], you went to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: --Wayne State.  And how'd you like Wayne State?
Speaker 2: It was okay.  It was all right.  I met--you know, I met some--I met James Wilson who is a photographer here, James Donald--James D. Wilson, very important photographer.  And we had a class, and he said, "Have you ever heard of Arts Extended Group?"  I said, "No."  He said, well it's a group of African American artists or art--you know, out of artists in the area, but you have to graduate before you can get in.  You can't come in now.  You have to be a--to have graduated.  I said, oh, wonderful.  I said, okay, so I, I did join that group and it turned out to be a very highly professional group that's really responsible for me.
Speaker 1: And it's called?
Speaker 2: Arts Extended.
Speaker 1: Arts Extended.
Speaker 2: Right.  I have one of the photographs there, A-R-T-S Extended.  It was Arts Extended Group and later they opened a gallery.
Speaker 1: Now was there--before we leave Wayne State, is there--are there any good stories about Wayne State?  About--.
Speaker 2: With art?  Well, at Wayne State, I started writing.  I did--I wrote poetry.  I became interested in poetry and, yeah, I became immersed in, in art.  But again, you know, I'm seeking--I, I mean, I'm--you know, there were the fraternities and sororities and all that.  I didn't--you know, I, I had friends here but I didn't--that wasn't a area that I was real interested in pursuing.  But, you know, I, I just wanted to be--I just wanted to be an artist.  And, you know, was taking the courses, art history and everything, and I said--well I knew I was gonna be the first.  So, you know, you just sort of go from--kinda go from there.
Story_ID: 283815
Speaker 1: You remember when you found out you weren't gonna be the first African American woman artist (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I found out--let me see, I found out actually, as I said, after I graduated and I--I'm trying to think exactly.  When was I--when I met the person that would be my husband [Edsel B. Reid].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you met him while you were in--.
Speaker 2: No, after.
Speaker 1: Oh, after--.
Speaker 2: No, after.  That's what I'm saying, after.
Speaker 1: Okay, after.
Speaker 2: Right, after.  Right, right.  I met him after.  I mean, I use it loosely.  I mean, I knew that--you know, I guess I was learning others, but it wasn't--he gave me--he gave me a book and it was the Cedric Dover book ['American Negro Art'], 'Modern Negro Art' [sic.].  And I started seeing--you know, I saw all these pictures and I have the book here.
Speaker 1: About what year is that?
Speaker 2: That was 1966.
Speaker 1: So that's about ten years after Wayne [University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: But, but I--but I did--let me--I, I wanna go back to before that.  I met [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt in 1960--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I started my graduate studies there.  Graduated from Wayne in '58 [1958].
Story_ID: 283816
Speaker 1: How did you choose to go to the University of--I mean the [School of the] Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to--I didn't wanna go to Wayne [University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  I said, well I've got my first degree here, I don't wanna go and get my degree, let me try somewhere else.  So I rode around to different places and I--you know, as I'm looking through material and I said, oh, here's something in Chicago [Illinois].  I've--my uncle lived in Chicago and his family, and I always loved Chicago.  So I said, oh, I could--I could maybe go to Chicago.  So I wrote for application for summer to see how I would like it and I went there for the summer.  And it was in the--I took painting and art history and it was in the art history class that I met [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt. That was in 1960.  And he was taking the class--he was taking the art history class.  It was really--it was called the history--it was really contemporary sculpture, but the instructor taught everything else that dealt with it, so it was really--it was a fabulous course.  And at--we had a break.  It was--we were--we were there like from eight to twelve for the class in the morning, and the afternoon was the painting.  So every--when we take our break about ten o'clock, all the kids would go out and they'd all kind of rush around this young black guy.  They'd all huddle around him and everything, and so there was another lady, African American lady in the class and we'd eat--you know, have our break, and I'd say, who are--who--why are all those--who is--who's that guy?  All those people every time, they're always going and talking to him.  She said, oh, that's Richard Hunt.  I said, who's Richard Hunt?  He's--she says, here, I'll show you and she took me around the corner and there was one of his gorgeous sculptures (laughter).  She said the museum [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] bought that from him--bought that piece from him when he was eighteen (laughter), you know?  I said, oh, okay.  So that was my first awakening that there was something going on out here in the world that I didn't know about, but I was learning fast and I really enjoyed that.  I met Richard, you know, we became friends and I--you know, we know each other.  And--but anyway, and then we went on a tour of his studio and, and it was--at that time, it was in the home of his parents [Etoria Henderson Hunt and Cleophus Hunt] in the basement.  He had all this metal and everything, and just, you know, it was--as I said, it was a real awakening.  So I guess that was--I knew I wasn't gonna be the first woman--I mean, I was--I already met the first man that I thought--but still, this--the history of it, there was still no inclusion in terms of African American.  It wasn't, as I said, until after that.  These little, you know, bits and pieces you see, Archibald Motley, you know, they put him in--I knew about him from Ebony but they did him doing shower curtains if you remember that famous article.  That was--that's how they covered him.  They didn't cover him as an artist.  They covered him as an artist who did designs on shower curtains, and so that's how I found out about him.
Story_ID: 283817
Speaker 1: National Conference of Artists [NCA] is founded in '59 [1959].  One of their goals is to make people aware.  I guess--I guess it just hadn't--it just hadn't really--it just--the word just wasn't out, you know, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, there was no vehicle.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The way you know about it is if they're in books; there were no books.  I mean, there were--it was a book or two books or something like that, but nothing that was widespread.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So everybody's kind of, you know, getting their way up.  And by that time, we're into the, the Civil Rights Movement, you know what I mean?  Every--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, you're just sort of--your awareness is peaked.
Speaker 1: Was there like a black arts community in Chicago [Illinois] that--I mean around, you know--
Speaker 2: You mean in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: Well, no.  You know, when you were in Chicago [at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago] for that summer, were you aware of--
Speaker 2: No.  No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: --the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't learn about that 'til I joined NCA and we came back, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I met [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs and she was in the--after I got married [to Edsel B. Reid] we were--we came back and we went to, you know, the home when it was in her home that her--before she--you know, the DuSable [Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] was open.  But, yeah, we went to the South Side and that's when I learned all about that.  So it was that--the late '60s [1960s] when my--you know, when just the information just started coming.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But nothing that summer.  No, we were looking at Frank Lloyd Wright buildings and Louis Sullivan.  We were down--downtown going--his architecture.
Story_ID: 283818
Speaker 1: So when you got back to Detroit [Michigan], what did you do before you, you know--did you--well, you finished the M.F.A. at--
Speaker 2: I didn't--
Speaker 1: --at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan], but did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't finish it at Wayne State, yeah--
Speaker 1: Wayne State.
Speaker 2: I came back and I began painting very different works when I came back from Chicago [Illinois] 'cause I was a figurative artist, so my works were very sort of abstracted but I was showing a lot of teeth, sort of in anger (laughter).  They were kind of, not anguished, but just sort of outraged kind of ideas.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you feel angry then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  And then--I, I was.  And, and I went to Europe during that time, too, and I made all kinds of, you know, kind of decisions there.  I went alone and I was there for three months, and I had a friend in London [England]; I made her my last stop.  But I met people along the way and I just--I just sort of got this feeling of, you know, well, you know, how am I looked at?  I was looked at as a foreigner certainly, you know, but I was an American, but I was something else then, too.  You know, how you're just sort of--sort of this kinda coming of age and looking at things.  I--when I was in Germany, I was in Cologne and I had--was I in--yeah, I was in Germany, and I had gone out to eat--I had gone out to eat and I was--you know, the restaurant found a nice--I'd gone there earlier.  I'd gone there--I think that was one I had gone to earlier and you know how kind of you find a place that's nice to eat earlier, you'll go back, you know, so I think I had lunch there or something.  Anyway, I went back and I was eating and saw this other couple and, and it was sort of like a couple--it was like a couple and a--and a friend, male.  They sat down across from me and, you know, kind of acknowledged sort of a little bit--I mean, but, you know, I was there.  So I did not speak.  And that was the other thing, the language barrier.  I speak French, some French, so I did pretty well in France.  But by the time I got to--I went to Italy and I said, oh, God, I gotta learn how to speak some more languages.  This will never do.  So I got to--I was in Germany and, of course, no German.  And--but regardless, you know, when people are saying something about you--'cause I was in Italy and a little guy comes up and--boy comes up and tries to rub--you know, makes some comment, rubs my arm.  I swatted him (laughter), get outta here, you little dumb body (laughter).  I didn't--you know, they were two little boys.  They ran away and laughed.  I have--I don't know if I was in--I may have been in Venice [Italy].  I think I was in Venice when that happened.  But anyway, so I'm in--I'm in, in this restaurant and the food was good and everything, I'm sort of finishing, and I'm looking and the--as I said, it seemed like the couple and sort of the male content friend who accompanied them to dinner.  So he was talking and he's talking and talking, and then he makes a gesture over to me.  He said so and so, and so and so, and so and so, like that, and they laughed.  They all broke out laughing.  When they--when they burst out laughing, I stood up.  I just stood straight up.  They thought I understood what they said.  They were so--they were horrified.  They were so embarrassed and they kind of wanted to say something, but whatever he did, you know, jungle bunny, I don't know what he called me.  I don't know what he said, but it was definitely--you know, how you just know what the--you get the gist of language.  So I said, all right, Germany (laughter).
Story_ID: 283819
Speaker 1: It was interesting because the day before I had some--I had gone--I had some entrees into meeting some other people and that had gone well.  And we'd gone to a radio station.  They take me--they took me into the radio station and--into one of the, you know, studio areas, and they were listening to music.  You know, it was kind of nice and I, I think, you know, I had gone to lunch with this person.  And so then I was--I relaxed, you know what I'm saying?  I sort of relaxed.  But I was alone and I was female and I was an African American, and I just--again, all of that, I just--I said, you know, this same thing would be--it--politically I think it just made me realize that--I wonder if he was--oh, I went to, to--all the expatriates, oh, I went to Germany or I went to Italy or I went to, you know, Denmark and everything, was fabulous.  I said, you're only one person, you're welcome.  I said if you took the population of Chicago [Illinois] and put it here, same thing, you know, or Detroit [Michigan], you know, I just--those were just some awarenesses that I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard that there's a critical mass that's reached (laughter) then everywhere you go--
Speaker 1: Right.  Then it--then it's no longer--no, and usually the critical mass on the other end is one, that's fine.  We're, we're, we're all set here, we got our one or two (laughter), we've integrated enough.  But, so these were some--these were just some definite awarenesses--
Speaker 2: Did you--
Speaker 1: --that I was coming to.
Speaker 2: --strike up a relationship with any of the black expatriates in France or--
Speaker 1: I didn't meet any.
Speaker 2: --Germany?
Speaker 1: I didn't--I had no entrees into that.  I had no--I had nothing.  I didn't meet any, any of that group until I got to England and met, you know, people from Jamaica and, you know, others who were living in, in London [England].  I didn't--and I loved London.  But I just--you know, I didn't--I, I wasn't aware of all of that.  You know, going now, I would have a whole bunch of things, you know.  I would have a lot of--lot of references.
Speaker 2: So this is nineteen sixty--
Speaker 1: Three [1963].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 283820
Speaker 1: So did you go back to graduate school when you came back to Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I finished [at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  And, and then I went to MacDowell Colony [Peterborough, New Hampshire].
Speaker 1: That's a artist college?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In New Hampshire.  And--
Speaker 1: Were you the only black person at this one?
Speaker 2: No.  I met Lindsay [Waldorf] Patterson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was a protege of Langston Hughes, writer, T-T Patterson, two Ts in Patterson.  And I met John Torres, sculptor, black sculptor.  There were three--
Speaker 1: What--what's his name?
Speaker 2: John Torres.
Speaker 1: Torres?  Just like the bull?
Speaker 2: Yeah, T-O-R-R-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So there were--there were three--there were three of us there.  He was a sculptor; John's a sculptor, I'm painter, and Lindsay's a writer.  And that was a very--that was a very important time.  I was there for three months and I did--it was my first work that I had done after graduate school, so it was a totally new scene.  And I, I received my book on African American art ['American Negro Art,' Cedric Dover], which gave me another whole--
Speaker 1: Okay, now when did you meet your husband [Edsel B. Reid]?
Speaker 2: In--let's see--nineteen--September 1965 just before I went to MacDowell.  I went to MacDowell in January of '66 [1966].
Story_ID: 283821
Speaker 1: So you got this book, the 'Modern Negro Art' by Cedric Dover [sic. 'American Negro Art,' Cedric Dover], right?
Speaker 2: No, I'm gonna--
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: --it's, that's not right.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Modern Negro Art' is by James [A.] Porter.
Speaker 1: Oh, James Porter, okay.
Speaker 2: The Cedric Dover book is also a negro--it's, it's a negro art, but I, I can't--I'm not remembering right now ['American Negro Art'], but I'll--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's right over on the shelf, right--it's right on the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --thing there.  I'll get it.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: But anyway, it, it was a survey of artists from--which, which was a historical survey from the period of enslavement and right up to the present, which was the early '60s [1960s] by that point.
Speaker 1: Now were you--how did you feel when you took a look at that and--you know, and--
Speaker 2: Well, I--you know, I--first thing I did, you know, how you do--you take--I looked at the book and I said, oh, this book is not well organized and they've got this over here and that part of there, not knowing that Cedric Dover was not a historian.  He was a sociologist, but he was putting this together, but it eventually turned out to be a book I taught from, that I use because of the wealth of photographs of the artists and I just simply taught it from--I just take whatever.  I had the--I had a chronology and I would just take what I needed from that chronology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The information was there, it just wasn't arranged--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.  I just--
Speaker 1: --as art history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, right.  And I was just--but I kept going back to it and it was really--although the other book, the 'Modern Negro Art' had come out in the 1940s.  I just--it just had not come to me.  I just hadn't seen it yet.  And then when I found that book, then I taught from that book and the--and the Dover book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is when you really find out about other black women artists, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Catlett [HistoryMaker Elizabeth Catlett], and I said, oh my goodness, look at this person, look at this person, and, and just start setting things in.  And then I, I realized that only a part of the--only a part of the story was being touched upon and that American art, which I'd taken in college [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] made no mention of these artists at all, none, not even an inkling.  And then I did my own little study of how many books were out--how many books were out or how many within the African American framework--pardon me, within the American framework, that there was absolutely no mention of African American artists, no matter where they had been, you know, or even if you could see influences that other people used in their work.
Story_ID: 283822
Speaker 1: Now what was your work like at this point in time?  What were you--what were your themes and what--.
Speaker 2: Well, my themes at this time became--I was very much a part of music, and so I did themes.  I did Aretha Franklin, I did Otis Redding, I did, you know, large paintings of singers more than musicians, I guess, and works that were very rhythmic.  I didn't--I didn't use any--I didn't visit the continent in that way.  I used--I used imagery of African sculpture in my work, very influenced by [Romare] Bearden.  Bearden's show was here in nineteen sixty--'67 [1967], '68 [1968], he began showing here.
Speaker 1: Here in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And I saw his work and, of course, very influential work.  And then I worked with--starting working with Broadside Press [Detroit, Michigan].  In fact, I think I did the first--I did Dudley's [Dudley Randall] first broadside.  He did a work on John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and I did--I did a--I did the--I wrote--I did a hand letter at Broadside in old--he wanted it in Old English, so I did that.  And then I start working with the press and then doing--and, and that's when I also began collage, you know, probably influenced by Bearden's work and combining images and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 283823
Speaker 1: Are most of the images that you create African American people or--?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you feel--you know, but I've heard some people say, well, you know, I'm just an artist.  I'm creating a universal image--I mean, universal, you know, human being.  I'm--I wanna do--
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.
Speaker 1: --human art and I don't wanna pick--
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.
Speaker 1: --black art (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know.  I know.
Speaker 1: Well, how do you feel about that kinda thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember I wrote the name down, Jimmy Wilson [James Donald Wilson], down early on and he questioned me.  He says, why are your people--why, why aren't you painting African American people, looking at my work from college [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].  Well, the work from college, you're painting models, so if you're not--if they're not African American, then they're not on there, you know, I mean, it's--and I usually did not create out of the blue.  I usually would develop a, a--some sketches first.  I worked--I always worked from sketches.  I always sort of commented on what I was seeing rather than just inventing it in that way.  So I would put together these collages.  I'd go through Ebony and pull out images and put them up and then I would paint--then I would work from them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he said why do you--well, I got incensed at first.  I said, what do you mean and, you know--and then, of course, it just stayed up there.  And I guess, I said, well, yeah, let's move into this.  I mean, all these years I've been schooled in another way, you know?
Speaker 1: So you kinda, kinda awakened to the concept that you could--
Speaker 2: That I could.  I mean, and I didn't--without making--without having to make up a reason for doing it, you know?  I just said, gee, you studied all these artists who've painted whatever they got ready to do.  You paint, you know, without this thing over your head.  So I just--I began working in that way and making comments on, you know, things that I felt that were important or to be highlighted.  So I did Aretha Franklin.  I did Tina [Turner].  I did, you know, images of that, [HistoryMaker] B.B. King.  I did a whole--this was working with Dudley [Randall] and I did--you know, I did a whole series of drawings, ink drawings.  He bought the--he has my drawing of B.B. King.  And so, again, having to under--having to relate to a broader audience that, you know, in terms of those, the broadsides and the cover--book covers, you know.  I mean, you've gotta make it so somebody's gonna wanna buy this book, right?  And so, you know, I had another--you know, I was trying for another appeal in that way.
Story_ID: 283824
Speaker 1: Do you have a certain philosophy of art?
Speaker 2: You have to clarify that.  Well, yes.  I mean, I, I work--I work to inform the viewer/viewers of--how should I say--that--just to inform the viewer of, of the passion--the passion of life.  I mean, lately, I've moved into some other--I do landscapes, but my landscapes are very--they're not pastoral, they're more emotional--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So they're not, not designed just to make you feel, you know--
Speaker 2: No, it's not--it's not decoration.
Speaker 1: --contented and--.
Speaker 2: No, no.  In fact, I always said, I, I always when I would paint--my figures in those earlier works are sort of confrontational.  They look right out at you and they want you to respond to them immediately and to make you--well, to agitate you, actually.
Speaker 1: Agitate you to do something, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  They're to--you know, whatever it is.  I mean, you know, I mean, but just, you know, it's, it's, it's not a picture for repose actually, you know?  And--'cause I always wonder, why do you always put--I'm thinking to myself, why do I always put these people that stare out at people (laughter), you know, and look at them and gaze at them?
Speaker 1: So you, you question your own approach to it sometimes--
Speaker 2: Many--oh, yeah, you do.
Speaker 1: --when you look back and what you did.
Speaker 2: Right.  You look at it.
Speaker 1: Are, are you conscious--are you--well, that would--that implies on some level that you're not fully conscious of what you're doing when you're doing it.  Is there a zone you're in when you're doing your art that you're, you're not really fully conscious that I'm trying--
Speaker 2: Oh, you're not.
Speaker 1: --to do this, I'm trying to do that.
Speaker 2: You're not.  You're never consc- you're not--you're never totally conscious of everything you're doing.  You don't discover things that you've done until later on, you know?  I mean, you're, you're wrestling with moving color around and, you know, you're trying to keep everything moving, and there's some things that come out that you don't really--they don't--you're not in control, you know?  The work becomes your controller--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --after a while.  It was sort of like when I was showing you the boxes that I did, I said, no, these are people that you know.  Nobody knows these people.  Why are you doing it?  But I had to do it.  I mean, I just--I had to, I don't know in the sense of purging, but you--everybody pur- all artists are purging.  It's a sense of, let me--I gotta get this out.  But I had to--this, this history was so precious to me and so wonderful and I realized that it was giving me--I'm feeding from it, too, that I wanted to share it.  So a lot of times, people would come back and they'd say, oh, you know, I've got pictures like this or they'd say, do--are you gonna sell this?  This is your own.  I said, sure, you can, you know--but I--it was relating; other people could relate to it, to the photographs, to this without knowing who these people were, you know, in the same way.  So--but I did--you know, in looking at my work over time, you know, I've seen that it is--you know, I've always wanted it to be confrontational.  I've always wanted it to leave the person a little ill at ease, so to speak or, or, you know, move them to some kind of activity.

Speaker 1: Now you, you mentioned your, your--we were talking about meeting your husband before and I, I think--well, when we were talking before we started the interview, you had a list of musicians that you've met at a certain point--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and these musicians, Albert Ayler, John Coltrane, Archie Shepp, these are people that agitate the listener, you know?
Speaker 2: Right.  And I loved that music.  I mean, I would just--it was--Coltrane played here at the 'Drome [Bowl-o-Drome] out on the West Side [Detroit, Michigan] not far away from where we are.  And I remember--I mean, he--it was Archie Shepp and the other--no, it wasn't--he wasn't Archie Shepp.  The other--
Speaker 1: Pharoah Sanders?
Speaker 2: Pharoah Sanders, right.  He and Pharoah Sanders.  I mean, and they were like just in total conversation.  And then there were so many things I didn't understand.  When I did see him--I saw him in a performance in New York [New York], and, and also there, he had the bells, you know, these big sleigh bells.  I mean--and I said, oh, my--you know, all of these textures and everything and I just--I was just really--I, I never thought I understood music, but I understood this music very, very well.  And so a lot of that was about what I was working on--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --what I am working on.
Speaker 1: Now you, you really had a treat.  You saw Pharoah Sanders and John Coltrane--
Speaker 2: Yes I did.
Speaker 1: --together--.
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  And they pick up those bells, and, and they--you could see they were actually making music.  I mean, and I also--I said, oh, they're actually creating this, right?  You know, I mean, it's like he got--you know, let me go get this, let me pick out the bell, you know, or whatever, but those sleigh--those bells were like incredible 'cause it was a--you know, that, that, that light--that lightness that was--yeah, Pharoah Sanders, I, I saw them all.  Coltrane--I'm--I, I travel on a train and I was going to New York and at the time--this was before Edsel [B.] Reid was my husband, but he was living in New York and I was, was going to New York, and I remember I was on the train, and I had a compartment when I went.  I remember I was walking down the aisle and I saw this man, and I said, gee, he looks familiar, you know.  But it was Coltrane and I didn't realize it, but he was on the train, too, he and Alice Coltrane.  They were both riding this train.  So when Edsel met me at the station and he looked, he said, look, there goes Coltrane.  I said, oh, there he is, you know.  So that's who I had seen, but I--seeing him play in a club and seeing him sitting in a, a seat on a train, you know, that was quite different.  I did not recognize him immediately.
Speaker 1: It was out of context, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was out of context, but it was just thrilling to, to see him.  And Cecil Taylor--you know, I heard--you know, I heard Monk [Thelonious Monk] for the first time and Charlie Mingus [Charles Mingus], just that whole--I just--you know, 'cause my husband was very interested in that, and so we met and so he took me--we went to all those clubs.  And, Albert Ayler, way out in the boondocks, we heard him.  And it was just all very--it just went all along with my art.  You know, it just--it, it all seemed to meld.
Story_ID: 283826
Speaker 1: Now you started really producing during the black power era, too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I guess '66 [1966], '67 [1967], is when that--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: People were talking about culture then.  There was a debate I remember in the pages of Negro Digest and in Black World about whether there's a black aesthetic or not.
Speaker 2: Is there a black aesthetic?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, what came after that was I got a job at Highland Park Community College [Highland Park College; Highland Park Community College, Detroit, Michigan], and I developed a course called black art and music, and I developed a whole curriculum based on that and the chronology of both black art and black--and music from, what 1620 to the present.  So I developed timelines and, you know, and things of that sort so that we could see that the music expressed what the people were doing, you know?  So the music of the '20s [1920s] meant this, the music of the '30s [1930s], the big band, meant this.  It, it talked about another consciousness, reflecting the consciousness of African Americans.  And I was reading--for the--sort of my base, I was reading [Amiri] Baraka, 'Blues People' [LeRoi Jones; Amiri Baraka], so that was sort of the text in a sense for the overall sort of sociological perspective on, on, on black music (unclear) talk about art.
Speaker 1: What you're discussing is how in some ways we--what, what you have done is to--you like link the various artists together--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with one influencing the other.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: You think that's real--I mean--
Speaker 2: I feel, yes.  I did--and I loved working with college students because they had enough background to link--you know, there were some links I brought in, of course, that they didn't know.  They didn't know anything about the art anyway; we were all learning that.  But they could pick up from the current music they were listening to and we--'cause I, I used a lot of that, too, to kinda--we listened to music.  I had records and I would show influences, you know, how this music influenced that, and new forms and, and that kinda thing.
Speaker 1: Recently in New York [New York] about--it was two months ago, I was at a discussion of jazz culture of--in, I guess, in contrast to hip-hop culture.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It was a, a new book, I think Robin Kelley and a group--
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd like to read that.
Speaker 1: --a group in New York produced a book on jazz culture and they were trying deliberately to contrast it with hip-hop culture--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a culture--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --music, a style of dress, a style--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --language, all, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, all of it.
Speaker 1: All of it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right now, my son--because he began doing a lot of--he's hip-hop and he's painting--his paintings were reflecting, very much engrossed.  He did a lot of writing on hip-hop and, and when he was in school, and, so--and, and the--and the hip-hop artists and musicians I should say.  And--but now, he's--as he's listening to music that he heard all the time in growing up, he's rediscovering the bebop.  He's--or the jazz culture and understanding the, you know, as you said, the two--the different styles, the dress.  When I think of when we went to see [John] Coltrane that time, the guys that were in there listening to Coltrane and their dress and, of course, if you go to a hip-hop performance, it's, you know, of course dress and everything else is quite different. And the writing--I guess, the writings between the two.
Story_ID: 283827
Speaker 1: In teaching [at Highland Park College; Highland Park Community College, Detroit, Michigan], though, I found different--I think it was Harold--it wasn't Harold Greenberg.  I do have the book, it's called 'The Vanguard Artist' [Bernard Rosenberg and Norris Fliegel].  It's a book, and it's a, a book written by a white artist, white writer, and it was--it's a old book of interviews and it was written in the '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Written about the, the artists that played for Vanguard Records [New York, New York] or, or, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The--no, no, no, just, just vanguard artists, those artists that weren't within the mainstream.  And how they--and these artists were interviewed.  So they had one--about various things, but one whole chapter was on Negro artists and what is so interesting is that they didn't--the writer didn't interview any Negro artists for the chapter on Negro art.
Speaker 2: He just--he just wrote it (laughter).
Speaker 1: No.  He interviewed--he interviewed non-blacks about what they thought about black artists (laughter).  And I would read--those would be things that I would read to my class so that they would understand the full import of what is--I mean, you've got these, these attitudes out here, so that's why, you know, I mean, these are things you have to be aware of.  We'll just say it that way.  So the, the--.
Speaker 2: It's like a--it's like a conversation that a--where two adults are talking about a kid and the kid is standing there--
Speaker 1: Standing there, right.
Speaker 2: --and nobody asks the kid 'cause he's a--
Speaker 1: No, doesn't ask him.  This is--what does he think?
Speaker 2: --he's, he's--well, he's a kid--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  He's, he's a kid--
Speaker 2: He's not--he shouldn't have a--
Speaker 1: No, he doesn't--right.
Speaker 2: He doesn't have--
Speaker 1: So they would say, well, do you know--tell me about--what do you think about African or Negro art at the time?  Well, he says, I, I--oh, yeah, I have a lot.  I know a lot of Negro artists, but, you know, they just never seem to quite--and they'd just go down the list.  They're never quite skillful enough, this one would say--and somehow, somehow it just--their art just doesn't make it.  Well what it doesn't mean--what it means is that the guy was--is painting black imagery and I can't get with it (laughter).  He's painting--you know, I'm painting what I wanna paint (laughter) but I--you know, the--it's--it was obvious, he--the subject matter was, was never quite what it should be, but it--they didn't say that, but you had to read between the lines.  But these, these--this, this particular book is wild.  I was asked to talk with a group of attorneys who this--this guy's an attorney and a collector and he wanted his class to have more of a understanding, become more sensitive to the whole area of art and, you know, in terms of they've got a client who's got a--you know, litigation or whatever.  So when I read this, this chapter, I, you know, handed--copied and gave them all, you know, a copy and everything and they said, this is incredible, you know, I mean, the logic.  There was no logic to their reasoning, but they had a whole--I mean, they have a chapter in the book.  What--why, why put the chapter in the book?  Leave it out.  So you would put it in there to continually undermine, which is all I could see.  You know what I'm saying?  Why would I--you ask me all this stuff?  But it was altering that--it was sort of their--it was very reactionary.  It was reactionary to the movement, you know.  So these were some things that--you know, that, that came up and that were important.
Story_ID: 283828
Speaker 1: In the '80s [1980s], [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell, the artist, Howardena Pindell, did a whole thing on--
Speaker 2: How do you spell--
Speaker 1: Howardena?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--yeah, yeah, I guess so.  The whole name, I guess, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Howardena Pindell, P-I-N-D-E-L-L.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: New York [New York] artist.  And she did a whole--Howardena spelled just the way it sounds.  She did a whole--she researched the ten major museums and galleries in New York.  She called it 'Art Crow/Jim Crow' [Howardena Pindell] and--Mr. Crow. No E (laughter).
Speaker 2: My grandfather added the E (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did--right (laughter).  Was he James?
Speaker 2: No, he had a son named James actually--
Speaker 1: James--did he (laughter)?
Speaker 2: --that they called Bud.
Speaker 1: Bud, oh, I guess so (laughter).  But anyway, she listed either all of the art--the artists that they had shown over the--so many years, Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York], the Metropolitan Museum [New York, New York], Brooklyn Museum [New York, New York], she listed all of these, and for whatever, ten years, whatever, five years, whatever the time was, they had no--there was--there were no shows that were--that--at the time, she had artists of color and in the, the galleries, the same, no artists of color at all, and it's still pretty much that way.  But, of course, on the other end, African American artists have, you know, and say--well, do it yourself, you know.  This, this is not a point of entry and don't worry about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's not important really.
Speaker 2: But hasn't the struggle been for the last, I guess, since the late '60s [1960s] for people to--well, to not only create their own venues but also to get into these other big--these museums and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  And it--and it--and it has--that has happened.  It has happened.  But very important has been us creating our own venues and creating clientele, and making things possible for people to own work and, you know, you know, just--the, the, the market--there's still that big market out there that'll--that's always--not so much is always gonna be there and you won't get into it--the waiting.  The only way you get into that market is for the controller to control it, you know?
Story_ID: 283829
Speaker 1: Off camera, we were talking--I was talking about the new boom in black folk art from the South.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know if you go into the House of the Blues, for instance in, in Chicago [Illinois], it's filled with Negro--black folk art from down South--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and coffee table books written by--it's a whole movement now about black folk art and we're just discussing similar, the Haitian art, African art, people--usually white art dealers going to the regions and pick up this work for next to nothing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then it's--now it's pricey.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, it's about the market.  The centers of the art market are in New York [New York], London [England], and, well, Cologne [Germany] or wherever--Germany, wherever it would--wherever it would be.  So, it's the United States, England, and Germany.  It's still the core of the art market and it's probably the core of all other markets as well.  And so in terms of African American artists, contemporary African American artists, that is not something, thankfully, that we have--that is something, I should say, that we have become involved in and enveloped and beginning to develop a market, a strong market with initiatives and so on.  But reactions to that are that these--they're not interested unless they're gonna control it, so the white dealers who are not gonna have African American art, they're not gonna do that, but they're going to--they will develop a market in terms of the folk art, create big books, and have endless supply and, and continually to develop that.  They want the aesthetic.  The aesthetic--the aesthetic excites them but they're not interested in it unless they're--you know, it's in their hands.  For example, I compare the work say of [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam and Frank Stella.  Sam Gilliam is by far the more inventive, the more creative, but there's not one book, there's not one publication--there are catalogs, but there's not one publication out on this guy, on Sam Gilliam.  He's a brilliant, brilliant artist, but I'm sure the Frank Stellas would stack up.  And Frank Stella usually stays sort of in one vein of sculptural composition.  And--but he's not--I mean, Sam, as I said, is by far--and that would be a contemporary, his contemporary.  And you'll find the same with [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt.  Richard Hunt is a, you know, wealthy man according to what he's done, but there is not one major book.  Rizzoli, Abrams [Harry N. Abrams, Inc.], whoever all these other people are that do the art books, there's nothing out on Richard Hunt.  There's not--he's in catalogs.  There's no book out on Richard Hunt.  [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis produced--even [Richmond] Barthe--a catalog for when they traveled abroad and, and she developed an exhibition, but nothing.  And that was one of the things that had come out of CONFABA [Conference on the Functional Aspects of Black Art].
Story_ID: 283830
Speaker 1: Off camera (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tell us about CONFABA [Conference on the Functional Aspects of Black Art] and attending that, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.  CONFABA was 1970, a consortium of artists and art historians that was pulled together by [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson at--in Evanston, Illinois, Northwestern University.  And it happened to have taken place the same weekend of Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio], the Kent State--
Speaker 2: The shootings--
Speaker 1: --shootings there.
Speaker 2: --where the National Guard shot the war protestors and--
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --students.
Speaker 1: And so they canceled--you know, they canceled--college campuses, you know, all over that area were closed, but our meeting was scheduled, so they let us have the meeting, the meeting continued.  So we were--we had all of Northwestern campus totally, you know, but it was that weekend, which was sort of prophetic, too.  But it was at this meeting that we got together and said, well, listen, here we are.  We've got writers, we've got this, how are we gonna disseminate all this material, all this African American art?  Education, publications, history, how are we gonna get this out?  And we talked about at the time, you know, AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and how they had done that whole series of prints, and they wanted to be able to put it in the hands of the people for, you know, not expensively, and so they were selling them very inexpensively.  But ultimately, what would the big picture be?  So we were charged with going out into the world and developing this big picture.  And as a result, you know, I told you the chapter--we, we developed--the National Conference of Artists [NCA], of course was developed but our chapter started and we sort of based it on those ideas. [HistoryMaker] A.B. Spellman was at the conference.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he said something about--
Speaker 1: Muhal Richard Abrams.  The whole--I mean, it was music--it was just--it was sort of really pulling that whole--Larry Neal was there.  He was in one of the--was on one of the panels, one of the group's task force.  And so we really had wonderful minds there, sitting down talking over a week, three or four days, and really, what are we gonna come up--what are we gonna do?  And we did it.  I mean, I think it was just a brilliant conference.  And it was reported in the, the quarterly coming out of International Review of African American Art, there is an issue, was about three years ago, that covers that conference that they published.
Speaker 2: It's like a retrospective of that conference.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  With photos from that time.  My husband [Edsel B. Reid] had an article in that--from that period.  But producing the, the art at that time.  But in its results, you know, many books--we've got many, many, many more books that have been--you know, art history books that have come out and so it was a--it was--it was really--it was just really brilliant.
Story_ID: 283831
Speaker 1: Now currently, you're, you're the president of the--of the--of the Michigan--
Speaker 2: Chapter.
Speaker 1: --chapter of the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --National Conference of Artists [NCA]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which include--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --many great artists--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --including [HistoryMaker] Jon [Onye] Lockard and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and others.
Speaker 2: I'm also--I'm also the supervisor for art education for the Detroit Public Schools.
Speaker 1: And what, what state is--what's the state of art education in the Detroit Public Schools today?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--I, I--it's in pretty good hands to the degree that, you know, they're cutting programs everywhere it's--in terms of art.  But what we've tried to maintain is a strong support program in terms of doing really effective professional development for our teachers.  [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis' book, art African American--'African American Art and Artists' is in every high school.  We have reference books on African American artists.  We have a wonderful curriculum series that is very inclusive of all cultures.  And so that's what I think is, is, is really important, that the teachers understand and--'cause the kids do the art.  Also, we're getting ready for our 68th annual student exhibition at the Detroit Institute of Arts [Detroit, Michigan], which opens in two days.  But the museum has supported the student artwork for all these years and it will continue.  It's always a real strong, you know, education program there as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  No how've--how have--has the Detroit Board of Education--have, have the schools embraced like new forms of, of visual art from I know like spray paint art and, and some of the other--.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, yeah, we have a lot of--we have--we have--the materials that are available are broad depending on whatever that budget is.  But, yeah, we use a lot--we do--we're very broad in our materials, the things that the students do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A broad use of materials, you know?
Speaker 1: I know in some towns, spray cans are banned from--
Speaker 2: Well, they are.  That's not a good one, but you can get the same effect.  You can use another method and get the same effect that you would with the spray.
Speaker 1: Okay, so styles are incorporated but not necessarily the cans, so it's--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  I'm saying you can get that, that same overall feeling of, you know, color dispersal by using other materials.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah, there is a--yeah, we certainly support using, you know, new materials and different ways of, of using--we have a--you know, fiber program that we want to kind of reinstall in our schools.  We are not advocates of--I'm not a Magic Marker advocate (laughter), you know, piece of paper and get Magic Marker.  Yeah, that's the--you don't have to have any skills for that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think even the, the, the artists, I mean, that, that do, do walls and they really do 'em, they, they, they look down on that too.  It's like a primitive kind of expression, a tagging of a name.  That's not a--really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, right.  And, and the markers, see it's, it's--basically, it's ink and you can't mix it.  You can't blend it.  You don't have to have any dexterity to get--it's really not--they don't--if you teach--if you--if you do use an ink marker--I won't use Magic Marker.  If you use an ink marker, it is--it's still ink and you--it still requires a certain dexterity of application.  But usually it's just used to fill in color, which means you negate painting, you negate crayon, you negate pastel, you negate all of these other materials because you've--you got this gorgeous color here, but that's not--that's not--. And to say nothing of learning to cut and, you know, get those, you know, getting fine lines and to, to be able to enhance the imagery that--you know, that you wanna get across.
Story_ID: 283832
Speaker 1: What are you working on now in terms of your own art?  What kinds of things are you doing right now?
Speaker 2: Well, right now, I'm working on the ancestor series.  I'm developing that further.  I'm working on a--
Speaker 1: Now, what is that, now?  Describe what you're doing.
Speaker 2: The ancestors?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The ancestor series--well, actually it came from a--an exhibition I was invited to be in about--I guess about fifteen years ago now called "Ancestors Known and Unknown."  It was the organization called National Women of Color and they had, had artists from all over.  Faith Ringgold was one of the artists, Clarissa Sligh, Carol Bayard were artists who helped compose this project that traveled nationally, and the first one was a book project where you collaborated with another artist and you did a book work.  The second one was the box work.  You had to do--whatever you were gonna do, you had to do it in a box format, and they wanted it to be about the ancestors.  So that's when I started on my box work and used the photographs from my own family and incorporated as--into the boxes by covering it with the images and so on.  So my work that's coming up, I'm gonna do some big paintings on combinations of, you know, ancestry and new thoughts.
Story_ID: 283833
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That we disengage ourself from those--from those images that--I guess I'm trying--that we disengage ourselves from any image that will not make us free and wholesome and caring for our children, that we disengage ourselves from those images that continue to satirize, you know, all that we do.  And I guess I don't wanna--one thing is gonna be you gotta turn off the television, quick (laughter), quick (laughter), and just stop and--it's, it's an education.  I mean, just turn it off.  And I'm--not that I'm--I--it's--and I won't say return to 'cause, you know, we're, we're moving--we're moving forward, but just to, you know, maybe--and maybe even readdress what's positive.  You know, I mean, you're gonna ask somebody what's positive now, I mean, and what's--what theirs--what's positive is totally negative, you know?  Education is, is still foremost--of foremost importance in our community.  And--but I think the whole issue of personal relationships and, and all that.  We may have to even stop reading certain kinds of magazines for--I mean, we have to know when we're being had, so to speak, and that the certain aspects of popular media, you know, are just sort of like part of the story kinda thing.  So I look at a lot of material that--you know, that, that we are given as our--that should be our goals or I should say as our models, you know?  What's a family like, what's a this like, what's--you know, at one time it was mother daddy this, mother daddy, you know.  Now it's all of the--you know, all of the extensions.  And rather than just saying, well, that's just the way it is, I think we have to say, well, it is the way it is, but it's not helping, and we're just gonna have to become a lot more aggressive about reclaiming our, our families and, and the people that, you know, that are around us.
Story_ID: 283834
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  Now, you have--how did your--how did your parents [Celia Trotter Woodson and Claude Woodson] react to you becoming an, an artist, first of all, and then I want you to tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: Well, my, my family, my parents, reacted really very positively about me being an artist.  You know, they thought it was good and they, they supported me in every way.  I know when I did tell my dad that I was--I came home and I said I'm dropping out of art education and I'm just gonna go into art, I'm just gonna paint, and he says, yeah, well, how will you--well, how will you support yourself?  And I said, well, you're right.  I'll go back and I'll finish in art education (laughter).  But I, I enjoy teaching.  I've always loved teaching.  And I have always--I found that it was a way--in teaching, it's kind of a way of working with some of your own processes, you know, in working as an artist.  But, no, they were always very, very, very pleased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they didn't have any fears about, oh, you're gonna be an artist or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they never, never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, never.
Speaker 1: Now you have a--you, you have two sons--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and tell us about your sons.
Speaker 2: Well, I have two sons, Khari [Benton] Reid and Senghor [Elwood] Reid.
Speaker 1: And Khari is K-H--
Speaker 2: A-R-I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're both--we mentioned--we were talking about Senegalese.  Yeah, well my husband--I don't know, did I mention my husband's name, Edsel [B.] Reid?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Edsel.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Now, is that--is he named after Edsel Ford or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.  They worked out there.  Everybody worked at the plant, so his dad named him (laughter)--had named him Edsel.  They named him Edsel.  But Edsel was my--sort of my counterpart in so many ways in terms of--I know you asked about the boys, I'll get back.  But just my counterpart in terms of--I talked about the music and all of those things, 'cause he was the one that sought out the CONFABA [Conference on the Functional Aspects of Black Art] connection and was an archivist, and he's developed wonderful archives on African American art.  Because he, too, when he went to the university, he went to Arizona State [University, Tempe, Arizona], and he went to the library and asked--he wanted to know, was very adamant about art at the time, the art of his time, and he went and asked the librarian where's--I wanted to see the section on African American art.  She said there's no such thing.  And so that became (laughter)--needless to say, his path was set after that.  And so he was a very--you know, he, he did some art, but his--he said his careers were short in art and music.  He put his drums aside early on and--although he had gotten a scholarship offer for timpani, you know, coming out of high school, but he was an athlete as well.  But he, he did a great deal for--you know, in terms of my career, supporting me in my career and, and said that he wanted a son--when Khari--Senghor, the youngest, became very interested in art, he said, well, then he'll be an artist.  I mean, he had no qualms about making a living or any of that.  He just said, he--don't worry about that.  Just be an artist.  So, Senghor is an artist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And Khari is a collector.
Speaker 2: Khari is a collector.  Yes, he's, he's gone out and made nice purchases on his own.  They're both teachers, though.  Senghor is in art and Khari is getting his certification in science.

Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Probably would have bought that Jacob Lawrence earlier.  My husband [Edsel B. Reid] took me (laughter)--he took me to a show in New York [New York] in 1966 and it was in the Village [Greenwich Village], a gallery in the Village, and I remember going--I remember they were being very dark.  He tells me that--he reminded me that they were three hundred dollars.  I said, "Edsel, there's no way those were three hundred dollars, that--those works."  He said they were three hundred.  I remember them being like six [hundred dollars].  I didn't have any money.  But I remember not being really excited about them 'cause that was part of my years when I--you know, I, I knew them and I'd looked at them, but they weren't bright in color.  I don't remember them being bright in color, but if I could revisit one thing, I would've gotten two of those Lawrences if I had to--if I didn't have anything to eat or wear for two years (laughter).  We've since--we've since purchased Lawrences, but not paintings.  These were small gouaches as I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would've done that differently.  But by and large, I've, you know, sort of followed the path.
Story_ID: 283836
Speaker 1: Now if someone wanted to see your work today in Detroit [Michigan], I mean where would they go?  Now how--are, are you--have you taken advantage of those Percent For Art projects and--where, artworks go in major public--
Speaker 2: Oh, I have certainly--
Speaker 1: --buildings?
Speaker 2: --applied (laughter).  I've said, I had my--for quite a few years, I had--my slides were registered with the--in Washington [D.C.] with that.  But, yes, I've, I've been able to receive some commissions from that.  And--but if someone wanted to see my work, they can go to the Sherry Washington Gallery [Detroit, Michigan].  I have work--
Speaker 1: That's here in Detroit, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For accessing work, but to see my work, I have work in many of the Detroit Public Schools collections.  I have work at the Detroit Institute of Arts [Detroit, Michigan] and at the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York], I have one work there; I'm in that collection.
Story_ID: 283837
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite work of all the things you've done?  Do you have a favorite work?  You might not, but I'm--I, I feel I must ask anyway.
Speaker 2: Well, I did--in nineteen--what was that, '60 [1960], could've been '70 [1970], I did--no, it was--yeah, '69 [1969] or '70 [1970], '69 [1969] dash '70 [1970], I did a large work of Otis Redding and I recently saw it.  A friend of mine bought it and I was recently in her home and it looked very, very, very good.  I mean--you know, when you don't see something for a long time and you go back and you look at it and you'll say, oh, I should've done this or that.  It was still--'cause it was--it was a monumental size because, of course, he was monumental.  And I--that was--I felt that was a very strong work.  And I have another painting that I--that I did that I really enjoyed and it was by Aretha--of--it's a painting of a young Aretha Franklin.  When I say young, it was--I did it from a photograph, but it was kind of an unusual one of her in very passionate kind of a structure.
Story_ID: 283838
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, again, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: In terms of art?
Speaker 1: Or anything, yeah.  Everything.
Speaker 2: Everything.  I--well, I guess I consider my legacy--well, I hope my legacy is that of someone who placed art at the center of, of African American culture and that, that art--and that art must be always part and parcel of any--you know, of our culture.  It's certainly the, the thing that leads us to know what any culture is about.  The great cultures of--cultures of Egypt are only known because of the art that's there.  It's not because of any, you know, paper, not even so to say paper writings.  I mean, whatever was there.  But it's, it's, it's a monumental gaze that we know, you know, it's--that, that these structures are there or, or if it's--if we go around the world in any culture, the architecture, the church--you know, whatever those forms are, but it's, it's that art that makes you--that, that gives clarity.  And I feel that my--you know, my legacy or my contribution--I'm hoping that my contribution has been that it must be at the forefront.
Story_ID: 283483
Speaker 1: Ma'am, is there any question or subject that we haven't covered that you--that you want to address that we haven't asked about before I, I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I--there's so many areas that I think are--I, I guess--you know, one is just the, the production of the artist and what--well, just the--just the importance of that endeavor of creating and devising and working on, you know, visual material that will enhance our lives.  And I just--you know, the--I think noth- there--there's not enough of that that's being shown or dealt with.  You know, it's still sort of--even though we--you know, we say these images are important because of, you know, certainly in, you know, in American culture, they're not important in terms of, you know, being, as I was--just said before, at the center.  But their alms should have important--and they do.  They have--there are, you know, a lot of things that are important, but there just should be some very essential concepts, visual concepts that people should live with, should need--should need to have.
Story_ID: 283484
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as an artist, painter.  And I have some favorite--you didn't ask me about musicians, but I have some favorite musicians.  And, and as I listen to their music, I will--I want my art to somehow equate with the response that I give, you know, with the music.  For example, we'll just say Stevie Wonder.  I mean, there's certain songs, there's certain things, there's certain quality of--well, there--I guess they're all performances, but a quality of performance, a peak, a range that he achieves in any number of songs, you know, that I just said, if I--I want my painting, I want this, I want--I'm gonna push this painting.  I want it to be that--you know, of that quality, not necessarily the quality of another artwork because--'cause I--you know, I feel some things are touched there that because they're--you know, it's another sensory experience.  And then of course, there's Etta James, so--and I listen a lot to her, so when I'm working, I want certain works that she does, certain songs that I want my work to have that same magnitude.  So this--right now, the next works, you asked me what was I gonna be doing.  My next works are--I'm, I'm, I'm--these are some things I'm gonna be trying to achieve, that kind of brilliance.  I guess I'm, I'm trying to move towards brilliance.  Not brilliance within the concept or within the context of what I'm--you know, what I'm working on, but I wanna move to--I wanna move to that height.
