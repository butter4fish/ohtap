Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are four lightweight, shallow questions that I ask that have that only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I guess I would have to say that it's barbecue ribs.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really, but I do like to travel, so I like to go to different places.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last question in this series, the last shallow question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I can remember it exactly, but my grandmother told me that you should always keep in mind this following phrase, and she told me that it's okay to be accustomed to being the center of attention, but you should never let it go to your head.
Story_ID: 260803
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history now.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Julian Mell] side.  First, we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Thelma, T-H-E-L-M-A, middle name Webb, W-E-B-B, Mell, M-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Webb is her maiden name, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born May 18th, 1926, in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about your mother's side of the family, I mean about the ancestors first?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's side of the family, my grandmother [Clara Webb] told us a lot about her siblings.  We knew, we knew them and, and her parents.  My grandmother's mother died when she was very young.  So most of the information we have about that side of the family came from my grandmother's sisters, who were older.  She, my grandmother was the youngest in that family.
Speaker 1: So your great aunts--
Speaker 2: As, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --as a lawyer, we only answer the question asked.  And I think that's (laughter), that's--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --kind of funny to--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --I think they wanted me to talk a little bit more, but okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, all right, are there are any stories about your ancestors?  I mean did they come, were they always in Cleveland?  I mean did, did the come--
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother was born--
Speaker 1: --was there a story about--
Speaker 2: --in Trenton, Tennessee, which is about as far south and west as you can get in Tennessee before you go over to the next state in that little corner.  Their father actually--
Speaker 1: That's near Louisiana [sic.] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Their father was, had a college education.  He was one of the first people to go through school.  And apparently he had a drugstore, kind of a pharmacy dime store in Trenton, Tennessee.  The family story is that he was murdered.  And you know, back in those days, people didn't particularly care what happened to the, the black people in town.  And he, they were fairly wealthy for, for blacks at that time.  So this is maybe like 1907 when that happened.  But they owned a home, and a lot of different kinds of things happened, but some point the house burned down.  And my grandmother and her sisters came north one at a time after that.  So my grandmother went through school and became a teacher.  She got a teaching certificate.
Speaker 1: Now where did she go to school?
Speaker 2: A small college in, in Tennessee for teachers, for, as they call, the colored teachers at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was teaching in a little one school, one how, one-room schoolhouse in Tennessee and decided that was not for her.  And since her two older sisters and older brother had already come north, she decided to follow them.  So, in the early '20s [1920s], all of them had left Trenton and ended up in Cleveland by a variety of different routes.  My, her eldest sister, my Aunt Lilly [ph.], actually was at the Fostoria [Ohio] glass-blowing plant [Seneca Glass Company] in Ohio, near, near Toledo [Ohio].  She did that--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --for a while.  But eventually they all went to, to Cleveland.  And my grandmother came up in the early '20s [1920s], and they all stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there any, any talk in the family about as to what, what happened to your, your, it's your great-grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What, what happened down there?  Was it, you, was it just--
Speaker 2: They said there was some jealousy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on the part of some of the white citizens in town about this, this prosperity, because apparently they had a car as well, so he was doing quite well and was educated.  But of course, nobody really wanted to elaborate very much on that.  But my grandmother always loved books. And after her mother died, and I don't even know if we ever knew what my great-grandmother's name was.  When she died, the grandmother raised the girls.  And my grandmother was the valedictorian of her high school class.  So she always was, loved books and loved reading and loved learning, and she certainly instilled that in my mother.  And since she lived with us when I was growing up, she assisted us in our studies and was very, very supportive of us becoming very educated.  So it was, it was a very enlightened childhood I think in the sense that all of the girls were encouraged to get as much education as you possibly can and were encouraged to work.
Story_ID: 260804
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Thelma Webb Mell] talk about growing up, about, did she basically grow up in, in--
Speaker 2: In Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: --in Cleveland, yeah, right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she grew up in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what, what, what part of town did she grow up in?
Speaker 2: She grew up on the east side in the Central-Scovill [Cleveland, Ohio] area--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Cleveland and tells the stories about how when she was a little girl in the early '20s [1920s], and during the [Great] Depression everybody as poor.  So it was a very integrated neighborhood.  Everybody lived and went to school right there.  It was only during the New Deal that you started seeing the white families moving out to other homes and the area become, starting to become segregated with, with, with blacks.  But they had a very good education, Cleveland public schools.  I had some of her high school papers (laughter), but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she go to East Tech [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio], over there or--
Speaker 2: No, my father [Julian Mell] went to East Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to Kennard Junior High School [Cleveland, Ohio] and I think it was Central High [School, Cleveland].  But the boys went to East Tech.
Speaker 1: They, they had that famous basketball team--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  For many years I guess they're all, there've, there've always been like a basketball--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, there always have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Even when I was in high school [Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio], East Tech had a really incredible basketball team and sports program.
Story_ID: 260805
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, actually there is.  My mother [Thelma Webb Mell] was also very studious.  And all of her girlfriends from high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] were dating, and she wasn't.  So, those were the days when the various gospel singers would go around to the various churches and have programs on the Sundays.  So my mother would have to go by herself 'cause nobody was there.  They were all dating.  So one of her good friends said we have somebody that we want you to meet, said you remember him; you remember Julian Mell.  And--(unclear)--said oh yeah, him, 'cause he was fresh, is what she said.  I said what do you mean when she said fresh?  (Unclear)--says well, when she was in junior high, you know, they had the little books that you would write things in.  And she had given him her book in junior high, and he wrote: you are too sweet to be forgotten, and she thought that was fresh and snatched her book back.  So now (laughter) he's in the [U.S. military] service, and she was in college at that time, and they went roller skating.  He refused to put on skates, and so my mother would roller skate around (laughter).  And when she fell, he would come over and hand her a handkerchief (laughter).  So, that was their first date (laughter).  So, but they eventually, you know, worked it out, and got married, and started the family in Cleveland [Ohio].
Story_ID: 260806
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Julian, middle name Cooper, C-O-O-P-E-R, Mell, M-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Cleveland [Ohio] also, July 24th, 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay, and now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, the, my father's side of the family has had a family reunion every year for sixty-five years (laughter), so we know a lot about that side of the family.  They've actually written little books about each one of the original sisters, the Benbows from Alabama.  And we know which sister we're direct descendant from.
Speaker 1: How, how do, how do you spell that name?
Speaker 2: B-E-N-B-O-W.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think I've even heard about them from, from Alabama.  What part of Alabama were they from?
Speaker 2: Was it Anniston, Alabama, in that area, around there?
Speaker 1: Okay, where that bus was burnt up back in--
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they have a family reunion every year.  And--
Speaker 1: So how far back do they go?  Do they go back to, could they trace themselves back through before the Civil War or--
Speaker 2: They go up to the Civil War.  And they're kind of fuzzy on the dates, because of course, they're all estimates about when they thought somebody might, how old someone might have been at this time because of other things.  But they really kept, kept in touch with people over the years.  And every July, the first weekend in July there's a family reunion.  It travels around, as different parts of the family will sponsor it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories from, from that kind of history there must be some stories associated with--
Speaker 2: Well, the story about--
Speaker 1: --there are some real old stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I mean the story about my father's parents and why they came north was that they were very prosperous farmers.  They had a very good farm, and they had a car.  And my grandmother apparently was getting out of the car, backing out of the car and stepped on a white man's foot, and it started this big fight.  So they decided that perhaps it was time for them to go north.  And that's how they ended coming north.
Speaker 1: That's both sides of the, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter) both sides of the family.
Speaker 1: It's less tragic on this side, but still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but still they had to give up everything they had there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to come.
Speaker 1: You know, the pressure of--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --racism--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on both sides.
Speaker 2: So, my grandmother's name was Rachel [ph.].  She died when I was--that's actually my great-grandmother.  Sorry, this is my great-grandmother and grandfather.  But I don't remember my father's grandmother that well.  But my grandmother, my father's mother's name was Lena [Bryant Mell].
Speaker 1: Now that's the woman that stepped on the white man's--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --foot?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Rachel was.
Speaker 1: Rachel was, okay.
Speaker 2: That, that was the, the great--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the great-grandmother--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was the one.
Speaker 1: All right, the great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Any other stories on that side?  With, with family reunion history like that, it would seem to be a lot of stories that--
Speaker 2: You know, it, it interesting, the kinds of things that, that people have done, the kinds of jobs people have had, how they all kind of moved from one industry to the next.  They all worked at Youngstown Sheet and Tube [Company, Youngstown, Ohio] and the plants there until they closed.  But they've been very hardworking people, very talented people, very artistic people.  Over the years, they've, they've made some beautiful handwork kinds of things, but very creative and just very persistent about making sure that the children were, got the education they wanted and that they were able to work.
Story_ID: 260807
Speaker 1: Did your father [Julian Mell] talk about growing up in, in Cleveland [Ohio] and what it was like for him?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  My father is the oldest son.  His father and a sister, whose name was Patricia [ph.], died in, died of pneumonia I think or influenza.  There was some, in the early '30s [1930s], so he died fairly young.  And my father had three brothers and a sister, so my grandmother [Lena Bryant Mell] ended up having to raise these children essentially on her own.  She had a house for a while but really, didn't have really the skills really to keep it.  She worked as a domestic, and, but she did okay.  She did okay.  She always made sure that the boys went to school.  And there was a story that my father was always very good at drawing.  And a social worker came by the house to check on the children and saw this drawing that my father had done of a spaceship.  I guess this is during the days of Buck Rogers, you know, and--(unclear)--this, this at the movies.  And the social walk--worker wanted to take my father and put him in school 'cause he thought, she thought that he had a lot of talent, and my grandmother said no.  She didn't want him to be taken away from the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he, the social worker actually wanted to take him away from the family and put him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --really take him actually--
Speaker 2: Take him.
Speaker 1: --out of the fam--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause she said I showed this, this to someone and indicated that he had a lot of talent.  But my father was always very good at drawing and mechanical kinds of things.  And that's how he went to East Tech [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] and got all A's.  When the war [World War II, WWII] broke out he enlisted, and he was too young, but he lied about his age, was a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps].  So I have some nice pictures of him in his uniform and all.  This is when he and my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] started dating (laughter) when he was--
Speaker 1: Did he pursue drafting or art or anything in the--
Speaker 2: You know, he's kept it up, his interest in the arts over the years.  And he's had a couple of displays of his art at the community college.  He's taking classes and that kind of thing.  But he never really pursued it beyond that, but he keeps up with it.  And I have some lovely things that he's made, from scrimshaw pieces to, and jewelry to different kinds of prints that he's done.  So, he kept up the artistic side of the, the Bryants and the Benbows.
Story_ID: 260808
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Julian Mell] do for a living, or how did your, your family, you know, earn a living?
Speaker 2: He became a policeman, Cleveland Police Department [Cleveland Division of Police, Cleveland, Ohio].  He was one of the first black detect, persons to become a homicide detective in Cleveland [Ohio].  Before he became a detective, when he was patrolman, he did undercover work in vice for the police department.  He has a whole lot of citations about his work.  And after the homicide department, he became certified as a scientific investigate, investigation detective.  So they do the fingerprints and all the, the fancy stuff you see on TV now, he was doing back in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, now what did your mother [Thelma Webb Mell] do?
Speaker 2: She was a retired elementary school principal for Cleveland public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She graduated from Heidelberg College [Heidelberg University] in, in Tiffin, Ohio.  And so I still have the letter that they sent her, giving her a, a scholarship for two hundred dollars, which was tuition, room, and board, and books (laughter) back in, what, 1944 or something (laughter).  So, things have changed, but.  And so she became a teacher and eventually became a principal of elementary schools.
Story_ID: 260809
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is, it must have been late May, early June, because all of the leaves were out on the trees.  I lived on Ashbury [Avenue], a street in Cleveland [Ohio].  And at the time, they all were still red brick.  And the oak trees formed a canopy over the street.  But the way that the sunrise came up, the sun hit just below the leaves, and it was a beautiful street.  And my father [Julian Mell] and I were walking down the street.  We were going to the store early in the morning.  And that's my first memory, is holding my father's hand walking down this beautiful street.  It was very peaceful.  It was a beautiful day.
Story_ID: 260810
Speaker 1: Now do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --an old brother and a younger brother.  My older brother [Julian Mell III] was born in 1949 and graduated from Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  He was a track star and played the trumpet in, in, in high school.  And he became a teacher when he got out of college.  But you know, this is during the Vietnam [War] era.  And he was in the Pershing Rifles, which was a prestigious ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] branch for the [U.S.] Army, and eventually went into the, the [U.S.] Army Reserves as an officer.  So he's a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserves and did time--I guess I can't quite say time, but you know, served in [Operation] Desert Storm [Gulf War].  And after September 11th [2001; 9/11], he was called back to serve as well.  So he's back home now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did tease him--
Speaker 1: Did he go to Iraq--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, actually what my brother does is he's sort of a computer specialist.  And the kinds of things that he did or what he does is to make sure that the supplies are properly ordered and shipped to where they need to be.  So, I guess that's called making sure that ordinance and all of the kinds of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a quartermaster, yeah.
Speaker 2: Quartermaster, that kind of thing is, is what he does.  So he was actually stationed in Hawaii for about eighteen months after September 11th, because that was the shipping point actually for Bosnia I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now and, and you've got another brother too--
Speaker 2: My younger brother--
Speaker 1: --a younger brother, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was born in '59 [1959], and he name's Bryan [Mell].  Bryan is a professional photographer in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and has done some exhibitions of his work.  He does black and white photography is his specialty, and he does some really beautiful things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So my younger brother got all the artistic stuff, and my older brother has the kind of organizational skills, that my father [Julian Mell] has.
Story_ID: 260811
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, this being the Christmas season that was a big (laughter) sight.  The, we had wonderful Christmases.  And even though I was born in December, my parents [Thelma Webb Mell and Julian Mell] always made sure that I had a separate birthday party, even though it's only ten days before Christmas.  So we'd first have my birthday party, and we always had cake; we always had ice cream; we always had a nice dinner and hats.  My mother, with her elementary school background, would make little paper hats with the crepe paper and all.  We'd have a family celebration.  And at Christmas my [maternal] grandmother [Clara Webb] would bake, and so the house would be filed with the smells of her original recipes being cooked.  And the house would be decorated beautifully, and we'd always get to participate, and just wonderful memories of the family celebrations.  Family always came first.  We always had dinner together whether we liked it or not (laughter).  But they were a very supportive family, and I give them a lot of credit for always being able to talk to us about difficult issues.  When the Civil Rights Movement started, it's, it's kind of strange to say that, that segregation really insulated you from a lot of the harshness of racism in the sense that you were in a black neighborhood.  Everybody around you was black, so you never really felt it.  So when I, I went to the Cleveland [Ohio] public schools I had an excellent education in the Cleveland public schools.  They were segregated at the time.  I didn't know I was supposed to have been deprived by virtue of that.  But I had an excellent education.  I had languages in elementary school [Doan Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio].  I had art.  I had music.  We went this, the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra [sic. Cleveland Orchestra].  We went to the Cleveland museums.  We were exposed to everything cultural.  We had the opportunities to see black businesspeople, black lawyers, black doctors all in our neighborhood.  It was a very good, very good upbringing.  We, my brothers [Julian Mell III and Bryan Mell] and I, since we were five years apart, and I'm a girl; they're boys, we played a little bit together.  We were little, but--(unclear)--a time I, one, by the time my older brother got to be twelve, he didn't want to be bothered with a younger sister.  So, but they were very protective, and we did stick together whenever our paths crossed by that time.  But some of the other things I remember about, about growing up is just that we were always supportive.  We were encouraged to do well in school.  They paid attention to what we were doing.  They always seemed to know what was up, even if we hadn't said anything.  So we, we always kind of wondered, how did they (laughter) figure that out, but they did.  They paid attention to what we were doing.  They were always, one of them was always there.  My father would be the one who would come to the programs during the day, because his schedule was a little bit more flexible with respect to his hours.  So he would come to the, the school plays, and he was the one who took me to, to, to kindergarten.  That's another memory, is going to school the first day.  And the kindergarten room was on the first floor and had its own door from the out, from the playground.  And they got us inside.  It's January is when I started school, and it's, and it's Cleveland.  January is cold.  We have boots and all these things on.  And so the elementary--the kindergarten teacher has us all come in.  And all of the parents were standing outside the window looking in (laughter), and I remember waving goodbye to my father kind of a thing.  But they were always there.  And even though we did not always get what we want, which was the way childhood is, we always knew that we were loved and cared for, and that went a long way to making sure that we could do whatever it is we wanted to achieve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I give 'em a lot of credit.
Story_ID: 260812
Speaker 1: Where did, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Doan Elementary School [Cleveland, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Doan?
Speaker 2: --which is now a condo.  It's not even a school anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: D-O-A-N?
Speaker 2: D-O-A-N--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Elementary School on 105th Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now it was right across the street from the public library.  And one of my other memories is kindergarten.  I loved school.  We had this beautiful, it had a cork floor.  It was one of those old buildings with cork floors.  And there must have been forty kids.  This is during the height I guess of the baby boom.  But everybody had their own little space with their name tag, their name on it.  And in the spring, we would go down the bout the, fire escape to the garden in the backyard of the library.  And they would tell us stories back there, and it was beautiful.  I can remember how beautiful the flowers were, from irises to roses.  They would tell us what the flowers were.  It was just a wonderful, wonderful experience and really got me interested and yeah, school's okay.
Story_ID: 260813
Speaker 1: Well how did you like school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I had some excellent teachers.  They always pushed you to achieve.  There was no question that you were gonna work hard, and that you were gonna get it, and that you were going to be able to do whatever you wanted to.  I mean there was never a question that you wouldn't go to college, that you would not finish college; there was never a question about that.
Speaker 1: Now were your teachers mostly black or white?
Speaker 2: They mostly black.
Speaker 1: Mostly black, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, I mean you were given a very good sense of confidence about your ability.  The classes were very challenging, but you knew that you could do it, which came in handy because it was about this time that the school desegregation started to be filed.  And Cleveland [Ohio] was one of the, the cities which was found to have segregated schools.  As a result, I graduated from elementary school [Doan Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], and we were now going to junior high school and high school.  So I was sent, the people from my high, my elementary school, we were sent to Collinwood High School [Cleveland, Ohio], which was on the other side of town.  We had to take two buses to get there.  And it was at that point that we really came face to face with discrimination and just basic racial prejudice.  There were race riots at the school.  And through it all though, I, I think that the teachers at the school handled things very well, in the sense that they made sure that everyone knew that that was not acceptable behavior.  And you know, after the first couple of times it happened, things died down, and we as students started to deal with each other as human beings.  I can't say that we broke down all of the barriers, 'cause we still did not socialize together, but that was fine with us.  We were there because this was high school, and we did very well there in high school academically.  And at the end of the day, that's what you go to school for.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Collinwood High School.
Speaker 1: Col, oh, okay, so junior high and high was at the same place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was six years, yeah, six-year high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Six, seventh grade through twelfth.

Speaker 1: Any special teachers that, that, that really stand out that were, were special in your development?
Speaker 2: Probably, oh, there were a lot of elementary school teachers [at Doan Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio] that were particularly important.  Ms. Hampton [ph.] was my fifth and sixth grade teacher.  Mrs. Dunn [ph.] was my fourth grade teacher.  I think that they were probably the most pivotal people.  When I went to junior high [at Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio], I joined the student newspaper there and eventually became editor of that newspaper [Collinwood Spotlight].  And the editor--the professor who was the sponsor of that or the, I guess the supervisor of that was Ray Spasa [ph.].  And he was very good at teaching us what news, what, what objective writing was all about.  And it was a very integrated group, and we all worked together and learned to respect each other's ability.  So that was an excellent experience.  Ms. Hershfelt [ph.] was my German instructor.  They were all just very good teachers.  There were a lot of them that were very good teachers because they were professionals, and they didn't particularly care what color you were.  But if you were in the class, then you were gonna work hard, (laughter) as hard as you could, and you were gonna be able to compete anywhere.  And because of them I was able to compete, Wellesley College [Wellesley, Massachusetts].  I got in and graduated with honors because the foundation that was, that was made in Cleveland [Ohio] public schools.
Story_ID: 260815
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio] did you participate in student government or, or any other--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'll say--
Speaker 1: --activities other than--
Speaker 2: --I was in the, the choir.  I was in the Top 20 singing group.  I was in choir all, all the years I was there.  Top 20 is for high school and seniors; I competed.  They had a vocal competition; I competed in that and won prizes in that.  I was on the student newspaper [Collinwood Spotlight].  I was president of the history club.  I was in a couple of the language clubs.  I think that was about it.  I was, I was fairly active (laughter) in a number of things.
Story_ID: 260816
Speaker 1: When you were a senior [at Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio] did you, did you know what, what you wanted to be?  Did you think about--
Speaker 2: I was gonna be a journalist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was gonna be a journalist.
Speaker 1: So you weren't thinking about becoming a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Well, that's not exactly true.  Sometimes during the summer my father [Julian Mell] would be called to testify in court on cases that he had worked on.  And my [maternal] grandmother [Clara Webb] would takes us, sometimes would take us down, we were downtown; we'd go and listen to what was going on in court, and it was kind of interesting.  I kind of enjoyed it--(unclear)--I can do that, kind of a thing.  But I really didn't think about it until I went, until I was in college, as to what I wanted to do, 'cause I was on the newspaper [The Wellesley News] in college too.  I thought I was gonna be a journalist, 'cause I liked writing, and I liked the kind of investigative things.  And I did a, a piece on the history of Wellesley College [Wellesley, Massachusetts] for the newspaper.  That was a lot of fun.  But I took a course called the Introduction of Law and enjoyed the course.  And I told my father about it, and my parents talked apparently.  I found this out years later, that they had chatted about this.  And my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] suggested that my father take me to meet a woman lawyer, and her name, or is, Judge Jean Murrell Capers.  And Judge Capers was one of the first black women judges in the City of Cleveland [Ohio], probably in the United States.  But Judge Capers took me to lunch and told me about the practice of law.  And I enjoyed talking to her, and I said well, maybe I can do this.  This is might be, this might be fun.  And the more that she talked about it, and I started to put together some things that bothered me about the way society was.  One of the turning points in my recognition of what's going on in society was the riots in Cleveland.  My street was not affected by it, but two blocks over, three blocks over, four blocks over, those places were in flames.  In fact, my mother had taken my younger brother [Bryan Mell] and I to the movies.  We couldn't get back to the house because the riots occurred while we were away.  So we couldn't get back to our home for a while.  And I was watching the faces of some of the white people standing there with guns looking over into the neighborhood like we're not gonna let 'em over here and looking at what they called a house, which was not as good as what I had, just kind of made me angry.  And the next day, when we finally did get home, they had a National Guard post outside of our house.  And there's this like little, this, this guy didn't look much older than I was, sittin' there looking really scared (laughter), looking really scared.  And I can imagine.  I'm what, thirteen or, thirteen or fourteen, glaring at him from my front (laughter) steps.  But, that happened, and then the race riots at the high school happened the next year.  And I said you know, there's got to be a better way.
Speaker 1: Do you--
Speaker 2: --and what is it I can do to participate in it?  And my parents were very good in talking to us about what had happened and why it had happened and you know, cautioning us to be careful.  They never told us not to protest, but they were concerned for our safety.  But the question was: you need to think about what you can do to, to make things better.  That's all they ever said.  So those experiences, plus the ones through high school, and a couple of the political science classes, the introduction to law classes, I said well, maybe I can be a lawyer.
Story_ID: 260817
Speaker 1: Cleveland [Ohio] was a, the subject of a movie about a riot called 'Uptight.' Do, do you remember that?  In '68 [1968] it came out.
Speaker 2: Just vaguely.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a, they had a big deal about it in all the Johnson [Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] publications.  And the mu- the music was by Booker T. & [the] M.G.'s.  And you know, it was supposed to take place in a Hough area of Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lived in the Hough area.  Hough area was pretty large, but I did live in the Hough area.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know, so it wasn't--do you, do you remember people discussing that movie when it came out.  It seemed like it was--
Speaker 2: My older brother [Julian Mell III], yeah.
Speaker 1: --probably was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that.  I don't remember very much about, I don't think I ever saw the movie.  I just remember my older brother talking about the movie.  And certainly he was five years older and was really very much more into the thick of things than, than was I.
Speaker 1: Now I think if I recall correctly, it's one of the first all-black movies to appear in years, you know.  And like it started a string of, you know, all-black movies to come after it.  This was like the first one really that, and [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee was in it, Max Julien, Julian Mayfield--
Speaker 2: See, now I'm gonna have to see if I can find it--
Speaker 1: --oh, that--
Speaker 2: --on video (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: No, really, I didn't, I don't think I ever saw the movie.
Speaker 1: Frank Silvera was in it.  I mean a lot of, it was like, it got a lot of attention then and may, I just wondered what a Clevelander would think of it.  And you know--
Speaker 2: I don't remember--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I don't think I ever saw the movie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I can remember is the frustration.  I think I was fourteen, a little bit too young to do anything really and not, you know, just really becoming aware of the kinds of tensions that do exist and just the level of frustration that would bring people to do this to their own neighborhood, because that's how I saw it.  And so that's, that's sort of the kinds of things that my parents [Thelma Webb Mell and Julian Mell] were trying to talk me through, about, you know, you don't understand because you have never seen what goes on outside of, you know, this little area, and just trying to help me get through the anger but to see what can you do to make things better.  So I give 'em a lot of credit to, for really trying to talk through things and to, you know, help me understand why people would burn down their own neighborhoods, why, you know, why, what they were trying to accomplish, whether they accomplished it or not, but the kinds of things that we would have to do now, if we really wanted to make things better.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's a conversation that--it's interesting 'cause that was right on the cusp of, of change I guess, because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this was a black community.  You describe it like a lot, my hometown the same kind of black community where you have like working class and, and people without jobs in the black community.  And then you've got like a black middle class that's--
Speaker 2: Middle class.
Speaker 1: --trying to, you know, exist in the middle of all that.  And the riots really caused a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --attention on how, you know, how can you change things, make things better in, in Cleveland.
Story_ID: 260818
Speaker 1: I suppose there's a lot of organizing done in a black community because you re--before you came out of [Collinwood] High School [Cleveland, Ohio], Carl Stokes was mayor--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did, did you, do you remember the discussions when you were in high school, you know, of the adults about that campaign?  Or, or did you part--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --participate in it at all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was the, this was probably the first campaign I ever really paid attention to.  And it was about the kinds of discussion that, discussions that were the, the adults were having and the kinds of things they were talking about in the churches, about we've had this, you know, the riots happened because.  There are whole list of reasons as to why they happened, but they have now happened.  So what are we gonna do about it?  What are we gonna do to make sure we're not in this position again?  And so that's when this grassroots movement came up behind Carl Stokes, and it was wonderful.  It was wonderful to witness and being young enough really to see that things can change.  And, and Louis, you know, [HistoryMaker] Louis Stokes came out of that also; I mean all of this stuff, positive things were coming out of it.  So it was a wonderful time to be fifteen or sixteen, to really see that there are things that can happen.  But then, of course, when I was seventeen is when Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] happened (laughter), so, you know, one step forward, two steps back.  It was, we had some long talks about that too, about what activism really means, and what can you do to participate, what can you do--of course and my parents [Thelma Webb Mell and Julian Mell] are protective--what can you do and still be safe, and the limits of the kinds of things that you can justifiably say you can do.  But, again, yeah, I give 'em an awful lot of credit, 'cause they were very, very open with us, just listening to what we had to say, because their, they would never tell us any, you know, tell us what to do.  They would just say well, what do you think about that, and really listen to what we had to say, and kind of, you know, talk back and forth about it.  There would never be an end to the conversation, just kind of: okay, well, time to go to bed now; go do your, have finished your homework?  And we'd think about it for a bit, come back the next day and talk a little it.  But they were very, very good about doing that.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you ever get a chance to meet Carl Stokes--
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: --by himself?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Very briefly one of, one of the crowd of high school students (laughter), you know, very proud day, but that's about it.  I never really had any conversation or anything, but I was just one of the adoring crowd of high school students for the new mayor as he went by and introduced--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --himself after his victory.
Speaker 1: And he was a, a newscaster I think before--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he became, he, a candidate, right?
Speaker 2: But he was a newscaster--
Speaker 1: What was he--
Speaker 2: --after he was.  I don't think he was before.
Speaker 1: After, after, okay, afterwards.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so what position did he hold before he ran?  Do, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Was he a lawyer?
Speaker 1: He might have--you know, I'm, I'm kind of fuzzy on it myself, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think he was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did become a newscaster at, afterwards, but--
Speaker 2: But he was a newscaster afterwards--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think you're right.
Speaker 2: --after the mayoral.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that, that must have been something, yeah, 'cause that was the--
Speaker 2: Just to watch.
Speaker 1: --first black mayor of a major city in the United States.  I mean it was, it must have been a real exciting time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he's very polished.  And what I remember about him was that he was willing to speak to anybody and really the kind of coalition builder that the city needed at that time, so the right person at the right time.
Story_ID: 260819
Speaker 1: Now when you graduated from high school [Collinwood High School, Cleveland, Ohio], now you, you decided to go to Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how did you make that decision?  How did--
Speaker 2: Actually, it was kind of funny.  The high school counselor, you know, I guess talked to each one of us and said well, here's a list of schools that you ought to consider.  I said oh, okay (laughter), you know, okay, okay, I'll consider these.  And so I applied.  I didn't know anything.  Then after I applied, I'd gotten, I, all of the, the Seven Sister schools: I'd applied to Radcliffe [College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Mount Holyoke [College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], and Wellesley, and I applied to Kenyon [College, Gambier, Ohio] and some other places.  And the Seven Sisters, each one of them had a holiday tea.  So I said what's a holiday tea?  So my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] took me to one; my godmother took me to (laughter) another one to meet some of the students who were currently enrolled.  So I went to the one at Radcliffe, didn't like them very much, 'cause I was from an inner city [Cleveland, Ohio], so okay, fine, fine.  I went to the, the one at Holyoke.  They were okay, but the people that I met from Wellesley, the, the black students I met there, they were just really wonderful people, very friendly, down to earth.  They seemed to relate to me; I liked them, so I decided that's where I was gonna go.  My parents did not say a word.  Now this is something else I found out years later (laughter), that my mother and, had gone and researched everything.  She said--she needs to go to this school, you know.  But as parents know, if you tell a teenager that this is what you need to do, you're not gonna do it, so they didn't say anything.  That's where I ended up going.
Speaker 1: But they thought it was--
Speaker 2: And it was a--
Speaker 1: --a good choice--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they thought it was a good choice.
Story_ID: 260820
Speaker 1: All right, well, what was Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] like, you know?
Speaker 2: Wellesley was well, it was the farthest I had ever been away from home.  Well, here's, here is a funny story: my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] took her first airplane fight when she took me to school.  She was a nervous wreck.  She was sitting like this the whole time, like she was, you know, if she breathed, the, the airplane was gonna fall.  And I said mom, you know, um-hm, loosen up, dah.
Speaker 1: Now that's something to reflect on in a sense, 'cause it--I was telling some, someone a couple of weeks ago that I think the first people I knew that took plane flights took 'em in the late '60s [1960s] in the black community.  I didn't know anybody that ever been on a plane--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  But it was--
Speaker 2: So it was, you know, it was different.  So we were on the plane.  We get to Boston [Massachusetts].  We got a cab.  And of course, I have all this luggage because of course I'm setting up the room, dorm room.  So we get to there, get there, and my mother gets me in the room.  And she's moving like lightning, putting the curtains up, putting the stuff in the drawers.  And it's like, 'cause she, she was planning to be out of there and on the plane before it got dark because she didn't want to fly at night (laughter), okay.  (Unclear) what's the rush?  You know, mom, what's the rush?  No, I gotta get on that plane.  So, got the room all set up, and my mother's parting words were: "Now, your father [Julian Mell] and I have tried these years to teach you the difference between right and wrong.  And you need to understand that you can always come home."  And I was so well-indoctrinated, I had no clue what she was talking about.  I said well, I can get a C.  That'd be pretty bad if I got that, but you know, why wouldn't she let me come because of that?  I mean it was really kind of funny (laughter).  I said (unclear) and it was, the next year I said oh, I get (laughter).  That's what you, that's what you talking about?  But, so I was on the first floor.  I had a lovely room, 'cause I wanted a single.  My best buddy in life was on the second floor, and there was another black woman on the third floor.  So each floor had their own black person.  But, of course, like all black people who were, you know, in the minority, we found each other at breakfast (laughter) the next day.  Oh, there's one over there.  But I have to say that Wellesley was an excellent education on a number of fronts.  The white students were fine.  We had a lot of good friends.  We, it was really a wonderful socialization process about how to talk to people that you have nothing in common with, to find that commonality, something that you use every day in business.  And you didn't even know that you were being trained to do that--excellent education; they challenged you.  But, again, there was absolutely no question that you were capable of doing the work and that you would achieve; absolutely no question was ever raised about that.  They expose you to a lot of different things.  At that time they had distribution requirements.  So, of course, you had to take a math course, at least one math course, a science course, a lab course, plus languages, philosophy and the whole nine yards, so you got a wonderful background.  So I took philosophy and sociology and all these little fun things.  And my grandmother's only comment was, "Oh, that's wonderful, dear, but what are you going to do with this when you graduate?"  (Laughter) I said "Oh, well, gee, I hadn't thought about that, you know."  "Well, maybe you need to start thinking about where this is going to end."
Story_ID: 260821
Speaker 1: What was your major in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually, I had a double major: political science and modern languages.  So I had enough credits for a major in both French and German, modern languages, and in political science, which is a combination of political theory and just your basic kind of political sciences.  But my, my friend, Denise [ph.], was a math whiz.  And it was like, well, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna take too many classes with you (laughter), so, you know.  So my math class was a course called Structure and Form.  You wrote a paper, and I can write and research, so I got an A on that paper.  And the professor, bless her heart, she was like, oh, this paper was brilliant.  You need to be a math major.  I said oh, you don't understand (laughter); you don't understand.  I know how to research well, and I write well.  But, no, I don't want to be a math major.  It something on, it was Lobachevskian geometry is what I wrote my paper on, study of topography and form.  So, essentially, I did a garden structure in three-dimensional form.  It was a wonderful paper.  But it's like, now I have finished my math class.  I never have to pick this (laughter) up again.  I was done.  But, again, it was a wonderful experience.  It was a great school [Wellesley College, Wellesley, Massachusetts], beautiful campus, beautiful campus.  I met some wonderful people there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, who were some of the professors there that you met that stand out?
Speaker 2: One of my favorite professors died suddenly, unfortunately.  His name was Baris [ph.].  He was a young guy.  But he taught a variety of the political science classes.  And Professor [Edward] Stettner was another one who was one of the supervisors on my honor's thesis.  He was a good professor, a good person.  But Alona [E.] Evans was the math professor.  And she was, she was absolutely brilliant.  (Unclear) it was her, it was her textbook, but very nice person.  There were a lot of very nice people as professors there.  And I don't think they ever made a difference between students by virtue of the color of their skin, I just don't.  I don't know if they did as much mentoring as they could have, but it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you get involved with any campus activities or, when you were there, or?
Speaker 2: Well, the campus, well, I was on the, The Wellesley News, which is the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had a black student union called Ethos, and we had a choir.
Speaker 1: Called what, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Ethos.
Speaker 1: Ethos?
Speaker 2: And so we had a choir, and we went around to the various schools and did performances.  That took a lot of time, so that was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 260822
Speaker 1: When you graduated from Wellesley [College, Wellesley, Massachusetts] in what, what year was it, '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So, what did you, did, did, did you go right to law school?
Speaker 2: I went straight to law school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and went to--
Speaker 1: So at, at what point did you decide that you wanted to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Well, there were a couple of things that happened.  First of all, I had applied for a number of externships, summer, summer programs, internships I guess, at newspapers.  I applied for one at The Washington Post.  I applied for one at The New York Times, [The] Wall Street Journal, all of 'em, right, had all the credentials, all this.  But at the time, looking back on it, I can see why they were a bit concerned.  Even though I met the qualifications, as one interviewer said, "How old are you?"  And I said, "Well, I'm twenty."  He said, "You know you look twelve," and I did.  When I look at myself now, I said well, I guess he was right (laughter).  I did look like I was twelve.  I guess I did, you know.  He says, "'Cause, you know, you'd have to go out at night to get some of these stories."  I said, "Yeah, and?  I go out at night now (laughter)."  But, so I said okay, I'll have to refocus here.  This looks like, you know, there're just too many doors being slammed here.  What am I gonna do?  And I started thinking about the things that I really enjoyed in law school and some of the things that I had thought, been thinking about over a number of years and decided to go to law school and decided to go home to Cleveland [Ohio] and went to Case Western [Reserve University School of Law, Cleveland, Ohio].  And I can't say that I enjoyed law school.  There were some aspects of it that I really liked.  Others, it's just law school.  Law school is, in a lot of ways it can be very intimidating because it does change the way that you think about things.
Speaker 1: Now why did you choose Case Western, be, just because it was close to home--
Speaker 2: It was home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Case Western seems to have a pretty decent reputation--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --as a school, yeah--
Speaker 2: --it's an excellent school--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  And to be quite frank, the notion of having school loans that cost, the, that for two years or three years were three times the cost of my parents' [Thelma Webb Mell and Julian Mell] mortgage, terrified me.  And the notion that I could get a job to help me pay for that, didn't really cross my mind.  It was just the notion that I would be seventy [thousand] or $80,000 in debt after school that I just couldn't quite face it.  So I said okay, I'll go home.  They gave me some money, so I went home to Case Western--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and met another wonderful group of folks and learned a great deal about how things work.  And that's re--what, what law school is really important about.  It really shows you how things work and how you can really make things work for you.
Story_ID: 260823
Speaker 1: Case Western Reserve [University School of Law, Cleveland, Ohio], and what, who were the, some of your outstanding law professors, or were, were there any or, or, or fellow students, or what, you know, or what, is (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, we were the largest group of black students Case Western law school had ever admitted.  There were nineteen of us in one class.  And so they exist, the former black students, students who were, like, second or third-year students decided to have a special orientation for us to kind of get us, you know, to meet each other and kind of get us acclimated before classes began.  So we show up.  And so, we're sitting in this room, the two rows of us.  We've just gone around and introduced ourselves, said our names, where, what school we went to.  And they had a variety of the professors give us a special session, one on the introduction to torts, one on contracts and something else, and the dean of the law school spoke to us as well.  And I knew this group of people was gonna be all right when the dean made a comment, then in retrospect, maybe we took it out of context, just being perhaps sensitive, but he says something to the effect of you're lucky to be here, something like that, when all of us jumped up, "What do you mean?  You're not doing us any favors."  This is okay.  This is a good group of folks, you know.  He said oh, no, no, you took it (unclear) but--
Speaker 1: So that was a good sign as a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean it was, 'cause we all, braaahh! (Laughter) What do you mean, aaahh?  So it was funny.  I said well, this is a good group of folks.  This is all right.  And one of my, my best, my best buddies, her name's Cheryl Baker.  Her father, Oscar [W.] Baker, was the third generation lawyer, Bay City, Michigan, so, a long line of lawyers.  He graduated from, Oscar graduated from University of Michigan [Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], which is where his father [James H. Baker] and his grandfather went to law school.  In any case--
Speaker 1: That's an incredible thing (unclear) I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --who would, I, I would never have guessed that there'd be a black family with--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --generations that go back that far at the University of Michigan, yeah.
Speaker 2: Go back that far as lawyers.
Speaker 1: As lawyers, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so the dean, after he made this one gaff-- we're all calmed down--and he says, "Yes, and I see Ms. Baker.  I worked on the constitutional conference in Michigan with her father, blah, blah, blah."  So we're all looking around.  Well, who's he talking to?  You know, who's he talking about?  Nobody's admitting that they're Baker (laughter).  So, they break, and we go out.  We're in the ladies' room, and this woman was like, "Oh my gosh," just looked like she was just drained.  I said, "Are you okay?"  She said, "Oh my God, oh my God, why did he do that?"  And said, "Oh, you must be Cheryl Baker (laughter)."  She, she said, she was just all upset.  She said, "These people are gonna hate me now (laughter)."  We said, "Aahh, he's just trying to relate.  Don't worry about it."  But she's a--we've been in touch.  You know, we've been good friends ever since, since then.  But, it was a very good group of people.  We came from very different backgrounds.  Some of the students in that class, the minority students in that class had two other careers and were coming to law school in their thirties.  There were others of us, of course, who were coming straight out of college, other people who were coming from different industries.  It was an interesting group of people.  But we decided right then, we're gon' stick together; we're gon' make it; we're gon' help each other out, and we did.  And we would study at a, a people's, different people's houses.  One woman, Phyllis Culp [ph.], lived right up the hill from the law school.  So we would go there and study, or to my parents' [Thelma Webb Mell and Julian Mell] house and study, or to Cheryl's house and study.  But we made it through, and people are doing very well, very, very well.  So, it was a good group of folks.
Story_ID: 260824
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like a wonderful experience for law school, 'cause so many, you hear so many stories of black law students show up, and they're the only one, or the only one or two of 'em.  And they have to, they feel compelled to act like they, they don't know each other.  And then they're not let into the white study groups or, or like a satellite of the study groups.  And you know, it' just a lot, lot of horror stories--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --associated with that.
Speaker 2: -we decide, okay, now this isn't the only study group that we're in.  So you're gon' make friends with somebody (laughter).  You get into their study group and then share, which is what we did.  They had, the first-year class was broken into four groups.  And we were split evenly among the groups, okay, random of course, but we were split evenly among those groups.  And so the groups would kind of like, group one and group three would have certain classes together; group two and group four would have classes together, and you know, that kind of thing.  So we always made sure that whatever we got, we would share and try to, you know, talk it through.  So it was a very good support group.  And then once a month we would go out together and just to, to, to let off steam.  Of course, this is during the days of disco, so we'd go out, and you know, dance for a weekend or something, Saturday night.  And then, of course, like ten o'clock, okay, gotta go; time to go home; we gotta go to bed 'cause we have to study tomorrow (laughter).  But it was just a very good group of people.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were there [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] until '77 [1977]?  Is that, that--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978].
Story_ID: 260825
Speaker 1: What, I guess, field or legal study did you gravitate towards?
Speaker 2: I liked litigation.  I liked litigation.  And while I was in law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], I was advisor to the [Philip C.] Jessup [International Law] Moot Court Competition.  And we actually competed here in Chicago [Illinois] and took an award home, so that was pretty good.  But I decided I was gonna be a litigator.  And my first job was with the Ohio attorney general's office in Columbus [Ohio] in the charitable foundations section.  That was the section that did regulatory kinds of things, for instance, charitable bingo, which was a quite, quite a big business.  We did the licensing of that, and you know, checked to see, if were complaints were filed, to go see if the complaints were valid and those kinds of things.  We also did charitable trusts, et cetera.  The second section was consumer frauds and crimes division.  And this was the div- this was the time when consumer protection statutes were just becoming, coming online in the [United] States.  And so, in essence, we were creating law and wearing the white hats, protecting the consumers.  So that was a wonderful experience, had a good time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and had a good mentor.  His name was Alex Shumate.  I believe he's managing partner of Jones Day in Columbus now.  But he was a very good mentor and opening doors.  So after four years there--I think it was four years, maybe three years.  But any event, the attorney general ran for governor and lost.  And a variety of administrative positions came open around the state so I applied--
Speaker 1: Was that [Richard] Celeste or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Richard Celeste--
Speaker 2: It was, William J. Brown was the attorney general.  He ran for governor and lost.  And I think Richard Celeste came in at that point.  Yeah, because Richard Celeste had been secretary of state.
Story_ID: 260826
Speaker 1: So another Brown [Sherrod Brown] became [Ohio] secretary of state, and they were looking to fill a variety of positions, administrative positions.  And I applied for the corporation's counsel spot and was selected.  And this was the first time that I had done any administrative work and discovered that I really liked it.  There were a lot--no, I do have a funny story about my first taste of administration and how I really had to kind of talk to my, talk myself through it.  The secretary of state's office processes all of the corporation's documents, so articles of incorporation, trademarks, trade names, mergers, acquisitions, all of those come through the secretary of state's office to be processed and filed.  So there's an awful lot of paper, an awful lot of paper that comes in.  Outside my office was a desk where the administrative assistant to the corporation's counsel sat.  But when I got there, this woman was on maternity leave, so there was no one sitting there.  But I noticed that every day there'd be a higher pile of documents on this desk.  I said well, okay, we're buying some new filing cabinets.  Maybe that's, there just kind of putting them there until we can actually move the things over and file them.  But I started looking at, there are checks attached to these things.  I said these things haven't been processed.  So I asked the, the supervisor of the area, I said, "Excuse me, Ruth [ph.].  I noticed that there are all these documents that don't look as if they've been processed, piling up on this desk.  You know, what's going on?"  And so she looked at me and "Well, that desk has always performed that function."  And I said, "Are you saying that the desk has always been used as the landing place or filing place for documents which have not been filed?"  "Well, no, that desk has always performed that function."  And I said, "Okay, are you saying that the person who sat at that desk has always performed that function?"  "Why, yes."  At which point, I really got angry.  I said, now, who does she think she's talking to?  I know there's nobody sitting at that desk.  Is she saying that the desk itself files the papers?  What is she saying?  Or is she just saying this 'cause I'm new?  You know, I'm the new corporation's counsel.  They've seen people come.  They'd seen people go.  They were civil service.  They could tell us anything.  So I was, you know, and I said okay, management lesson number one: think before you speak.  I said, "Okay, Ruth, so what you're telling me is that so and so, who is on maternity leave, always processed those papers.  Is that correct?"  "Well, yes."  I said, "Well, and so and so is on maternity leave, isn't she?"  "Well, yes."  "And she's gonna be on maternity leave for another six weeks.  Is that correct?"  "Well, yes."  And I said, "Well, and we're supposed to turn these documents around in two weeks.  Isn't that correct?"  "Well, yes."  I said, "Well, what do you think we can do so that we don't have an eight-week backlog on these documents?  What do you think we can do?"  "Oh, well, I guess we could distribute this work to other people who know how to do it."  I said, "Oh, that's a wonderful idea, Ruth.  That's a wonderful idea.  Would you do that please?"  "Oh, of course."  So she left my office.  I closed my door.  I said I don't believe this (laughter).  I mean it was just, okay, but it was a good lesson for me.  It was a very good lesson for me to think before you speak no matter how angry you may be and to not take it personally.  I mean she's a fine person, and we really did speed up the processing.  We sped up the accuracy.  We improved our customer relations just by getting them to decide how would you like this to run--you've been doing this for a long time.  What inefficiencies do you see?  And making them proud of themselves; they aren't just clerical help, that they are a staff, a professional staff that know what they're doing, that can answer the questions.  So it was a very good experience.
Speaker 2: So, so it sounds like they'd almost been taught in the past not to think about what they were doing.  Just do it really.
Speaker 1: Just do it.  Because really there were no incentives, because, well, they're civil service.  A lot of them were political appointees.  What's the big deal?  I'll get my check.  I'll come at 8:30.  I'll leave at 4:30.  What's the big deal?  So, we worked together for the next I guess year and a half, and they really had become proud of themselves, and were really doing good work, and thinking about things, and suggesting changes to the law.  I mean they were good; they were really good.  But it was a, it was a great experience.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were living in Columbus [Ohio] during this time, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so you were there until '85 [1985] I think you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Eighty-four [1984] or '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Eight-f--okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think it was '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 260827
Speaker 1: So I left the corporation's counsel spot and went into teaching.  That was my first step into academia.  The [Ohio] secretary of state [Sherrod Brown] was about to become a candidate for another office.  And as a political appointee, I had to make a choice as to whether I was gonna truly get political or go someplace else, and I decided to go someplace else.  And someone that I had worked with in the attorney general's office had just started teaching at Capital [University, Columbus, Ohio] he says, got this program and alternative dispute resolution.  Why don't you come over and try it for a year?  You don't like it, you can look for another job.  I said okay--
Speaker 2: This is Capital University in, in--
Speaker 1: In Columbus [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: --Columbus, okay.
Speaker 1: --and went over and decided this is all right.  I enjoyed working with the students.  I enjoyed being able to think about things and think about ways that we could make things better in the law.  So I really enjoyed it and decided to stay in teaching.  So I was at Capital for a year.  Then I went to the University of Toledo [Toledo, Ohio] for a year and then went to Widener [University Delaware Law School] in [Wilmington] Delaware.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, Widener, okay, in, in Delaware.
Speaker 1: Widener University.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I guess it was called Delaware Law School at the time, but it's Widener University School of Law now.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: That's when I really started developing my teaching and being in the academic circle.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you really liked that I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I love it, yeah.  It has all the excitement of trial work.  But it also has the connection with the students in assisting them in figuring things out and assisting them in being able to see not only the little details but also the big picture as to how ultimately this ought to work and how this fits into a larger piece.  So I found that a wonderful challenge.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, so, so what areas did you teach primarily?
Speaker 1: Well, after twenty years now I guess I've taught (laughter) quite a few.  I started teaching corporations, agency and partnership, so business courses.  But then, I also taught in the clinical area, the criminal trial clinic at Toledo.  I taught alternative dispute resolution, interviewing and counseling at Capital.  Then I went to Delaware Law School and taught business courses and criminal law and then eventually turned that combination of business and crime into a white collar crime seminar that I put my own materials together for.  And so I did that for a number of years.  In fact, when I left Delaware and eventually started teaching at Detroit College of Law [Detroit, Michigan], I kept those two and eventually started teaching a seminar in the rights in art, 'cause I got involved with the Detroit Institute of Arts [Detroit, Michigan]--
Story_ID: 260828
Speaker 1: When did you go to Michigan to--
Speaker 2: Went to Michigan in 1991.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], right (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, when I went to Michigan in 1991, I'd actually gotten married to my first husband, and he worked in Detroit [Michigan].  So I was on leave that first year.  And 1991 I was an associate at Lewis, White and Clay [Lewis & Munday, P.C., Detroit, Michigan], a law firm in Detroit.  And in 1992 I started teaching at Detroit College of Law [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were there before you went to Michigan State, at--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --at Detroit College--
Speaker 2: --for a year.
Speaker 1: --of Law, okay.  This associated with the University of Detroit?
Speaker 2: No, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --University of Detroit at Mercy [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].  That's Detroit Mercy law school [University of Detroit Mercy School of Law, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Detroit College of Law affiliated with Michigan State University in East Lansing [Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and moved to East Lansing, ninety-seven some miles west.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, how did you like Detroit?
Speaker 2: I had a great life there.  I found it to be a very vibrant African American community.  A lot of people had great businesses.  They could be very successful.  The Detroit Institute of Arts [(DIA), Detroit, Michigan] was a, is a fabulous institution.  I took the year-long program to become a docent, met some, people who I'm still in contact with.  It was an opportunity for me to return to the love of art that I had developed going to the Cleveland Institute of Art [Cleveland, Ohio] as a child.  I really hadn't had a chance to really do anything with it but went there and did in the art to the schools programs.  So, essentially, we took slide presentations of the DIA collection to children in their third through sixth grade classes.  But it was, it's almost like going back to law school with the, the course was that intense.  But they allowed you also to do, develop a specialty.  So I developed a specialty in ethnographic art, African, Native American, art.  So I did that for what, nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know they had a (unclear) there's a big Egypt, Egyptian art show [The Splendors of Ancient Egypt] that shortly--
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --came through.
Speaker 2: --yes it did, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know--so were you there when that, that, when the--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I was there when that happened.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Asa Hilliard [III] came to speak and all that, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, it was a wonderful exhibit, but a great art museum.
Story_ID: 260829
Speaker 1: You became an expert in copyright law I guess, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually, computers and privacy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is what I wrote my tenure piece on, talking about, well, raising the issue as to whether or not you have a property right in the privacy that you have.  Of course these days, computers and technology have advanced so quickly, I really don't think there's very much privacy left.  If someone wants to find out something, they probably can without very much difficulty.  But it's just because the technology advances so quickly.  It's kind of hard to protect things when that happens.
Speaker 1: So it's kind of hard to block a blow you don't even know--
Speaker 2: It's hard to block, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you don't know where it's coming from and your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If you don't know where it's coming from, how can you protect it?  And there are so many ways for people to get at it.  Once it's on the computer there are a whole lot of ways for them to get it.  And of course, the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act [Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001] allows the government to get a lot of information.
Speaker 1: Now, what was, okay, what was the, the landscape like before the PATRIOT Act?  And how did it change after the PATRIOT Act, the PATRIOT Act was passed?
Speaker 2: Well, before the PATRIOT Act, before the government could get a wiretap or to be able to have access to information, they had to get a warrant.  Essentially, a judge had to pass on whether or not there was probable cause to, to believe that a, a crime had been committed.  They'd just pass on it, look at what the prosecutor, the, or the policeman had.  If there was enough there, then you could get it.  It was just a check.  It was another check on the police power.  Those checks are gone.  There is, I think, some natural restraint among good prosecutors.  I don't think the prosecutors want to abuse the power they have.  By and large, good, you know, they're good people as well.  The problem is that you need laws to protect against those few people who aren't particularly careful about the [U.S.] Bill of Rights.  That's who you're guarding against.  I guess in view of the kinds of tax the United States has been subject to, the thought is that perhaps we need to give up a bit of that freedom for the sake of security.  And the question becomes well, do you really have security if you do give up the freedom?  That's a debate which I don't think anyone can really answer (laughter).  It's an interesting debate.  It's a serious debate.  I think that the pendulum was probably swung a little bit too far along the way of giving people information when there is very little to indicate that that person has done anything wrong.  The history is full of incidences in which the police power has been used for political purposes, and that's my concern, that's my concern.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a history in Chicago [Illinois] of an outfit that the Chicago police had called the Red Squad.  You've probably heard of, of that and it's, the, the city's quest to reinstitute it over the last ten years, you know.  It's always been knocked down by a federal judge until just recently I think it actually is pretty much--it's not called the same thing, but they have the same--
Speaker 2: Same kind of powers.
Speaker 1: --powers, right.
Speaker 2: That's scary.
Story_ID: 260830
Speaker 1: Almost like an axiomatic question: Have these powers been abused (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.  I mean there are a number of instances in history in which you can see they've, they've been abused.  Ooh, we were just talking about Marcus Garvey earlier, early on today.  I mean if you can't find something that says that someone has in fact done something wrong, then why do you keep observing these people to just make up something or just use the flimsiest of evidence to use the power of the government?  That's wrong, that's wrong.
Speaker 1: Like the FBI's [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigation of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when they sent a tape of, to his wife [Coretta Scott King].
Speaker 2: Wife.  I mean come on, that's wrong, that's wrong.  What is the purpose of the government?  It's not to listen to people's private conversations with whoever.  That's not what you're (laughter) supposed to be using it for.  That, the [Joseph] McCarthy situation, that was wrong.  And I fear that information can be manipulated any way that you want to manipulate it and to be used to try to pressure people into thinking the way that you do; that's my concern with it.  I'm not particularly concerned about what information.  I mean there's a whole lot of information about everybody out there.  But selective use of information can make someone look as if they're a criminal when they're not, and that's wrong.  So I think that having the judges in the middle, so that before you can actually tap in to someone's information, you have an objective pair of eyes looking at it.  It's a protection that we need, and removing that protection puts us all in a very dangerous position.
Speaker 1: So what can we do about--
Speaker 2: Put the judges back in (laughter), essentially.  Make sure that there is another check on the government's use of the police power.
Speaker 1: Do you think the, the, the, that check will be reinstated by, through political means or through, or, or will it hit a core--I mean will, will, will it--
Speaker 2: I think it's gonna have to hit--
Speaker 1: --hit a snag in court and--
Speaker 2: I think it's gonna--
Speaker 1: --go all the way to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: --have to hit some kind of--there's gonna have to be something that's so egregious that the public just says okay, enough, that's enough, before the political process will say okay, yeah, you're right, this is enough.  Perhaps we do need to put the police back in--the judges back into the mix.  On some of the provisions of the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act [Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001] did son- are gonna sunset at a particular time, but I think there is discussion about reenacting those that keep the, the judges out.  So, that's what I think we have to, to be vigilant about.
Story_ID: 260831
Speaker 1: There's something in terms of acts, the, the sunset of certain acts.  Black people seem to be universally anticipating the, the subtraction of their voting rights.
Speaker 2: Voting rights, yes.
Speaker 1: If, you know, this just seems like a, I don't know.  Is it a spurious fear or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --is it a--
Speaker 2: No (laughter), no, I don't think it's a spurious fear.  It is going to sunset, so what are we doing about it?  Do we think that the president is going to reenact, or reinstate, or prolong, or at this point, after four hundred years in this country, are we finally at the point that we can be considered citizens like everybody else without the need for these kinds of statutes?
Speaker 1: Well, surely our, our friends in the southern states wouldn't, wouldn't try to disenfranchise us because there are--
Speaker 2: What makes you think--
Speaker 1: --no federal laws there.
Speaker 2: --that we just have to look to the South?
Speaker 1: Oh, oh (unclear).
Speaker 2: It is an issue.  I am--
Speaker 1: 'Cause that is a legal protection.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I am, well, of course, we can say that the last election demonstrated that even with those protections in place, perhaps people can be disenfranchised in a number of ways.  However, let us assume that that is a mere aberration of chads, et cetera.  I think that we--I am disappointed that the black leaders in [U.S.] Congress haven't said anything, really pushed this, that this is an issue.  I don't know if perhaps you're saying well, if we don't look, nobody'll say anything.  I, I don't quite get it.  But it is gonna sunset.  So now is the time for us to stand up and say all right, it is going to sunset, so let's say that people who were born here, we don't, we don't need this protection anymore.  Yes, we can vote.  You can't just say that we can't vote.  That's one, that's one way to take it.  But I think the statement needs to be made.  Either we don't need the protection anymore because we recognize that black people have been in the United States for four hundred years.  We've been born here, therefore we have citizens, we have citizens' rights, period, and just move on.  Or we say that in view of some of the voting irregulars, irregularities that have been demonstrated, that perhaps we still need the protection, and we need to extend the protection of this bill, one way or the other.  But I think the statements have to be made.
Story_ID: 260832
Speaker 1: So you were in Detroit [Michigan] for how many years?
Speaker 2: I was there for eleven years, 1991, no, ten years, no, eleven years, '91 [1991] to 2002, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, and you, you taught at Michigan State [University College of Law, East Lansing, Michigan] as well, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I taught there all that time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the same classes, but I, I became associate dean for academic affairs at Michigan State as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was my experience in administration on the academic side for a professional school.  And I was associate dean on the East Lansing [Michigan] campus.  We were phasing out Detroit [College of Law, Detroit, Michigan] at the same time as opening up on East, in East Lansing, and got to see how a major research institution works, and assisted in kind of meshing the cultures of a private urban school with a large research institution.  It was a lot of fun, lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're the present, the position you have a present is historic in the sense that there haven't been too many, well, I think you're, you, you were saying you're the second black woman--
Speaker 2: Second black woman in the United States--
Speaker 1: --to be selected as a--
Speaker 2: --of a school that has, that's predominantly white.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The first one was Marilyn Yarbrough, and she was the dean down at Tennessee [University of Tennessee College of Law, Knoxville, Tennessee] for a number of years.
Speaker 1: And it hasn't been the long since the first black man was the dean of, I mean or the--
Speaker 2: Well, that's true.
Speaker 1: --or taught at a, at a majority white--
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: --law school.  And I think that, that was Ron Davenport [HistoryMaker Ronald Davenport], I've been told someone that we interviewed a while ago.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I think it was 1970 he taught at Duquesne [University School of Law, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --law school and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --became a dean in the late '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: In the late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: --early '80s [1980s], right, okay.
Speaker 2: He and [HistoryMaker] Carl Singley, who is the dean at Temple [University Law School; Temple University Beasley School of Law, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so it hasn't been very long that blacks have risen to the rank of, of dean at a law school.
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Joyce Hughes I think was the first black woman to teach in a predominantly white law school, as well here at, at--
Speaker 2: At Northwestern [University Law School; Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], yes.
Speaker 1: --Northwestern, right, right.  Okay, so were you aware of all these people before you--
Speaker 2: It's a very small community (laughter).  We've all heard of one another even if we haven't met--
Speaker 1: There's a old adage in the black community that all black folks that can read and write know each other.
Speaker 2: Know each other (laughter).  Yeah, pretty much, pretty much, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well, how, how did this position come, come about and how did you, you know--I don't want to take away a good story from Michigan State though.  If there, there's a good story there that, that you need to tell, tell it before we, we, we move, move you to [The] John Marshall [Law School, Chicago, Illinois], but--
Speaker 2: Well, there are a lot of good stories all over, but you know, this one I think is kind of interesting in, in the, in terms of how people become deans at law schools.  Generally, you need a bit of administrative experience.  And when I was at Michigan State and I had gotten tenure and published and enjoyed that, but I was kind of aah, I can do a little bit more.  So I asked the dean at the time, I said well, you know, I've been thinking that I would really like to get a little bit more involved in administration.  So, if a, an associate deanship comes up, you know, I'd like to talk to you about it.  (Unclear) says oh.  So the dean got up, closed the door, and came.  He says well, you know, so and so, who's the associate dean, is stepping down.  Are you interest, are you really interested?  I said oh, oh, okay, sure, I'm interested.  So that's how I became the associate dean (laughter) at Michigan State, just being in the right place at the right time.
Story_ID: 260833
Speaker 1: Then here, I had stepped down from the associate deanship, gone back to the faculty.  I'd had a sabbatical.  I visited at another law school for a semester.  And I was about to get married, you know, just you know, aah, what am I doing?  I'm just gonna kind of move around and see, see what's going on.  And I got a call.  I had been getting calls from a variety of people who said you know, you should really consider being a dean.  I said aah, I'm not quite ready to do that and just kind of kept putting it off.  And I got a call when I got back from visiting, and it was the dean search committee from here, saying we've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.  And I said well, I've been on sabbatical and out of town for a year, so, you know.  He said well, you've been nominated for the deanship.  Would you be willing to interview?  I said sure, why not?  I said if nothing else, I'll see how the process is and see how that works.  I had no in, no idea that I'd actually get the job, but I said well, I'll see.  I came up to Chicago [Illinois] for, it was supposed to be a two-hour interview with the, the dean search committee.  I says oh, okay.  So I walk into the room.  Clearly, they've been having some heated discussion when I walked in.  And I said (raised eyebrows)--why don't you come and sit over here?  I said (raised eyebrows), so I sat at the end of the table, and it's like twenty people around this table.  So we start talking, and the converso- sation I think is going very well.  And they were asking about what I thought about a variety of things at the law school and what I would do under these circumstances.  So I was just telling them what my experience had been at Michigan State [University College of Law, East Lansing, Michigan], how that would relate to this, and maybe you need to consider da-da, da-da, da-da, da.  So forty-five minutes into this two-hour interview, an elderly gentleman on the end of the table turned to this other person and said she's great.  This other elderly gentleman said well, thank you for coming.  I said okay, thank you (laughter).  I got up and walked out.  Forty-five minutes, oh, I guess I blew that, and went shopping (laughter), 'cause I had like five hours until the plane, you know, had lunch, got on the plane.  I got back to Detroit [Michigan] and got a call from (unclear) saying they want you to come to do the full interview.  Well, I was not prepared to do the full interview because I figured they'd never had a black dean here.  They only have three black faculty members.  What's the, the possibility here?  So I said plus, I wasn't expecting to get past the first interview, so what do I do now?  So I called some of my colleagues and said okay, you just did this dean search; what do I do now (laughter), kind of a thing.  And we all kind of shared information and said well, what do you think about doing this?  What do you think about doing this?  Do you know anybody on the committee?  Yes.  Call 'em and see about x, y, and z.  Okay. So, put together the package, came up for nonstop interviews, three days.  I met everybody, every single constituent group, from the alumni to the faculty to students, even the janitorial staff; I met everybody.  We had some very frank discussions about where the law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] is, the kinds of things a law school needed to do.  They provided me with reams and reams and reams of paper to go through.  And on the basis of that, I said well, this is, you know, I like this school.  I like the people.  This could be a good fit.  I understand the kinds of things, challenges that they have.  If they like me, fine.  And so I came for the, you do an interview.  You do a presentation to the faculty, and it's taped.  Okay, it's just the, the entire faculty.  So after I'd given my formal presentation, I just kind of walked out and started talking to people, and we're going back and forth.  So at one point, I leaned on a table.  When I moved, the table flipped over.  So I, I mean it pssf, about six feet up in the air this table flipped over.  And so everybody's kind of stunned, so I curtsied and kept going (laughter), you know.  So they said oh, (clapping)--(unclear).  So I said well, what can I do?  But we clicked.  And I figured well, (laughter) I don't know how many other people can flip a table, aah.  What was even funnier, was some of the faculty came over--
Speaker 2: How did this table flip (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, they were, they were saying, you know, that table does that all the time.  I said why didn't you te- tell me not to lean on it?  I mean I, I leaned on it and it--
Speaker 2: Say and one end just flipped the other end up?
Speaker 1: So I said okay.  But I got the job anyway (laughter), after flipping the table, so.  But, and then everything just started to speed up at that point.

Speaker 1: So I'd just gotten married [to Dr. Michael Steven Ragland].  My husband was in Kansas.  We'd never lived, we hadn't lived together.  I was thinking about having him come to, to Memphis [Tennessee].  Well, no, don't think, forget about Memphis.  It looks like we're going to Chicago [Illinois] (laughter).  So things were happening.  And then that fall, right when I started interviewing, my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] was diagnosed with cancer.  And so we were, we, we would talk every day anyway, and I had talked to the doctor.  He actually told me before he told her, because they were going in to, to do surgery to see what it was.  So, throughout the process, you know, my mother was saying well, are you gonna take the job [dean of The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois]?  This is your job.  I said ma, they haven't even offered me this job.  Well, but you're going to get it.  This is your job.  I said mother, you know, I don't know.  I mean they were telling me some of the other people who were applying.  I'm the only woman.  I'm the only black woman.  They've never had a black person here before.  That's a big step for a number of institutions.  No matter what your qualifications are, for them to put a black person in charge and a woman in charge is big step for some of 'em.  So I said don't get your hopes up, mom.  We're just gonna take it as whatever.  So, my mother had had the surgery before I went down for the interview, right before I had the interview.  The surgeon came back; they said it had spread.  So, she was trying to be really encouraging, and she really wanted me to take this job.  I said well, you know, mom, we'll just have to wait and see.  So, they were supposed to tell me in December.  Well, December came, you know, and they said we'll, we'll--the, the committee is gonna meet December 10, and so we'll let you know.  Well, December 10 came and went, so I figured I didn't get the job.  Okay, fine, but how I've already done a dean search.  I know what to do.  I can do this job, so I'll just apply for something else, okay, 'cause deanships come up all the time.  So I'm in Kansas with my husband, and the phone rings, and it's one of the gentleman from the dean search committee.  He says well, Pat [HistoryMaker Patricia Mell], we're gonna go with a different candidate, but we want you to know we really liked you, blah, blah, blah.  We'll send you, you know, write a recommendation for you for anybody, blah, blah, blah, da-da-da-da-da, but we don't want to announce it to the faculty yet.  And we want you to treat, you know, keep the confidence.  I said that's fine; I won't tell anybody anything.  So I had moved on.  You know, I said okay, fine, didn't get the job, but it was a great experience, da da da.

Speaker 1: So in January, every January, right after New Year's, all the law schools meet at the American Association of Law Schools [sic. Association of American Law Schools] annual conference.  So, everybody from every law school comes to this one place.  So we're in Washington [D.C.] this year I think.  So, it was hysterical because every single faculty members from this law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] must have gone to that conference.  And they would see me from across the, the room and said there she is.  And they'd come swarming over: Pat [HistoryMaker Patricia Mell], Pat, Pat!  Have you heard?  Have you heard?  Do you know anything?  I said well, no (laughter). They told, you know.  I said well, no, I haven't heard anything.  And they said oh, keeping people's lives on hold.  And I was kind of like, well, my life's not on hold, but okay, I thank you for that sentiment.  And I'm sure that, you know, you will soon be advised as to who, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right, 'cause I've moved on.  But every single faculty member must have, they were all, whenever they saw me, I mean they would point across the room.  And you'd see this group of people coming over: Pat, Pat, Pat, have you heard?  (Laughter) No, aahh.  So, I'm now visiting at Memphis [Cecil C. Humphreys School of Law, University of Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee] this semester.  It's February, the phone rings, and it's the dean search committee.  Pat, this is so and so.  Well, hi, how are you?  Pat, are you still interested?  I said still interested in what?  Well, the deanship.  I'm kinda like, okay, now they did announce that someone was in fact the dean, so the negotiations must have fallen through.  So I said well, okay, yes, I'd be interested in continuing the discussion with you.  Can you tell me what happened in the process, 'cause I thought that you had selected another person?  Well, they decided that they didn't really, the family didn't want to come to Chicago [Illinois] or blah, blah, blah, and I said okay.  So I said fine.  So it just so happened that this other person was also a minority.  So I said hmm, let me call him (laughter).  So I called him.  I said what's up?  What happened?  (Laughter) So he gave me the whole--I said oh, okay.  And I do understand why he would have handled things the way that he did.  The issue, the--I do understand why he decided to withdraw.  He didn't handle things the way that I would have, but I do understand why he did things that way.  I think it's just a difference in personality.  And so I said well, I think I can work with that.  But basically, he told me what they had offered him and all the stuff.  I said okay, thank you (laughter), so now we know what the baseline is.  And I came to talk to them again about it and decided to accept the job.  And so during the negotiations, my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] was funny.  She was saying, Pat, aren't you just--I said no, I'm not gonna just accept the job, no.  We haven't talked about salary.  We haven't talked about benefits, no.  (Laughter) She was going, take the job, take the job.  It's okay, I'll take the job, but.  So she helped me through the negotiation and all.  And on my way up here to accept the job, I got the call that she was dying, and I had to go to Cleveland [Ohio] for that, so.  But she was right there with me in making the decision and really has been, was a fabulous role model, as someone who was, you know, had a career, balanced a family.  She really did do it all and always supported me being able to get an education and do whatever I wanted to do.  She and my father [Julian Mell] were a very good team and set a really good example of what a team for a fifty plus year marriage really is all about.  But, so she died before I took the job, but she knew that I had taken it, and was very happy about that.

Speaker 1: I came that summer and had an interesting move.  There were two trucks, July 3 in Chicago [Illinois].  And they had tell me, well, you know, July 3 is the day that we have the fireworks here, and the streets are gonna be blocked off at 11:00.  So, you have a truck that's coming into the Loop [Chicago, Illinois], then you need to get it here before 11:00, and we'll block out a space for you to deliver.  Fine, so I'm at the, the apartment, and the truck's not here.  The truck supposed to be here at 8:00.  It's like, well, what, where is this truck?  So we get a call at 9:15, 9:30, saying the truck is on its way to the law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] meet us there.  So I pull oh, I pull up behind the trucks.  There were two of 'em.  And my assistant, Dorothy [ph.], had this stricken look on her face.  It's like, what's wrong?  She said have you seen the truck?  I said well there it is.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, have you seen the other truck?  So she pulls me around to the front of the truck.  It had one of those things were there's a little cab that goes over the, the little part that goes over the cab.  It was flattened, and it looked like someone had taken a large can opener and rolled back the top of the truck.  And the driver jumps out: there was no, the bridge wasn't marked.  The bridge wasn't marked.  It's not my fault.  It's not fault.  The bridge--it's like, well (laughter), nothing we--
Speaker 2: Was your, was your stuff damaged?  I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I said well, there's nothing we can do about it now.  So let's take the stuff out of here so that we can get out of the Loop in forty-five minutes.  So they dropped the stuff over here, came over to the house, were, and they were, of course, nuts by that time.  They were so upset by the virtue of the fact that they'd run into this bridge that was not--they were, they were gonna show me Polaroid pictures: see, there's no sign on the bridge (laughter).  I said yeah, I know.  I'm a lawyer.  I know this from law school.  You don't look (laughter).  You know, it's not, you know, just get the stuff in here.  So we got all that done and moved in.
Story_ID: 260837
Speaker 1: The faculty and, and staff have been fabulous.  Everybody really was ready for a change.  They have a real commitment to the law school, real commitment to the students, and to the City of Chicago [Illinois].  They were ready to do the kinds of things they'd always wanted to do and just never really had the go-ahead.  So we did an awful lot of planning and laid some really good foundations for the school.  So it's been really a wonderful, wonderful time.
Speaker 2: So, what, what, what kinds of things did they want to do that, that, that you--
Speaker 1: Well, in a lot of respects, the law school had just kind of rested on its laurels for too long.  Law schools are a business.  Now, it's a business that provides a specialized type of service, but it's also a business in a very competitive market.  DePaul [University College of Law, Chicago, Illinois] is literally right outside my door.  Chicago-Kent's [Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois] down the other way.  They're all within walking distance.  Loyola [University Chicago School of Law, Chicago, Illinois] is right here, Northwestern [University Law School; Northwestern Pritzker School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], and University of Chicago [Law School, Chicago, Illinois].  And for Loyola, DePaul, and Chicago-Kent, we basically are in the same market.  Now, this law school has some things going for it that the others don't, and that's the large number of graduate programs, and its pride in being an institution that prepares students to really practice law.  It's a school of opportunity.  Some of the most well-known minorities in this area, in the practice, graduated from this law school, and they're doing fabulously well, and really contributed to the law, society.  They've done great things.  And they wanted to continue that.
Speaker 2: Who are some of the people that came out--
Speaker 1: Oh, Timothy [C.] Evans graduated from this law school.
Speaker 2: He's a judge now not only--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he's the chief--
Speaker 2: --is a--
Speaker 1: --judge of Cook County [Illinois], which is the largest (laughter) county tort system in the world.  We have two [Illinois] Supreme Court justices who are our graduates.  We have one of the, the first black woman who was a delegate to the United Nations [UN], is one of our graduates, Ransom [sic. Edith S. Sampson] is her name, one of, graduated from [The] John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois], I mean very prestigious history of people from this law school.  The hall of distinction downstairs, we have the largest number of judges graduated from this law school.  So this is a law school for people practiced to become judges; they become government officials.  It's a very wonderful history.  But they've rested on their laurels a little bit too long.  I mean we have one of the oldest intellectual property programs in the country.  We'll be celebrating its sixty-fifth year next year.  It was ranked ninth I think last year, but it's slipped a bit because it really hasn't advertised what it does, the same with respect to our fair housing clinic, which has written bre- briefs, presented briefs to the United States Supreme Court on the issues of fair housing.  It's a fabulous center, but no one really connects it to the law school.  So, I mean there were a lot of pearls here, real gems that really weren't connected to the law school and its mission, because no one really kind of pulled together the marketing and really focused on the kinds of things that we do.  So they were ready to really demonstrate the kinds of things that John Marshall lawyers can do and wanted someone really with the energy to pull these things together, get people to move in the right, the same direction at the same time.  So, it was a good fit.
Story_ID: 260838
Speaker 1: Your energy kind of comes across when you talk.  You seem to be very energetic.  And so this is, there's a lot to--you know, how is, how is the school viewed by the black community, and do black people really--
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a school of opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  As I said, the first black graduate graduated in 1903 from this law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the school started in 1899, so it's, he was right on the--
Speaker 2: One of the first classes.  The first woman graduated in 1904.  It was founded on the principle that people from different backgrounds really going back to their neighborhoods, really contribute to the meaning of collective justice, because you need people from different backgrounds and perspectives really to be able to assist people.  And that's what this law school has always been about.  These days it's a struggle to balance the needs of remaining a school of opportunity with being a school of high quality as well, because you have to make sure that people pass the bar.  And the law school for a while just kind of didn't, didn't really keep up with the demands of being a tuition-driven institution but also making sure that the students had a rigorous enough education that they would be passing the bar at the end.  So they had a slump in bar passage rate.  When we came in, the couple of the administrators have put together a proposal for a program to raise the bar passage rate.  And the raised the bar passage rate 30 percent one year, so they were dedicated and on it.  And the bar passage rate's gone up substantially, has gone up continually since then.  The entering credentials of the class, we just did this marketing campaign.  We have ads on WTTW [Chicago, Illinois].  I did interviews on United's [United Airlines, Chicago, Illinois] overseas flights.  I mean they did a whole lot of things, but it increased the positive views of the law school to the point that we had an increase in 25 percent increase in our applications.  And the quality is up substantially, so we're really happy.  The people are really beginning to remember us as a school that really is one of high quality but also is able to balance the needs of this academic intellectual pursuit with the practicality of how, yeah, I should put the two together for practice.  That's what we do here.  And I think that we're well on our way to, to regaining our, our stars rising, so to speak, because of the faculty and the staff, and everyone is really committed to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what is it, what's the percentage of the black students here?
Speaker 2: About 24 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Now, they're split between day and evening.
Story_ID: 260839
Speaker 1: And what are the, your future goals?  Do you have any, any, any things, I mean any innovative things planned for the future that you're working on--
Speaker 2: Well, my aspirations for the school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] are that each one of its centers of excellence be ranked nationally.  Eventually, I'd like to see the intellectual property center [Center for Intellectual Property, Information & Privacy Law], the intellect, the international business transaction center [Center for International Law], and our employee benefits [Center for Tax Law & Employee Benefits] and our real estates centers [Center for Real Estate Law] be in the top ten in the country, our advocacy program as well.  Advocacy and IP [intellectual property] have been in the top ten, so it's not difficult for us to get those back in the top ten.  The others haven't been ranked, but we have some fabulous faculty.  We just hired a number of faculty members this last year who are a rare combination of a dynamic professor but also very well written, very academic, has written very well, extensively, and are good teachers.  So, I would like to get the reputation of the school up so that it is recognized as being better than our local competitors, which we really are, but we have to get the reputation up there to match with the reality.  I eventually would like to see us have a new facility.  We're kind of bursting at the seams here.  I'd like to see the graduate enrollment in our programs increased and probably the size of the J.D. program reduced.  I'd like to hire a couple more high visible faculty members.  And I'd like to provide the fact, the assisting faculty opportunities to have more experience abroad and to connect them with scholars and other institutions who would like to do, you know joint research projects.  So, and I'd like to get a few more grant proposals in as well.
Story_ID: 260840
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about juvenile court.  I know you, you shared some opinions with a Detroit [Michigan] paper concerning the, the, seems to be the tendency of the courts to try youth offenders as adults now, you know, more and more to the point that, you know, juvenile court, which was established here in Chicago [Illinois] over a hundred years ago, may not really even exist anymore.  If that, if this keeps on.  You know, what, what do you--
Speaker 2: I think that, that the discussions about trying juveniles as adults is a reflection of society's frustration.  It's a frustration over, what do you do when you see younger and younger people creating more and more violent crimes?  Obviously, the types of support systems that young people might have had a generation or two ago from an extended family to schools that can actually pay attention to what children do after school and afterschool programs to churches, which would kind of socialize people.  Those kinds of supports aren't there.  As a result, children are basically exposed to things that perhaps they should not be exposed to.  And they're getting into serious trouble, use of guns, selling drugs, all of these kinds of things, which are a bad, you know, it's a bad situation, a very difficult problem.  But the support systems to get people out of those situations, they aren't there, so you see children, thirteen year olds, twelve year olds, eleven year olds, ten year olds who are committing violent crimes.  What do you do with the?  And for a long time society's answer has been the criminal law.  The criminal law socializes.  The criminal law pen- penalizes.  It does not rehabilitate.  But perhaps society has tacitly made the decision that these people cannot be rehabilitated, even though they're twelve or eleven or ten.  That's a serious problem.  On the one hand, you want to make sure that society is protected, which is what the penal system does.  On the other hand, you want to at least try to assist young people in correcting errors where they can.  It's a pendulum.  Right now, the sense seems to be that there are too many of these violent crimes going on by these young offenders, and we need to punish them harshly.  There does not seem to be a recognition that a young, youthful offender can, in fact, be rehabilitated at only twelve.  Perhaps there are things we can do for them other than put them into a prison population.  There doesn't seem to be the societal sentiment in doing that anymore.  That's going to have some very serious consequences for us as a nation, ten years from now, fifteen years from now.  In the short run, it means that these people won't be on the streets.  But in the long run, it means that we will have lost another generation of young men.  But there is not a societal cry to do anything other than take them off the streets because of the fear that people have with respect to them being there.  It's unfortunate, but that's where I think things are going right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sometimes the voices in the black community cry out the loudest for the severest punishment for--
Speaker 2: Oh, black people are very--
Speaker 1: --black offenders.
Speaker 2: --very conservative when it comes to punishing crime, very conservative, because they, you know, as a people, black people in the community are most likely to be the ones who, who suffer from those kinds of crimes.  Of course, black people are gonna be the ones who want to see the most severe penalties.  In the short run, it works.  In the long run, all people are gonna feel, feel the pinch for the loss of a whole generation of people, of young men in particular.  Although what we're seeing now is that young women are more and more becoming the offenders for these kinds of violent crimes.  That's tragic, absolutely tragic.
Story_ID: 260841
Speaker 1: What would you see as the biggest challenge to, I guess, facing a law school trying to prepare young lawyers and legal minds today?
Speaker 2: In the last twenty-five years, or should I say the first twenty-five years of my practice of law, the world has changed dramatically by virtue of the spurt in technology, in technology and development.  It now means that a purely local attorney, attorney who's never left the City of Chicago [Illinois] might have a small business client that has a customer in Japan.  Because of the Internet, lawyers are also being challenged by legal services online.  Why pay an attorney $3000 when you can just get these forms online and do a will?  Why buy an attorney to set up your business when all you need to do is to follow these steps and this form, these forms that I'm going to give you.  So, lawyers are being faced by a number of challenges, first of all in their experience in the global marketplace, being able to deal with the various treaties necessary to get business done abroad online, and secondly, by challenges to being able to do some of the simple, simpler kinds of functions, will and trusts, setting up businesses, divorces, all of these kinds of things that were the bread and butter for small to medium-sized firms, which are the majority of the firms in existence.  Those things are being challenged now by other types of providers.  And so to really prepare law students for a practice in this kind of a dynamic market, you, we are trying very hard to tell them about the business of doing law, and how you make connections, and how you do referrals, and how you get the experience working with clients overbroad, overseas, so that you get some kind of an international experience so that you know at least what page to go to or what, what treaty to look at.  If you're trying to sell goods to Japan or China, which is a burgeoning economy, without any kind of--there's no precedent for what China could do.  So how do you deal with a country that basically can shift the market by virtue of what price they offer their goods for?  How do you make those kinds of connections internationally when you are just right here in Chicago?  So, trying to expose them to people who were practicing law in China.  As a matter of fact, the law school [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] has like a hundred alumni in China by virtue of some of our, our relationships; trying to assist them in dealing with a very diverse United States population, getting them used to the notion that perhaps you might learn, need to learn a language, a foreign language, so that you can really deal with your clients one on one; trying to encourage them to get different types of experiences while they're in law school, so that they will at least have a frame of reference when they actually get out and practice; and making sure that they know the basics inside and out and they're intellectually stimulated enough so that they can make the transition from just the bread and butter topics to asking the kinds of complex questions that come about in the real practice.  So it's a challenge, but I think it's one that this law school in particular is up to because of its history.  It's changed to meet the market for over 105 years.  This is just another change.  It's being pushed a lot I think by the technology because the Internet is such a compete, it's, it's a wonderful tool, but it's also a weapon being used against us and that lawyers can--clients can pick up stuff off the Internet.  They, you know, as they say: a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.  So when the clients come into the, the lawyer's office now, it's like well, why should I pay you $3000?  Because I just read on the Internet X, Y, and Z.  And you know, telling students, so what you're telling is well, you know, information is not knowledge.  You can have all that information, but if you don't know how to effectively use it, what good is it?
Speaker 1: Is there sort of an ethical kind, I mean a, a crisis in the public's perception of the ethics of lawyer--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --and, and I think that's always been around.  And, but in a, there's a, I think there's a common perception that people have that lawyers, that law is just a series of loopholes and, and rules that if you master these you can--
Speaker 2: Well, it's a love/hate--
Speaker 1: --manipulate your way--
Speaker 2: --relationship.
Story_ID: 260842
Speaker 1: When you train to be a lawyer you do learn how things work.  There's an advantage to learning how things work because it puts you ahead of the game.  But by tame- same token, because you do have that knowledge, lawyers do have a higher responsibility to act ethically.  And there is no school for ethics really.  I mean people come to the law with whatever moral upbringing they have.  It doesn't change just because they go to law school.  And unfortunately, those, and I think few, relatively few, bad actors do give all lawyers a bad name.  Lawyers need to be much more vigilant about identifying those people who do break the rules and having the courts call them to task for it.  Because until you actually police yourself, the public is justified in having these kinds of beliefs.  And I understand that new television show, what is it, 'Boston Practice' [sic. 'Boston Legal'] or something with, with Captain Kirk [William Shatner], some of that stuff that was just absolutely--I said disbar that person.  Some of the stuff they see on television is just ridiculous.  It gives a ridiculous view of what the practice of law is.  The practice of law, if you're doing it correctly, is not glamorous.  It is a lot of hard work.  It is a lot of time spent in a library.  It is lot of time waiting for cases to start.  It is a lot of time listening to people who are unhappy, who are angry, who are frustrated.  It is a lot of people work.  It is a service profession.  And if lawyers forget that, then they lose their way.  It is a very difficult profession, and you do students a disservice not to really prepare them for the kinds of challenges that they're gonna face.

Speaker 1: What does the landscape look like for black lawyers today, I mean (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I frankly don't think that there are enough lawyers, period, but I definitely don't think that there are enough black lawyers.  The law is the kind of profession that you can use in just about any industry.  You don't have to go to court, really, to be a lawyer.  And in fact, if you've done your job properly in putting together a deal, you never go to court.  You go to court when something's wrong.  So teaching students the art of the deal, how to put things together so they don't fall apart, that's really critical I think.
Speaker 1: Are there, are there a high percentage of black lawyers practicing criminal law today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there probably are, but I, I really couldn't tell you how many.  There have been some highly visible cases.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that Johnnie Cochran--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Johnnie Cochran--
Speaker 1: --he's the most--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's probably the best--
Speaker 1: --one of the most visible in--
Speaker 2: Right, the most visible.
Speaker 1: --(unclear), but, but are there that many black lawyers actually involved in criminal law today, I mean as a result of--and do, and do they seem--
Speaker 2: Are more that--
Speaker 1: --to be attracted to--
Speaker 2: I don't know if more--
Speaker 1: --to--
Speaker 2: --black lawyers do criminal law proportionately than--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --than white.  I don't, I can't say that.  At this point, I would have to say that I think black lawyers are nicely spread through a lot of different disciplines in the law.  The question is really how far up they've reached in law firms.  How many are managing partners in a law firm?  I think there are still a few of those, too few, for the number of lawyers that we do have now.  Those are the kinds of challenges that face black lawyers.  But I do think that there are black lawyers who do all kinds of law, from intellectual property and patent kinds of cases to domestic relations to tax.  They're pretty well spread I think throughout the various disciplines.
Speaker 1: Can you see yourself in the future, in any, any time in the future maybe working for a black law school?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I think there are only a couple anyway--
Speaker 2: Only a couple, yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I think, what do we got, like, we got Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and what else?  We've--
Speaker 2: Oh, North Carolina--
Speaker 1: North Caro--okay.
Speaker 2: --Central [North Carolina Central University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina].  I could see that happening.  That'd be an interesting challenge too, yeah.  I mean there are a lot of different types of law schools, and working for an historically black law school I think would be a wonderful honor, a wonderful honor to have.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Probably my, my largest concern for the African American community is my sense that we're not educating our children well enough to compete globally.  When I've traveled abroad, what I have seen is an enormous amount of energy being spent, and effort and financing, being spent to educate children across the board, not just rich children, but children in the inner city.  I remember what kind of education I had in the segregated schools.  It was an excellent education.  There's no reason that we can't have that kind of quality education now in public schools, except nobody wants to spend the money to do it.  I think that is a travesty.  That's my concern.  I would like to see every child be able to have a good education and be able to have access to post-secondary education, because nobody's gonna make it with just a high school degree anymore.  You can't do that and compete.  There are always exceptional people who are able to do that, but most people aren't exceptional.  They need as much education as they can get to compete.  And we are now seeing a whole lot of competition from overseas.  It's not just the domestic market that our children have to compete with.  It's people from all over the world, and I don't think we're cuttin' it with respect to education here.  That's my largest concern.
Speaker 1: How do you think the, in, in terms of the black community, how do we really get control of it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I think that we really have to be able to support single parents so that they can work but also be able to be there for their children.  I think that we ought to have daycare and aftercare for children so they can get support in, in education while mom and dad, mom and/or dad is working.  I think we need to really encourage children to, to learn, that learning is in fact fun, and it's fundamental.  We need to do that as a group.  I don't have any children of my own, but that's one of my concerns for the black community.  We, in fact, we adopted [George B.] Swift [Specialty] School [Chicago, Illinois], north side of town.  We go and the law students did a, a mock trial, the trial of Goldilocks (laughter) for the students--but, but showing them that there are opportunities.  A lot of African American children are encouraged by the, the images they see of the various sports figures, and that's great.  But they don't realize that you have to be exceptional, exceptional, not good, not excellent, exceptional to make it there.  And what happens if you get so far, but you don't have anything else?  Education is your backup.  You need to get that education so that you can have the flexibility necessary to make it, making sure that children in the African American community know that there are opportunities for you.  I may be only the second black woman to do this, but you too can do this.  And they'll be more people in the room when you do it than when I did it; letting them know that there are other opportunities.  There are other options for you if you have an education.  You're not limited if you have an education.  They can't take that away from you.

Speaker 1: When you look back at all the things you've done so far, and you're still young, and how, I mean is there, is there any one major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I probably would have taken some more math classes (laughter).  I probably would have gotten another degree.  I probably would have gotten an M.B.A. as well as a J.D.  I probably would have listened more to my mother [Thelma Webb Mell] when she told me that I was gonna go back into education 'cause I didn't want to (laughter), but probably would have traveled more.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you ever regret not becoming a trial lawyer or--
Speaker 2: I was a trial lawyer for four years.
Speaker 1: Well, okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, did that (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you didn't wanna, you didn't wanna stay, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I decided--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --that, you know, I loved wearing the white hat for the consumers.  That was a, that was a lot of fun.  But it is a very tough job.  You're always working.  You're always on trial.  My, my general day would be that I'd get up at six, eat, in the office by eight, I'd leave the office at eight, work for another two hours, go to bed.  And because I worked for the state, I was always preparing for trial, 'cause I didn't have to settle.  So, that kind of thing grinds you down after a while.  And I was at the point that I needed a break, just to kind of sort things out to see if that's what I really wanted to do.  So, I enjoyed litigation.  I don't think I'd want to go back to it.  I enjoy teaching, love this.  I love the administrative aspects of this.  And I enjoy being able to help an institution like this [The John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois] take its first steps in the 21st century.  That's a real joy and a real honor.

Speaker 1: Say I was a ten year old aspiring lawyer, you know, what, what kind of courses should I take, and what should I be preparing myself to do to, to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: You should read everything you can.  You cannot write well unless you have read a lot, so read.  Read things that you're interested in.  Read things you don't think you're interested in because you may discover something else.  Go to a concert.  Listen to music that you don't like.  Try different things like that to stretch the limits of, of your experience.  Take an art class, even if you're bad at it.  Learn an instrument, even if you're bad at it.  Try to learn a, a language.  All of those kinds of experiences will help you figure out what you are good at, help you discover your own talents.  And once you've discovered your talents, be proud of them and develop them as much as you possibly can.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done so far, and you know, you still have a way to go, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy? I think that probably my legacy is taking this opportunity on with the kinds of challenges.  Being female and, and black presents different types of challenges as you go into the corporate market to raise money for an institution.  You have to strategize things a little bit differently I think than if you're male.  Being black and female has advantages in the sense that they don't expect you.  And so they know who you are.  That gives you an advantage.  Being able to--I think that the, the real legacy would be that I assisted the institution in taking the steps necessary for it to be on solid ground for its second century in legal education, that I opened doors for the [The John Marshall] Law School [Chicago, Illinois] to make connections in China, that I strengthened the, the bonds between the law school and the City of Chicago [Illinois] and its alumni base, and that I continued the legacy of, of opportunity and access at this school.  I think that would be my, my legacy.

Speaker 1: The only thing that, that, you know, I talked a lot about how much of an influence my parents were, but particularly my mother [Thelma Webb Mell], who I saw as a true leader.  My mother never raised her voice.  She was only 5'3", so I was taller than she was when I was twelve.  But she always made her presence known.  She was always a motivating force.  She and my grandmother sat me down as I was going to school and said you realize that we are spending more on one year of education for you than we spent for all four years of your older brother's [Julian Mell III] education--well, no, I didn't realize that, but, okay--and we are doing this for a reason.  I said okay.  And she said because as a woman, you have the opportunity not only to do something for yourself, but you have the opportunity to do something for all black women.  So you remember where you came from, and remember who you are.  And so for them, I am carrying their legacy forward.  And I remember them every day, and they're with me every day.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I would like to be remembered as a generous spirit, a fair person, a fun person, and someone who was willing to do the right thing when it wasn't popular.  That's what I'd like to be remembered for--
