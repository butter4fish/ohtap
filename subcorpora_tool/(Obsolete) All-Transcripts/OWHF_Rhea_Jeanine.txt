Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, July 22, 2008, and I am in Tulsa, Oklahoma  interviewing Dr. Jeanine Rhea. This interview is being conducted as  part of the inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Dr. Rhea was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 2005. Thank you for joining us today.  I   m very pleased to be here.  Well let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you, where you grew  up, and if you could give us a little background on your early life.  I grew up 13 miles south of Omaha, Nebraska in a small town, 6,000  people, called Plattsmouth. It   s where the Platt River meets the Missouri  River. And it was a life of   everyone in town had the right to correct,  advise, discipline, and come to your wedding from the time I was born  until I left. Well even now occasionally. (Laughs) They don   t mind  giving their opinion as to what you should be doing. I went through  school with many of my classmates, from the time we were in  kindergarten through high school graduation. We graduated with 84 in  our class.  We had a movie theater   we called it a    picture show,    but it burned.  So, we were pretty much left up to our own designs as to how to create  fun, but we had lots of slumber parties and, of course, the farm area was  a big part of our lives. We were known as    city kids.    Probably the thing  that took up a lot of my time growing up   there were probably three  things. I was an avid reader. I loved to read and I could walk from my  house to the library. It was probably a mile and a half or two miles to do  that, but it was a very pleasant, sociable meander through the town. So I  spent a lot of time with my books and reading. I loved to read. The other  things that I did, I took piano lessons from Miss Kitty Roberts, who was  5  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  a very strict disciplinarian. I never learned to play the piano but I learned  a lot from Miss Roberts.  I took dancing from Jean Lockin. When I was nine, I   d heard that there  were children who were taking dancing lessons. So one day when it was  my mother   s time to clean the church   volunteer to clean the church   I  went with her. The church was about three blocks from the library, up on  a hill   this is very hilly area. I   d heard this lady was down there  teaching, so I walked down there and went in. When she had time, I told  her that I was there to start dancing lessons. So then I went back to the  church and told my mother when my next dancing lesson was and that I  needed tap shoes and  5, because it was going to be  5 a month to take  lessons. So she decided that since I wanted to do that so badly     Dancing was a huge part of my life for a long, long time. I was probably  28 before I quit teaching dance and ballet. It just became more and more  a bigger part of my life, as music was. I had many, many friends, still  do, from my hometown, and we still get together. We still get on the  phone. We still e-mail. They   re still with me.  What were some of your favorite subjects when you were in school when  you were younger?  Well, English   I loved literature and so my major at the university  actually was in English because I was a student of English and literature.  I student taught for one semester   English   and decided those students  didn   t like English nearly as much as I did. And I didn   t think I   d be a  very good English teacher. I actually had taken enough business courses  that I was certified to teach. But English was my favorite, and language  always fascinated me.  When you were a youth, did you aspire to become a teacher or a  professional dancer?  Oh, actually   this is true and I   ve told it many times. When I was five  and went to my kindergarten class and I met Miss Poppy for the first  time   whom I thought when I was five was old, but she was probably     I don   t know, 19 or 20   she probably had only two years of university.  Because, at that time you could do that. But I walked into that classroom  and saw the most powerful woman in the world. She held the chalk, and  I knew I always wanted to be the person with the chalk. I never ever  deviated. I was going to be a classroom teacher, and I loved it. I just  never could believe that people would actually pay me to go in there and  spout off to a captive audience, but they did.  Now where did you go on to receive your undergraduate education?  6  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  I went the first two years to a Methodist private liberal arts school,  Nebraska Wesleyan. That   s where I met my husband. We were married  at the end of our sophomore year, and we transferred to the University of  Nebraska. We were so involved at Wesleyan that we knew they would  never let us out of all of the activities we were in at Wesleyan, and so we  transferred to Nebraska. He had a dance band and was on the radio as a  disc jockey. I had the dance studio and we made a lot of money during  that time, going to school and being married.  There was no married student housing then. In fact, they weren   t looking  very kindly in 1958 upon students being married and at the university.  That was a challenge, but we graduated from the University of  Nebraska. When we finished, we both said,    We will never darken the  door of an institution of higher education again in our lives.    We   d just  worked too hard and life had been happening. It really took us three  years to finish those last two years. I had gotten quite ill and we had to  put off and take    I   s    and so we were done.  We moved to Nebraska City and I opened a dance studio there. People  in Nebraska City didn   t even know I had a degree. The only one that  knew was the principal of the high school because he   d been my band  teacher when I was in high school. Now he was the principal of  Nebraska City High School. So one day I got the call,    Jeanine, we have  to have you come and substitute.    So I went in to be a substitute teacher,  and that was a big    A-ha    for most of my friends in this new community  we were in. But, as it happens, we loved our time there. Two of our  daughters were born there. We built a brand new house there. I thought  we were set for life. Jim was a sales manager and then an assistant  manager at the radio station. I had the dance studio, so we were happy,  but he decided he wanted to go on and get a master   s degree. So, we  moved to Lawrence, Kansas, and that   s when I started teaching in  Kansas City in a high school, and it was business that they wanted to  have me teach. I was a certified business teacher. I   d taken enough hours  to get that accomplished.  Now was it more shorthand and typing or was it different?  I actually got hired to teach shorthand, which I was terrible at. That   s the  reason I got hired at this high school, and I taught it one semester. I  taught office management and then consumer economics. I really moved  then, I never ever taught shorthand again. Because I was teaching  consumer economics, the Kansas Savings and Loan offered me the  opportunity to take a graduate course in money and banking at the  University of Kansas. So I did that. Everybody else in the class already  had their master   s and they were working on PhDs. So I didn   t know  anything, and everything that Dr. Leland Pritchard said to me was  7  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  gospel. So I finished at the top of the class because I didn   t have any  other stuff in my head except what he said in his book. Of course, he  was quoted two times on the front page of The Wall Street Journal while  I was in that class, so he had high credibility, and that was really a  turning point for me because that   s when I decided maybe I could  possibly go back and do a master   s. The other part about all of this is, we  probably have to recognize that as we were going through each of these  stages there were many changes going on all around us in the United  States. The girls  Rhea   s daughters  were born in    62 and    64 and I  started teaching in    65, in January of    65. My students were going off to  fight in the Vietnam War. It was not a fun time.  When we moved to Memphis, Jim took a teaching position when he  finished his master   s. We moved to Memphis, and I had a graduate  assistantship then in the College of Business in computer science.  And what was the course work like back then when you were working on  your master   s?  Unique   I know what a dinosaur feels like because I finished that  degree in 1969 and of course computers changed significantly.  Everything I did was on big charts of paper. We did mapping and all  kinds of wiring panels and star wheels and punch cards and anything  you read about the history of computers. FORTRAN was our basic  language and that   s what the courses were.  While I was working on my master   s degree in Memphis the sanitation  strike happened and we were all put on curfew. You couldn   t be out past  a certain time. You couldn   t buy more than a gallon or two of gasoline at  the time. And some of my graduate classes were at night. Well, during  that Spring term, the first few weeks we couldn   t meet at night because  we were on curfew. We sort of did everything during the daytime. We   d  check with our professors and see what we had to do and turn in  assignments. So the first time our night class met was the night Dr. King  was assassinated, and we were in class   and Dr. Peoples was our  professor   and the highway patrol came to our door and opened the  door and said,    You all are dismissed. You will go immediately to your  homes.    Dr. Peoples was very offended. He said,    They   re taking a mid-term  examination.    He said,    Not anymore.     So everything changed overnight, and then of course we left Memphis in  1969. We had loved Memphis   the people, everything we learned  there, my professors. It was only a positive experience for us. We left  there for Jim to finish his PhD, and he   d been working on it at Kansas,  the University of Kansas. His major professor had moved to Ohio     Ohio University in Athens   so we decided we would take a year   s leave  8  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  of absence from Memphis for him to begin that degree and see what  could happen   not begin it   he   d already had quite a bit out of the way.  As it ended up, we rented our house to some people that were coming  in   a young couple   and our neighbors took care of it for us while we  were gone. We just didn   t even worry about it. Jim worked very, very  hard on his PhD and he did it   they   re on the quarter system, so he was  actually able to finish it in 15 months. But while we were there, Kent  State happened and Jim was out interviewing for other jobs and Ohio  University closed down while   I mean we were having   tear gas and  everything happened during that time. So they closed the university and  then the only way he could do his research was to have a special little  paper card or tag to get into the computer center or the library or  wherever he needed to go. Well this time he   d been gone we had a riot,  so he   s trying to get back into Athens and the National Guard won   t let  him in.  So now by this time we have a new baby who   s been born in Athens   a  boy   and I had to load up all three of those children way early in the  morning   and of course, no cell phones   head out to where the  National Guard was and say to the checkpoint Charlie,    Yes, that   s Jim  Rhea. Let him in.    So he was able to come back in. The closest we ever  came to getting a divorce though, you know that little white card I was  telling you about? I washed it (Laughter) and he was not a happy camper  over that. But you know, the good news was, he   d been in and out of the  library and the computer center often enough that the security guards  never asked him for it, because we knew we would have a terrible time  getting that back. (Laughs)  So when we moved to Stillwater   we didn   t go back to Memphis, and  there were some real reasons. The university had helped us as far as  financially but then they weren   t willing to increase his pay like other  universities were willing to do. So we just paid Memphis State back   at  the time it was called Memphis State, now it   s the University of  Memphis. But OSU called and he looked in Alabama, Indiana, and he  had offers from those three schools, and he chose Stillwater. My parents  were exceptionally happy because when we got to Stillwater in 1970,  August 23rd, it was like the    60s had not happened. The most traumatic,  dangerous thing that happened in Stillwater, Oklahoma was    streaker  night.    (Laughter) And then when we got there, I started on my degree.  From Dr. King to    streaker night        Right. But all of that has made a difference in my perceptions   the  dancing when I was really involved and growing up as a dancer, I would  go to Omaha to take lessons most of the time. Many of the children there  were not of the same race that I was, and we got very close and  9  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  comfortable and friends, and that was very early on. I think all of that  made a difference in the way that I ended up teaching a class on  diversity with never having had any course work in the area. Of course,  there wasn   t any, you had to make it up as you went.  When you were working on your master   s degree and your PhD, were  there many women or minorities in your classes?  Master   s, it wasn   t too bad   at the doctorate level, it would be me and  the boys   it could be me and 40 males. The worst problem I think I ever  felt was when I went in to a class and there were 11 males in there and  they had already taken a class together and now here I was, and they  were not happy. And of course, all kinds of comments. Dr. Ralph  Catalanello was the professor of that class. I can   t believe I remembered  that   but he was a wonderful professor, very open. I learned so much  from him, not just in the class but outside of class because he would  allow you to come and have discussions and interaction and   great  mind.  But the very first night of class, the men in the class were saying things  like,    Oh, now we   re going to have to clean up our language    and    Oh, I  guess we can   t go to the Grey Fox anymore      they called it the Fox. It  was a tavern just off campus where   there   s a bookstore there now but  evidently that was one of the things that they enjoyed doing together.  And we never actually ever did go to the Grey Fox again, but by the end  of the term, I learned a big lesson because the next semester, instead of  just the 11 being together in a class for a second time, the 12 of us were  going into another class together   a graduate class with a different  professor   and a new person was coming into the class. The new person  was male, and they began to treat him very much like they had treated  me, just different kind of slams. So I was very aware that it had a lot  more to do with building that team and that commonality than just  probably the fact that I was a female   at least that   s the way I chose to  see it.  Did you plan on becoming a professor?  You know, that   s interesting because I had loved teaching in high school  so very much and I knew it was important to get a master   s degree but I  hadn   t really ever planned at all on going past that. It was at the urging  of the   well, at that point when we were in Stillwater Jim was a  department head in Radio-TV-Film and so I was a faculty wife with  three small children. I was volunteering but I wasn   t working. Well  when the faculty in the College of Business knew that I   d gotten my  master   s degree and knew where it came from because that was a  respected program, at the dances and things that we had together, social  10  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  events, they would be saying   like Dr. John Bale, Herb Jelly, Dr.  Garrison   they would be saying to me,    You need to get into our  doctoral program. You have to get into it.    I was going,    I don   t even  think I could pass a test to get into it,    but finally I just said,    What the  heck. I   m here. Might as well try,    and I got an assistantship right away  so that was it.  Was your area of focus, research always minority, women or was it  something totally different?  Well it was really, because I   d come out of the computer keyboarding  background. My doctoral dissertation, what I did was I   d heard that there  were some new programs out where they were teaching children to  keyboard without a teacher in there   without a classroom teacher. So I  really wanted to test that and see if it made a huge difference to have a  teacher or have the technology. So my dissertation was an experimental  design in the Stillwater Public Schools. They actually let me use the  seventh grade students, and I had 60 students   30 were in traditional  taught classroom and 30 were in the experimental class   and it was a  wonderful, wonderful research project and it got nominated actually for  a research award. It was one of the top three at one of the conferences     it   s been so long I can   t even remember now. But I transported by school  bus every day five days a week, 60 children came at two different times.  I managed both classrooms, but one classroom I couldn   t do any  teaching. All I could do was answer a question, and we did a random  sample. I had the same amount of males and females   and the bizarre  thing was one young man broke his arm and by golly in the other class a  young woman broke her arm within seven days.  Very strange.  Very   and I promise, people accused me of going out and breaking her  arm, but I did not do that  (Laughs) We tested them on a whole battery  of tests. I don   t even remember all now, but it had to do with their  agility, it had to do with their IQ, and we looked at many, many  variables in that.  Was the one group using computer-based training? And I guess  computers were a little smaller from the larger models, just a little bit,  possibly?  Actually it was not computer   it was programmed learning. The books  had come out for the students to do it on their own, just read and do the  program.  Oh, okay.  11  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  It didn   t have the technology, no.  Okay. And after you finished your PhD, was there a plan for OSU to  hire you or were you looking at other schools?  No, no   oh, yes. I thought for sure because actually the whole family  was getting ready to leave   I mean even our daughters. One of them  called a family meeting and said,    We   ve been here three years. How  long are we planning on being here? It   s time to move on,    and she was  seven at the time. So, no, I did not plan to stay in Stillwater, but the  department head called me in and they had   I don   t remember for sure,  either two or three positions that were going to be open. I think maybe  two   and they were bringing in different candidates, and he said,    I  think you should put your name in.    And I said,    I will not do that if  you   re just trying to be nice, because I   m not interested and I don   t want  to play any games here.    He said,    You know, you   ve had teaching  experience. You   ve owned your own business. You   ve done all of these  things, and you   re going to have to go through the whole process, but we  want to interview you.    So I did and they did, and there we stayed.  What did you start out teaching now that you were hired on?  Business communication and methods. At one time, we had a business  education program, and I had been a certified teacher and had taken  methodology classes so when I got hired I became one of the supervisors  for business teacher education. We would have students in methods  classes and in student teaching and first-year teaching and that really  was my area for many years. I think it was probably 1980-something or  around 1975 that I started teaching a class called    women in business     and then it became    administrative strategies for women in business     and then it became the diversity class. So that was early on that that took  hold. So I guess only the first couple years, I taught business  communication, and then I taught organizational communication which  was at a different   the first class was really a letter writing class. Gosh  you   re making me think of things from a long time ago.  I   m sorry.  That   s all right. That   s your job.  Going back to what would become the diversity class   when you started  teaching it, what was the class population?  All female because it was about   well, what had happened, we were  growing in the College of Business, but the reason we were growing was  because of the women students coming into the college majoring in  12  marketing management, finance, accounting, economics, and not just in  the office management or business education areas. I just became very  aware   and it was like overnight   that I just said,    Oh, we have got to  do something. This is not okay. These young women are coming in here  and if they see any films   there weren   t videotapes   and there were  cases   but I   d been through the program so I knew what those were  like, and women were always the problem. They were never the solution  to the problem. They were never the director, the project person, the  chair. They were always cleaning up behind somebody and taking care  of the messes, or they created the messes. I just felt very strongly that  these new young women needed to understand that number one, the  rules were not the same for them as they were for the young men   they  just were not   and they needed to know that. It was not fair for them. I  knew we would lose many of them if they weren   t aware that it was not  their fault, that people would say things to them   hurtful, awful  things   set low expectations.  So I went to my department head   Dr. Lloyd Garrison has to be a prince  among men because he had the patience of Job with me. Here he had  this female in there turning over tables all of the time causing a ruckus,  and he supported me. I said,    I need to go talk to somebody, and I know  there   s a woman at Southern Methodist University and she   s been doing  some investigation into women   s issues and I   ve got to go talk to her.     Well I went to talk to her. We spent two days together, and the last piece  of advice she gave me was,    Don   t go there. Don   t get involved. It will  break your heart and you will have a nervous breakdown,    and I told my  husband about that and he said,    Well, I think you have your challenge  now. Sounds like it   s a plan.     I went back and started working on an outline, and somebody in  Sociology helped me get a copy of research that had been done at  Harvard University. It was the research that the book The Managerial  Woman was based on by Henning and Jardim. I got a copy of that  dissertation. So before the book was published, out of that book, I was  able to create my own questions   you know, besides the questions I  had. I looked at the questions they had and I applied for an OSU  Presidential Challenge Grant to do work in the area of women in  business. At that very time, the university was interested, and Jay Boggs  was the Academic Vice President. He   d sent a message to the dean  saying,    We want a course from the College of Business          Spotlight  on Women    they were called   and here I was digging around. So I  walked out into the hall and all my male colleagues were around and I  said,    Okay, guys. We   re gonna have a class and it   s dealing with  women. What are we going to call it?    They just said,    Just call it     women in business.       So we did, and the first class that was offered was  offered with 12 women in the summer, and they really helped create the  13  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  outline for what would happen.  So all that Fall term I worked on that research. I went to Wichita and  interviewed people at Lear, Cessna, Boeing, Coleman and Fourth  National Bank. They were all male-oriented work environments and I  gathered some amazing information, and out of that created the basis for  this class. There weren   t any books published. Honestly, at that time, if  there were any magazines out there that had it, it was McCall   s. And  women   s magazines, occasionally you   d find something in there, but  none of the professional magazines had anything or our academic  magazines had anything that we could use. We operated out of the  newspaper   events, things that had happened. It was amazing. So that  Fall the class was created called    administrative strategies for women in  business    and it was a junior/senior class. Those first 12 women helped  with that outline and what the discussion points would be, and that was  the beginning. I didn   t think we   d have any people in that first class  because it wasn   t in the class schedule. I went to a couple of local  meetings in town and said,    Here   s what we   re going to be doing,    and it  was always held in the evenings so women who worked, or if they had  children, they could have someone taking care of the children. It was  always held on Tuesday night 6:30   40 people the first semester.  Very groundbreaking for that time.  Oh yes. Well and I was invited to speak and go all over the country, and  went a lot of places. I was asked to publish a book, but you know the  truth was I felt like I couldn   t because it was moving so fast and  changing so fast. By the time that anything got printed, it was too late     we needed to move on. It just started growing from there. And the  primary people in that class were females until I had   the athletic  director who was working with Jimmy Johnson at the time came in and  he wanted to take the class. I said,    It   s all females.    He said,    That   s  why I want to take it.    He said,    I intend to be in this business for a long  time and I   m going to have females that I   m working with and I don   t  want to do something stupid and I know I will.    And I said,    Okay, on  that basis I will let you come into the class.    Then probably two or three  semesters after that, the whole golf team was there. Well after that, at  least a third of the class   even when it was called    administrative  strategies for women in business,    they were walking around carrying  The Managerial Woman as one of their readings. The young men would  always tell me funny stories about how they hide their books and don   t  want other people to see what they   re reading (Laughs) but it was a  great, wonderful experience. Oh my gosh   and it was three hours, so we  had time to do something in that time period.  Would you have just class discussion or what types of items would you  14  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  cover   in a nutshell?  There isn   t any way to cover that in a nutshell   no way. Well I normally  would start out with me presenting something. The issue we might be  talking about    risk    and how males and females look at risk differently. I  always tried to help them understand that different just meant different.  It didn   t mean good or bad   better, best, worst, nothing. It   s just  different. So what do we need to know about those differences that will  help us in working with each other? And I would present information  and maybe graph some things. During the three-hour period, we   d  normally   well for many years, I was the only person teaching at night  in the College of Business so we had the whole building and I could  break them out into groups and put a team leader in each one and give  them a discussion question. Then they would come back together and  the groups would report what they had talked about and finalized.  Sometimes they   d have different questions, sometimes they   d have the  same   and then we   d, as a group, share. But I had as many as 75 people  in that class sometimes, and it was designed for 24. So I had to teach it  like it was 24, but they had to have team leaders so they could do their  own discussions and then come back together to interact   people had to  talk in that class. And then I had what I called    optional tasks.    If you  came to class all the time and you got    A   s   , 100 percent on all your  tests   you could get a    C    because I told you what the questions are  gonna be and you should prepare for those   and they were all essay  questions   and you should be able to come one night a week. Now if  you want a better grade than that, these are the optional things you can  do. You can read a magazine article and present it and allow the class to  ask you questions, or you can go to a special workshop or seminar and  write a critique on that and turn it in to me and sometimes I   d have you  talk about that. There were a whole list of optional tasks. The students  regularly every semester would point out to me,    Dr. Rhea, those are not  optional if you want an    A.       I said,    Well, your choice.     At what point did you have the foresight to expand it just from a  woman   s focus to minority inclusion?  Your students lead you the way. They are the ones, they saw some of  the connections in race or disabilities, challenges, age and gender. Each  one of those was sort of added as it grew into more of an issue for us.  The gender and the race   race came very closely after, but we were still  calling it    administrative strategies    but I went back to Memphis and  took, I don   t know, about a three- or four-day workshop from Roosevelt  Thomas. He had written the book Race and Gender that I had been  using for the class, and it was an amazing time to spend with him, but I  knew that I knew a lot more about race than I had thought I did. It  15  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  confirmed that there were many, many connections there. And then  ageism   the different generations   just integrated itself in, and that   s  how those things just happened. They just integrated themselves in.  When we started out, sexual harassment was not an issue to begin with.  It had always been an issue, but we hadn   t talked about it, and then   oh  probably after the first session or two, we got into sexual harassment  before it was out there in the mainstream.  Were many colleges and universities integrating these types of courses?  No, no, no, no, no. That   s why I was asked to come and help put them  together. I spoke at a lot of conferences and gave out all the information  I had, sent them to places   yeah   no. I just had different support. I was  so fortunate that I had somebody like Jay Boggs, and I had our dean,   Robert  Sandmeyer, and I had my department head early on, and my  colleagues. I could not have done this without my colleagues. Of course,  some of them didn   t know they were helping me at the time. They put  little funny cartoons on my door to kind of give me a raise or get a  reaction. I just took those off and had them made into transparencies and  used it for class for discussion points. Well when they found out I was  doing that, they   d leave them on my door but sign who had sent them.  So that was pretty funny.  Well it   s a great preparation tool for women back then because you   re  right, they didn   t really know what was ahead of them and what could  be. So that was great, groundbreaking curriculum. OSU   s very fortunate  that you were able to not only teach it but also spread the good word to  other universities.  It was a trip and a half   and can you believe it? They paid me.  (Laughter)  Well tell me a little bit about the Women   s Business Leadership Program  and how that came about?  Well that is a brainchild of Lou Kerr   and I don   t know if you   ve ever  had the opportunity to meet Lou Kerr, but she would be a wonderful  person for you to interview because she has the greatest imagination.  She   s so creative and she has the ability to do something about it. She  has a network of people that she can just call on and because of her  enthusiasm and her motivation and her support, you can get things done.  You don   t just talk about them, they happen. And she surrounds herself  with the best people. Her staff   I mean they are top drawer.  She went to Dean Poole   well he wasn   t the dean then, he was Vice  President Poole   and she had an idea. I believe that she went to the  University of Oklahoma first with this idea and they weren   t ecstatic  16  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  about it, but Vice President Poole was, so they got together. The College  of Business was having a lecture series at that time that was primarily     oh almost always we had somebody who was male there doing this, and  they were wonderful, wonderful speakers but primarily the audience was  male, because they were powerful people in powerful positions in  Oklahoma City.  Now through the years, that   s changed, the demographics has changed     but early on that was primarily   a female in that mix was rare. But she  said,    Well we need to have something for women.    So originally they  did like a half a day that followed up the men   s program, or was at the  same time, and then she got connected   I don   t know if it was Julie or if  it was Jim Hromas   the very first   came through the Business  Extension. That   s what it was called then   it has a new name now   but  she got together with them and with her Oklahoma International  Women   s Forum that   s its    own unique group, women who just do  amazing things in this state that just couldn   t be done any other way, in  Oklahoma City or   well I   m thinking of the academic science and  math   high school academic   they   ve been very involved in that, just  so many different kinds of things.  Martha Griffin is their President and Lou Kerr is really the one that got it  started with Vice President Poole and Business Extension. Then they  came to me and asked if I would help moderate it, and so the second  year I began to be moderator. Lou gets the speakers and it was up to me  to create a program that was a good mix and get each one of them  comfortable with speaking, because many times they had a great story  but they weren   t particularly comfortable with getting up in front of a  group like that and speaking. That was my job, to pull it all together, talk  to the speakers, make them feel comfortable, have a theme. So that   s  what I did.  You retired in 2004. If you could touch upon a few career highlights     Every single day walking into that classroom. Honestly and truly I just  cannot tell you what a blessing it was because I learned so much from  those young people, whether it was teaching business organization or     you know, I loved those Tuesday/Thursday classes in the morning  because there were 30 in each class and oh my gosh, we did so much in  the area of communication in there and it was so different than the  diversity class really. Of course in 1980 when I was in California at a  training   and I did teach a lot of training and development graduate  classes, too, along the way. I was at a training and development ASTD  meeting in California and I got a call from the Vice President   s office  telling me that I had been nominated for an Amoco Outstanding  Teaching Award, and hearing that   and that I was going to have to fly  17  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  home early because I had to be interviewed   and hearing that I was  nominated, I just was amazed because at that time we didn   t fill out  anything. We didn   t have to create a portfolio. If we had, I probably  never would have received it because I tend not to like to put that all  together   but I did   oh, it was fun.  I guess the other part was the opportunities that I   ve had serving on  university committees, working with people across campus and getting  outside of your own area. I like serving on the library board because  you   re seeing things from somebody else   s perspective, or hearing about  it, so those were good things. Just the conversations I   ve had with my  colleagues, the traveling we   ve done   I don   t think I could say any one  huge thing. I have been so grateful that they have established the  professorship in my name, and being inducted in the Oklahoma Higher  Education Hall of Fame. I mean, that to me   when you   re doing  something you truly, truly love and somebody notices it, that   s really  nice. That   s probably it. It   s been a good life, a good career.  Going back to 2005 when you were being inducted into the Oklahoma  Women   s Hall of Fame, do you remember what you were feeling when  you caught word of it?  It was at Christmas time, and it was right after Christmas that I got the  phone call, and it was Patricia that called and I was very ill. I mean, I  was in bed   fever, the whole thing. I truly thought I was hallucinating  when this voice said that I had been selected to be inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame. I think I said,    What? You   ve got to  be kidding me.    I could not imagine how that had happened, and our  daughter was there   our second daughter lives in Iowa, and she was  there   she   s a professor up there   and she stood in the doorway and she  said,    Mom, are you okay? What   s going on?    and so while Patricia   s  still on the phone, I   m saying,    You   re not going to believe what she just  told me.    So, yes, I can remember, and I felt terrible about that  afterwards. I thought I should have been so    Oh, thank you so much,  that   s a wonderful thing,    but I was just astounded.  Did you attend the ceremony?  Oh, yes. Oh, I wouldn   t have missed it.  Do you remember who presented you?  Lou Kerr.  Did you have a lot of family and friends in attendance?  18  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Yes, yes   people from our church in Stillwater, people from Tulsa, new  friends that we   d just really met, and my neighbors from where we   d  been living in Stillwater came. Two of the children came   the one from  Iowa, that was not going to be   she has two little ones and that would  have been a real   but everybody else was there, and she was there in  spirit. People from Kansas City even came.  What does this honor mean to you?  Maybe that I was doing something of value and something right   and I  will tell you that during those early times when I was teaching the  diversity class there were definitely nights   9:30 at night I   d be up in  my office with my head on my desk crying because it had been such a  struggle. I had young women that   some of them truly thought they did  have a place and didn   t understand who they could be. I felt like I wasn   t  reaching them, that I needed to do more. So I guess maybe what that  honor said was,    It was okay. It was worth it.     How do you feel that now people look to you as a role model?  Well, you know the truth is I think everybody is a role model to  somebody, and you have to be very careful of what you say and what  you do because someone is watching you and you don   t even know it. It  could be a neighbor. It could be somebody that you meet regularly at the  grocery store, and you don   t know that they are looking at you and  saying,    That   s the kind of behavior I want to be known for.    You have  no idea. So I guess I   ve always known that there could be somebody  watching, because I had role models that they didn   t know I was  watching   Charlene Halovek to this day doesn   t have a clue. She was  our neighbor and probably   oh, ten years older than I was   and she was  a role model. So you have to be careful. Watch who   s watching you.  Would you like to make mention or say anything about people that have  played an important role in your life?  That list is so long, my word. You think of the Sunday School teachers,  all the summers I spent at Merritt   s Beach with Mrs. Doodie and what I  learned from her. My grandmother Clark was probably my single most  influential person in my life. She lived with us six months before I was  born and really lived with my parents until I was married and then she  moved to live the majority of the time with her daughter in Wyoming for  the rest of her life   but she was there with me always. She was very  strong. She was the first woman telephone operator in the state of  Nebraska. She operated the switchboard in this small town. Her husband  had had a freak accident and died when Mother was two. My  grandmother had three daughters   one was 11 years older than Mother  19  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  Nykolaiszyn  Rhea  and one was 13 years older than mother, so she had those three  daughters to finish raising on her own, and did, and worked as a  telephone operator until I was born and then that was it. But I wouldn   t  forget my dancing teacher, Jean Lockin, or Miss Kitty Roberts, even  though I didn   t learn to play the piano, or the ministers I   ve had and Dr.  Arnola Owaby and   oh my gosh, all of the people, all the friends, the  personal family friends that you share everything with   my colleagues,  that they   re still there and I   m not. So many, many people   Dr. White.  What would be your advice to women who plan to follow in your  footsteps?  Just do it your way and have the time of your life. There is not a recipe.  Don   t get discouraged. Find your own special place. Find your own  unique spot and make it yours. That   s probably what I would try to tell  somebody. Find a hole that really needs to be filled and do it, but have a  good time.  What   s next on the agenda for you?  Well I continue to work with my husband   s company as a consultant and  facilitating seminars and workshops and doing some consulting work.  I   m not going to say I   m writing a book. I   m writing blips of information  that might somehow come together in something that somebody might  be interested in sometime.  Well speaking of writing a book, when history is written about you, what  would you like for it to say?  That I was a good friend   that   s primarily it.  Is there anything else you   d like to mention today before we end the  interview? Anything I   ve forgotten that you   d like to add?  You know what? I think you have done a superb job of being inquisitive.  (Laughs) So no, I just think you handled it.  Well thank you very much for participating. We do appreciate your time  today.  Well you   re very welcome.  -------  -------
