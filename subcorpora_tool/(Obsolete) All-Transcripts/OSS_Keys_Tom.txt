 Gill. Today is June 27, 2009. I   m visiting with Tom  Keys, former Director of the Student Union at Oklahoma State  University and we   re in the Student Union in his old office, as a matter  of fact, on the OSU campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is  for the O-STATE Stories project which is part of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Tom, thanks for taking time to visit with us  today. There   s a special event going on today that brings you to the  Union?  Oh, it   s my pleasure to be here with you, Jerry. Yes, we   re having a little  reunion of some former directors and former members of our staff.  We   re looking forward to having a nice day of visiting.  Well, Tom, can you tell us a little bit about where you grew up and your  early life?  I was originally from Louisiana. My home was in Natchitoches,  Louisiana. A little bit of history of that community, it   s the oldest  permanent settlement in the Louisiana Purchase founded in 1714. So,  it   s been around for a while. I grew up in Natchitoches. It was a nice  place to grow up; it   s a little community of about 17,000-18,000. I  graduated from high school there. I did my undergraduate work at  Louisiana State University in finance, then came back to Natchitoches to  do a master   s program in student personnel because that was the only  program in the state that dealt with higher education.  When I was growing up, I was pretty involved in athletics. I played  football, played basketball. We had some success in basketball, more  successes as a basketball team than we did  as  a football team. Like  every other kid, I had visions of playing ball at LSU at that time. A  pretty severe knee injury stopped all that, so I had to trace other paths for  a career. But I had a good experience at LSU. I got very involved in  5  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  campus life kinds of things and ended up being in student government as  a vice president for the student body. I served on the Union Governing  Board, served on the Student Union Leadership Cabinet. I cut my teeth  on those, and another dean of students encouraged me to get into this  kind of business. And that was my career path. Having a great out-of-class  experience as an undergraduate got me started in all this.  Tom, hearken back a little bit to your early life. Were there some values  and lessons that you learned growing up from your family that  influenced you?  Oh, exactly. Like all of us, we pretty much owe who we are to our  parents. My dad was in private business. He owned his own construction  company. At that time, my mother raised the three of us. I had an older  brother and younger sister. She stayed as a housewife, which in those  days, that was done a lot more than now. I think the primary thing that I  would latch on just immediately and gratefully is a work ethic. It   s kind  of a philosophy of    don   t forget where you come from.    I have kind of a  sports analogy, always stay in balance. That wasn   t just physical, but it  was mental and the way you led your life. Have goals and have dreams,  but don   t reach so far that you   re out of balance with who you are and  what you are, work hard; those kinds of things came to me from my  parents.  Obviously, as you indicated earlier, you cut your teeth on student union  work there as part of their Student Union Activities Board. But what is  the story about how you got to Oklahoma State University? Did you  come straight from     No. It   s kind of an interesting story   interesting for me. Actually, when  I finished my master   s degree, my first job, the title was Coordinator of  Student Activities at a small school in Augusta, Georgia. At the time it  was Augusta College, now I think it   s Augusta State University. But I  was hired there in the students    activities business, and I was there only  about a year. In the summer of 1969, I actually watched them land on  the moon in a lounge at the University of Iowa because I was there at a  two-week workshop. Just to put that in perspective, we were there in this  workshop that was being sponsored by the Association of College  Unions International to deal with campus unrest because that spring the  University of Iowa had been shut down due to campus unrest. They just  quit and went home early that year. We were there for a two-week  workshop learning how to deal with some of those issues and so on.  While there, a friend of mine that I   d gone to school with contacted me,  and Winston Shindell of all people had just hired this person, this friend  of mine, as the first Assistant Director of Student Activities. Well, he  contacted me saying Winston had said that there   s another job open at  6  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Oklahoma State as an Assistant Dean of Students working primarily  with fraternities, who has a legendary name in the history of campus life  was Daryl Troxel.  Dean Trox.  Dean Trox, who had been formerly by the title Dean of Men, had moved  to become an Associate Dean of Students and they were looking to  replace Trox in that process. So, long story short, they contacted me. I  left that workshop. In fact, that little network there   Jan Carlson who  worked here for a long time, he and I were rooming together at that  particular workshop. Jan and another colleague saw to it that I got on the  airplane and got to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Had never been to Oklahoma  in my life. (Laughter) Had never thought about going to Oklahoma. I  was contacted. I flew in here, did an interview. The first person I met,  who met me at the plane, was Winston Shindell. We imprinted there  very quickly. And Trox and Bob Schmalfeld, who was Dean of  Students, hired me for that job.  I had some real decision making to do in terms of whether I wanted to  come to Oklahoma State, but we did make the decision. We came here  primarily to work at a larger university, one that was in philosophy and  history and nature a lot like LSU. They were both land grant schools,  comprehensive universities.  It was  an opportunity for me to move to a  comprehensive university and also an opportunity for me to pursue a  doctorate. I said I   ll come and stay for four years. I   ll get my doctorate,  work in the fraternity area and student discipline and orientation and  those kinds of responsibilities at that time. I   ll get my doctorate and then  move on. And thirty-six years later, I retired from the University.  (Laughter)  What was your background in terms of your academic degrees before  you came to OSU and started your doctorate?  I have an undergraduate from LSU in finance out of the College of  Business. I had a master   s in education and student personnel and then I  came here and I got my EdD in student personnel/applied behavioral  studies/higher ed administration, kind of a mix of those three things.  How long were you in that position? You were an assistant     I was Assistant Dean of Students for six years. Then I was hired by  Norman Moore, who was Vice President for Student Services at that  time, to work in his office kind of as an organization development  person. We were doing a lot of evaluation and other kinds of program  development that we were trying to do out of that office. I worked with  7  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  President   s Leadership Council while I was in that capacity. I worked  for two years for Norman.  So, you were Associate Dean of Student Affairs from    69-70?     75.  And then    75 to    77 you worked in Dr. Moore   s office?  Right. Then after    77, Jay Boggs, who was Vice President for Academic  Affairs and Research, now carries the Provost   s Title or Chief Academic  Advisor, I moved to his office on his staff as Director of Academic  Programs and Services. I was there five and a half years. Then January  of 1982, I became the Union Director.  Did you go through a formal process, or was it just an internal search?  How did they do that?  For the Union Director job?  For the Union Director position.  No, it was a national search. Interestingly enough, I had never really  formally been employed in any kind of student union facility. I had not  sat in the traditional chairs of advancing through the ranks of Union  Director. But I was a part of a national search. Interestingly enough, this  is kind of an aside. Earlier we were talking about all that, but within a  few months after I got hired, I was at a national convention and got to  know the other three finalists and thought,    How did I get hired?     because they were pretty prominent in that whole profession. But I was  hired and, again, thinking I would stay not a long time. I was twenty-three  years as Union Director.  Tom, obviously there   s a lot of strengths to build on. You had Abe  Hesser, Norman Moore and Winston Shindell, some outstanding  directors. What were some of the strengths that you wanted to build on,  and what were some of your initial goals and priorities for the Student  Union?  Okay. Probably the initial response, just as you set it up, there were a lot  of pretty significant people who had been in the role of Union Director.  Of course, most things in this union were sort of set into motion by Abe  Hesser. He was legendary. As Trox was legendary in the fraternity  fields, Abe carried the same weight in the college union business. Of  course, Norman and Winston. I had known Winston very well when he  was in this position. In fact, it was Winston who had encouraged me to  8  even consider the Union.  As an aside, I had two options at that point. One was, I was the finalist  for a Dean of Students job at the University of Florida. While I was on  an interview down in Gainesville at the University of Florida  interviewing for this Dean of Students job, the person who was chairman  of the selection committee was the Union Director at Florida. He and I  started talking about college unions, the operations, the philosophy, the  purpose and so on, and Winston had just encouraged me to consider the  position. I had never given it any thought at all. It was that conversation  that really kind of tweaked my interest. I flew home and immediately  contacted the vice president at Florida and said,    I don   t think I want to  be considered for the position. I want to throw my hat in the ring for the  Student Union Director   s job here.     I know I   m not answering your question, but I   ll get to it in a minute.  The thing that really attracted me about that was it was in the Student  Affairs within the boundaries of the Student Affairs profession and  mixed, but it afforded me an opportunity, I thought, to combine a lot of  my experiences. My business background, having grown up in a  business, having my initial degree being in business, my understanding  and experience in Student Affairs thing. Plus, the network I had built in  academic affairs. I think that   s probably why I was picked, although I  did not have a whole lot of hands-on experience as a Union Director. I  felt there was a breadth of knowledge and understanding and networks  that I could bring to the table that perhaps other candidates didn   t at that  time, being more of a traditional background.  Day one and I tried to follow this philosophy all the way through, was  with staff and so on to say,    Look, I   ve never been here. I   ve never been  in a job like this. There are some things that I can bring to the table, but  as far as having a real understanding of the hands-on kind of processes,  we   re going to have to work together. I   m going to have to depend on  you, because I can   t cook. But there are some things that I can do that I  think I can bring to the table that would facilitate this.     Back to your initial question, now, let   s begin to look at the principles,  the programs, the mix of everything in this union that we think is near  and dear to our hearts, and our philosophies that we want to keep, and  the traditions that have been established. Let   s honor those and respect  those, but at the same time, let   s look at how we can change what we  need to change, what we need to venture into to stay at the cutting edge  for our students, because students, they   re our mainstay. We   re here to  serve the university community: students, faculty, staff, alumni and  guests. It   s probably the largest market and constituency that anybody  else on the campus would have. How do we stay at the cutting edge of  9  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  trying to address their needs in terms of the out-of-class experience?  And that   s pretty much the philosophy that we hung on to was,    I don   t  know nearly everything there is to know, but when we combine all of  our knowledge and all of our expertise, we have the power to do  whatever we think we need to do to continue to address.    In summary,  respect those who have contributed before, but not be so stayed in that  that we can   t change. Be flexible enough and adaptive enough to try to  stay at that cutting edge for those that we serve. That   s kind of what  draws us.  Sounds like from your conversation too, that student program is a  priority for you?  Student program is always a priority. It   s fundamental. Through our  years, I can tell you that it is difficult to continue to address, to maintain  that priority when   as I mentioned earlier, when you   re talking to  students, faculty, alumni, and guests of the University, and plus being an  auxiliary where you have to have an economic engine that will drive and  support all of those needs, we try really hard not to lose sight of the fact  that the student program was more than the student program. I think, to  me, a better term was the out-of-class experience stayed as foremost in  our minds as we could, and we had all those other things that would  support it.  It was difficult at times to   going back to my operative words, staying  in balance with everything. You know as well as I do, there was  probably, at certain years, not a week that would go by, certainly not a  month that would go by, that someone would need or want more space  for something else that was not necessarily primary to the mission of the  Union. But we were trying to accommodate those needs, as well, and  trying to address some of the pent-up needs for capital improvements  and repairs on the building that was heavily used, therefore getting very  well worn was real challenging.  You touched on some of these, but you might elaborate a little bit more  on what   s called the stakeholders?  Yes.  Primarily being the students. The other constituencies that you served.  Can you speak to that a little bit more?  Well, as I said, students, faculty, staff, alumni, guests of the University,  that   s just about everybody that would walk through the building. Then,  again, trying to maintain a balance among all of those and our  constituency is pretty obvious. Students, we know who they are. Faculty,  10  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  they had particular wants and needs and how to address them and  support their needs. And people probably don   t give a whole lot of  thought to   well, the faculty teach over in the classroom building. How  does that    Our whole bookstore is a support effort to the teaching and  learning complex and communicating effectively with them, regarding  providing the academic materials that are used in a classroom. That   s  very supportive. A lot of our programming we tried to co-program with  faculty, hit some areas that faculty would have an interest in, not in just  in terms of attending, but programming for students that we used faculty  to assist us in those programs. Discussion groups following  presentations that would be led   we would bring a speaker in and so on,  and then we   d have faculty come in, and discussion groups after that.  You know, try to do some things with them. Staff the same way.  Guests   at one point, we were the continuing education facility for  Oklahoma State University. Either fortunately or unfortunately, now I  think it   s fortunately, Oklahoma State   s been able to develop some other  facilities and buildings and meeting places to accommodate the  continuing education aspect of the University, both as part of the  University   s mission of outreach and that sort of thing.  The Student Union housed the Alumni Association.  Yes.  The OSU Foundation.  Right.  A lot of operations that people forget about, don   t they?  Yes. One of the unique and challenging aspects of that is, in terms of  keeping all that balanced, this union has always been fairly unique in  terms of the mix of that which is contained within this building. You go  from the obvious of food service, and not every union has a bookstore,  but we have a bookstore. Not every union had retail facilities or shops.  We have shops. But in addition, as you mentioned, certainly very few  have a hotel, parking structures, but I don   t know of any other college  union that has its Board of Regents    offices right here in the building. Or  its Alumni facilities. Or the OSU Foundation was located here. Career  Services, the counseling center and those are in the earlier days. Then,  when we added the Student Services Center to the building in the late     90s, that really made it a whole   everything you wanted or needed to  do at the University could basically be found right here when we added,  oh what was it? The Bursar, the Registrar, Financial Aid, all of those,  really just made this a unique facility in terms of all the services that  were wrapped together in one facility, which I think was one of the  11  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  nicest things we could have ever done for students.  This sort of begs the question, how do you organize your organizational  structure and how was it managed here in your tenure?  I think that we kept our organizational structure very flat, on purpose.  That was my design, was to keep it as flat as possible. We were  organized by departments. Hopefully, I was smart enough to hire some  good people as department heads in these various units and then get out  of the way and let them do their thing. My job was to provide them the  opportunities to succeed, the resources, the wherewithal to do what they  were hired to do and to manage, to coach, it was very much a coaching  kind of thing to try to motivate, try to counsel. Working together with a  master plan for the building in terms of where we wanted to go and  where we wanted to be. Unfortunately, we didn   t have the resources to  get there early, so we had to be very patient in terms of what we did.  That was one of our biggest challenges was to just have enough  resources to grow these departments. And over time, I think one of our  greatest assets, in terms of our organization, is the strength and the  competence of our department heads and the loyalty and devotion of our  staff. I think that was the greatest asset we ever had.  Do you recall the departments that were under you? I   m sure it changed  some over your twenty-three years.  Yes. By title, the Assistant Director for Retail Operations ran the  bookstore and worked with the rental lease shops that we had in the  building. Assistant Director for Food Services and Catering, which by  title, ran our day-to-day food plus our catering operations, our banquet  services and our food courts. We had an Associate Director for Campus  Life which, over time, really grew into a very broad and kind of unique  to college unions. It was way beyond the Student Union   s Activities  Board and Program that was a part of our Campus Life. But that area  grew into a combination of our Union program, our Greek life, our  International Student advisement, our Volunteer Center, our non-traditional  Students, Allied Arts, our leadership component. All of those  things were in one department headed up by an Associate Director, and  that was Kent Sampson.  Tom, isn   t that unusual? I mean most of those kinds of services would  have fallen under Vice President of Student Affairs?  It was very unusual and I thought very effective, because when you start  splitting them out, you get a little competition involved in some of that,  not only for resources but recognition and all of that. It was extremely  unusual. And the forearm for that, or the emphasis for that, was done  12  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  before I came in here. We just grew it beyond anything we ever knew,  and that   s when Ron Beer early in his career as Vice President for  Student Affairs dismantled the Dean of Students office, and those  functions that reported there were kind of farmed out, and the Union got  Student Activities. It became a part of the Student Union organization.  And that was a genesis of that whole thing growing to what we know  now as the Department of Campus Life. We   re still talking about the  organization. So, we had food service, bookstore; at the time, the  manager of the hotel reported to me. We had a meeting services and  conference component of our organization. Building Operations, which  handled our maintenance and housekeeping. All those were headed up  by managers. They all reported to me. As a result, our organization was  pretty flat.  Do you remember total budgets when you came in and the total budget  when you left?  I don   t recall the exact numbers, but it was about four fold over the  twenty-some-odd years. Roughly, early on, it was about a  4 million  operation, and when I left it was sixteen-plus or somewhere in there. So,  it was about four fold. Primarily growth, and that in terms of budget, a  little bit about our budget, the primary growth was in the bookstore. We  were an auxiliary. We are an auxiliary, meaning that we did not rely on  state-appropriated funds for the operations of the Union. Another kind of  financial philosophy we clung to over the years, we kept our student fee  very low. In fact, our objective every year was to establish a budget  where the students didn   t pay more than 10 percent of total budget in  student fees. We clung to that for a long time, which probably slowed  down our ability to finance large renovation projects. Again, you asked  me earlier on about some philosophy from parents and so on, was that  pay-as-you-go kind of thing. And we tried to do that as best as we could  with the Union and rely on some of the economic engines and other self-produced  revenue kinds of thing to help us meet needs for capital  improvements.  What were some of the revenues? You mentioned primarily the  bookstore and then the fees.  The bookstore, food service, rental income both for meeting use and the  privately-owned shop income. Revenue from the parking garage,  revenues from the hotel. One of the real watershed issues, historically,  for us and very significant for us, best I can say it, is to just get the  University to reimburse us for the real cost in operation of certain offices  that were in the building, without having to bill you, Jerry Gill, former  Executive Director of the Alumni Association, directly, for rent. That  was a real watershed for us. Once the University recognized that the  13  Gill  Keys  utilities, the housekeeping, the maintenance, and other operating costs  for every square foot in this building of an agency that was another part  of the University, to recognize that as some revenue for us. We, in turn,  paid our fair share of overhead, but to balance that early on really was a  significant thing for us.  In your perspective from twenty-three years, how has the role seemingly  evolved over those years? What new or emerging issues have you seen  over the twenty-three year period?  I figured that question was coming, but it   s kind of hard to answer  because when you   re in it and you   re up to your elbows in all of this, it   s  sort of hard to see quick rapid changes. It   s almost an evolutionary thing  that is kind of, the ship is turned, but turning so gently it   s hard to see.  Got a lot of changes in students, but at the same time, everything I can  say, I will contradict myself. The students are still the heart and soul of  what we do. The students and the principles and ethics that they bring to  this campus have always been special and are still special. Their  interests, they   ve adjusted a little bit. There   s been things that we   ve had  to give up that were no longer of interest to the students. I ran across,  and I   ll just give you an example and it   s not meant to be derogatory in  any form or fashion, alumni who say,    Oh, yes, I remember being in the  Union, and bowling and shooting pool.    That will immediately date  them in terms of their age and when they were here. (Laughter) We  didn   t give up on the bowling and the pool hall and all of that stuff  because it was being overused. It was because students, their interests  and needs had gone somewhere else. I used to have a favorite saying of,     I   ve never seen a business go out of business because they had too  much business.    I   m not answering your question directly, except to say  we   ve tried to stay as mobile and as willing to adjust and adapt to what  the students and the university community wanted and needed through  those years.  Now I can see in terms of facility and the plans that they have now,  moving a little more back to much more student-oriented where we  were, just to survive economically and to provide and support some of  the needs of the campus, we had to be careful that we were not  becoming just a service station, just a building. One of the greatest  misnomers about this union or any college union, is, when you think  about it, most people think about it as bricks and mortar, the facility, the  hard core surface of it. That   s only its vessel. That   s the vessel of a  college union. The real purpose and meaning is that which occurs within  it, the mix of things that occur in it. Its program, the facilities only help  to deliver those kinds of things, and that is something to almost anyone.     What do you use the Union for?       I just use it for a cup of coffee,    or     We come over here as a study group,    or    I come here to get a book,     14  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  or    I go to the Bursar   s office.    The point is that it   s different things to  different people, but if it   s meeting their needs, it   s doing what it needs  to do.  Overall, from your perspective, what should be the mission of the OSU  Student Union or any student union on a university campus?  Well, it   s a pretty standard statement. I used to be able to quote it  verbatim, but I   m not sure I can do it now. But it   s here to serve, as I  said before, students, faculty, staff, alumni, guests. It   s here to  supplement and complement the academic mission of the campus,  provide social, culture, recreational kinds of opportunities for students.  It   s here to provide leadership opportunities. I think leadership  development is one of the best and most important things that we could  do or facilitate in any college union. My main mission, my main concern  is all the freshmen in the world need first of all to imprint on a campus,  to feel like they belong, to feel comfortable. I think that   s an important  mission of a college union, not as bricks and mortar. Its bricks and  mortar need to make them feel comfortable, make them feel welcome,  make them feel a part. But that   s not only as far as the bricks and mortar  can go. It   s the program inside that gets them meaningfully engaged in  out-of-class activities, an activity, an organization they can feel involved  with. An opportunity to learn about themselves in mixing and interacting  with students who are from different backgrounds, different cultures,  different nature, different parts of the state or different parts of the  world. It   s through that kind of interaction and involvement in campus  activities in a meaningful way that   s important as a part of the Union   s  mission.  As I said, leadership development. I think this institution does a great  job in giving students an opportunity to learn about organizations,  organization effectiveness, leadership development and all of that stuff I  think is extremely important. And that   s one of the primary missions I  think of the Union. Of course, to provide the day-to-day amenities and  services that members of this community need. Come here to get  whatever it is you need, whether it   s that cup of coffee or whether it   s  that scholarship out at Financial Aid. But I think that   s an important part  of the mission.  Looking back, what did you enjoy most about being Director of the  Student Union?  I enjoyed putting together the staff, the staffing. I enjoyed the planning  that we did together. I enjoyed seeing our staff grow and develop  professionally and personally. So, just that success through others was  something that kept my light lit. Student interaction, although, sitting in  15  Gill  Keys  this position you probably know as well as I do, when you get to a  position, you don   t have that all the time. The further you go, the more  removed you get. But I did enjoy my interaction with students, and I  purposefully kept my hand in Orange Peel because I enjoyed the direct  interaction with Orange Peel. Although, it was frustrating and I   ve got  many chapters in a book that could be written about that, but that gave  me a hands-on thing with students. I always made sure I developed a  good working relationship with student government officers. I think I  held a reputation with students that I was always fair, I was always  direct. If they wanted to know what I thought, they knew I would tell  them, hopefully in very fair and equitable manner.  I enjoyed the student interaction. I enjoyed the planning and the staff  development. Staff development is   and I used this before, maybe it   s  because I was a wannabe athlete early on   a lot of things came back to  coaching. If a coach had every star player that had ever come through  their program, they   d be national champions every year. And that   s a lot  of what we had. We had some real stars, that if you could have kept  them   but some of them grew and developed and moved on or got  bought by someone else. But the team that is in place now is a really  outstanding group. Hopefully we had something to do with where they  are now and their ability to move on.  In fairness, the other side of the coin, what did you enjoy the least about  being Director?  I was good at it but didn   t necessarily enjoy it, and that was the campus  politics part of that. Trying to keep the wolves away from the door. I  mean, I   m just being blunt about that. As the University grew and  developed and changed in its leadership, that was really a challenge. I  was good at it; I didn   t necessarily enjoy it. That was no different than  any other institution would face. I   m not dissing OSU. I love OSU and  the people in it. That was kind of a challenge. I was never totally  satisfied with what we could achieve in our programming effort, and I  was never totally comfortable and satisfied with our food service  program. I think we have a good program. We had a good food service,  but you could just see where there was just so much room for growth  and improvement. And we had good staff in both of those areas, very  dedicated people. But I don   t think people really understand how  difficult it is to operate as much of a food service program as we have,  and as diversified as that is. It   s difficult, but we made some moves  through the years to try to adjust and do some things that were needed.  And I think the track they are on now, we set the thing into motion  before I left, of blending our food services into one university-wide food  service program, which I think better serves the students.  16  Gill  Keys  Can you share some of your memorable experiences, key moments, key  events in your twenty-three years? I know that sounds like a lot, just  some highlights     Sure. Well, one that I certainly don   t want to   it may or may not fit in  the question, but I sure want it to be recorded in some place that the best  thing we ever did for any and all of our students, the one best watershed  thing that we ever did was establishing the bursar program which  allowed students to charge their books. This came about one day after a  meeting of division heads within Student Services where, at that time,  the head of Financial Aid said,    Tom, is there anything that we can do to  help students get their books on time? We have a lot of students who are  several weeks into a semester before their aid packages are delivered and  they have enough money to buy their books. That puts them three or  four weeks behind the learning curve.    And I said,    I don   t know. We   ll  look at it.    So, the bookstore manager and I got together and we figured  out how that could be done, and that it could be done, and that it should  be done. And the charge program, in effect, the Bursar Account Program  was already in effect. All of those principles were the same as allowing  students to get books on time. So, we introduced that program. It was the  best win-win thing we ever did. It was a winner for us, and it was more  than a winner for students. So, that was one of the best things we ever  did.  Other memories   establishing Orange Peel was very challenging but  will always be a memory for me, particularly a couple of events  surrounding Orange Peel. I will absolutely never forget the flood that we  had one evening, nor the fallout and aftermath of that from August to  May in terms of trying to deal with that particular concert that was  rained out. I will absolutely never forget the exchange I had with another  performer, as an educational community, we felt was inappropriate. I  addressed that issue directly with that individual. I   ll absolutely never  forget that one, nor the fallout for the next few weeks with the general  public over that particular program. Fortunately, we had a very  understanding president and board at that time. We were bigger and  better than that performance and we survived that.  I   ll never forget my first day on the job. I was all excited about coming  to be the new Union Director, and it happened to be a Friday, and Friday  is customarily our staff meeting. I was all fired up with a big  motivational speech, you know the new kid on the block, and going to  go in and have great things for this union. I walked into the building  through the hotel lobby and it was about two inches deep in water.  Someone had stepped on a pipe doing some work upstairs and had  flooded the hotel lobby, and we had to address that issue immediately.  So, the first day, I ruined a nice pair of shoes, was late to a staff meeting,  17  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  and had to forego my motivational speech.  It got shelved. (Laughter)  Yes. We just did what we had to do right there, and all of the  motivational issues had to wait for another time. I have tons of good  memories of this place and its people. One of the best things, and we  used to talk about it all the time and we meant it, that we were a family.  It wasn   t just a job for any and all of us. Our deal was then,    Hey, all of  us have to work for a living. We   re not fortunate enough to be born with  silver spoons in our mouths, so we   re going to have to work for a living.  We may as well enjoy what we   re doing, so let   s try to have fun with it.  And we are family, we   re here to assist. Our job is about service. We are  the poor part of the institution but the institution doesn   t revolve around  us. We   re here to serve that institution in any way.    I think all of that  was thoroughly ingrained into everyone, regardless of what they were  doing, regardless of whether they were a department head, regardless of  whether they were on the housekeeping crew or a cashier. So, we very  seldom had to deal with issues related to how our staff served other  people. Only on rare occasions. If somebody was in need, we tried to  address those as best we could as a family. That   s kind of the way we  ran our shop. As a result, I think we had a very, very loyal crew, loyal  staff. A dedicated staff. I   m not saying dedicated to the Director or loyal  to the Director. Loyal and dedicated to the mission of what we were  there to do. And we tried to make sure that permeated all the way  through our organization. I felt pretty good about that.  You talked earlier about your predecessors Winston Shindell and  Norman Moore.  Right.  Can you share with us about those two individuals? Strengths, things  you remember about them, things they brought to the Student Union.  And if you   ve got some good stories, we   d like to hear those as well.  You want me to talk about them?  Sure, absolutely.  That may be one of those in that form that I choose not to. They were  all   both of them, and I go back, Abe Hesser was actually Vice  President when I started here as an assistant.  He was a legend     18  Keys  Yes, legendary. I had the deepest respect for all of them. Winston was a  very good friend of mine, to begin with. As I said and reflected earlier,  he was pretty instrumental in my initial hiring. He was the first person I  met in Stillwater. We were friends; we were colleagues. Like I said, I  wouldn   t be Union Director if he hadn   t planted the seed and encouraged  me to even consider moving over here. We were friends and colleagues  long after that through our interaction and involvement in our  professional association. We served on its board of directors at different  times. But the summer meetings were in Winston   s facility, his union at  Indiana, so we had some very meaningful interaction over the thirty-plus  years that we   ve all been together. Winston was always a very  organized, very intelligent leader. I have nothing but good and kind  things to say for Winston.  Norman, I worked for Norman for two years when he became Vice  President. I would say one of the things that sticks out in my mind  regarding Norman was Norman was in the right place at the right time in  a very bad time in the history of Oklahoma State University, and he did  an outstanding job with it. Norman had been named interim or Acting  Vice President for Student Services in a year. Had been a there a number  of months and it was in the fall I believe, fall or early spring semester,  that we had an unfortunate racial incident on campus that ultimately  resulted in a boycott of African American students. It was very difficult,  very touchy times. I think had we not had Norman at the helm of the  Student Affairs side of what we did, those times would have been much  more difficult. He communicated effectively. He met with the students  as a group, and that whole group dynamic was very touchy, in a state of  imbalance. Norman handled that very well. Norman was a good thinker,  was a good planner. He had a good mind. He was sometimes stubborn to  a point of discredit for himself, but he believed in principle and  generally those principles were right. He was a very uncompromising  person. I don   t care who you are, he would stick to them. I respected that  quite a bit.  Abe is legendary. The ghost of Abe Hesser is still alive and well in this  union. I had to tell one of our long-standing staff members once that  Abe   s no longer the Director. That person needed to learn to think and  make decisions on his own because he didn   t have to do that when Abe  was there. Abe made all the decisions, you just implemented them. I  wanted that person to grow in terms of,    You have more information  than anybody else has in this building, feel free to make decisions based  on that information. I   ll back you up. If you   re wrong, I   ll tell you  you   re wrong. Your problem is you haven   t had to think before, because  Abe didn   t want you to think. He wanted you to do it Abe   s way.    We  always had an expression   and I love and I admire him. He and I had a  great relationship. One of the greatest compliments that he could make  19  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  was walking in here and saying,    Hey, you   re doing a good job.    It   s  like Dad saying,    You   re okay, you know?    It   s difficult to comment on  your colleagues, but I learned a lot from all of them. Hopefully, from the  Union   s standpoint, we built on each others    careers and  accomplishments. They were good people. They did great things with  the Union, and hopefully we   ve all added to it some more.  We were talking about your predecessors. Have you got a favorite  Norman Moore story you can share with us that can give us a sort of  glimpse into his philosophy, the kind of person he was? Or just a good  story?  I don   t know if I have any I   d like to tell on Norman. Not any fun  stories. An appreciative story. As I said, I worked for him directly for a  couple of years and, at that time, I was going through some private  issues. I spent a lot of time around Norman and Ruby   s kitchen table.  They took me under their wing and made sure I was being well taken  care of and that kind of stuff. I   ll never forget their extending that. Let   s  see, I mentioned earlier the other story about his outstanding leadership  role during a difficult time. I don   t have any dirty or funny anecdotes  regarding them. Winston, again, a lot of my fun anecdotal things have to  do with our friendships and the times that we spent at his house and  other colleagues    houses. Back during his early days and the Union,  there was a pretty well-established movie program, as there was in most  college unions. I don   t think it was extremely inappropriate, but there  were a lot of those movies we watched in their living room and den  where the projector would be taken home and some of our friends would  be invited over to see a special showing of the movie that was about to  be shown the next day in the Union. But we had some good times. There  were some dinner parties that the Dean of Students used to throw for us  that would have some other kinds of memories of Winston and some of  our other colleagues. How much we enjoyed some of those small dinner  parties, but I don   t think I want to go into details.  A couple of historical questions. Henry G. Bennett, President of  Oklahoma State University, created the master plan and probably his  two iconic buildings were first and foremost the library, but then right  behind it, the Student Union. Did he have it right about the importance  of the Student Union?  He had it exactly right. I still am amazed, if you think about Oklahoma  State University during post war, because you have to think, well, this  was open in    50, but that   s only five years post-war. Can you imagine  the impact on this campus of the Student Union coming out of the  ground, the Library coming out of the ground, Bennett Hall coming out  of the ground at the same time? Put in that historical perspective it was  20  Gill  Keys  just huge. A huge undertaking for this campus, knowing its background  and all of that. Yes, he had it right. And he had it right for the Union. I  can   t speak for the other buildings, but for the Union and the unique  nature of how this thing was funded, it was the first college union built  with student fee support with appropriated monies. The message that  that gave of students being willing to assess themselves a fee to pay for a  facility of this nature was incredible at that time. That kind of set the  way for most other college unions. Prior to that, there were other ways  that they were financed. Yes, he had it right. Yes, they did it right in  terms of how they designed the facility, the quality of the facility. This  building could not and would not be built in this day and age with the  kind of amenities and the quality of construction had it not been for his  leadership, and that of some others that traveled around, looked at other  facilities. This building is kind of an amalgamation of buildings based  on some travel that they did, and the planning of it and so on. But yes,  Bennett had it right.  Tom, the uniqueness of the funding, you talked in terms of bond  indebtedness, was the first time I know of, the Student Union and very  few campus buildings, period, but certainly student unions were funded  that way. The genius of that is certainly there. But let   s step back a  minute and recall some of your conversation earlier. There was also  having to retire that debt, and every time we   d do a major renovation,  then we   d add on that bonded debt. So, we would get paid off, then you   d  add on to it. How did that balance between programming, reaching the  students, the public/alumni you were talking about, pan out? But then at  the same time you   ve got this financial pressure of being sure that  you   re paying the bills, paying off the bonded indebtedness. How did  that impact you? What are your thoughts on that?  It was a struggle. In fact, I think one of the longest and hardest struggles  we had was from something that was very good and very significant in  1978, which was a few years prior to my coming to the Union. But in     78, the creation of the food court and that whole design on the first floor  was a several million dollar bond, and the effect of that bond, I mean the  product was good, but the effect of the bond we inherited, the term of  the bond, which   and it was bonded to its max capacity at that point. It  was a thirty-year bond, so the twenty-some-odd years I was there, I was  strapped with the bond that I inherited. So, we had to make sure that the  economic engine was still in place to pay off those bonds, and the same  thing, I   ll be quite honest about it, when we moved in we were so  strapped financially, I would not have moved into the Union as a Union  Director had there not been a transfer of funds from another student  affairs agency. At the time, Pat Hofler, who was Assistant Vice  President for Student Services, was the financial guy, and fortunately  had a philosophy of any reserves on deposit for Student Services, it  21  belonged to any and all because the Union had a million dollar cash  deficit in 1982 which was taken care of by some reserve funds out of  Residential Life. A transfer was made to balance that negative cash, or I  would not have come over here. But that at least set that. And then the  challenge was, well, okay let   s pay the debt.  I   ll give you a prime example of how poor we were at one time. The  doors of the east entrance of the Union, when I walked into the building,  were broke. I don   t mean the glass was broken. I mean some of the main  supportive structure of those doors were broken in half. My idea was,     We may be poor, but it doesn   t have to look that way,    so we put two  pieces of steel metal plate, bolted them together just to hold the doors  together and painted over them, because we couldn   t afford to change  the doors. We convinced Jay Boggs, Vice President for Academic  Affairs, that some of our meeting rooms had had AV Screens in them all  torn, that they were being used for academic purposes and so on, would  you please provide us some audio/visual assistance by replacing them.  So, we were begging and borrowing and trying to do as much as we  could to get by, because we were strapped.  Now, on the other hand, one of our greatest accomplishments as a team,  which we did by early on developing a Master Plan for where we wanted  things to be in the building and the projects and some priorities on the  projects and we began a pay-as-you-go kind of thing. We were able to  accomplish some things in terms of some improvements in the building  that, as a team, I   m quite proud of the team work. We re-engineered the  bookstore and made it much more user friendly, because we felt like,  given the cramped corners and space that we had and some other  marketing things, we wanted to do with in terms of trying to upgrade our  student store. Opening our office supplies and putting our textbooks  where students could get to them, but they wouldn   t necessarily be in the  way on a day-by-day basis. A lot of re-engineering of that. That really  helped turn that bookstore around and generate more money.  We had to generate more money in terms of rental income. So, we had a  lot of lounge space, particularly on the third floor. All the west side of  that building was total lounge space, crumbling to dust. We didn   t have  the money to renovate, but there was a pent up need for some office  space and so on. So, we began to move in that direction for rental  income. We made some adjustments along the way without having to     we did the first renovation of the hotel during that time. We spent a  whopping sum of like  1.1 million, and I say    whopping sum,    but I say  that in jest. Get that right, which wasn   t a whole lot of money at that  time. And the renovation of the hotel and the bookstore, and that was a  pay-as-you-go thing. We did not incur any additional debt. All of the  projects I   m about to mention did not incur any additional debt because  22  we did not have any bond capacity. In addition to paying off the bond,  we did the bookstore, we did the hotel, we did a lot of repair work on the  parking garage. Even the Student Services Center that was added on to  this building was done without additional indebtedness to the Union.  That was some stars lining up budgetarily with the rest of the University,  and using some other funds available for non-Student Union kinds of  things, and did that. But we were able to do all those projects.  Do the renovation of the ultimate renovation of the hotel is a story  within itself. It was a big learning curve for me and a lot of others in  terms of how to get some things done by, first of all, giving up. You give  it up to let it come back to you in terms of a facility far greater than  anything that we could have afforded and not been able to raise the  private money that the academic unit could. But that   s the magic of us  running it; there   s nothing magic of us running it. It can grow. It   s like a  child. You want it to grow and be bigger and better than it could be if it  had stayed under Mama   s apron strings. Even that was done without any  real additional indebtedness. We helped them get a bond, but we were  guaranteed payment of that. And we were able to accomplish all of that  stuff by paying as you go, which is a pretty significant achievement, I  think, over that. Plus, pay off the bond that we were strapped with from     78 on. We paid that off about five or six years early.  I   ll say this, in leaving the Union, I took a great satisfaction that our  debts were paid. We had no indebtedness. We then, therefore, had some  bond capacity for additional bonding by someone in the future. We had a  few million dollars in reserve. We had an audit in which there were no  findings, so we left it in good shape. And I don   t know what questions  are coming forth, but I will tell you a part of my decision after twenty-three  years was it   s in good shape financially, physically, we   re at the  threshold of needing a major renovation. That major renovation from  start to finish, and you know this as well as I do in terms of building, is  ten years from start to finish. I don   t think it would be good for the  Union for me to do that, and because the person who would follow me  would, in a sense, follow the same situation that I moved into and that  was strapped financially with a design that wasn   t yours, and I said,    I  don   t think I want to do that. I think it   s in good shape. It   s debt free.  There   s a reserve. All the accounting is in order. It   s time for me to  move aside and let somebody else lead that. I don   t need it. Let that  person   s star shine. Let that person be hands-on involved in the initial  design of whatever renovation.    We left a whole bunch of ideas among  our management staff, which you can look in over these past four years  and see a lot of that come to fruition. Some of those ideas have blended  into the plan for the renovation. I take a lot of satisfaction in that, and I  think I got out at a good time.  23  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Tom, you really led nicely into my final question. In looking back over  your twenty-three years as director of the Student Union, how do you  hope people remember Tom Keys?  I don   t mean to be flippant, but I told some of my staff,    In six months,  nobody will remember I ever was here.    I hope, if people do remember  me, they will remember a person that was dedicated and committed to  the Union as a facility, the Union as a service, the Union as its people.  That I was dedicated to all of that. That I was open to change, not just  change for the sake of change, but very well-considered change. That  would keep the Union kind of at the forefront of student needs and  campus needs. I had somebody from another part of the University tell  me one time, he said,    Man, you guys are fun over there because you   re  always willing to try something. There   s always something new,  something different coming on line.    I said,    Yes, we   re willing to try  things. We don   t succeed at all of them.    But I   d like to be known that  way. I would like to be known as a person who   s fair. There are  probably other sides of me that some of my staff will remember me for,  and that   s sometimes I was a pretty spirited person. (Laughs) Pretty  frank, pretty straightforward. I don   t apologize for that. I just feel like I  always wanted people to know where I stood. I always stood on the side  of trying to do what was right for the Union and the people we served.  To protect that as much as I was forced to have to protect that in the  community. That could lead a group that would, hopefully, make some  good decisions. Now, realistically, I know that I may not be remembered  at all.  Tom, thanks. Is there anything we   ve left out?  No, I think there are bits and pieces throughout all of that. Probably  much too wordy, but I think I tried to make known what I think I need to  make known.  You were known for being passionate about the Student Union, Tom. I  remember that. And you defended your territory in a positive way. You  stated your case and the importance of it, which was your role and your  job.  And I think everybody who served in positions similar to ours, you had  to take passion. The operation of the Union is, literally, and I hate to use  the expression because it   s overused, but literally, the Union is a 24/7  operation. There   s never not somebody in this building. From a Union  Director   s standpoint, you needed to have a visibility among all of your  staff and a show of support for that which was going on in the building. I  don   t want to overstate this, but short of being President of the  University, a Union Director could be here any and all times and pulled  24  Gill  Keys  Gill  Keys  Gill  in a number of directions physically, emotionally, financially, mentally  and so on. Not to overstate, but it could, if you don   t keep your priorities  in order, it can be quite taxing.  Balance act.  It   s a juggling act. We used to talk about the old Ed Sullivan Show where  the guy would spin saucers, all the time standing there, and he would go  over and grab this one and that. So, we spun a lot of saucers in twenty-three  years.  I   m sorry to say, I   m old enough to remember that. (Laughs)  Yes.  Well, Tom, thanks for taking time. Thanks for your passion.  -------  -------
