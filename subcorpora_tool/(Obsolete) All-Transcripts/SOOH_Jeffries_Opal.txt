 Finchum  Today is January 19, 2012. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library, and I   m here in Tuttle, Oklahoma,  to visit with Opal Jeffries, who is 103 years young. Thank you for having  me into your home today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s get started by having you tell us where you were born and when.  I was born, at the time, the name of the town, it was just kind of like  Tuttle, it was small. My father had a hardware store and two or three  grocery stores and stuff like that and that   s as big a town as it was. It was  Seabrie when I was born, but before we moved from there, it   s  Vineyard, Texas, now.  Vineyard?  Yes. V-I-N-E-Y-A-R-D.  And what year were you born?  1908.  Were you born at home?  Yes, ma   am.  And how many brothers and sisters do you have?  I have two sisters and two brothers and I   m in the middle.  That was my next question. Where do you fall? And have they all lived  5  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  as long as you have?  All of them were in their eighties, I think. My oldest brother got killed in  a car wreck. He was in three car wrecks, and he was killed in the third  one. He wasn   t driving either time. Of course, my youngest brother, he  lived in Norman and he was in World War II. He was captain of a ship  called Meriwether. And he was aside the ship  USS Missouri , got off of  his ship and got on the one where they watched them sign the peace  treaty. And he had that book and the pictures and stuff was in it, and it  was really an interesting book.  And he was your youngest brother?  Yes.  What was his name?  William Oliver Felkner. Felkner was his last name.  F-E-L     K-N-E-R.  K-N-E-R. And was that German, or were your grandparents from  where?  I don   t know. I really don   t know.  Kind of sounds German, but I wasn   t sure.  I think Momma   s parents were French, don   t you?   Jeffries grand-daughter, Paula Barnes, joins in.   What was her maiden name, Pounds?  Yes. They were both tall people and I think they were, now, I don   t  know anything about it, and Papa might have been in a German family. I  don   t know that, either. So I guess it doesn   t make any difference, does  it?  So for a while, the family lived in Texas. When did they come into  Oklahoma?  We moved to Cimarron County in1921 or 1922. I think it was 1922.  6  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  You were thirteen or fourteen at the time? Still living at home?  Yes, I wasn   t but about, I imagine, about eleven or twelve when I come  to Oklahoma.  And what brought them to Oklahoma?  Well, he started to Montana, and he got off there. He wanted to go where  they raised wheat. He didn   t want any cotton anymore. I don   t know  what made him stop there but he did, and it was pretty good country.  Everybody plowed up all the grass and farmed it, and boy we had some  of the awfulest dust storms you ever saw. You couldn   t see. It was  terrible.  You remember some of them?  Yes.  Did your mother have any secrets on how to keep it out of the house?  Well, we kept it all out that we could but we sure had to do some house  cleaning and dusting the next day when it quit, I   ll tell you. Then every  so often, you   d have them, it seems like. And finally, just a lot of people  left the country. And now, when they quit having them, I don   t know  what happened. I guess the earth moved over a little bit or something.  (Laughs) Got crooked on the axle, I guess.  You know, many of the  folks who lived out there lived in dug outs but my family had a normal  house .  Well, did you go to school when you were in the Panhandle?  Yes. We had a section of land and the schoolhouse was Grisholm, and  that was our address. You know, we lived there and then after I married,  a railroad come through there. The town   s called Felt now, and they   ve  got a depot and everything. And it   s quite a little town. But to go to  town, we went to different states. We went to Texline, Texas, Clayton,  New Mexico, and  Colorado  and Kansas. There was four states joined  the corner, there. Joined Oklahoma.  And how would you travel in those days?  Until we got a car, we had wagons and horseback.  If we had to travel  any long distance, we took trains wherever we needed to travel.  We  rode horseback a lot. Me and my brother went to church on horseback.  One night, we come out and it was so dark, you couldn   t see a hand in  front of you, and Bubba said,    Well, just turn them loose. They   ll take us  7  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  home.    So we turned them loose and the next thing you knew they   d  stopped at the gate at home for us to let them in. We had a lot of fun.  Kids don   t know what it is to have fun these days. They watch television  and stuff like that and don   t even get out and play or nothing, do they?  No. Well, what are some of the things you did for fun?  We played croquet and a lot of games, is what we did.  And your neighbors were close enough to have some friends over?  Well, we had a pretty good family, and we just did it ourselves.  Sometimes we would play of the night, and we would tie white rags on  top of the rickets and have lanterns sitting around where we could see.  When we had company, that   s what we did, sometimes. I don   t know  whether I even know how to play croquet, now. I haven   t played in so  long.  And they wheat farmed for a long time or just for a little while?  Oh, well they stayed. I married and we came down here. I didn   t know  any of Roy   s folks, only his sister. She was out there, and we came down  here to Chickasaw. We farmed, I guess, the first year we married.  Farmed what?  We had cotton and row crop stuff.  Chickens?  Yeah, we had chickens, and the cows we were milking. So I sold the  cream. We had a cream separator, separated the milk and sold the cream.  Then we were in bridge work, I guess, for several years. Roy was the  pile driving man.  Well, let   s back up. Tell me how you met Roy.  Oh, on Sunday evenings, the community boys always had a baseball  game. Of course, everybody in the country went to them, and that   s  where we met. They were really good friends, and they were together all  the time, so I got started going with him. And that was it.  Grandpa and your brother, right? That   s how you met him. It was  Grandpa and your brother, right? But he met you when you were taking  care of that lady that was sick, right?  8  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Oh. Well, I just went and stayed all night with her. There was a ranch  house up about half a mile up from us. She was a widow woman, but she  had a son that lived with her. He was a man, and Roy and him was  farming. Roy did the farming for him and he did the cattle. Well, he  went to Kansas City to buy some cattle and Roy was there, and her  daughter come down and asked Momma if I could go up and stay with  her of the night. She said,    She   s not afraid, but it wouldn   t look very  nice.    You know how people was in them days. Of course, he had a  bunk house he stayed in. The first morning, we always got up at five. All  of us kids got up when our parents got up. Nobody stayed in the bed.  You got up and ate breakfast at the table with everybody. So I helped her  with her breakfast, set the table and everything. And the next night I  stayed with her, next morning she was sick and she couldn   t get up. So I  went in and got breakfast. That   s the first time I really met Roy, I guess,  and I didn   t really meet him, then, I left out of the room. (Laughs)  You set the table, put the food on the table and you left.  I knew what she fixed. I fixed what she did. I had sausage and oatmeal  and coffee and biscuits.  Sounds pretty good to me.  And when it was left, I cleaned up the dishes and cleaned up the kitchen  and went home and told Momma she was sick. So Momma went up  there to see about her. And she told Momma, she says,    You know what  that kid done? She cooked breakfast and she never asked me a thing,  what to do. And she cleaned up that kitchen and left.    She said,    I   ve  hired two girls to help me, that was in their twenties, harvest hands, and  I had to tell them everything they done, and they didn   t do very much at  that.    She was just so carried away, because I knew what I was doing.  You were about fourteen, then.  I was probably, I don   t know, no, I guess I was thirteen when I cooked  that breakfast for her. But I had done it at home. The first light bread I  ever made, Momma was gone over to her sister   s and I was the cook.  And she made some light bread loaves and buns on Saturday, every  Saturday. It was quite a bit of light bread, and I thought I ought to do it  too, so I did. And I had company for dinner on Sunday, my  schoolteacher and his wife. (Laughs) Of course, we knew her real well  and she   s kind of sort of like family, and they was bragging on my  bread. Papa said,    You know, when I saw her making it, I thought it  would be to throw out.    He didn   t know I could make it.  You just watched how your mother had done it?  9  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Yeah, because we usually did whatever she did. We got a little bit of  stuff and made whatever she made, and we had us a little pan. If she  made cornbread, we made us a little pan of cornbread and put it in the  oven, just like she did.  And why was it called light bread? The color?  It would rise.  Oh, that kind of light.  Yes.  Not color, okay.  (Laughs) Rising bread, and buns.  And how old was Roy, if you were just thirteen or fourteen?  He was fifteen years older than I was. Almost. He was twenty-nine when  we married and I was fifteen. But he was just like Roy, he was just a kid.  (Laughs) They did everything. Of course, we always did, too.  Well, if he was that much older, did he have to serve in any of the wars?  World War I, he was in. I didn   t know him at that time, of course. I had  a lot of cousins that was in. They caught the train there at Vineyard.  Whole trainload of them and left for the army. I never will forget all of  them having their heads sticking out of those windows on that passenger  train and when they was pulling out and waving goodbye to all of us. I  had two cousins that got on the train there. They come back, they didn   t  get killed.  So tell me a little bit about the wedding, when you actually married.  Oh, married at Dalhart, Texas. Well, we went to Clayton to get married.  I was going to get me a suit. I got my suit, but they wouldn   t issue a  license under sixteen years of age. So we had to go to Dalhart to get  married. Well, my brother and his girlfriend, when school was out, they  was going to get married. So they found out you had to go to Dalhart, so  we just went through Dalhart and picked her up and took her. Talked  Mr. Record into letting her go with us, and they got married. But  Momma wouldn   t let us marry on the same ceremony. One of us got  married, and then the other one. But we married at the same time.  10  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  And what year was that?  1924.  And then what brought the two of you here to Tuttle? Oh, you didn   t  come here first, though. You went somewhere else.  Chickasha.  Chickasha. And that was to farm?  Yes.  Was that where his people were?  Yes. We rented a farm not far from them the first year, and then that   s  all the farming we did there. Then we was in bridge work, and sold out.  Hardesty was going to rent his farm. Sell all he had. He had a lot of  stock and hogs and about twenty hogs and mules. He didn   t have tractors  and stuff like that, and cows and stuff. We bought all of his stuff, I think,  for  10,000, and rented the place for two years. In 1928 is when we  come to Tuttle, and we been in Tuttle ever since.  We rented first one side, then the other, and finally bought this. This one  had the first shack that was built in the county. Boy, that was the coldest  house you ever lived in. It was a one-wall house, your winters come  inside. Well, they were two by twelve boards and then a strip of wood  where they joined together, one strip of wood nailed over that. When we  bought the place, we was running the dairy, and we had to have a dairy  barn and milk house and all that stuff. We couldn   t build a house. We  had to build a barn, first. (Laughs) So we built a barn and lived in that  house for three years. We bought this place in    35, and we built the  house in    39.  That was during the Depression and you were still able to buy and build.  That says something.  That was really something, though. We had a lot of sickness during that  time. Roy   s father died, my mother died, we helped with the funerals  and stuff. Then Billy Roy, our son, swallowed a pin and he had  appendicitis, it was lodged in his appendix. And I lost a kidney and I  was in the hospital seven weeks. We were still living in the old house  when all that happened. (Laughs)  No stress whatsoever, huh?  11  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  So we done pretty good, I thought. The good Lord looked after us. I  asked him to let me live to raise my kids, because Margie was just three  years old. I was in there so long, she went up to the nurse at the desk and  says,    Can we take Momma home?    I never will forget that. (Laughs)  And that was Billy Roy   s first year of school. He was always interested  in horses and stuff like that. So he drawed this picture and brought it up  for me to see it. It was a pond, and a horse was standing there drinking  out of it. I said,    Well, what   s this?    And he said,    Well, that   s his  shadow.    (Laughs) He drawed his shadow, too.  How long were you in the dairy business?  Clear up until after the kids all married. They were gone, we milked  cows awhile longer. Well, we did at first. I guess it was just Billy Roy  was gone. I guess Margie was still home, wasn   t she?  Would have been in the    40s.  I think they married about a year apart, though. They both run off and  got married. Maureen married in this house, the oldest one. She married  at home.  Well, the dairy must have done pretty well to keep with it that long.  Fourteen head by hand.  We did everything. I guess we didn   t have to hardly buy any groceries,  only flour and sugar and stuff like that, because I canned an awful lot of  stuff and it lasted all winter. I canned about everything.  Had a big garden, then?  Yes.  And did you have to do the milking? Some of it, anyway?  Yes. I milked all the time. Sometimes I did it by myself. One time I  milked thirty-seven head by myself, and I was really milking cows, I tell  you, I can really milk. I never will forget, one of them said,    I never saw  anybody that can milk as fast as you could.    I   d have a three-gallon  bucket full of milk before you could turn around. It was a good thing.  I   ve often wondered how many ten-gallon cans of milk I rolled out to  that vat and put in that water overnight for the milk man to get it the next  morning.  That was Christmas Eve. Roy had gone to Norman, my brother that  12  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  lived with us, he was in college at OU, and he went after him, and they  did some Christmas shopping before they come back. We had a hired  hand that lived just, well, it wasn   t near as far as that house out there  from us, and he always helped with the milking. Well he went to do his  Christmas shopping. I guess it was just me, and I had to go after the  cows. I left the house about eight, I guess. No, it was four. I left the  house at four. I didn   t go at eight, and I run all the way down to the river  after them, and you don   t know how cows do. They just huddle on in a  bunch and stop and eat, then you go get another bunch. And I didn   t  have a dog. When you have a dog, them cows stay together and go right  on in, but I didn   t have the dog. And I had to run all the way from one to  the other bunch till I got them to the house.  The barn held fifteen head, so I put, let   s see, thirty-seven. I put seven in  the barn, milked them first, I was kind of afraid of when it come dark  them days. We had lanterns hanging all in the barns because we didn   t  have electricity then. We lived down on the river down there at that  time, and I milked them, filling in the barn, and it wasn   t too dark when  I got the last bunch in. I was satisfied in there because I had lights. I  didn   t have to hunt up the cows in the dark, but the cows will just come  right on in the barn and stick their heads in where they belong. You   d  just shut them up. (Laughs) Or I did. And I went to the house, I think I  got done milking at eight, and I went to the house and I just lit the lamp  and here come the lights down the road to the house. That was Roy and  Bill coming in. He said,    Well, why didn   t you wait till we got here?    I  said,    Well, I thought you   d be here before I got started, but you didn   t  get here until I got done.     They timed it pretty well, didn   t they?  And you still had to cook dinner.  Really well. But nobody would believe I milked that many cows that one  night. And you know, you put your lids on your ten gallon cans and you  get ahold of them and you roll them like this (gestures) on the rim on the  bottom of them and get down there. Then you pick them up and set them  on top and get up and stand on it and let them down in the water, and  that   s it.  You   re a pretty strong woman to be able to do that, too.  I was always stout, really stout. I was always doing things I wasn   t  supposed to when I was a kid. I was operated on for appendicitis and  Papa came in after I got out of the hospital. We was home and he come  in and he said,    Now, don   t you be going out there and looking at the  house and thinking it   s crooked and try to pick up the corner of it and set  13  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  it over.    (Laughs) That sounded funny, but not near as funny as later. I  thought that was really funny. We had a happy home.  Doing the dairy, besides milking, what else would you have to do?  I rode a tractor. I helped in hay, handled bales of hay and I also ran  combines. I did about all there was to do.  It was a joint effort, then.  Yes, me and him worked together. We had a boy that he was plowing on  this across the road here and the road was going south. I bet it was as  deep as this house, the canyon that was at the side of it. It was supposed  to be a bar ditch, but it caved off and washed till it was really deep. That  crazy kid unhooked that tractor from that plow and drove it right into  that ditch. It went upside down in that deep ditch. Roy was so  aggravated he could wring that kid   s neck. He wasn   t a kid, he was a  man, and he says,    Well, I guess we   ll just have to,    he just thought it  was ruined, and of course, I did, too. He says,    I guess it   ll just have to  sit. We can   t use it. I can   t afford to have it fixed.    We just had had it  overhauled and fixed and that took all the money we had to do that. He  got the road grater man to lift it out, and he lifted it out and it didn   t even  mash the muffler on it. Can you imagine that? But it was so deep and it  was so narrow at the bottom, it didn   t go clear to the bottom. It just hung  on the walls. But it was okay. We didn   t have to do a thing to it. So I  said,    Well, we don   t have him anymore. I   ll take this tractor and you  can have the other one.    I liked the big tractor better than the other. But  he had ulcers in his stomach, and that one had a spring seat on it. I  thought that would be better for him, and I took the W-90 and that   s  what I drove. I had a four bottom plow.  How had you learned how to drive one? You just taught yourself?  Yeah. It   s just like driving a car, only you watch where you   re going.  Around the plow you   ve got to stay in the field.  Is the W-90 the one you got caught on, when you got caught on fire?  Oh, yeah.  She   s been burned.  I   m younger on this one (gesturing to left arm). See how wrinkled this  one is (gesturing to right arm) and this one isn   t? The skin is just about  forty-five years old or fifty-five. I don   t know which it is. (Laughs) The  muffler was broke on that tractor. Instead of killing it, I just left it  14  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  running to fill it with gas, and it was really windy. I had one foot on the  battery box and one on the pickup bed and had a ten-gallon can of gas.  Roy was on one side and I was on the other side, poured it in that funnel  and that funnel got full and the wind blowed it. It spilled gas on that and  it exploded, throwed gas, and the can got afire. I just drawed back to  throw that can of gas and I thought,    Oh, it   ll burn us up. We   ll be in a  lake of fire.    So I held on to it and I had my bonnet on and them days I  wore my bonnet, but I got rid of it. It was too hot. A hat was much  cooler, and I turned my head and I was feeling for that battery box to set  that can down, and then I was going to get up, jump out of the way.  Roy was just taking both hands and going down this arm putting the  blaze out and then it just blazed right back up. He burnt the inside of his  hands. When I got that can to stay there, I jerked loose from him and  jumped and didn   t even try to catch myself. I wasn   t on the side where it  was plowed and it was hard as rock, and I was really stove up, I   ll tell  you. I just reached out to rake that dirt up on me and there wasn   t no dirt  there. That was the wrong side of the tractor I was on, filling it.  So I was in the hospital for a little while, a few days. Not too long. I   d  come home and there was a woman in the room where I was, she was  older than I was, quite a bit, and she said,    You know, you   re not going  to be able to use that arm? It   s going to be up just like this.    And the  nurse come in just as she said, boy, she gave her a good raking over, I   ll  tell you. She said,    She won   t be no such a thing. She can use that arm,  and she   ll use it. It   ll be all right.    I never will forget that. She sure was  aggravated at her because she told me that.  Well these little setbacks didn   t stop you long, did they?  No.  Well, and that is the same tractor that you got your leg caught in the  power takeoff, ripped the hide off your leg.  Oh, no, that wasn   t it, then.  She   s a very accident-prone lady.  That was October, and everybody told me to stay in the house all during  every month of October. Every October, something happened to me. Got  burnt and it was in October. Well, we was helping Ellis, Roy   s brother,  get his wheat in because he was late, and we already had all of our work  done so we just took our two tractors over there and was helping him.  That   s where we was when I got burnt. (Laughs) But see, I had plowed it  over there where it   s a lot of cockleburs, big, so when I   d come to them,  15  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  I   d step over like that. I was sitting down, but I bent over to dodge them  so they wouldn   t hit me. We had maize over there and Roy was  combining it and I had the truck catching the grain.  We come in and ate dinner and went back. The truck was clear at the  other end and I was going to walk over there, and Roy says,    Get on and  ride around and you can get off when we get up there.    So I got on and  stood on the back there and oh, it was cold. I had two pairs of jeans on.  One pair was patched till it was thick and heavy and one pair was brand  new. I just stepped over when we come to them and I thought, I stepped  over and there   s a bolt on that pulley that went around and around and  held it on and it caught on my britches and it twisted it off. All I could  do, I had to be stouter than that tractor was to do it, I hooked my hip  under the seat Roy was sitting on and hollered at him and he stopped,  but of course, it took a little while. It tore both pair of my britches off  clear right here (gestures to top of leg). Them brand new ones and them  old ones, too. But I still stood up. It didn   t take me around with it. So we  stopped right there and came on home.  I cleaned up a little bit and Roy got my shoe that was full of blood, and  then he says,    I   m going to hide this shoe because if somebody comes  and you   re not here they think I   d have killed you.    So I went to the  hospital and he doctored it and kind of sewed it up. But I had it terrible  with that leg. It got kind of an infection or something, anyway, he said,     You   re going to have to stay in the hospital or else go home and go to  bed.    I said,    I   ll go home and go to bed.    We didn   t have any money to  pay the hospital bill. (Laughs) So I went home and went to bed, and I  scooted to the bathroom and back, and it got all right. I don   t know what  they called it, but it was something that happened to my leg, anyway. It  had a name. They got names to stuff you don   t even know what is.  Well, you were able to quick think a lot. If something was happening,  you could respond pretty quickly.  Just right now. You had to, I guess.  And you sold the dairy in the    40s?  I don   t know when it was we sold that. I really don   t. Our son got  married and he was milking. He   s got cows to milk and he lived across  here. We moved a house in over there. They lived there awhile, and he  milked, used our barn and stuff here to milk his cows and stuff and had  his cows here. We had made a silo down there and had silo feed for  them. And then he rented a place on down east of here and first one  place then another he went, but we had sold our cows by the time he was  married.  16  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  And then he kept wanting Roy to get a silo. Well, we didn   t need a silo. I  thought we didn   t, and we really didn   t. But Roy went in with him. We  bought it on time. That   s the way they fixed it, and you had to set it up  and all that stuff, and we never did use it. (Laughs) We set it up, and I  said,    What are you going to make the payments with this with? It   s so  much a month.    And I said,    We don   t have any income, so what are we  going to make payments with?    Well, I gathered up some of the cows  we had out at the pasture, put their calves up and I milked about five  gallons of milk every day, and that made the payments and that   s how  we paid the silo off. So that   s the last milking we did, or I did anyway.  (Laughs) Our son, he had a milking machine, a lot of people had them  them days, but we never did have one. There weren   t too many when we  were milking.  And you guys kind of quit the dairy, too, because Grandpa was getting  older and, well, and you weren   t because you were so much younger, but  it was just getting time to start slowing down on some of those things  you guys were doing.  So after the kids all married, we just did the farming and baled hay and  stuff for everybody else. We did his brother   s farming for a long time,  because he had cancer, you know, and was sick for a long time and we  did all of his farming. That   s the first time I run the combine, I guess,  because I took our combine and Roy took his. And Ellis drove the  trucks. Hauled wheat.  Did you belong to a home demonstration club at any point?  No.  No time, huh?  Didn   t have no time for that them days.  Well did the county agents come out and help with questions around the  farm or anything?  No. You had to go to them, I guess, if you needed anything. You had to  sign up in the last part of our farming, I guess.  How much acreage did you have at the time you had the dairy? How  many acres?  We had 150 and we rented some places, and we had eighty across the  road here that we farmed.  17  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Were you involved with church during that time?  Sometimes, yes.  When you were living in the panhandle with your parents, did they go to  church?  We had church in the schoolhouse and it wasn   t any denomination. It  was just the preacher would come in, or if he didn   t, we had Sunday  school. That   s what we did till we come down here.  Did they have the pie sales where the women would bring in pies and the  men would bid on them?  Yes, we had pie suppers they called them. A long time, and also box  suppers. You fixed a box and had it full of different food. Pie supper and  box supper. I   d forgotten about that. There   s a lot of stuff you forget  when you get so old.  And how many kids were in one class in the school at that time?  Well, there wasn   t very many kids in our school. Eighth grade was as far  as it went, that school where I went, then you could go down to  Bertrand, another place, and you had high school. But when Bubba and  my sister graduated from the eighth grade, they went to Bowie, Texas,  and stayed with Grandma and Grandpa Pounds and went to high school,  but they just stayed till Christmas and they wouldn   t go back. (Laugh) I  never will forget, they were so homesick they didn   t know what to do.  And they didn   t go back to school anymore. And of course, I married  and I didn   t go to school. I didn   t go down to Bertrand, but Mildred and  William did. I guess I was just dumb Dora. I think I knew about as much  as they did, though.  You knew how to take care of life and people and be successful.  And when I first got here, you were talking about dances? You would  clear out the rooms and have dances? Was this here in this house or was  it there?  No, it was out there before me and Roy married and also afterward. Our  house out there, it was kind of a square house. Had a long front porch on  it and the doors, like these two rooms, they were big rooms. The doors  slide in back in the wall, and so that made a big place and that   s where  we danced. We had an organ and also a victrola we used for our music.  And then a lot of them played French harps and stuff like that. And of  18  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  course, half of them we sang them while they was playing, while we was  dancing. That   s where I learned big foot and heel and toe and schottische  and everything.  Heel and toe I recognize, but I don   t know these other ones.  Sure enough? And put your big foot, and all that stuff.  Schottische, I have no clue what that is.  Schottische is like the Cotton Eyed Joe. That two-step thing.  That was a lot of fun, you know it?  I can imagine it would be.  It was, it really was.  Well, did you quilt much?  No, not too much. Well, Momma did, and I always did what she did, and  that   s when I learned to tat. I sat down on the floor by her, she was in the  chair tatting and I sat down on the floor and I learned to tat.  I don   t have any samples in here.  There   s a scarf on that back bedroom dresser in there, but you can   t get  it off, it   s got so many pictures on it. If you want to go in there and see  it, you can look at it.  Isn   t that tatting right there on the piano?  No, that   s crochet. I never did crochet, either.  Till later.  But I made a churn dash quilt when I was a kid. It was brand new when I  married, and we put it on the seat of the car when we went to Oklahoma  City to the State Fair. I never had been to one and came back to go home  and somebody had swiped my quilt. So that was the end of my churn  dash quilt.  What else do you remember about that particular fair if it was the first  one you   d been to? What do you remember about it?  Well, just everything like it is now, I guess, only they didn   t have as  19  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  much as they   ve got now.  Went through and saw other people   s canning and things? Did they have  rides?  Yeah, they had rides. All kinds of rides. I guess that   s when I rode a  Ferris wheel. I never did ride a Ferris wheel before, either.  Did you ride it with Grandpa?  Yes.  I could see him doing that.  Of course, he   d been to all of that kind of stuff. Because he lived down  in here and different places where they had that, and they didn   t have  that out there where we lived. You had to make your own playing or go  twenty miles to a town, either way.  And you wouldn   t do that very often, probably. Go to town.  No. No, you didn   t. When we got married, the moon was shining just as  pretty as you please that night. We got up the next morning and it had  snowed till it covered the fences all over the country. We stayed all night  in Texline. Went out to sister   s and Elmer   s. They lived on the ranch and  we went out there. You could drive over fences. You didn   t even have to  open a gate or nothing, the snow was so deep. I guess we stayed over  there about three or four days before we got home.  A snowed-in honeymoon then, huh?  Yeah.  Well, do you remember your first car?  Yeah. It was a touring car. Bubba bought it from Roy. Roy made it, I  think, but it was upholstered with leather. He did that and he put a new  top on it and all that stuff and painted it, and it looked like a new car.  That   s where I cranked it for Mom before I went to school and I   ve still  got the scar right there. I made a blister and it busted. Made a blister and  busted it and it got infected, and I had a terrible time with it. I walked  the floor one night with it and our neighbor was going to Texline in the  wagon and team to get a load of coal for heating and cooking. Me and  Momma went with him to the doctor. He lanced it and Willa Mae was  living in Texline at that time and going to school and I went to school  with her the next morning. I thought that was really something. They  20  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  had home ec and everything at that school. But I wasn   t there very long  till here come Mom and Roy. He had dug their car out.  Oh yeah, this happened before this. We went to Clayton, New Mexico,  to a show. We come out, it was snowing. We didn   t have heaters in our  cars them days, and we set a lantern in the floorboard and put a lap cover  over that. You didn   t even get cold or nothing. By the time we got, we  had to take Willie to Texline from Clayton, and then come on home and  that was twenty more miles or so and it was snowing all that time. It was  snowing when we come out of the show and did you know, Bubba and  Roy brought us to the door and they didn   t even come in or nothing, they  just tore out back because their car was going to get covered. They  didn   t get no place till they got stalled. Wasn   t no place from the house.  Come back to the house and Papa rolled out of that bed and built a fire.  They was about froze. Next morning, their car was covered. It snowed  that much it covered that car. That   s the reason we went to Texline in  that wagon because we didn   t have the car. Well, here comes Roy and he  knew I went to the doctor and I had him lance that. You know, he never  did leave our home anymore. He stayed there and doctored my hand  after that. (Laughs) He stayed with Bubba in his room.  He didn   t leave anymore after he met you, did he? He was with you,  after he met you, he was there from then on until you guys got married,  right?  Well, not right at first, he wasn   t. He did, well, he did after we went to  going together for a long time. He had dug that car out and he come in  after me, so they come to the school and got me.  How did he ask you to marry him?  He just asked me. (Laughs) That   s all I know.  Did he ask Papa first?  I don   t know. We saw him, me and Momma was in the kitchen and we  saw them talking out at the side of the house and we thought that   s what  he was doing. I don   t know. I know Papa told me, I guess it   s Christmas.  We married in March. But it was Christmas Papa told me that. How did  he bring that up? I don   t know, but anyway, he said, Roy was going to  get too serious about me, or something like that. I don   t know just how  he said it, but anyway, and I was going to be too serious about him. I  said,    I already am.    And that   s the way I answered him. (Laughs) So  that   s the way it was.  But they had farmers, now, I don   t know where they lived in Mexico, I  21  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  suppose, and they was two wagons and two men and teams, two teams,  and they was coming, they had took their beans to the market and was  coming back or else they was going and going to take them. Anyway,  they got stranded and they was at our house at that same time Roy was,  and they stayed three or four days before they could get out. We had a  house full there for a while, I   ll tell you. When them snowstorms come,  you didn   t get out no place. You stayed in or you got snowed under.  Our welder man got stranded and he told his wife to stay in the car and  he   d go see if he could find help. He froze to death. She didn   t but she  was almost dead when they found her, but she come out of it. But he  froze to death because he was out.  Well, when you had your children, did you have them at home or in the  hospital?  Home.  All of them?  Yes.  With a midwife? The doctor?  No, just Momma lived close to us. Well, she didn   t when Maurene was  born. I guess I was in Chickasha when Maurene was born, in Chickasha  at our house, and Billy Roy was born here at Tuttle and so was Margie.  At home.  That   s just the way it was in those days, wasn   t it? Did you have  electricity by then?  No. Oh no, we didn   t. We had, let   s see, we got electricity in 1935.  You always said this was the first house in this area that got electricity.  Because we had electricity in the old house just before we moved out of  it, because we had lights that hung down from the ceiling in that old  house and you just pulled the string and turned your bulb on.  Indoor plumbing?  No, you didn   t have indoor plumbing in the old house, but we had it in  this one. (Laughs) This is the only house in the country that was modern.  Have you had too many tornadoes come through here? Or any?  22  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Yes, quite a few.  Did you have a hiding place?  Yeah, we had a cellar. But we got a basement under this house.  That helps, then.  The May 3rd tornado was pretty close. Five miles. Took out her sister-in-law   s  house. The May 3rd tornado took out Aunt Mary   s house.  Mary? Yeah. Well, we stood on the front porch and saw it. That awful  tornado that just swept everything. Some of them fences, they were  chain link fences, and we went over there and that whole community  was just swept to the ground, and that fence was rolled up till it was  about that big around, all around that yard. Didn   t blow it away, but it  blowed everything else away, but it rolled that up. All the bushes and  flowers and stuff rolled up in it.  And you stood on your front porch and watched it go by?  Yes. We was all ready to go to the basement but we didn   t have to go.  We had it on TV, and they was telling how it was going.  You brought your 101 year old sister-in-law here and you were ninety at  that time, I think. So you took care of her, because she didn   t have a  place.  Yeah, blowed their house away. Well, it left part of their house. It  blowed the trees in through the bedroom. Great big old pecan tree, I  guess it was about this big around, blowed it through the bedroom and  into the other one, and that part of it, but the living room and the dining  room and the kitchen was okay. They lived in that till they got their  house built, and she never did get to live in the house. Ava Nell just  lived about a month or two before she died. Mary died before she got to  live in the house. They had her a room built in that house for her sewing  machine and stuff, she sewed so much. She died before they got that  done. Avonelle didn   t get to live in it very long before she died.  Did you sew much? Did you make your kids    clothes and things?  Yes.  Where would you go to get your fabric?  23  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Oklahoma City. And this town up here had fabric, too.  Tuttle did?  Yeah, it had one store up there that had fabric in it.  It   s getting harder and harder to find fabric these days.  Yeah, I made about all my clothes and I made coats and everything. I   ve  got everything I ever had hanging down in the basement.  Yeah, you do, and you made a lot of our clothes, too.  Yeah, I did.  Well, I know people have probably asked you this, but when you   re 103,  do you have any secret to why you   ve lived so long?  Not anything. Just the good Lord ain   t ready for me yet, I guess.  Well, do you eat anything special or stay away from anything in  particular?  No, not really. Well, I   ve had some trouble with my teeth just right  lately but some things I can   t eat very good. Do a poor job of doing it.  Do you still eat fried food?  Yes. I never was picky about what I eat. I   ll eat about everything all my  life.  Well, you stayed busy, too, I guess. Constantly working.  Really, really, I never sat down. Now I sit all the time. All but summer  times, I   ve been working outside a lot, but I won   t do that anymore. I   ll  fall over, I guess, if I do. I   ve got rheumatism too bad, and I can   t raise  this  right  hand up, but I can take this  left  hand and put it where I want  it and it   ll help me then. I can take it back, straight back, but I can   t take  it forward or lift it up over my head without doing that.  Well, what done it in the first place, I was on the ladder and I was  cleaning the gutters. (Laughs) And instead of getting down and moving  my ladder, I just reached as far as I could, and I sprained my wrist. I  never thought about breaking my arm, anything about my arm, and went  and bowled the next day and a bone broke in it. It sounded just like a  stick breaking. It bled from my shoulder down to my elbow. This just  24  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  looked black as tar it bled so much. It quit hurting in a little while, and I  didn   t tell anybody. Brandy was here one day and I had short sleeves on  and she seen my arm, and she went and told Margie and Margie took me  to the doctor. He said, well, that it   d be all right. That doctor, he didn   t  know what he was talking about. It got to hurting so much, but I thought  it was rheumatism, in it, but I guess it   s what I had done to it. Anyway,  the bone doctor said, well, he couldn   t help it no way. The only thing  that would help it would be put a whole new shoulder in there, and he  said,    And I won   t do that to you. If you can live with it, I   ll just give  you shots when it hurts too bad.    So that   s what I   ve been doing, and it   s  been several years.  How old were you when you did it? Do you know?  I was in my nineties.  So you should have asked somebody to help you clean the gutters, then?  (Laughs)  Tell her about you laying down on the roof of the shed because you  didn   t want to get caught up there trimming trees when someone pulled  into the yard. She didn   t want to get caught and have them fuss at her.  (Laughs) Well, I live on the road here and everybody knew me and  everybody would go tell Margie what I was doing. Well, I did all the  stuff. You didn   t hire stuff done. You did it yourself. I had all this  fencing and the barns to tear down and everything else. I learned one  thing, when you   ve got long sheets of sheet iron and the wind blowing  ninety miles an hour, you   d better stand this a way with it instead of this  a way. (Laughs) It   ll take you right off the top of that barn. So I learned  a lesson right there, and it was the first one I took loose and all the rest  of them I knew what to do about it. I just slid them right on off. But I got  it cleaned up around, anyway. Two barns torn down. And all the fencing  and everything else.  Pretty much by yourself?  Yeah, that   s after Roy passed away. I had to do something. I was busy  all the time. I didn   t even go anyplace. Margie was the cause of me  getting started bowling. Well, she said,    Let   s go take physical fitness up  here at that community college,    and I went with her. We didn   t any  more than get started till she quit and got Doris to go with me up there. I  was going to quit, too. I said,    I don   t need to go.    Well, before we quit,  there was some people, two women that was bowling, I mean, was  physical fitnessing, and I could out-do any of the young people. They  25  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  couldn   t do what I could do. I was limber and I could do anything, and  they thought that was terrible.  Well, then we went with these two older women over to bowl. Margie  says,    Let   s go and watch them bowl.    We didn   t no more get in that  building till she said,    Now go get you some shoes and a ball.    And I  said,    Margie, I ain   t going to do it.       You are to,    she said. So I did.  Well, of course, the teacher told you where to stand and what to do.  Well, I did it. About the second ball I throwed I knocked them all down  and this woman said,    Is there anything you can   t do?    I said,    Yes, a lot  of things.    That was just luck. I just happened to put it where she told  me. And that   s how I got started bowling. Well, I didn   t start for a long  time, because Elsie called me then and they lacked one in their team, and  took four of us. I said,    Elsie, I don   t know how to bowl.    She said,     You do too.    Well, I went and bowled, and I just kept bowling till I was  in my nineties and I hurt my shoulder. Then I quit.  So did Tuttle have a bowling alley?  No, we went to Chickasha. My sister-in-law lived halfway between  Amber and Chickasha. So I   d stop and we   d go together, then.  So you drove yourself in to your nineties as well?  I quit driving when this leg got to where I couldn   t move it, couldn   t use  it. I drove as long as I could because it was power steering, and you can  drive with an arm like that. It can lay down like this. You hold it close to  you, you can use it. Well, anyway, I bowled until I was, I guess, into my  nineties. I drove until I couldn   t use this foot, and I thought,    Well, it   s  time I quit driving.    And I wished afterwards I hadn   t dropped my  driver   s license, because I could   ve drove later when my leg got better.  It got better.  You   ve got a good attitude on life.  Whenever she went to pick up something, she would always pick up the  heavy end, no matter what it was. When it came to working, she would  always get the hardest job first, and she would pick that before anybody  else could get it. It   s just the way she was.  I can   t hear a thing she   s saying.  She   s telling tales on you.  Well, I know she is, but I couldn   t hear it.  26  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  I still think it   s one of the reasons she   s lived to be 103.  I   m a little hard of hearing now, I can tell you for sure. I have a time  understanding Margie. Do you?  Yes, I do.  Well I do. She talks, I don   t know how she does talk. Quiet, I guess you  would say, wouldn   t you.  She was saying you were a very hard worker and if there was something  heavy, you would get the heaviest end of it before someone else would.  If you picked up a stick, you were guaranteed to get the heavier end of  the stick. Every time. And she   d make sure that she beat you to it.  Everything she went to she went to at a dead run, whether it was getting  the mail or doing     We had our front yard out here, that was the playground when the kids  was all home. And the grandkids and stuff. We   d play baseball and we   d  jumped horses over ropes and everything else.  Made your own entertainment. Well, we haven   t talked about holidays  too much. What were holidays like when you were younger?  Well, when we   d get the crops all laid by was usually in August. We   d  usually go to Turner Falls or someplace like that. One time, we didn   t  know where we were going, we just decided we were going to go  through the country and go see the Mississippi River, so we did.  Did you cross it?  Just on a bridge. (Laughs)  You get out and row the boat across. (Laughter) That was a vacation?  Yeah, that   s where we went. The kids all liked to go to the Falls and  swim and stuff like that. We camped out two or three days, come home.  One time, I guess we was class parents at that time, well we rented a hall  and it had a nickelodeon in it, and them kids would put money in that till  it wouldn   t take anymore. So I guess whoever was emptying the  nickelodeon after we left had got a lot of money. (Laughs) They got all  theirs, I think. Way in the night, you   d hear them get up, mine and  Roy   s, our cots and the girls cots was in the kitchen. In that big room in  there was all the boys. And that   s where the nickelodeon was, and every  once in a while you   d hear one of them dump another one in, out off of  27  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  their cot. (Laughs)  Were your children in 4-H or FFA?  No.  Billy Roy was in sports because he played football.  Yeah, he was in sports. He was a good football player. Tuttle didn   t have  football until then. They used to have one and a boy got hurt in it and  died, and they quit the football. They didn   t have football in Tuttle for a  long time, but then the year Billy Roy played, they started football again.  They got in such a hard ground that Billy Roy got so skinned up and he  was terrible. I had to take him to Minco to the doctor a dozen different  times about his skin ups. And Roy took the tractor up there and plowed  the ground up and leveled it down and it was soft then. It made it all  right.  Well, is Tuttle as big as it was? Has it grown any?  Yes. It   s growed around Tuttle till it   s ridiculous. We   ve had to rebuild  two different schools, and we still don   t have enough. I forgot how  many, last year I think there was five hundred in the fifth grade. One of  them that had been here a long time, he said,    You know what? We got  more in the first grade than we ever had in the whole school before.     Now it   s two or three pages of graduating seniors. It   s a big school.  Well, I want to know how early in the morning do you get up these days?  Now? About five. I got up at five this morning. I go to bed about ten  thirty. Don   t ever get in bed till eleven. I start at ten thirty. (Laughs)  Do you set your clock for five or do you just automatically wake up?  I just wake up. Come in here and sit and turn on the TV. Need some five  o   clock news every morning that I listen to. You   ve seen these people  going out and getting their paper and reading it, haven   t you? Well, I  come sit in that chair and watch TV.  And drink coffee, or     I used to drink coffee, but I don   t drink coffee anymore. That   s one thing  I quit.  So breakfast would be what, then?  28  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Cereal. Different cereals. Sometimes I   ll eat either sausage or bacon and  egg and toast. Not very often. I like the cereal better.  Well, between five and then ten thirty do you take a nap?  If I read, I get sleepy. If I don   t read, I don   t. (Laughs)  What do you do all day?  Just piddle. I   m always hunting for something, seems like, though. I   ll  think about something.  Tat. Do your tatting.  Yeah, I   ve tatted a lot and I   ve crocheted afghans like that and given  everybody in the country one.  And stayed off the roof?  And stayed off the roof. My grandson said,    Grandma, don   t let me  catch you on that roof anymore,    and I said,    You won   t catch me. I  know when you work and when you don   t.    (Laughs) He   s a fireman,  you know. Well, this tree right here, it   s had a terrible time. That storm  just blowed it all to pieces. Two or three storms have just broke that all  to pieces, and it looks awful, but when it gets leafed out, it don   t look so  bad. But anyway, it broke a limb down and the limb didn   t go down to  the ground, it fell down this way and it was holding up and the bark was  holding it in one place. Well, if I pushed it down, it would split that clear  down that tree, and I was afraid it   d kill the tree. So I just got the ladder  and went up there and cut the bark under there. What else could you do?  And then I pushed it over. Here come my neighbor in here in the car and  she says,    What are you doing?     That wasn   t your neighbor, Grandma, that was me. I said,    What are you  doing? Get off that ladder before someone catches you.     Well, it would have peeled that bark clear down to the bottom of that  tree, and it was up high because I couldn   t reach it. I had to get the  ladder and go up it. We had a big tall ladder in them days. I bought me a  six foot and that   s what I was cleaning the gutters with, and I had to  stand on the top of that ladder instead of on the step to even reach these  gutters. These windows are high off of the ground. You can   t wash them  outside without getting on something.  You   ll have to hide her ladders, huh?  29  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  So I gave my ladder away and now I don   t even have a ladder.  We had to get rid of your lawn mower and told you to quit mowing your  lawn.  Yeah. The doctor told me to stay off of the ladders. He said,    Now, I  mean stay off the ladders. Don   t get on ladders.    I never said nothing.  He said,    I   ll let you still be mowing your lawn, but stay off of the  ladders,    and I said,    Okay.    He just grabbed me up and slung me  around.  So I have to get on the ladder to get a light. How can you put a light bulb  in the light if you don   t get on the ladder? Or get anything out of the  second shelf in my kitchen. I   ll tell you what I did do. You know that  thing  the grabber  Margie gave me that you reach up? Somebody had  turned that light off at the steps as you go down in the basement. All the  other lights are on. But this one wasn   t on. It looked kind of dark when  you first looked down in it, so I got that. I couldn   t reach that string. It  was all wadded up, it wasn   t hanging down. I got that thing and got  ahold of that string and turned it on. So I got a light now there at that  step, at the bottom of the steps. (Laughs)  Figure out a solution for everything, huh?  Where there   s a will, there   s a way, isn   t there? Sometimes you get in  trouble, though, don   t you?  You get caught.  Yeah.  Well, is there anything left on your to-do list? Like your bucket list?  Anything you want left to do?  No. At least a lot of things I wished I could still do, but I guess I   ll be  satisfied if I can even get out of bed, hadn   t I?  Do you remember your first airplane ride?  Yeah. Going to Lake Tahoe. First trip. I think that   s the first ride. It  might have, no, first one it was going to Washington, D.C. That   s right.  Me and Margie went with Alice and Billie Claire.  To see the Capitol?  Yeah. Well, we have a niece and nephew that live in California and he  30  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  had to be in Washington every so often, to a meeting, I guess it was,  once a year. He didn   t like for Melba to go around by herself, and he  wanted us to go up and be with her and we   d all go places. Well, that   s  what we done. That   s the first airplane ride I got. Alice went with Billie  Claire and Margie went with me, or I went with Margie, and we was all  together.  Oh, we had two beds and a cot in that one room, and all us ladies slept in  it. Bill had to stay where his job was, and when his job was over, he  come in and he got in the middle of one of them beds and jumped up and  down. Billie Claire had left her glasses laying in there and the lenses  come out of her glasses, and there just happened to be a place downstairs  where they did stuff like that and she got them put back in. (Laughs)  We rented a car and we took a trip up to Pennsylvania and then a lot of  the places. We seen a lot of stuff, but we come back and you could smell  the chocolate but it was closed. We didn   t get to go in where they made  all these Hersheys and stuff. Then I saw the draw bridges that they  raised up to let the ships go through, stuff like that. And the people that  farmed with teams and rode in buggies and stuff like that. They always  had a lot of pretty quilts, didn   t they?  They do. Pretty colors.  I used to have quite a few quilts, not too many anymore. But I did make  that spread in there and embroidered it. That   s my first cross-stitch I ever  done was that, because I always embroidered. I never cross-stitched.  You seem to have a very good sense of humor, too.  I don   t know about that.  Do you ever get mad?  I always have my mouth open, haven   t I? (Laughs)  Never saw her mad with anyone.  Do you ever get mad?  I imagine I do. I don   t remember what I do. I get pretty aggravated, I  guess.  There seems to have been some stress in your life, but you have been  able to just work right through it.  31  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Yes.  Keep going.  Well, tomorrow may be better. Make it through today and maybe  tomorrow will be better.  That   s always what we remember about you. Tomorrow will always be  better.  What   s your favorite thing to cook these days?  You know, I don   t cook very good anymore. I used to just cook like  everything, but I ain   t a very good cook anymore. I don   t know what to  cook.  Well, what used to be your specialty, then?  I don   t know that I had any. German chocolate cake, I guess. I always  had to have one of them.  Well, she always, we still to this day still do Christmas here in this  house, and she still does the majority of the cooking, and so everything  she puts on is just amazing.  Turkey or ham?  Turkey on Christmas.  I did Thanksgiving at our house this time and she always cooked in this  Nesco cooker. I tried cooking turkeys and it just failed abysmally, so I  thought,    Okay, Grandma, I   ve got the turkey and I   ve got the Nesco.  Now what do I do?    A long pause.    Well, you cook it.    And I said,     Well, for how long?       Till it   s done.       Grandma, this isn   t helping me  any.       Well, honey, you just cook it.       Okay, Grandma. Never mind.     Very matter-of-fact.  I guess you   ve done it so long you just know when it   s done.  Yeah. We had a lot of hands a lot of times and I had hands to cook for  all the time. We always had a table full of hands or folks.  Tell her about how you do when people send you flowers, what you do  with those roses.  Huh?  32  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Barnes  Jeffries  When people send you bouquets of flowers, and what you do with the  roses. When you put them in the ground with the fruit jar on top?  Oh, yeah. You can cut a limb off of a rose bush in November and put it  in the ground, have a joint in it, in the limb someplace, and put a fruit jar  over it and leave it till April or May or whenever there isn   t any more  freeze, and it   ll have some leaves on it by the time you take the  jar off  of it . I had roses on it that very year, last year or the year before last, or  whenever it was.  So when people send you bouquets of flowers for Mother   s Day or  whatever, she   ll take those and there   s rose bushes are all around here,  that have come from cut florist flowers, and she does that.  Does it only work with roses?  Well, I had all kind of flowers for awhile, but I don   t anymore. The  gophers, I worked with gophers this year till they    it was pitiful, and  this last, I   d say, three months, they   ve undermined my whole yard. Just  hollow, you just walk over it and sink down. I spent a lot of money on  gopher poison and I   ve still got them. They got real bad just lately. I was  afraid, I couldn   t hardly bend over, finally and I   d take the wheelbarrow  with me and so if I fell over, I could get up because I couldn   t get up if I  didn   t have something to hold to. (Laughs) So I   d take the wheelbarrow  and the feed, poison grain.  They   ll be taking that away from you next, then, huh, the wheelbarrow?  Will be the next to go.  I think we   re going to manage that one.  And I   ll tell you what, I   m aggravated to pieces about, there   s two sacks  of cement, mix cement. All you have to do is put water in it. I used to  mix cement, you know, three scoops of sand and one scoop of cement  and water and you stirred it up and that was cement. Well, they didn   t  tell me they was through with it and there   s two sack fulls out there in  that garage. It   s got hard as a brick and look what my door looks like  going out and in back there. That would have made me an awful nice  step, and I could   ve fixed it myself if they told me I could have it. But  it   s got too hard and I can   t have it. I wonder, for real, inside of it if I   d  chop it open, it would be dry. (Laughs) I might try it. But I think that  looks awful there, that door. I guess I could go get me another sack of  theirs and use it just to make me a step there and it wouldn   t be all  gravel.  33  Barnes  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  There   s nothing you think you can   t fix or do.  But I won   t do it before summer, because I   m not going to work outside  when it   s cold. I   ll make it to the mailbox and back and that   s it. And  when it   s real windy, I   ll go all the way this way and that a way  (gestures swaying). I   ve got to where I take that cane with me because I  can balance myself better, because right lately I can   t balance too good  when I walk. But I   m thankful I can still walk and so that   s okay, isn   t  it?  It is. I   m assuming you don   t fix a garden any more then, a vegetable  garden?  No. I did have a tomato vine. Nobody had any tomatoes this year, I don   t  think, and you know that crazy vine, I watered it and watered it and it  didn   t have but just a few tomatoes but they never did grow or anything.  They   d bloom, and when it started to rain and got cooler, that bush was  loaded with tomatoes about this big when it come a freeze. So it waited  too long to put its tomatoes on. I had that this year.  Have some big fried green tomatoes, then.  Yeah.  Well, do you have a couple of highlights? If someone asked you what a  few highlights are?  No, I don   t have any.  It   s all been good, huh?  Yeah, everything, and the kids are all so good to me. It   s pitiful.  So you have three children, how many grandchildren?  Twelve.  And then great-grandchildren?  Great-great. Last count I had of the great-great-great I had nine, or ten,  but I   ve had several since then, so I don   t know. There   s some of them  I   ve never seen, some of the great-great-great. I   ve got five generations  of two different families.  Makes for some good family gatherings, then, doesn   t it?  34  Jeffries  Barnes  Jeffries  Barnes  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Jeffries  Finchum  Yes, it sure does. There   s lots of them live around, on my birthday, I  think there was about twenty-six there, wasn   t there? And everybody  was kin but Henry and Betty. And Henry seems like he   s kin.  Where did we celebrate your birthday?  Up at the Olive Garden. (Laughs)  The wait staff thinks it   s pretty neat to be able to sing to somebody that  old.  Well, any advice for those of us who are hoping to live as long as you?  Not any. Just be thankful to the Lord that you can do what you do, I  guess.  And get up at five o   clock and do it, huh?  Yeah. I   m getting to where I don   t get up that, I wake up, but I have to  get up and walk around. I get up and walk around sometimes then go  back to bed. Sometimes I take a little nap in that chair after I get up and  the news gets to advertising all this stuff, and I don   t pay any attention to  that.  No secrets you want to tell us?  I don   t have any secrets, I don   t think. I don   t know what I   d do without  Margie and Lloyd, though. They live right down here close to me and if  Lloyd   s going to town, Margie will call me,    Is there anything you from  town? Lloyd   s going, he can get it.     So you talk to somebody almost every day?  Margie usually calls me. If it ain   t through the day, it   ll be before I get to  bed in the night, sometimes. She called last night and she said,    Well, I  hadn   t called you today, I thought I   d better call you before I go to bed.     Well, I think you   re amazing myself.  Well, thank you.  I appreciate you sharing some of your stories with me today.  Thanks.  And if there   s nothing else, we   ll close off.  35  Jeffries  Finchum  I guess that   s all. I   m still sitting here.  And with a smile on your face, that   s great. Thank you.  -------  -------
