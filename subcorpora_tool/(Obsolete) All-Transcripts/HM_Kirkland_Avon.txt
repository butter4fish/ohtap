Speaker 1: My name is Loretta Henry, and I'm going to be doing the interview.  And Scott Stearns is our videographer--sorry about that.  So, we're gonna continue.  Is everything okay?  (Unclear)-okay. Okay, so, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Avon] Kirkland, it's so nice to meet you.
Speaker 2: Please call me Avon.
Speaker 1: Okay, Avon, thank you for joining us.  Could you please tell us your name, first, middle, and last name and spell it, please, spell them?
Speaker 2: My name is Avon Kirkland, A-V-O-N, K-I-R-K-L-A-N-D.  I have no middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay, could you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: May, may I tell you a story about it?
Speaker 1: Sure, I would love to hear a story about it.
Speaker 2: When I was about thirty years old, thirty-ish, I decided I didn't have a middle name, and I had the opportunity of adopting one, so I could give myself a name.  It's a true story.  And I went through all of the alphabets, putting it with A. blank Kirkland to see what sound good.  A. R. Kirkland didn't sound right, "ark," you know, and so on, and I settled on J.  And I couldn't find a name that kind of came off the tongue nicely, Avon blank Kirkland, none--of it sounded from the names that occurred to me.  So I wrote three or four of my friends, and I said suggest a middle name for me.  [HistoryMaker] Walter [E.] Massey was one of them.  After a while they all, true story, after a while they all responded the same suggestion, Jackass (laughter).
Speaker 1: So is, is that, what, you went to court and, and you had your name (laughter) changed?
Speaker 2: No, I decided to (laughter) let it go.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).

Speaker 1: We're gonna start with five simple little questions.  Just bear with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There is-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --a few People magazine type questions--you movie star, okay (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My favorite flower is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Your favorite food, not the favorite flower.
Speaker 2: What is my favorite--
Speaker 1: Favorite food.
Speaker 2: --food?  My favorite food is baby back ribs, barbecue the way I do it.
Speaker 1: And how is that?
Speaker 2: How long you got (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It's a sau--there, there's a sauce that I make by doctoring Kraft's bit of--a bit of lime juice, brown sugar, Tabasco and particular way, but it's mostly in the, in the way that the meat is cooked or not overcooked.
Speaker 1: So do you slow--I'm, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I'm interested in this recipe.  Do you slow cook it over--
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: --over coals or--
Speaker 2: I do.  Yeah, and you watch it very carefully.  Most people overcook barbecue chicken, ribs, whatever.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, I'll tell you later. The time of the, what's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, living in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California], where it is spring much of the year, it's any time of year just about here, where it rains three or four months.  But other than that, the weather is pretty, pretty much the same.  Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Why--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I made some--it's a racial chauvinist thing--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  I just think it's an elegant, and it's--it's always elegant.
Speaker 1: Okay, your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere (laughter).  No, I have to tell you, I'm often mischievous in my answers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or in my conversation, so.  I've been a lot of places.  I don't know what my favorite is.  I know some that I like.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I think my favorite might be the places I haven't been that I'd like to go.  I haven't been to Brazil.  I haven't been to Africa.  The far--went to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong and Japan once, but I'd like to go to Russia.  I'd like, I'd like to see much of the world, and I'd like to go to South America, particularly the Andean region where, where the, the, the folk music there is really lovely and haunting.  But I don't have any one particular place.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a, a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) One that's--doesn't in--include one of the seven words recently outlawed by the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]? (Laughter) Favorite word or phrase?
Speaker 1: Phrase, sayings.
Speaker 2: Saying?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, saying.
Speaker 2: Oh, probably, but I can't think of--there are a number I like, but I can't think of any right now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine.
Story_ID: 202846
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna talk a little bit about your family and your background, okay.  Could you please tell us about your mother?  What was her name?  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Parrott, Georgia.  Her maiden name was Lula Mae, Lula Mae Durham.  She was born in 1910.  Parrott is sort of Central Georgia, not too far from [President James Earl] "Jimmy" Carter's Plains, Georgia, and not too far from Albany [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about her growing up or her background?
Speaker 2: Very typical black southern childhood on the farm.  My mother's mother had three children by a white man who gave her land.  And--but my grandmother died when my mother was ten, leaving her with an aunt to raise her.  My mother was an ambitious woman.  When she was sixteen years old she worked part of the way--walked part of the way--had enough money to ride a bus part of the way to Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] where she worked her way through high school.  So she entered at age sixteen in the sixth grade, and six or seven years later graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful story.  Did, you said that your grandmother was given land.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So, did your, your mother and her sisters inherit it, or they lost it?
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt had it for a while, but they lost it probably because they couldn't pay taxes.  There were so many ways that poor black people could be manipulated into debt during those times.  And I don't know the details of it, but they did, it did leave their hands pretty early on.
Story_ID: 202847
Speaker 1: Could you tell us something about your father?  What was his name?  Where was he born?
Speaker 2: My father is William Kirkland.  He was born in Newville, near Newville, Alabama, which is near Mobile, Alabama, so far in the country you had to be near about three places to, to connect to one that somebody's heard of.  Anyway, he was one of, I don't know, we're, we're not sure how many brothers or, and sisters and half-brothers and half-sisters he had because my grandfather remarried after my father's mother died and had some more kids, actually well into his eighties he had, when he died at the age of eighty-three, eighty-two, and he had a three-year-old that my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] said looked like him, right.  I hope to carry on in that fine tradition.
Speaker 1: How do you describe your father?  Do you have any stories to--
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I never knew my father because he died a month before my twin sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I were born in 1936.  This was during the [Great] Depression.  He died accidently.  And I'm, the, what I know about him I learned from, partly from my mother, but also from his sister and aunt whose picture I have by the way because she became a very important person in my life.  He was, he, they, my mother met my father in Jacksonville, Florida, where she went to live with her sister after she finished Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], hoping to find a job teaching elementary school because at that time if you had a high school diploma, in the early 1930s, you could teach school.  She didn't get a job.  You actually had to bribe--there were enough people wanting those jobs that the people who made the decisions could, could help those if they wanted and did.  She was a maid for the rest of her life.  My father met my mother there, and he was, he had moved to Jacksonville to live with my Aunt Berlie [ph.], his sister, and was an ambitious and bright kid.  She said, my, my aunt said he was smart as a whippersnapper.  But he was very poor, and even in Jacksonville among other poor people they used to tease him about ragged clothes and shoes with holes in 'em and stuff like that.  And he, he never finished high school.  And he started working on becoming a cook, and that's what he did until his accident in 1936.
Story_ID: 202848
Speaker 1: Have you, do you know anything about your ancestors, your grandparents, your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not a great deal.  We're actually researching it a bit now, my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] particularly, my sister, Yvonne.  We know who my white grandfather was before he died because my mother's [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] brother moved away from Parrott, Georgia, but not too far and would see him from time to time in a town about fifteen or twenty miles away.  And in fact, I have cousins now, my Uncle Everett's [ph.] children who live in Cleveland [Georgia], who tell stories about going to this little town where their grandfather lived and him pointing them out as his grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Oh, really?
Speaker 2: But he never took an interest in them.
Speaker 1: I see, okay, okay, can you tell us about your grandparents on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, that is on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother's mother is named Classie [Durham], and she, you know, she was uneducated, and born and raised in rural Georgia, and never got out of it.  And that's about all I know on my mother's side.  As a matter of fact, though, I, I was thinking the other day that at some point my son [Avery Julian Kirkland] and I would go to that region.  I understand that the white children of our white grandfather on my mother's side are nice people.  And I would try to learn more about my grandfather and so on.  As a matter of fact, when one of my cousins in that region graduated from high school, a couple of 'em came.  Isn't it odd?  And it's sort of, you can't, you never know.  So that's on my mother's side.  That's about all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't know your father's [William Kirkland] parents?
Speaker 2: Your my father's parents, I met my grandfather once.  He was pretty old by then, in the '40s [1940s].  I was maybe ten or eleven.  He came to visit us in Jacksonville [Florida].  And he was a crotchety old guy who wanted to see Willy's twins.  He'd never seen 'em, so he came, and he stayed for a few days.  And he was interesting.  I hardly remember him, frankly, but I've heard a lot about him, Richmond Kirkland [ph.].  I didn't put that on my form, but it's Richmond Kirkland.  He's the one who had so many kids, and my father, William, was one of about thirteen or fourteen from his first wife.
Story_ID: 202849
Speaker 1: Do you remember when you were growing up in Jackson [sic.]--
Speaker 2: Jacksonville [Florida].
Speaker 1: --Jacksonville, I'm sorry, were, did you have aunts and uncles there?  Was there extended family, your cousins?
Speaker 2: We had a nice extended family.  I wish I had, my family were as extended here as it was then.  Our uncle lived in rural Georgia about seventy-five miles away, maybe more.  My aunt lived with us much of the time, my Aunt Rushiebell, unusual name, never heard it since, R-U-S-H-I-E.  Rushiebell.  And, but more than that--and we had a few cousins here and there in Jacksonville.  But more than that, we, my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I, once we were born--my father [William Kirkland] had just died a month before--were taken care of by a family, the Felders, Mary Felder [ph.], who was older, and she took care of us.  And she had a large family, and actually their family became in many ways our family, too.  In fact, the person I most want to see in Jacksonville is one of, is her last surviving child, who's a very nice man.
Story_ID: 202850
Speaker 1: You mentioned your [twin] sister [Yvonne K. Moody], but you also have a brother [Donald G. Kirkland].
Speaker 2: I have a brother.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about your brothers and sisters--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --brother and sister?
Speaker 2: My brother, Donald Gene was--he's dead now--he was a year and, about a year and eight months older than us, my sister and I.  And when my father [William Kirkland] died he was sent to live with an aunt and uncle in St. Petersburg, Florida, for a while.  Turns out that they didn't have any children, and they wanted some.  And they convinced my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] to let him stay with them.  They were in better shape than we were financially.  (Laughter) We were really poor.  And as it turned out, he stayed with them until he finished high school.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: We would visit, and we did, he certainly didn't have as close a relationship as my sister and I have and had at that time.  But we were brothers and sisters, and we, we'd see each other, and we'd enjoy each other.  And when he died and his wife died, their two children, my sister and I became guardians for, for.  And right now I'm still guardian for (laughter), for one who's taking a different path.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Can you tell us about your sister?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Yvonne Kirkland Moody.  She, both of us were fortunate that our mother was woman with, that was ambitious, in the best sense of the word, and wanted us to become something.  She worked very hard, six, seven days a weeks as a maid at, much, much of our childhood, during the [Great] Depression, remember.  And my sister and I graduated from high school, and we were--well, she was, you know how girls grow up, grow faster than boys, at least early on, so she was usually bigger than I was, and she was bossy.  And she used to intimidate me, until about age nine I just got fed up with it, and I hit her in the nose, and she stopped bothering me (laughter).  Since that time, we've gotten, we've gotten along very well, so much so that in high school I had a full-time job from tenth through graduating, and she didn't work.  We were poor.  We, we moved up to the projects (laughter) when I was about thirteen or fourteen, and I had a full-time job.  And I used to give her an allowance.  And she went to Grady Nursing School [Grady Hospital School of Nursing] in Atlanta [Georgia], where you could work your way through nursing school, and got an RN degree in three years.  And my last year in college she sent me a, an allowance monthly.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: She became a nurse, got a bachelor's degree in nursing from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], a master's from DePaul [University] in Chicago [Illinois], and became a nursing administrator in the Veteran's Administration [VA] hospital system, did very well.  She's a talented woman, good manager, and when she retired three or four years ago, her responsibilities, well, her job was to oversee the operation of nursing activities in all VA hospitals west of the Mississippi.  She was actually offered the next job up, but (laughter) she said, "I don't think I want the whole country."  She now lives in Washington [D.C.], retired recently.  And we are probably each other's best friends.
Story_ID: 202851
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory--
Speaker 1: The earliest--
Speaker 2: --usually involves spankings (laughter).  I remember when I was four years old, my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] got a little kitchen set, a stove and this and that.  And I tried to light a fire under the stove because it wouldn't get hot (laughter).  I remember that 'cause I got a helluva spanking.  They tell me I got a spanking for another infraction not long after that.  There was a song popular at the time that I was singing.  We lived across the street from a juke joint, so, in my childhood, in the late '40s [1940s] I heard Muddy Waters' first release.  I heard [HistoryMaker] B.B. King's on Ms. B's [ph.] juke joint --
Speaker 1: Juke box.
Speaker 2: --juke box.  And it was a song out that I liked a lot, and I used to go around singing it.  Well, it was, it was not a clean song.  And my rela, my relatives and friends would tease me when I'd go back to Jacksonville as an adult, said, "Boy, your mama sure fanned your hide, boy--tanned your hide for singing that song."  I said, "What song?"  "I--I don't know what the name of that song was.  You were, but we remember you going around saying, 'Why don't you feel my leg, leg, leg, leg, leg, don't you feel my leg.'"  And I wondered for years what that song was.  And then in the 1960s it was released by Maria Muldaur and is called 'Don't You Feel My Leg.'  And that wasn't the only feeling that, that took place in the song, and I understood why my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] was so upset that her four-year-old--I mean you go to Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], you come out with pretty, pretty bourgeois, you know, things to try to live by.  And of course if you're poor and you're trying to make a life for yourself, you, I mean it's part of being, you know, sort of getting up in the world a little bit.  Prove that, you know, you're not low down, dirty, and all of that and so forth and so on.  And the blues, of course, back then was the devil's music, so--there you have it. I remember that.  And I had a nice childhood.  My sister and I were skipped a grade early on.  And I played baseball.  I played football.  I was very sports oriented.  We did well in school most of the time, even though I didn't study.  And we're talking about segregated South now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We actually at one point--I was doing some reading a few months ago.  At one point, when we lived in Jacksonville, I used to walk past a house on Church Street in Jacksonville, Florida, at a  to go to a little part-time job I had when I was about ten years old.  We walked past a house that is mentioned as the house that the singer, Ray Charles, lived in during that period when he left the [Florida] School for the [Deaf and the] Blind in St. Augustine, Florida, and went out on his own at age fifteen or sixteen.  And I almost met Ray Charles when I went down to his office.  I was supposed to meet him, but I talked to his manager.  But he's gonna know that I know where he was, because there was a huge oak tree whose roots tore up the sidewalk, went out in the street, and I used to have to walk over that thing as a little boy.  And I know that as a blind guy who, who, who moved around without the aid of other people, he knew that tree (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm sure he did.
Speaker 2: Just an average childhood, you know--nothing particularly horrible.  We were just poor.
Story_ID: 202852
Speaker 1: Did you have chores?  Did--were there things you had to do every day?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what were they?
Speaker 2: Well, when we got to be about ten we cooked for ourselves and pretty well too.  I remember the first cake we baked for my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] on her birthday, a one-egg cake it was called.  And it, it was going along pretty well in the oven, then it fell (laughter).  We, we didn't make any icing or anything.  It was--my mother really loved it.  She said it was a nice gesture she thought, and we all sat down and ate some of the cake.  I'm sure it tasted terrible, but.  What was your question?
Speaker 1: Your chore, your daily life, what was your schedule?
Speaker 2: Oh, just went to school.  But you know, if, if we wanted anything, we often had to get it, you know.  I mean we were, we were into survival.
Speaker 1: What were your holidays like?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Holidays, Christmas, Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were fine.  We, we'd get, we--I would have money to buy gifts with for myself, and my sister [Yvonne K. Moody], and my mother, et cetera.  And my sister, we'd get some money from my mother and so forth and friends.  And we would decorate the Christmas tree.  I remember taking Christmas paper and cutting them up and making little chain rings, paper strips and so on.  You know, everybody was like us around there. And no, there was nothing traumatic about it.  It was pretty restricted.  I remember (laughter) we, we only went to the dentist if our teeth hurt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember, for example, sitting in the dental, dentist wait, waiting, waiting room with a sore tooth, sore mouth when, and heard on the radio while I was sitting there the funeral cortege or ceremonies when FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died--
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna--
Speaker 2: --nineteen forty-five [1945].
Story_ID: 202853
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Avon [Kirkland], you have recalled your favorite quote, and would you like to tell us about it?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's on my W.E.B. Du Bois poster on the wall there.  And you can't see it, but it reads: "There can be no perfect democracy curtailed by color, race, or poverty, but with all, we accomplish all, even peace."
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why is that important to you?  Why you--
Speaker 2: I'm just very, very committed to economic and social justice for the downtrodden in the world.  And it comes from my own experience and, and a lot of reading and consciousness raising (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that kind of ties in with you were saying that you heard the funeral of FDR [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 202854
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up during that time in [Jacksonville] Florida?
Speaker 2: We were protected from some of the stuff that went on, some of the racial stuff that went on.  We, I mean you, you grow up learning to know that you don't do certain things, especially around white people.  But there weren't, there really weren't a lot of bad kids in our neighborhood.  And we were poor, but we were--we wanted to--improve our lives, and to go to school, and to work, and you know, be good citizens, and take care of our families.  Still, it was the segregated South, and we sat on the back of the bus.  And there were only certain jobs you could have, as when I worked in [Stanton] High School [Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] at a, at a restaurant in Jacksonville.  I could have been a great waiter, but black people weren't waiting tables at that restaurant, so I washed dishes and pots, and I worked my way up to being a busboy.
Story_ID: 202855
Speaker 1: What was the neighborhood, the section of Jacksonville [Florida] that you lived in, what was your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, that is interesting.  It was called Black Bottom, and it was both (laughter).  It was all black of course; it was poor; streets were unpaved.  And I mentioned earlier there was a juke joint across the street, and so I knew all the music coming along at that time.  I've always been very musical.  I have a good ear.  I whistle a lot to myself and used to sing a lot to myself, and I used to sing, too.  We'll get to that.  I don't think you know that.  You, you asked about my childhood.  I actually restrict that to grade twelve--I mean to age twelve and under, but I'm speaking now in general.  My mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] would have trouble with disre--being disrespected at some of the places she worked.  There's a woman she worked for the entire period of our childhood, Mrs. Ellis [ph.], who could be a little nasty.  And from time to time my mother, who would let you go so far and then she would stop you, very, very clearly.  When Lula Mae got mad, you knew something was wrong.  And--but there are some sort of funny things that happened on a racial basis that turned out, at least in one case, to be really rather remarkable.  My mother worked for a woman name Mrs. Hogdoll [ph.], who lived actually about twenty, a fifteen-minute walk from our house.  The black and white neighborhoods were separated by a park, a white park called Springfield Park [ph.], and so we could walk across the park to this woman's house.  Mrs. Hogdoll had a young son unexpectedly (laughter) after most of her other children were grown.  His name was Eric [ph.], and Eric was four years old when, when he called my mother a nigger.  And my mother picked him up, started to slap him, and then put him back down and marched straight to Mrs. Hogdoll and told her what had happened.  And Mrs. Hogdoll was a nice woman.  She went and really balled Eric out, and he understood that he'd done something very bad.  But he did ask, "Well, is it all right to say Mrs. Nigger?" (Laughter) Now the nice part about this is that Eric grew up to be one of the leading civil rights lawyers in Central Florida.  Isn't that nice?
Speaker 1: That's a nice story, a good story--
Story_ID: 202856
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your neighbors, the neighbors around you, your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I'm not sure--Jacksonville, Florida, never has been among, in the forefront of much that was progressive.  And I'm not sure how available welfare was.  But most of the poor people we knew in our neighborhood were not on welfare.  They were working at low level jobs.  This one woman downstairs that I've always wanted to write a short story about, Mrs. Precious [ph.], her name was Precious, Precious Sarvage.  I think it's Sarvage, S-A-R-V-A-G-E.  And when somebody would chase me home, a bully or something, I would go see Mrs. Precious (laughter).  She would come out on that porch with her hands on her hips, boy, and she would stare down the Russian army (laughter), if she had to, nice lady.  Her husband drove a, a truck for a Mayflower [Transit] trucking company.  The people around us mostly worked in low-level jobs.  I did have an aunt once who lived, didn't live too far from us.  I guess she had a job of some kind of, or another.  She left when my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I were children, but we did--she did stay there long enough for us to learn that her main source of income was selling moonshine (laughter), Aunt Verlie [ph.]--
Speaker 1: That was her name?
Speaker 2: --and a sister to Aunt Berlie [ph.] (laughter) that my father [William Kirkland] knew--
Story_ID: 202857
Speaker 1: Are there any sights, or sounds, or smells that when you come in contact with them they remind you of growing up, of home?
Speaker 2: Humidity.
Speaker 1: Humidity?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Jacksonville [Florida] is very humid, and when it gets hot there and humid it is insufferable; fresh orange juice, Florida, the orange state, mangos.  In some towns and cities in Florida mangos grow on trees, and we could just knock 'em down and eat them; saltwater.  Jacksonville is near the Atlantic Ocean and right up to the St. Johns River to get to the ocean; and beach water always reminds me of when I was growing up and going to meet, we'd go to the beach.
Speaker 1: You mentioned something about someone lived downstairs.  Did you, you lived in an apartment or a house?
Speaker 2: We lived in an apartment house--four railroad apartments, three rooms each on each floor.
Story_ID: 202858
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories about growing up that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Not at the moment.  Well, growing up I guess would include high school and a number of memories about high school.  We went to Stanton High School [Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] starting in 1951.  It was, it was around that time that the Legal Defense Fund [LDF] at the NAACP [National Advancement for the Association of Colored People] started its assault of, in earnest on the, on school segregation that culminated in 1954 with Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision.  I've lost my train of thought.  What did you ask me?
Speaker 1: We were asking you about if you had any other memories of growing up.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  So, it was of great interest to us when all of a sudden they built a swimming pool for black people near our house, our apartment in the projects, first black public swimming pool in Jacksonville [Florida].  And a mile away they built a new high school, which, which was called New Stanton High School, and from which I graduated, my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I.  This is kind of background for, for a story that actually I tell these days.  I am active or a presenter in a number of programs going on around the country commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Brown decision and a couple of weeks ago the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].  I just came back from Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan], may go to the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.].  It was interesting, on May 18, 1954, a day after the [U.S.] Supreme Court decision, the news was in the paper in--that morning.  I was rushing out to go to school, picked up the paper, and read a headline, 'U.S. Supreme Court Declares School Segregation Unconstitutional.'  We hadn't heard much about it.  The Florida Times-Union newspaper, which at one time I delivered on two paper routes, did have--we didn't know it was coming.  So I asked my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] what it meant, and it really stopped her.  And she finally said, "Son, it means you and your sister got a chance."
Speaker 1: That's wonderful, that's wonderful.  Did--
Speaker 2: She gave me a big hug and then went to work smiling.

Speaker 1: Did--when the school segregation was overturned, how did that affect your community?  I know you got a new school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida].  Was it, were there any problems?  Was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not immediately in Jacksonville [Florida] because nothing happened.  However, I guess a preview of what was coming I actually took part in, not really thinking about it as something that would be attached to a movement.  The summer out of high school, I didn't study hard in high school until my senior year, and so I didn't get an academic scholarship.  I didn't, since I worked full time in high school, I didn't play sports, probably could have gotten a baseball scholarship.  I wasn't big enough to play basketball.  When I went out for foot--I mean, wasn't big enough to play football.  When I went out for basketball, the coach took one look at me.  I was about 5'6" and a hundred and thirty pounds in the tenth grade, and he said, "Okay, [HistoryMaker Avon] Kirkland, you're gonna be on the midget team," (laughter), which he used to scrimmage against the varsity, junior varsity, whatever.  So, I was talking about what happened--
Speaker 1: Once--once segregation--
Speaker 2: After I graduated from high school, I was trying to save money to get a, to go somewhere to college.  I, I thought maybe since I was a strong swimmer, I could go to one of the two or three black colleges that had swim teams, Tennessee [Agricultural and Industrial] State [University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and I've forgotten what the other was.  I was a very good--I started to bring you some of the ribbons I, I won in Florida, and Georgia, and in South Carolina, too, when we, when we could travel.  I was working the summer after high school at the King Edward Cigar Factory in Jacksonville.  A woman my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] cleaned for got me the job there as a pot washer, and that was the best I could do at that time.  And I was saving my money, staying at home, putting my surplus cash, most of it, 80 percent of it in the shoe.  And in the middle of the summer--and, and I had a friend there with me, who, who'd graduated with me I'd gotten a job there, too, and the two of us working there.  In the middle of the summer the manager of the cafeteria, not--the cafeteria for the King Edward Cigar Factory hired a white cook to become a baker.  And the guy who was the baker, a black man who really cooked very well--we loved his stuff--trained him, and then they promptly fired the black baker.  And he was a popular guy, and we were really displeased.  So my friend and I organized the three or four other black people who worked in the cafeteria and went in to see the manager.  We weren't gonna work.  We thought he--that was wrong.  We were gonna go on strike, whatever that was (laughter).  Nobody black ever went on strike in Jacksonville, Florida.  We had no--we knew the word (laughter), we knew the phenomenon, but we had no idea how you do it right.  He wasn't there, so we waited around.  You know, it's like Richard Pryor in 'Stir Crazy;' we were trying to look like, I'm bad, yeah, I'm bad, you know.  It was a funny sight, I bet (laughter).  The manager never came so we left.  We had to do something.  We left.  We were walking down the street on the way to the bus stop, and he drives up, and he jumps.  He said, "Well, what the hell is going on here?"  He said, "Well, we object to your firing," whatever the cook's name was, "and we're going on strike unless you bring him back."  And pardon my language, but he said, "Well, you can take your black asses on home."  And we were (laughter) standing there looking at each other going, what do we do now?  And he drove off, and we went home.

Speaker 1: When you were growing up did you go to church, and how was the effect of church on your life?
Speaker 2: My sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I were obedient children.  And we went to Grant Memorial AME Church [later, Greater Grant Memorial AME Church, Jacksonville, Florida].  We got an award when we're something like ten years old for having been to Sunday school every day for five, every Sunday for five years.  I'm sure we must have must have missed something, but that's what it was for.  But by the time I was about thirteen I switched churches.  I started going to Dayspring Baptist Church [Jacksonville, Florida] because the girls over there were prettier.  I wasn't very religious.  My mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] wasn't traditionally religious, although she was a much more moral woman in the best sense of the word than any people we knew at the church.  I wasn't very--religion didn't, a formal religion never had that much of an impact on my behavior.
Story_ID: 202861
Speaker 1: I know you, we talked about what happened after the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision.  But when you were in elementary school, what, what elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Darnell-Cookman Elementary School [Darnell-Cookman School of the Medical Arts] in Jacksonville, Florida.
Speaker 1: What kind, what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Very good.
Speaker 1: Were you?
Speaker 2: Very good, yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what subject--
Speaker 2: We were skipped a, we were skipped a grade, my, my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I.
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were, what, what, what subjects did you like?
Speaker 2: Recess (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a good one.
Speaker 2: No, the, the schoolwork wasn't that hard.  I--liked to read.  I mean I've read, I, I, I've been a cure, I've had a significant curiosity for a good while.  And even when I wasn't interested in school, I would read the newspapers, and magazines, and, and sometimes more.  So, I--keep forgetting your initial question.
Speaker 1: About elementary school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we did well.  We, we did well, we did well through junior high school.  And it was when I hit puberty that I started sort of losing interest and had no real, had no real guidance.  My mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] used to apologize to us when we were out of high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] and, and adults that she was, she had to work so much that she doesn't think she would--she would love to have taught us that she thought would have been helpful.  That--was her responsibility and so on.  We said, "Oh, ma, come on, you did great.  Don't even worry about it.  Besides, we're perfect," (laughter).  She said, "Boy, get out of here."  School, you know, we did well in school.
Speaker 1: When--
Speaker 2: I just stopped, stopped studying at all when I got to high school.  I was real--I wasn't a troublemaker or anything like that, I just didn't study.
Story_ID: 202862
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that influenced you or that you recall?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, a lot of them.  You know, the people we came in contact with day to day who provided, you know, really sterling examples of integrity, of concern for the community, for personal achievement were the schoolteachers.  Blacks, at that time, in segregated Jacksonville, Florida, could work as schoolteachers in black schools.  They could work at the post office.  A handful were fortunate enough and who had the resources and the, you know, intelligence could become doctors.  There were a few doctors there and a dentist or two and a lawyer or two, but it was the teachers.  We had good teachers.  We had, I think our high school teachers were really quite good.  I didn't know it at the time.  So, but, you know, we didn't, I didn't know until we left the school [Stanton High School, Jacksonville, Florida] what, all the stuff we didn't have until we moved into New Stanton [Senior] High School [Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] then had a gym where more than a hundred people could sit.  I think we learned in spite of the fact that the schools in terms of the ranking nationwide were very, very, very low.  Schools were not supported in Jacksonville.  Even the white schools were not accredited, very conservative community, spent as little on the schools as possible.  Something, huh?
Speaker 1: That is something.  That's very unusual--
Story_ID: 202863
Speaker 1: What kind of activities did you take, did you participate in school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida]?  Were you in the band, in sports--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --in any organization?
Speaker 2: --I worked all the time.
Speaker 1: And what did you do?  What kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: I had a paper route at first.  I worked at a dry cleaners delivering stuff, helping clean the clothes, some dry cleaning fluid, learned how to press.  I had two paper routes at one time.  I worked at a friend's, friend of the family's service station.  I, after having a paper route for a year or two, I turned sixteen, and they made me an assistant branch manager which gave me a salary of sixteen or eighteen dollars a week, which was what my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] was making.  And I had to get up three or four o'clock in the morning, go open the morning paper, drop off point, and then distribute the papers to the core, the guys who deliver them, and collect the money at the end of the week, and turn it in and so forth and so on.  And it, I got sick from doing that, and my mother made me quit.  So, we, I worked all the time.  I regretted that I couldn't be, learn an instrument and be in the band, because I am very musical, love music, and I would have been a good musician.  I wanted to play--baseball (laughter), tried out for basketball before I started working full time, and that didn't work out 'cause I was too small.  So I was, I had a pretty unexceptional high school career, except that I worked a lot.
Story_ID: 202864
Speaker 1: Did you have friends?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you do together?
Speaker 2: I had friends who lived in the neighborhood and who went to high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] with us.  I had friends, I had a couple of friends that, who were are also working full time with me at the same place, the same restaurant that I worked at my last year in high school or so.  Friends at school--we have a picture of (laughter)--by the time I reached my senior year and I learned that Wesley Bynum [ph.] was gonna go to college, I said, whoa, really?  I'm smart as he is, I think maybe smart, and he's going to college?  I hadn't gotten there yet.  And Sylvester Houston [ph.] was going to college, and Rabbit Powell, whose real name was Robert, who looked like a rabbit, was going.  I started thinking about going to college, and then I started studying.  And I had, I, I graduated with a B average, but that was in spite of having in my, in eleventh grade, put myself in a, not on the academy course but in the indust- in, in the industrial curriculum, which meant that I, for all eleventh grade I learned automobile body and fender repair (laughter).
Speaker 1: You chose that or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I didn't wanna study, and I wanted to learn how to drive, and I wanted to know about cars.  And I was an adolescent, remember.  So, I had friends; I, I, I had, I had a lot of friends.  I was, I was well liked.  And we have a picture of my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] and I.  And, and I dressed well, too.  See, I was working all the time.  I could spend my money on what I wanted to, so I dressed well.  My--and it was important back then to dress well, especially if you were po'.  Nowadays, you know, the more money you get, the, the, the more casual you are in your appearance unless you're in a formal situation.  Anyway, we had a, there was a club in our, in our senior year of sort of some of the outstanding students in the class, at least, this was a self-organized thing.  And just to show you how vain we were, we, the name of the club was T and T Social Club Topnotch Ts [ph.] (laughter)--the picture out there.  It's interesting, one of the guys in that thing, Wesley Bynum, as a matter of fact, is now rich in Charlotte, North Carolina.  He's also a Republican, but he's a nice guy other, other than that (laughter).  I hope I'm not stepping on anybody's toes here.  But, anyway, yeah, I had friends. I regret it that I couldn't do some other things, but I wasn't unhappy.
Story_ID: 202865
Speaker 1: Were there any adults who influenced you, who encouraged you to go to college or to try and better yourself?
Speaker 2: I had a number of teachers tell me, you know, "[HistoryMaker Avon] Kirkland, you know, if you ever started studying, you'd do really well."  I remember my social science teacher meeting me once in the hall and saying, "Mr. Kirkland?"  "Yes?"  "I, I hear you're still matriculating here."  (Laughter) I had cut class a few times.  I was, I learned photography that year working with Mr. Bryan [ph.], who was in charge in, of that kind of stuff at the school, and he was a role model of ours.  He's a very, very nice man, well-dressed, good looking, very approachable.  We all loved Mr. Bryan.  He was--an elegant, good person and good to us.  His example, I, when I call back to Jacksonville [Florida] now--I think he's still alive--I ask how is Mr. Bryan, and they, they knew who I'm talking about, and they can usually tell me.  Mr. Bryan was, he was a good person.  That was what impressed me about him, but he was also a schoolteacher.  He had a master's degree and that kind of stuff.  And, and he urged us on.  He gave us stuff to do.  He taught us things, and he, he helped us learn skills that gave us confidence in our ability to, to do different things and to learn.  So he was good--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that regard.
Story_ID: 202866
Speaker 1: When you finished school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida], what were your goals?  What were your aspirations?  What did you wanna do?
Speaker 2: Well, by the time I finished high school and I picked up on the fact that I needed to get serious about what was gonna happen to me, 'cause I could see what was possible in high school--I mean in Jacksonville [Florida], and I'm beginning to get some sense of confidence in my ability to be competent at things. I mean I was seventeen then, so, you know, part of it was a matter of being developed mentally there.  My plan was to save money, as I said earlier, and go to college.  I was going with a good friend of mine who was also a competitive swimmer, only his girlfriend got pregnant that summer, and I turned out, yeah, I wound up being his best man.  He did work at the post office until he retired.  We were going to Tennessee [Agricultural and Industrial] State [University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], we thought, and we were gonna save our money.  And we were gonna get a partial scholarship, and we were gonna get through that way.  Well, that summer, that was the summer that I lost my job for walking out to protest the firing of a black baker.  And I was saved, and I had no idea what I was gonna do.  I was gonna get another job, and I was gonna save.  But my aunt and uncle from Atlanta [Georgia], Aunt Berlie [ph.], she was the one that my father [William Kirkland] moved to Jacksonville to be with.  She had moved to Atlanta by then.  She and her husband came to visit.  And she was a house cleaner, and he was a janitor.  But both of 'em were working, and the kids were grown.  And both their kids went to college in Atlanta, finished Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they hadn't seen us in a good while.  And they loved my father, and they said, "Well, [HistoryMaker] Avon [Kirkland], you gonna go to college?"  I said, "Well, I hope to, but not right now."  And I told 'em what I was planning on doing, and the said, "you know, if you wanna go to college, you can just come to Atlanta and stay with us, said you don't have to worry about food.  You got a place to stay, and your Uncle Robert [ph.], he has a, he has a janitorial service, which he does after he leaves his regular job."  He was a janitor at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia].  "And he, you know, he could use you."  She said, "If you get in school in Atlanta, if you can get in school up there, you can"--so I applied to Clark College right away, mainly under their influence, or their kids' influence because they had gone there.  It's ironic that in a month I'm gonna get an honorary degree from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and not the one I went to (laughter).  The, in Atlanta--so I went--I got accepted, and I went to Clark.  And I worked for Uncle Robert.  I stayed with Uncle Robert and Aunt Berlie and started studying.
Story_ID: 202867
Speaker 1: What was your major?  What did--
Speaker 2: When I first went there [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] I was, I had some vague major, sociology or, I had no idea.  Then I got there and I said I think I wanna be a doctor.  So my second year I changed my major to chemistry.  I made, I made the honor roll, had excellent grades, participated in drama.  I got a tuition scholarship contingent upon my continuing to participate in drama 'cause the drama department head wanted to be sure she had enough people, and I deserved an academic scholarship anyway.  Anyway, she, she got me a scholarship, and I started making very good grades.  I started studying.  I could do the work.  I was bright, they said.  I said, well, that's good (laughter).  And you know, things just started happening.  I was president of the sophomore class, elected president of the student body in my junior year, president of my fraternity, made the honor roll.  I was growing up, and my, at the end of my junior year I won a scholarship to travel in Europe for a summer, thanks to the head of the English department who thought that I would be a good representative.  As we--and I was making good marks in chemistry.  And as we approached, you know, graduation I started applying for--I, again, I still didn't have any money, so I was gonna get a master's degree in chemistry, teach a year or two.  There were a number of people who, who would teach for a year or two, save their money, and go to medical school after that in the sciences.  In fact, some of them would even go, if, if you had a science or biology major, they would even go to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and work on the staff for a year or two and then enter the school.  That was my idea, however, I wound up getting, well, I got assistantship office.  I had--I was accepted at several universities as an, a graduate assistant, which mean that I had to help teach lab and stuff like that.  But at that time, something directly related to the changing times and, and the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision has happened.  In 1959, I was one of four students, black students in the South to get a Woodrow Wilson [National Fellowship Foundation] graduate fellowship.  Those were highly regarded at the time.  I was a runner-up actually for a Marshall Scholarship which is kind of just next to the Rhodes Scholarship, in terms of studying abroad.  One of my classmates at Clark at the time, [HistoryMaker] Reatha Clark [King], also got one of those scholarships, one of those fellowships, Woodrow Wilson, and two other black students in the South.  So we were in the first class of Woodrow Wilson Fellows in, in the South.  And it paid my way to graduate school, room, board, everything.  I didn't have to be a graduate assistant.  They were hoping that--well, Woodrow Wilson had been--foundation had been doing that for a while, but they had never gotten anybody black.  I just saw something that corroborated something I suspected for a long time.  It was that the Ford Foundation got involved with it and poured--I just read last night in an article out there--poured twenty-four million dollars into the Woodrow Wilson Fellowship Foundation and told them, I'm sure--it didn't say this in the article, but I know this is what happened: I'm sure you can find some qualified black students in the South.  And they did.  Reatha Clark, now Reatha Clark King, the vice president of General Foods [sic. General Mills], you know, huge food corporation in Minneapolis [Minnesota].  And you know, the three of the five chemistry majors we had that year, Reatha was one; I've done what I've done; third person became a doctor and head of emergency services at the Howard University Medical School Hospital [sic. Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].  And the other people worked as chemists.
Story_ID: 202868
Speaker 1: Before we go on with that in Roosevelt [sic.] when you went to graduate school, can I just go back to a couple of things--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was wondering--coming from Jacksonville [Florida] and going to Atlanta [Georgia], the black communities were very different I would think.  Were they--
Speaker 2: Well, Atlanta was a cosmopolitan place--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --compared to Jacksonville.  One of the things that struck me when I first got there was that I'd never seen so many beautiful black women in one city in all my life (laughter), and Atlanta is still known for that.  It had at four or five colleges; I mean it had four, four colleges, Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], Gammon Theological Seminary [Atlanta, Georgia] and so on.  And it had, of course, a very large, probably the largest black middle class in the South, either by percentage or numbers.  So, a lot of people were, you know, up and coming.
Story_ID: 202869
Speaker 1: And you also said you got a scholarship to go to Europe.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that change your life?  How did it feel when you--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was--
Speaker 1: --got there?
Speaker 2: --it was amazing.
Speaker 1: Was it--
Speaker 2: It was amazing.
Speaker 1: Was it amazing?
Speaker 2: It was amazing.  I'd been out of the South once.  And in a way I didn't go very far, although it was in New York City [New York, New York].  I went from the segregated South to Harlem [New York, New York], is basically what I did.  I went up there to visit my Aunt Verlie [ph.], the ex-bootlegger (laughter).  Well, she didn't bootleg; she just sold it once it was made (laughter).  You know, we're not proud.  And when I took that trip to Europe I needed some clothes; I needed this, that, and the other.  Aunt Verlie sent me some money to get--she actually paid my train fare from Atlanta [Georgia] to Quebec [Canada], which is where we picked up our ship.  And so, your question was?
Speaker 1: Going to Europe, how--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --yeah, this experience--
Speaker 2: --we got to Europe--
Speaker 1: --of, of going there?
Speaker 2: --I'm--it was the Experiment in International Living [EIL].  It's still in operation, and their, their interest was to send, was to increase international understanding, was to promote good relations between the United States and other countries.  And they considered students as goodwill ambassadors who would learn if, you know, if the right students were picked and who would learn and make good impressions about--this is during the Cold War.  And I chose, I, I was encouraged to apply for a scholarship, and I did.  And I chose Italy because it had more places in it.  I, I could go to one country, see.  I said which country has the most in it that, that I want to see?  And it was Italy, so I chose it, and I got to go there.  The main thing about it--remind me to tell you a story about preparing to go to Italy and a true story and it's funny, ironic.  The main, the main thing is that getting out of the United States and into Europe--I experienced what black servicemen experienced during World War II [WWII], absence of racial discrimination, certainly legalized.  And people, when I arrived in Italy and stayed with a family, as we all did, the ten of us, I was the only black in my group.  Interestingly, the, the leader of our group came from Jacksonville, Florida, Burt Winterfield [ph.], Jewish guy.  And everybody in our group assumed we knew each other.  We didn't.  Burt Winterfield tried to call my house when he noticed that, somebody in Jacksonville to say hi, and he learned that we didn't have a phone (laughter); we also didn't have a TV (laughter).  It's funny.  People don't believe, "How can you not have a phone?"  We were poor.  We got there and the Italians were wonderful.  I stayed with a well-to-do Italian family who had a summer house on the Italian Riviera.  They lived in Genoa [Italy].  And it was--outstanding, the relief, I mean, you didn't have to be careful around white people, you know.  You, it was, it--all depended on what kind of person you were.  And it just struck me very dramatically how wrong racial discrimination was in the United States and how arbitrary it was.  It didn't have to be that way.  You see, if you grow up in it, that's just the way things are, it's a given.  So it's not a given, and in fact, it's evil, it's wrong.  So, it opened my mind in a way that no other single experience ever has.
Story_ID: 202870
Speaker 1: And you also said when you were at Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] you were in the theater group.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did--what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was a lot of fun.  It was an extracurricular activity.  I was in a play in, in high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] when we graduated, and I did a pretty good job, just something I could do, and be fun, and to meet people.  And, and I turned out to have some talent.  I have a good speaking voice, and I also, I also used to sing a little bit just to sing, not in the choir or anything.  I knew all the popular songs, all of 'em, hillbilly, pop, and, and there were no black stations or programs with black people, per se, in Jacksonville [Florida], so I had, I, but I knew those two from the Ms. B's [ph.] joint, and I still know 'em, all those songs back then.  So I had actually a little sense of performing.  I was in the talent show at, senior talent show when, when I graduated from high school and I friend and I, we did an imitation of Martin and Luther [ph.], Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.  I, I could do both roles, 'cause I sang better than he did.  So I sang like Dean: "If I could sing like Dean, how happy I would be, ba-ba-ba, boom, ba-ba-ba boo, ba-ba-ba boo."  He sang that song.  I don't know if you're old enough to, to remember it.  But I can also be Jerry Lewis (laughter), so we did that.  So yeah, I was a little, I had a little ham in me but nothing serious--you know, for, it was for fun.  So I got there, you know, I was in two or three plays, and I did well.  And I got a scholarship behind it.
Speaker 1: In theater?
Speaker 2: I got an, an academic scholarship.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the drama teacher told me I had to continue to be in plays.  So I was for a year, and then I just had the scholarship.
Story_ID: 202871
Speaker 1: You said you wanted me to remind you about, the story about preparing to go to Italy.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was funny.  I got the list.  And I'm in Atlanta [Georgia] with, at my aunt's house.  The end of the school year [at Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] I get the news, wow, wow!  I thought about all the stuff I need.  My mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] bought me some drip-dry underwear, and I borrowed a raincoat from a friend, and I--a camera from another friend.  And my aunt gave me the money to come to New York [New York].  And so I, and I'm looking at this list of people who were juniors at--I finished a junior year at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], Karin [ph.] went to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts].  I said damn, all these people gon' be smart; they're gonna know a lot of stuff, you know.  These are prestigious schools, most of 'em, and I'm gon' be ignorant.  I had about three or four weeks.  I--submitted myself to a crash course in Italian culture, art, history, and the language like you'd never seen.  I listened to about five or six operas; I mean, I did it.  And I still rent--and I learned some operatic arias phonetically.  And I, I'm not gonna do 'em now, but I can.  I know "Questa o quella" from 'Rigoletto' [Giuseppe Verdi] and a bunch of stuff.  Anyway, we got--our group stayed with families in, in Italy.  And, and then after a few weeks, we all took a member of our family with us on a tour of Italy.  This was one of the payoffs for the family, just normal everyday families, I mean normal.  They didn't work at this; they, they were our hosts, and they volunteered.  And I just happened to get one that was well off.  And we got to Italy and, I mean to, to Rome [Italy] in our cross-country trip.  And we went to a place called the Baths of Caracalla [Rome, Italy], at which an old Roman, at which operas are performed.  And the night we went they were performing 'Aida' [Giuseppe Verdi].  And wouldn't you know it, (laughter) I studied 'Aida.'  So about five minutes into the thing somebody asked: "What's going on?"  And I looked around and nobody was answering.  I said well, what's happening is the Radames, you know, is falling in love with Aida and so forth and so on.  Well, okay, it's about five minutes, ten minutes later somebody said "Okay, what's going on now?"  And still nobody else answered.  I said what's happening is blah, blah, blah, and in a little while an elephant is gonna come on stage.  And in a little while an elephant came on stage (laughter).  And I'm sitting there just feeling so good (laughter).  I said, this is so sweet.  They don't know.  Four or five nights later, the guy I was rooming with, John Mendel [ph.], very sweet Jewish guy from Birmingham, Alabama, and that's the way he talked, we had been out and had a good time.  And we're, we're in, sharing a hotel room in Florence [Italy].  And the lights were out, and we--(unclear)--sleep.  You know how you can become sort of--you can talk more intimately when the lights are out even with people you don't quite know.  He said, "[HistoryMaker] Avon [Kirkland]."  I said, "Yes?"  "You mind if I ask you a personal question?"  I said, "Well, it depends on what it is."  He said "Well, how in the hell do you know 'Aida?'"  I said, "I just picked it up."  And he didn't allow me to finish it.  I was gonna say: I just picked it up this summer by--what he heard was, "I just picked it up."  It was in the atmosphere, the environment around me, right?  And he was so impressed.

Speaker 1: Fast forward--let's see, that was '57 [1957]--fast forward forty years.  I'm now producing television programs.  I've had, you know, a number of public--I get a call.  "[HistoryMaker] Avon [Kirkland]?"  "Yeah."  "This is John Mendel [ph.]."  I said, "John Mendel, where are you?  Are you still in Alabama?"  He said, "I live in Marin County [California]."  He was on his way to Harvard Business School [Boston, Massachusetts], by the way.  He said, "I wanna get together with you.  I saw your credit on a show I'd--a week ago.  And I've been, I spent the whole time trying to find out how to get in contact with you.  And come to find out, you're right here in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California]."  He said, "I've been for twenty or thirty years."  "What are you doing?"  "I'm an investment banker."  He was filthy rich, lived in Belvedere [California], some of, one, some place over in--Marin County.  And he comes and he brings a videotape of the movies, of the eight millimeter movies he took while we were in Italy.  And we had a very nice lunch.  And he gave me the tape to copy, and I sent him the--original back.  But he also wanted me to join the Berkeley Repertory Theatre [Berkeley, California] board.  And I said, "Okay, John, that's a money board.  I don't have any money."  He said, "It's not just a money board.  You'll love it."  I said "Okay, I'll take your word for it."  Before I joined the board, he up and died, nice guy, 'cause I think we would have been very friendly.  At any rate, John Mendel was the guy who, he was so impressed (laughter) that I knew 'Aida,' [Giuseppe Verdi] and he never knew what I was really trying to tell him--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: That's the story.
Story_ID: 202873
Speaker 1: So you've graduated from Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  And you've got this wonderful scholarship, the Woodrow Wilson [National Fellowship Foundation] scholarship.  And you're ready to go off to graduate school in chemistry--
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --right?  And you decide to go to?
Speaker 2: Washington University [in St. Louis, Missouri].  I went to Washington University for graduate school to major in organic chemistry.  I did that because I thought that I could do as well as, in it as I thought I could in any of the other specialties at the time.  My, we had a very good professor at Clark who had just finished Washington U, and he kind of guided me in that direction.  One of our--[HistoryMaker] Reatha Clark [King], whom I mentioned earlier, was also in my class.  She went to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Turns out, University of Chicago was not as difficult as the-- Washington University, I would learn later, but that's another story.  St. Louis [Missouri] and Washington University were really important in my development because it's when my mind really, really opened to the wide, whole wide world of possibility.  There were students there from around the world.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  I'mma pause for a second.
Speaker 2: At Roosevelt [sic.], that's when your world expanded.  There were people from all over the world.
Speaker 1: And I--started giving myself a real liberal arts education.  I started reading very widely.  The person that I became was being formed significantly during that period.  First of all, I'd done well in college.  I'd done well to get to graduate school in the way, in the fashion that I did.  I still wanted to be a doctor, but I got to Washington University and they had these people that I'd read about in Time magazine come and talk to you at symposia.  I'm doing a project now by a guy who came to Washington University in the late 1950s, and I met him.  His name was C. Vann Woodward, and he wrote the best history of the South yet.  It is still a classic.  My mind was opened.  I read literature; I read history, certainly, racial history.  But I got interested in all kinds of other, other kinds of music.  I bought a guitar, and I started getting lessons from people I knew who played, to play folk music.  It was just to play and have fun and 'cause I, I love to sing.  The world opened up to me, and it ruined me (laughter).  I, my second year, as I was a, I could have gotten about--my, my plan was to stop and get a master's degree, and go teach somewhere, and work somewhere, and save my money and go to medical school.  But during my second year in graduate school, I decided I didn't want to become a doctor because all the doctors in my hometown [Jacksonville, Florida] were never at home.  They were workaholics.  And I was becoming interested in a whole bunch of other things, and I didn't want to be a workaholic.  Well, I should have gotten some counseling (laughter).
Story_ID: 202874
Speaker 1: And I became politically active [at Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  I joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I joined the Committee on Racial Equality [sic. Congress on Racial Equality (CORE)], CORE, as it was known then.  I don't like the CORE that exists today because it doesn't really do much, much that I'm in favor of.  After a while I was singing protest songs.  I have a picture, which I cannot find, of standing outside of the St. Louis [Missouri] jail with a group of people in our NAACP organization and I serenading people who were also part of our group who had gotten arrested while sitting in at a bank that would not hire black people.  And one of the people in that picture looking on is [HistoryMaker] Walter [E.] Massey (laughter).  So, yeah, I, I learned a lot.  I started reading literature.  I read Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man,' then.  I'd read [William] Shakespeare.  I was just, I just, I was just curious, very curious, and, and I wanted to know a lot, I mean.  And, and I wanted--and some things were really unfair in this world, and, and I (laughter), and I was gonna try to be a part of making some of it, you know, changed.  Anyway, so I was there for five or six years.  And it--
Speaker 2: Had a very profound effect on you.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 202875
Speaker 1: After you graduated from Washington (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Washington University [in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --right. What did you do then?
Speaker 2: I got a job as a research chemist at Sinclair Oil Research Labs [sic. Sinclair Research Laboratories, Inc.] in Harvey, Illinois, which is just outside of Chicago [Illinois].  And Sinclair was later bought out by ARCO [Atlantic Richfield Company].  But I worked there for three, about three years.  I was a decent chemist, but I was really bored.  I thought it was graduate school that I was bored with.  When I got out of graduate school and paid off my debts, I found that it was chemistry I was bored with.  And it was very difficult, but I said I'm just gonna quit the field.  And I wrote and told my mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] that, and she called me on the telephone: "Boy, are you all right?"  I said, "I'm fine.  I said I just don't like this field.  I wanna do something else."  By that time I was not yet thirty.  I said, "Mama, if I can do a Ph.D. in chemistry, I can do well in something that I'm really interested in".  She said, "All right, but you call me if you need to," (laughter).  She didn't understand it, and, and, and it's easy to understand why.  She was very proud.  We have a picture up there, out there of her at my graduation with my Aunt Berlie [ph.].  And so--
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: --I went to work there and worked for three years and paid off my debts to the National Science [Foundation], to the national whatever, loan--I've forgotten what they were called then--and took a year off, mostly.  I worked for a foundation during that year running some establishments, some study center in, in, in the projects in Chicago.  But basically I was trying to redirect my career, and I didn't, had no idea where I was gonna redirect it.  So I did not wanna stay in Chicago.  I, I think I convinced myself to go to New York [New York] and take guitar lessons.  Still thirty, footloose, and fancy free, had no, not married, had no kids, and I went to New York, took guitar lessons, worked part time for a publishing firm training teachers to use their reading materials, which I had used in the study centers the year before.  I'm pretty thorough.  I was a very good --tutor to kids in, in the inner city that year I worked.  I even roped in [HistoryMaker] Walter [E.] Massey, who was then in Chicago, to come and take the kids out to Argonne National Laboratories [Argonne National Laboratory, Lemont, Illinois] where he was a post-graduate student.  I left Chicago though and went to New York and found out that I should have started working on guitar when I was ten because my left hand was, it seemed like it was palsied.  It, I needed--muscle training that would have taken--it wasn't gonna work.  It was taking too much time.
Story_ID: 202876
Speaker 1: By this time I'm thinking, well, maybe I'll settle down, you know, and I'm not gonna--I've just got out of graduate school [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  I'm not gonna be, I'm not gonna be poor another three or four years or whatever.  And this [publishing] company I was working for offered me a full-time job as a regional operations manager in charge of everybody who did what I did in the Northeast--overachieving, I did too good a job.  And I took it.  Behavioral Research Labs [Behavioral Research Laboratories (BRL)] is the name of the publisher.  And I don't know if you ever used any BRL stuff.  They also owned the copyright to a program learning materials that Neil Sullivan had done--not Neil--the same author of our materials had done for McGraw-Hill [Education].  And he had broken away from McGraw-Hill, formed BRL based out here in Palo Alto [California], had a lot of business in the urban school districts back East, biggest region was the Northeast.  I got a job taking care of the projects in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  And I did well there, and then they gave me a job taking, taking care of all the projects in the Northeast.  And I did well there, and then they made me a vice president in two years.  And they expanded quickly and to all kinds of things, like language schools and preschools.  And they got in some deep trouble and started doing some funny things, and I left the company.
Story_ID: 202877
Speaker 1: And what did you do after you left the [publishing] company [Behavioral Research Laboratories (BRL), Palo Alto, California]?
Speaker 2: I took another year off (laughter).  I took a year off, and I was living in Belmont, California.  The job--
Speaker 1: How'd you get to Belmont?
Speaker 2: Oh, we moved, during the time I worked for BRL we moved out here.  The head of the company and I engineered our division moving out here to join the rest of the company, because I wanted to live out here, and he did too.  I moved out here in 1972 and loved it.  I'd wanted to move here since I got out of graduate school [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri].  I, I visited here during the time I was in graduate school, and I just wanted to live in the [San Francisco] Bay Area [California].  I knew that.  Everything suited me, politics, climate, lifestyle.  And so I left--well, I moved out here, worked for BRL.  The company went a little crazy.  I left them, took a year off, watched television, worked on my tennis game, socialized, and decided one night watching 'Sanford and Son,' I could do that; I could make that kind of show.  So I got a book on script writing and read it, and I wrote a script for 'Sanford and Son.'  And through a friend in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I got the producer to read it, which is very hard to do because most of that stuff is written by writers on staff.  And they sent me a nice note saying, "It's a good idea.  We've done something very close to it.  But if you come up with some other stuff you'd like for us to read, we'd be happy to."  It took me a year to get to that point, and I, and--the year I took off, and it was the end of that year, and I needed a job.  So I looked around locally to work in television.  Make a long story short, I got a job at the PBS station here, KQED, which needed a director of instructional services, which programmed, who programmed programs for the schools during the day.  And I had been an educational publisher, publishing, had been an executive; I was a good salesman.  I got the job.  And by the time I got the job I wanted to produce.  And I thought that if I could produce programs, I'd probably keep doing that 'cause that, you know, there are so many subjects, and there are so many kinds of programs you can make.  And it--I wanted to do something, I wanted to create something, some things.  That's, that's what, that was always pushing, and it finally came out.  I mean it was there in the music; it was there in my extracurricular activities in high school [New Stanton Senior High School; Stanton College Preparatory School, Jacksonville, Florida] and college [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  I'm creative.  So, whoa, what I gonna do now (laughter)?  I gotta make a living at this.  I was at KQED [San Francisco, California] for two years before I came up with my first idea for a production.  And I let 'em know I wanted to produce.  And it turned out to be a huge idea, and they let me try it, that is by giving me a little bit of money to develop the idea.  And lo and behold, it worked.  We were all surprised.  I got a $2.4 million grant from (laughter) the [U.S.] Department of Education to develop a series that became 'Up and Coming.'
Story_ID: 202878
Speaker 1: So could you tell us something about 'Up and Coming?'
Speaker 2: This was, this is in the late 1970s, when our presence on television was beginning to be felt, but they were sitcoms.  Bill Cosby had been a detective on 'I Spy.'  [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll had had a, a sort of sitcom that--
Speaker 1: 'Julia.'
Speaker 2: --'Julia,' that ran for a little while.  But basically we were all becoming very conscious of the fact that everyday black people that we knew--there's no--we, we couldn't be found on television.  We were maids, crooks, no 'Brady Bunch' (laughter).  Anyway, my idea was to develop dramas about a middle class black family living in San Francisco [California] trying to get from here to there in their lives.  It's about surviving; it's about their kids growing up; and it was a kids' angle that the department of-- [U.S.] Department of Education found relevant to something they wanted to do, which was promote interracial understanding.  And our argument was: white people don't know black people like this.  And we're gonna focus on a--on our teenagers and basically affective growth.  And they said, "Good idea," and they gave us the money.
Story_ID: 202879
Speaker 1: I was lucky enough to find a really good writer to work with us on the series ['Up and Coming'].  His name is Ilunga Adell.  Ilunga had just left Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] where he'd burned out writing for 'Good Times,' and 'Sanford and Son,' and a couple of other shows.  And he was up here, he and his wife, living in Oakland [California] and was available.  And with his help, we developed a series that really was pretty good.  It was a huge and sometimes painful learning experience for me.  I was not gonna be a producer.  I was gonna be the project director, the creative and protosorial writing, directing, that was gonna be done by people we hired.  After--as it went down, I became the executive producer and, and, and supervised script writing.  So I had editorial control of the thing.  I had a knack for it, plus I knew children.  I mean I'd, I'd worked with children, and I knew, I mean, most people at that time had never heard of, unless they taught school, had never, never heard of the affective domain (laughter), and, and I did, and I had, and I knew what it meant.  It meant values clarification; it meant self--self-awareness; it meant learning living skills that are not intellectually based.  And I had some very good advisers that I gathered around me, considered actually Julia's [HistoryMaker Julia Reed Hare] husband here in San Francisco [California] that you talked to this afternoon.
Speaker 2: Oh, [HistoryMaker] Nathan Hare?
Speaker 1: Nathan Hare.  And lo and behold, the program was a success, took three years to do, two years, two years to do.  I worked with some noteworthy people.  [HistoryMaker] Danny Glover got his, shot his first TV appearance for our series, so did Peter Coyote.  Have pictures, we have pictures from that production.  Sidney--I'm sorry, Cindy Herron, who was eighteen at the time, but she grew up to become lead singer in En Vogue.  Wolfe Perry, he's second team all-American basketball player at Stanford [University, Stanford, California], played teenage son in the show.  Brock Peters appeared in it, Esther Rolle, others.  And it worked, and it was, when it, when it was reviewed in the New York Times, the reviewer said that in time the show could be significant.  Well, one reviewer noted about three years later that it was remarkable that no show like 'Up and Coming' had been on the air in a positive but not unrealistic characterizations of the black characters and the black family, and, and that a year or two afterwards the 'Bill Cosby Show' [sic. 'The Cosby Show'] came on (laughter).  I'm still learning a whole bunch of things, and how to worry about money is not one of them--
Story_ID: 202880
Speaker 1: --Except as I approach retirement.  It's too late to worry now (laughter).  That worked.  I learned while I was there--see, I'm taking you at a greater clip now.  I learned while I was there that I could raise my own money for a production.  I had several ideas for a production at KQED [San Francisco, California] that I didn't think would be appropriate for that station because they weren't really set up to do drama.  And I was all, I was doing all dramas then, so I decided to leave KQED, continue producing.  And a month, two months after I left KQED and formed New Images Productions [Berkeley, California] and whose offices we sit right now, twenty-two years ago I got my first grant for a production--a children's drama, which became 'Booker' about Booker T. Washington as a young boy.  I had been, I--was visiting my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] once and sleeping in her daughter's bed who was away in college, and there was a book about Booker T. Washington on the bookshelf next to the bed.  And I picked it up and started reading it, and I couldn't put it down.  I never knew that much about Booker T. Washington.  And his life was fascinating, important, and interesting, and also here and there a bit troubling.  And I determined that I would do something on Booker T. Washington, 'cause nobody, nobody else knew that, stuff that was in that book unless they studied it in college.  And it was just out, and she hap--my niece happened to take the course from the guy who wrote it.  Louis [R.] Harlan, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, agreed to work on the project; he had written the book; and we made 'Booker.'  And of all the films we've made, I think 'Booker' is the most successful because we finished it in--we went on the air in 1985, and it's still on the air.  It was on the, it was on PBS for three years, and then the Disney Channel, and then all over the world, all, the BBC.  South Africa bought it not too long ago.  That's how I could tell they were really gettin' on their feet in terms of how the media operated.  It's, it's a show that stood up well over time.  It's a very good story about a ten-year-old boy who wants to learn to read, and he happens to be a slave.  But then the [Civil] War ends, and there, there are opportunities, but they are still very difficult.  And it's what actually happened to him.  And it's a terrific children's show, and it's used in schools throughout the United States.
Story_ID: 202881
Speaker 1: And the next one you did was 'Simple Justice.'
Speaker 2: After finishing 'Booker,' I tried to do a miniseries based on Booker T. Washington's adult life, a miniseries.  My idea was, okay, I'll make me a career doing stuff mainly that I wanna do.  But I'm gonna pick these subjects that really have great dramatic potential, that, but nobody's looked, looked for it or had enough interest in it and working hard enough on it to make it happen.  So, we tried to do a miniseries on Booker T. Washington and turned out to be really difficult; turns out that a number of production companies in Los Angeles [California] had tried to do a 'Booker' project.  And it got to various stages of development and decided it wouldn't work on commercial television.  I didn't think it was gonna work either, so we eventually had to abandon it.  But during the same time I was working, I discovered a book about the Brown [v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision, 'Simple Justice,' written by Richard Kluger, 1970--published in 1975 or '6 [1976], fascinating, another great story, a twenty-year struggle, very astutely planned and strategized twenty years before it happened by Charles [Hamilton] Houston, who taught Thurgood Marshall, who took over the struggle.  And it took us eight years, eight years from idea to completion.  One of the problems was that we were four years into it and close to production when ABC announced that it was going to begin production in a few weeks of something called 'Separate but Equal,' a four-part miniseries on the Brown decision, starring Sidney Poitier, whoa, and Burt Lancaster, whoa.  We were hoping to raise three thou--three million dollars for a four-part series, and it would have been enough for us.  And that almost blew us out of the water.  But after I recovered from the shock, and I was depressed for a week, a good week or so, I called some friends back east that I thought might have been asked to work on the brush, the production, because they were doing it back east.  And one of them had been asked; in fact, the first person I called had been asked, and he had the script.
Story_ID: 202882
Speaker 1: So I read the script and found out that they'd [producers for 'Separate but Equal'] gotten a lot of the material from the book, 'Simple Justice' [Richard Kluger], which I had optioned.  But nothing ever came of that because you cannot copyright history, and they were smart enough not to use the same words as in the history books that they couldn't get from someplace else.  At any rate, the big problem was that they had changed the story here and there to make it more melodramatic.  And in my opinion and in the opinion of the--Richard Kluger, who wrote the book, they had pulled their punches on racial matters, that is they made it, they made the arguments before the [U.S.] Supreme Court [in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] seem like a kind of moot court intramural thing, when it was actually both in front of the Supreme Court and behind the Supreme Court a lot uglier, and mean-spirited, and racist.  And we told it the way it happened.  Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself.  I was able to recover our project from near disaster by knowing what was in the script, saying to our funders it--what we're doing now is all the more important.  We have a show that's dramatic, that works, engages the audience, and it tells the truth.  And they said, "That's a--that's a good reason to do it." See, the, the rule in, in, in Los Angeles [California] is: don't get it to me good; get it to me Tuesday.  And we were trying to get it good, so it--and plus we were in public television.  It takes longer to raise the money, and you gotta do it step by step, and there's a few months between every step.  And we produced the show, nevertheless.  And Dick Kluger, Richard Kluger, the author of the book, wrote a letter saying, "Stick to your guns.  You got it right."  And we're, we are really good friends now.  We did Richard--we did 'Simple Justice,' and it premiered on PBS on Martin Luther--on the evening of Martin Luther King [Jr.] Day, 1993.  We learned later that six million people watch, watched it, which is a lot for PBS, and even more than that two million of them were black, which is a lot of viewers, which is three times the average black viewership of a PBS show.  So the show worked very well.  It might have been, might have become our best show in terms of staying on the air, in terms of sales in Europe, as 'Booker' sold in Europe and so on, except for 'Separate but Equal.'  Not long after our show was broadcast here, I went to England for, for a public television international conference but also to see what was on the air over there.  I was checking out the market for 'Simple Justice' in England, Europe, and Germany, and because you need those places to have a viable financial foreign market.  And the week I arrived in England it was announced in the BBC booklet that I picked up, that they would be broadcasting 'Separate but Equal' in about a month (laughter) they're with the foreign market, so.  But it's being used widely in schools, from Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts] to third grade class here in suburban San Francisco [California] in the City of Lafayette [California].
Story_ID: 202883
Speaker 1: Could you tell me, how did your mother [Lula Mae Durham Kirkland] feel about your filmmaking?  Did she live to see any of your films?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother after a while began to trust my instincts about what I should be doing, because I always landed on my feet and at least as solidly as I had before.  In fact, I actually kept improving my position, from a research scientist to a vice president of a company to an executive production in a television station and now head of his own little company [New Images Production, Berkeley, California], but he makes--(unclear)--anyway, she lived long enough to see the pilot for 'Up and Coming,' the pilot episode.  And she lived in Washington [D.C.] with my sister [Yvonne K. Moody] at the time.  And my sister is a big promoter of my work, and she has a, she has a whole mailing list back in Washington.  People admire her and respect her.  So, and one organization she belonged to they decided to spend one of their meet, meetings looking at the pilot of this television show that was going to come on the air and be national.  And she took my mother along, and everybody loved the pilot.  They said, "This is new; it's about time," blah, blah, blah.  And my sister said, "Boy, you should have seen Mama Lula."  That's what we called her, Mama Lula, Lula Mae Kirkland.  She said, "She was so proud and people coming up saying: 'you must be proud of your son.'  And she was trying to play it down, but you should have seen her," yeah.  And then we talked a few times after that, and then she died of emphysema.
Story_ID: 202884
Speaker 1: So you've done three major projects, and your next one was closer to home, San Francisco [California], is that right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, the Omega Boys Club [San Francisco, California], a mutual friend of, of ours called me to ask me to speak to [HistoryMaker] Joe Marshall about an offer he'd gotten from Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] to, for a movie of the week about his experiences trying to turn teenage youth, mostly black, mostly males in trouble with the law around, get 'em studying out of high school into college.  And at that time, Omega had been working seven or eight years and had established a really good reputation.  And the main reason for it were the two people who founded it, one of whom, Joe Marshall now runs it, and the other was Jack Jacqua.  And I said yes, I would talk to Joe Marshall, and I did.  And I got some material about them.  I kind of heard about them, so, see a little two or three-minute thing on TV, you know, the good news story of the day.  You take it with a grain of salt 'cause most problems are not so easily solved, has to be done by one person in one organization.  And certainly, if it did work, it's gonna take more than two minutes to saw how.  But the material included a long article on the Omega Boys Club and Joe Marshall, done by the Los Angeles Times of all places rather than locally here in San Francisco where the club operates.  And I said wow, if this is true, then this may be a good thing to put on the air because at that time it was three strikes you're out fever.  There was a big, big, big I mean crime, especially urban crime, and especially by black people, was one of the greatest fears during that time, gang slangs, this, that, and the other.  That's when we started putting a whole lot of people in job--in jail fast.  And there's more to it than that.  And I decided to go to a meeting, and I took a long a friend of mine, a documentary filmmaker that I'd worked with who'd worked on, on our film, 'Booker' as a director of photography or videography in, as in Scott's [Scott Stearns] case.  And it was amazing.  These big, bad, bold teenage dudes who, the mean-mug you on the street in a minute were kids.  They cry; they shed their strut and bravado; and they said that they wanted to change, and they hoped they could.  And I asked my friend, whose name is John Elks [ph.], a really well-known filmmaker.  He won a MacArthur Genius Fellowship at one point, teaches now at UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and still continues to make award-winning shows.  I said, "I think there's a story here."  He said, "You're damn well tootin' there is."  And I said, "Will you direct it?"  He said, "No, I'll shoot it.  I'll shoot some of it."  He said, "But I think you should direct it."  I said, "I've never done a doc [documentary] before."  He said, "But you know how to tell a story, and what you're gonna do is an observational doc.  You're gonna follow these boys."  The idea was to follow the club, several kids in it, over a period of maybe a year.
Story_ID: 202885
Speaker 1: There had been a movie like that ['Street Soldiers'], sort of like that, about basketball called 'Hoop Dreams.'  And the form was sort of on people's minds.  He [John Elks (ph.)] said, "You know how to find a story.  You're, you're gonna wind up finding what the story is and editing anyway after you've shot for, for a year.  And I think you can do it."  (Laughter) I started trying to do it, and I, I was not, not looking forward to editing.  We shot two hundred hours over thirteen, fourteen months, but we discovered some really amazing things going on with some kids.  We, we discovered some horrific things going on in kids' families.  We discovered how many drug and alcohol addicted people are out there that we don't see whose kids are programmed to go the same route because many of the kids in the Omega Boys Club [San Francisco, California] had come out of homes like that.  And we asked [HistoryMaker] Joe Marshall if we could shoot the Club's meetings and related activities.  And he said, "Why do you wanna do that?"  I said, "We wanna find out what it is you do that works."  And he said, "Yes, why don't we do it, 'cause I'd like to know too," (laughter).  What we found out is something he already knew, and that, that is they, they're not a program; they don't run a program, as he says it; they run a family.  They give, they're, you know, they say showing up is 90 percent of doing the job.  They're always there.  These kids are not accustomed to regular support and protection from parents.  They have to fend for themselves on very mean streets.  And these, and people in this organization, they're there.  They go to court with them; they, they go and they visit them in the jail if they're in jail; they pick them up in jail, that is they get to meet them in jail.  So, this is an extraordinary, extraordinary program.  And Joe Marshall got a MacArthur Genius Award, which I--was very happy to help make possible, because I brought him to the attention of a well-known novelist friend of mine who was "a secret" MacArthur nominator.  And Joe got one, fifty--sixty thousand dollars a year for five years just to keep doing what he was doing.
Story_ID: 202886
Speaker 1: Anyway, we made the show ['Street Soldiers'].  It was a national PBS show.  It--my congressman,  "Ron" [HistoryMaker Ronald] Dellums, his assistant became aware of it, asked to see it, looked at it, and before we knew it, Ron Dellums' office in Washington [D.C.] was arranging for the [Congressional] Black Caucus to have a screening on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  Ron Dellums' son had been troubled like that, and it had a special place in his heart.  Plus, you know, it was, we have too many black youth going that way and more and more.  And it just, we have a million black men these days either in prison, on parole or someway their lives are managed by the penal system.  So we had, you know, we had, we had an opportunity to, to show it there.  And [HistoryMaker] Joe Marshall came along, and it was wonderful because Nancy Pelosi, who was Joe Marshall's congressman at the time, she's now, of course, the minority--
Speaker 2: Whip.
Speaker 1: --whip, is it, in the [U.S.] House of Representatives?  She--they all got together and had this thing, and it was really wonderful.  We had good, good turnout that early evening, despite the fact that Teddy Kennedy [Senator Edward M. "Ted" Kennedy] was having some--[Vice President Albert Arnold] "Al" Gore was having something important at the same time.  At any rate, the show went, did well, and people use, are using it in correctional institutions and recreation centers and, and stuff like that.  And the first doc [documentary], and we did find stories there, and we were also able--we being those of us who worked on the production--were able to help some kids get into school.  One or two or three kids I helped get accepted into some schools back east, including Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and we keep in touch.  So, I learned something about making documentaries and we think also did a little bit of good.
Story_ID: 202887
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that when you were in college [graduate school, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] you read a book ['Invisible Man'] by Ralph Ellison.  And how did that affect your professional career?
Speaker 2: I started work on 'Street Soldiers' in 1994, the same year I read an obituary of Ralph Ellison.  And I said whatever happened to him?  I don't think I've read a book by him other than 'Invisible Man,' and it was such an outstanding book, a National Book Award winner.  Whatever happened to him?  And I started looking into it.  And what I discovered was a very interesting and controversial life after the book was published but also a very unusual kind of background.  Invisible--Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man' is one of the most important books ever written about America.  It is considered--a poll was taken during 1999 of some distinguished scholars and writers to name the most important books published in English during the 20th century.  And Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man' was among the top twenty, up there with Ernest Hemingway, all the really fine masters.  Who wrote 'The Grapes of Wrath?'
Speaker 1: [John] Steinbeck.
Speaker 2: Steinbeck, James Steinbeck [sic.].  But a number--these days a lot of people haven't heard of Ralph Ellison, certainly the younger generation.  It's--taught in high schools and colleges and, but I remember I learned that even people who'd read had forgotten it and him.  And his life story was really, I thought, inspiring, came out of nowhere, deep poverty, and wrote one of the best novels in American history, not just because it's a powerful story and it's about black/white relations, but also because technically it is outstanding.  The man was a master of the Engwish [ph.] language (laughter), as we used to call it on the streets of Jacksonville, Florida.  It's a masterpiece.  And you know, our job, I think we feel is to help tell the story of America, especially those stories that don't get told by the mainstream media.  These stories are important.
Story_ID: 202888
Speaker 1: 'Booker,' about Booker T. Washington, brought Booker T. Washington's story to a large number of people.  So we started working on a doc [documentary] about Ralph Ellison's life.  My first doc worked.  Ah, this ought to be a breeze.  It took us three years, and which is a relatively short time for a ninety-minute program.  But during that time, we were able to, for the first time, get the Ellison estate to say that we could adapt some scenes from 'Invisible Man.' It had never been made into a movie because he never trusted anybody to do that.  And it was my job to convince the estate that we would not be going against that feeling of his.  And it took two years of very delicate negotiations.  I finally got them to agree to it by reminding them that in nine, the late 1980s, before he died, I called his agent to ask if the book were available for optioning for an adaptation into a movie, and I was told, yes, it was available.  But the, his agent at the William Morris agency [William Morris Endeavor] also told me that Ellison required script approval, which is a no-no in this business, unless you're dealing with a novelist that you know very well and, and who understands that a movie is a very different thing than a book.  There's no way you can get every interior monologue that occurs in this five hundred-page book into a movie.  And Ellison was a stickler for (laughter), for that book being taken word for word.
Story_ID: 202889
Speaker 1: We got to do those scenes.  We attracted such, you know, fine intellectuals as Cornel West to talk about it because they all loved the book ['Invisible Man,' Ralph Ellison]; they all thought the man [Ralph Ellison] important; they all thought that he deserved a great deal more presence in the public mind than he had, and so, we, we finished that production ['Ralph Ellison: An American Journey'].  And my second production as a, a documentary, a filmmaker, and lo and behold, we got accepted into the Sundance Film Festival.  The, the festival director said that Ellison is very important, and this is an outstanding--production.  The New York Times gave us a rave review.  It was broadcast on PBS in the national series, 'American Masters.'  And it's just, we've just completed a DVD with an hour of additional material, which is very interesting stuff in which we get into Ellison's ideas and the kinds of things that caused his life to be controversial.  Back in the '60s [1960s] when many of us were saying, "We are Africans really," he was saying, "no, you're Americans."  They didn't understand that Ellison was saying a lot more than that, not that he was trying to deny our African heritage.  He was saying, you're American because your values, your--the context of your life, the history that you remember all took place here.  But don't, don't believe for a moment that being American is something, your being a black American is something to be ashamed of because you contributed so much to this country that made it a vital, dynamic, rich culture.  In fact, a great deal that is distinctive about American culture, Ellison was saying, you created.  And when I talk about, when I talk about this before groups, I bring--try to bring the point home by saying that but for the presence of African Americans in America, America would be much like, say, Canada.  Now don't get me wrong, some of my best friends are Canadians (laughter).  No, but it would be very Anglo.  And it's a kind of point that Ellison made fifty years ago that people are just becoming able to appreciate now.

Speaker 1: Like in parts of jazz.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Like jazz, the--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --the contribution--
Speaker 2: --yes.
Speaker 1: --of jazz.
Speaker 2: Ken Burns' 'Jazz' series featured six or seven key quotes by [Ralph] Ellison.  So, we were trying to basically say something about the contribution of black people to the American experiment.  And at the very end of the show we presented as that.  He had trouble finishing his second novel, his work in progress ['Juneteenth,' published as 'Three Days Before the Shooting...,' Ralph Ellison].  And we asserted that one of the reasons is that he was trying to cover so much of America, which itself is still a work in progress.  So, we get interested in these ideas and these personalities--who personified them, and we keep going.  Right now I'm working on Booker T. Washington, the adult.  And his career was important, and fascinating, and very controversial.  And we're gonna try to analyze and clear up some of the controversy and derive some meaning from it because people still fuss heatedly about Booker T. Washington.  Some say he's an Uncle Tom; others say he was a Trojan horse trying to--you know, he accepted segregation and didn't fight very hard for the right of blacks to vote.  Well, what can you do if you're told you're not fit to be a first-class citizen?  I, I believe that a person who does not have pride in themselves, who--does not respect themselves don't get respect.  And he was accused of being apologetic for black people.  [W.E.B.] Du Bois on the other hand was a, was just the opposite.  The truth about Washington is more complicated, and we think we're onto it (laughter).
Story_ID: 202891
Speaker 1: You have people whose views on Booker T. Washing--on many things are so different it's like night and day.  Like Rosa Parks, civil rights activist, adores Booker T. Washington, so does [Justice] Clarence Thomas, who keeps a picture of Booker T. Washington sitting at his desk in front of him in his office at the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  On the other hand, you have someone as great and as noble in my mind as W.E.B. Du Bois saying, Washington was an extraordinary man, but he did some damage to our chances.  Ultimately, I wasn't quite sure where I stood until I read what, what [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] said about Booker T. Washington.  He said two things: he shined a light in Alabama, and darkness disappeared, his educational contribution.  But as a politician, as a black leader who became a politician in the sense of being a political leader and having political philosophies about how we should try to advance, King said, I don't believe Booker T. Washington was an Uncle Tom, but by depending, by urging pressure-less persuasion on whites in the South, it only encouraged the South to, to dive deeper into its racist policies and thereby encouraged it.  So, he was wrong in that regard, and I think that's pretty much what we're gonna be saying.
Story_ID: 202892
Speaker 1: Could you explain the process that's involved [in documentary filmmaking], 'cause I'm sure there are some students who might be thinking about going into this field.  Just what--from the beginning, when you get the idea for a project, to the end, could you just kind of quickly go through the steps that you--that are involved in it?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my favorite sayings is: the distance between an idea and the fact is very long, (laughter).  The idea is the purest, the first idea, a concept for a show is when you first have it, so pure, so wonderful that you can hardly sit, sit down.  Thinking about a show, about Ralph Ellison, in which you would compare the life of his protagonist in 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] to his own life, which was very similar, and then show where they're joined.  Conceptually that's a beautiful, elegant structure, and that's how I first thought about it.  However, it took me two years to raise the money there.  That was a short amount of time.  It costs around $900,000 to produce a ninety-minute doc [documentary], because we spent $300,000 dramatizing scenes, and that's ver--a lot more expensive.  Anyway, I spent a lot of time raising money, a lot of time writing proposals, a lot of time worrying: can I raise the money for this project ['Ralph Ellison: An American Journey']?  I'm an independent.  If I worked for a commercial station, I would be doing the news.  I wouldn't be doing these kinds of hopefully ambitious documentaries that are useful in the educational context.  You have the idea.  You try to describe it.  You go do some research on it.  I went and read a lot about Ralph Ellison.  I bought two or three good books.  By the time I finished reading them I knew pretty much what his life had been like.  And then you try, you kind of outline what the story is.  And here a great deal of skill is required because there's a lot of details in life.  But what is, what is this, what is the story structure?  Where is it going, and what does it mean?  You know, drawing that meaning out of the facts of a person's life is, takes some skill and I'm, that's what John Elks [ph.] meant when he said, I know how to tell a story.  So, I'm learning more and more how to do that.  And once you get the story essentially told, either in a summary or, or a treatment, then you start trying to raise production money.  One of the hardest things to do is to get to that stage because it takes time; it takes research; it takes writing, and the people you hire to do research for you are working for you.  If you're writing it, it takes time.  You better have some money to pay yourself.  I'm an independent.  If I were working for a, a big production company, say like 20th Century Fox or, or Paramount [Pictures], I would, I would get money right up front, if they like the idea, to develop it.  So I have do, I have to raise development money.  And then once I've done that and done the developing work, I have to go raise production money.  So, I'm always fundraising.
Speaker 1: Sounds like--
Speaker 2: I spend 80 percent of my time, if I'm lucky, only 80 percent, doing that.
Story_ID: 202893
Speaker 1: All right, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Avon] Kirkland, we've been talking about your professional life.  I'd like for you to tell us a little bit about your personal life.  You have a son [Avery Julian Kirkland].
Speaker 2: I have a son, Avery, who is sixteen years old now.  For I was single for a long while.  I got married for the first time in my late forties.  It wasn't the first time I'd had a committed, monogamous relationship.  But I was busy changing, changing careers, trying to get established, and also being a little picky, and sometimes, I must say, not being picked when I wanted to be, you know, the usual stuff.  But I met and fell in love with Evelyn [A.] Lewis, and we got married and had a son, Avery.  Evelyn is a remarkable woman.  She teaches law, teaches in the law school, Martin Luther King Law School at the University California, Davis [sic. UC Davis School of Law, Davis, California], and she's a graduate of University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill, North Carolina], one of the first graduates.  And she graduated with honors and then graduated from Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  We were married eight years before we divorced.  Avery was, I guess, six when we divorced.  And I share custody of him during that time with her.  And he's just a joy.  He's--I, I can only be so angry with her because she gave birth to a son, our son.  And I'll tell you, people used to tell me that, "Well, you know, children add another dimension to your life," you know.  They didn't tell me that that meant, that, what that dimension was.  In fact, sometimes they meant just the opposite of what I decided it was.  But it is, it was just such a wonderful thing to become a father, and because children make you get outside of yourself.  And I mean there were few things I would, I would have said before he was born, few or maybe not any that I would give my life for, but I--there's no question about that.  You know, I--being a father and having a wonderful son--he's not perfect (laughter); he's far, he's far from it.  As a matter of fact, I'm waiting for him to grow up.  He's too much like I was when I was a teenager.  I told him I was like that and that I'm paying for it.  So, I think--anyway, I've--it's taken me a long while to actually appreciate intimacy in relationships in a real way.  One of the bad things about growing up in Jacksonville [Florida] is, and in my particular circumstance, is that you learn about relationships on the street, for the most part.  And if you don't have a good one at home to, in some way, insinuate itself into your own assumptions about how to deal with the rest of the world, then you have to learn it by trial and error.  And I think I am genetically a late bloomer (laughter).
Story_ID: 202894
Speaker 1: My tennis game is getting better now than it ever has been (laughter).  I got married a little later.  My son [Avery Julian Kirkland] helped to teach me about intimacy in a way that doesn't involve sex, just as I learned, I've learned it in my other more recent relationships with women, and it's a beautiful thing.  And frankly, too many of our men cannot imagine the real fullness and richness of intimacy in a relationship where you're not trying to manipulate somebody to, to act a certain way, or be a certain way, or seem a certain way but where you are dealing with someone in a trustful way, you really trust them and so forth.  I've--had to learn that one step at a time, and there are probably many former friends out there who would tell you I'm a really slow learner (laughter).  But I'm very happy.  One of the most important things I've ever learned is what a good relationship consists of, and my, in my present relationship, it's there.  And one of the things that helped me really appreciate other people was the birth of a child.
Story_ID: 202895
Speaker 1: Is there anything, any lesson that you've learned about life that you would like to pass, to teach him [Kirkland's son, Avery Julian Kirkland]?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one.
Speaker 1: One.
Speaker 2: The other one I've been trying to teach him, but he won't read the book (laughter).  I never appreciated, and I think this is true of many people who grow up poor, where your daily focus is to survive, to have something to eat, have a roof over your head so that when it rains you don't get wet, build assets, build assets, build assets.  Being a bachelor for a while, I was able to buy a house relatively early.  And it is the major asset in my portfolio right now by far.  And it's--it's not a large portfolio, but it could have been much larger if I have, if I had understood that in the long term, you gotta, you need to build assets to wind up in a place where you can either sit back and relax and enjoy the labors of your life without having to work anymore, or you can do a whole lot more things with a great deal more freedom and richness.  If when I bought a classic Jaguar convertible back in 1976 I had put that $5,000 into a house, it would be worth $500,000 now if I had rented it out.  And when I bought that second classic Jag for $4,000, a hard top version of the convertible and it turned out to be a clunker, I could have put that $5,000 into a house or some, some investment.  Right now I'm concerned that I won't be a burden on my son when I get too old to take care of myself and that I won't have to live alone in deep poverty as an old man.  So I've learned first of all, the concept of assets is something that is there and gonna stay there.  It ain't what you work for every week.  It's what you grow over your, over a period, longer period of time.  So, I don't think enough of us are there yet.  And some of the smartest people I know aren't very smart, but they knew that, and now they're okay.
Story_ID: 202896
Speaker 1: Is there anything in your life that you still wanna do?  What do you still wanna do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  What would I still like to do that I haven't done?  I'd like to travel a great deal more.  I'd like to go back to school.  I'd like to study philosophy and literature.  I also like to become really a master at what he [videographer, Scott Stearns] does because that is a powerful instrument.  And I know how it works.  I know how to get footage that we can edit together, but to be an artist at it is something, if--I could write a bit better, knew more about how to, ways of looking at the world, which I would bust any philosophy in reading certain kinds of literature, and operate a camera, I'd be making three or four more movies per unit of time than I do now because I'd just go ahead and do it.
Speaker 1: What about your tennis game?
Speaker 2: Tennis game.  Yes, I would like time to work on my tennis game because I'm still, at age sixty-seven I'm still quick, still fast, and I'm still strong.  I used to play people who are fifteen years younger than I do, than I am.  But it's a very frustrating game, like golf--I don't play golf, but I know it's frustrating--and it's a very difficult game to play well.  And there are some guys who take too much pleasure in beating me.  And I would love to get to the point where I could look at them and say, "Now I'm bad, I'm bad. Yeah, I'm bad (laughter)."

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How's mu--what, does music still play an important part in your life?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been trying to do something on music forever.  I wanted to do a blues history series and got scooped--
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: --by billionaire Charles [sic.], rather, what's his name?  Co-founder of Microsoft--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --and Martin Scorsese--Paul Allen.  He's worth $23 billion.  He gave several million to Martin Scorsese, and they did a series.  They scooped mine, because I raised $90,000 to start working on one, jet, and that's researching and, and treatment writing.  And that, I got knocked out of that, and then I went to rhythm and blues.  I wanted to tell that story, and nobody would fund it.  Paul Allen just got out of funding music series (laughter), just as I came along.  Martin Scorsese I guess taught him a lesson or two.  I wanted, I wanna do a doc [documentary] on Sammy Davis, Jr. just because he's interesting, and I think much like Booker T. Washington and [Justice] Clarence Thomas, hated, didn't like himself.  And, but I really wanna do a doc on Richard Pryor.  You didn't ask me that, but Pryor.  I've been trying to get to his estate for a year, and it's very difficult.  He is alive, but he cannot talk.  And he married his second or third wife.  And she has power of attorney, and she's not cooperating.  Anyway, that's something I'd like to do.

Speaker 2: Yeah, Renee Thompson (laughter), no (laughter).  Oh, I don't know.  You know, I'm too old now.  I didn't, I never, I didn't, I have regrets, but basically, you know, I've, I've lived a decent life, and I've had the good time, and I plan to live awhile longer and still have a good time.  I don't have any regrets about any, any basic decisions I've made.  I've been burned by a number of 'em, but I did the best I could and when I could, so I stopped beating up on myself for that kind of stuff.

Speaker 1: Do you have any suggestions or advice for young people who might be thinking about becoming a filmmaker?
Speaker 2: Someone who wants to become a filmmaker?  Yes, learn to read and write very well, learn to think critically, and if you can, learn--excuse me--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  I'll pause.
Speaker 2: If you can and you plan to operate as an independent as I do, learn one, one of the line skills.  Director of photography, they're always working if they want to.  They may not make as much as they want to, but they, often they do if they're good.  Editors, editors, first-rate editors make a lot of money.  When I have a project, the editor makes more money per unit time working on it than I do as the producer/director/writer, because it takes me a long time.  The project might last for four years.  He comes in for six months and work, makes two thousand dollars a week here, and he goes to the next project.  I might have a down period before I raise money for the next one.  Anyway, develop a line skill.  Writing is one, photography is another, editing is another, but basically become a very intelligent, well-versed person who thinks very critically.
Speaker 1: Good suggestions--
Story_ID: 202900
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes or concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I think we've been making progress steadily since slavery.  And we've gotten to a point where I think we've reached another wall, and it's economic.  We can go most places we want to.  A lot of people don't dislike us because we're black.  In fact, I think a lot of white people admire us because we're black.  There is a large number of people--I mentioned earlier that there are about a thousand people--there's a thousand black men whose lives are controlled by the criminal justice system.  Remember when the slaves were freed at the end of the Civil War there were about three million black people.   Probably at most there were about 800,000 black million freed as slaves.  Here, 139 years later, we've got more men in prison, more black men in prison than were freed from slavery.  It is a terrible problem, and I think it is--there's a racial angle on it.  I think we gotta do more ourselves 'cause nobody's gonna save us.  And a lot of what we have in our show is I think examples of people who were self-empowering in addition to having gotten support from outside sources.  I mentioned my relatives, friends.  I could mention more.  I mean, right now I deal with a large group of scholars, and there are three or four of them who are so smart, and so good, and so good hearted that I couldn't do without them.  They are a source of, of moral support, and most of them are white--hope is that we continue to make progress and that we get to a position or a situation in this country when we are not so much each individual hustlers--

Speaker 1: I think there's less racism now than before by far, although I think the mood of the country is that it's every man or woman for himself, and there is not enough of a sense of community.  I think that's, that tone is set by our current national administration [President George Walker Bush], and I think it's really regrettable.  Until we have better leadership in that regard in setting the tone for building a real sense of community and caring for other people and at least, you know, sort of reaching out to folks--you can't do everything for everybody.  I had the feeling when George Bush the first [President George Herbert Walker Bush] was running for president that somebody would do him a big favor if instead of--who'd he trod out?  "Willie" Horton?  Who did that?
Speaker 2: Willie Horton.
Speaker 1: He was very sort of quiet about--I think that most, most people recognize that--I mean, if I were present I would say listen, every pers- every child in this land, we will meet you halfway if you've had a hard time.  You're gonna have to work, and you're gonna have to do your share, but we will meet you halfway, whatever that means.  If it means college stuff, if it means--we have never been embraced racially.  We've been taught we're more and more tolerated.  I took my son, Avery [Julian Kirkland], when he was about four or five years old to Nordstrom in San Francisco [California].  There's a huge atrium around which the escalator goes.  And this is during Christmastime, and there were entertainments downstairs on the ground floor.  And this particular time there was an Irish, a group of Irish dancers, actually San Francisco kids who belonged to the Royal Hibernian Society [sic. Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH)], which is an Irish organization, Irish pride, Irish help, a self-help group.  And the group of boys dancing, they were doing these heel and toe and the Irish jigs and things.  And it was, they were really good, and Avery was fascinated by it.  And then came out a, a group of girls, slightly older, maybe twelve, thirteen, fourteen, older than the boys.  They were nine and ten.  And I noticed that there were two black girls in the group, actually mixed black and white.  You don't belong to that group unless you have Irish blood.  So, I think probably an Irish man or woman had married an African American, and their two daughters were in this group.  Now you know the Irish weren't all that great to us for about a century.  And I thought that this Royal Hibernian Society chapter, what they'd done with these black girls was rather than resent them "having Irish blood" was to welcome them into things Irish, that in fact they had embraced them.  And it occurred to me that America has never embraced black people, tolerated, whatever, never embraced, and I think that's an important distinction.  Until we get to the point where, where we can do that, you know, I think we're still gonna have trouble.  And I'd love for that to happen during my son's lifetime, but I don't think so.  So I keep trying to get him ready, and he doesn't need it.  He's cool, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he'll live forever.  He's indestructible.  He's a teenager.  But, that embrace, should it ever happen, I think America would have done something that nobody else has done.

Speaker 1: You--I expect you to be here for thirty, forty more years, at least. At least. But when the time comes, how do you wanna be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: He was a good guy and tried to do good things, took care of his responsibilities, and I'm glad I knew him.

And here I'm playing Finian, or rather Og, the leprechaun in 'Finian's Rainbow.'

Huey Newton was at that thing, and the Chinese ambassador was just in town for the first time, and he would not go near Huey.  He didn't wanna be controversial.
