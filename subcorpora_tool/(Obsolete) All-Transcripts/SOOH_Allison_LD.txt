 Finchum  Allison  Today is May 4, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University, and I   m here today in Claremore with L. D. Allison  who retired from Cooperative Extension back in 1994, having started  back in 1958. This is a part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Project with  an emphasis on Cooperative Extension workers. Thank you for having  me today. Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your youth,  where you were born, brothers, sisters, and then we   ll work our way  forward.  Thank you very much. I was born in Ryan, Oklahoma, (that   s in  Jefferson County) and we had a farm that was about a mile and a half  from the Red River. I was just almost a Texan, but kind of proud I   m  not. (Laughter) I think one of the most important things that happened in  my life, in the early part of my life, the first ten years, there was a  farmers    home program started around 1938 in Oklahoma. The first  loans made in Jefferson County was in 1939 and    40. There was 175  people applied for that loan. My folks was one of four that was selected  to receive the loan, so that really helped me make a move in my life,  them getting that loan. That loan was paid off in eight years. In 1948 we  had finished paying off the loan.  They had to go through strenuous exams. They had health exams. The  committee come to the farm and looked at the farm. It was really  something, I think, to be picked out of 175, only four being picked. I  have the checks that they wrote for the farm, and they bought the farm  for thirty dollars an acre in 1939. That was  4,918. They were required  to build a new house. We lived in an old house and had an old barn on  the farm. The house cost  1,344 to have it built. The barn cost  578 to  have it built, and a lot of the lumber in that barn come out of the old  house. That really got us set up with a nice-looking place. The folks  wasn   t really interested in building a new house or building a new barn  because that added to the loan that they would have to pay off. However,  5  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  it was very important that they did because that really give us a nice  place to live, and that house is still there today. We farmed cotton when  I was young, and later on we farmed wheat and started running some  more cattle.  How large was the acreage?  A hundred and sixty-five acres at that time. My father bought another  sixty acres to go with that.  And did he work off the farm?  The only thing he did off the farm at that time was he drove a school  bus. He drove our school bus, probably, around thirty years or so. It  wasn   t the school   s bus. We had the truck, and the school had the body,  and we would put the body on the truck in the fall and spring and take it  off in the summertime, and we   d haul grain with that truck. So it was our  truck.  Did your mother work?  No, just there on the farm. My mother was in 4-H and went to 4-H  Roundup as a girl, probably 1928, sometime in that timeframe. I have  one brother, and he was in 4-H, and I was in 4-H. I can remember in  1945 going with my father to ask people to take electricity because there  was an electric line coming down through the community, but it would  only go whenever there were enough people signed up that they would  want to extend the line your direction.  We did, and I was ten years old. Most everybody was saying,    We don   t  need it, and we   re doing just fine like we are, but we   ll take it if it will  help the community out or if it   ll help you all out.    So we got enough  people to sign and got the line extended our way. They all would say,    If  we take it, we   re only going to use the lights.    Well, that was probably  what they had in mind, but it wasn   t long until they were using other  things and using more electricity. (Laughter)  I will just mention that my uncle wired most of the houses in our area,  and my brother went to work for Cotton Electric. That   s the electric  company that come through our area, and he retired from there. He  would soon become the manager of his department, then after he retired,  they asked him to come back and be the manager of Cotton Electric. He  has worked a lot with OSU, teaching codes in Oklahoma City. He knows  his electricity real well. He didn   t go to college, but he knew how to pick  that up.  6  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  And made a fine living doing so.  Yes. Yes, he sure did.  Well, let   s go back to the farmhouse. I   m taking when it was first built, it  wasn   t electric. Did it have running water?  No. No, it wasn   t. No, we didn   t have running water, either.  How was it heated?  Kerosene stove that we had.  Did you have a few chores?  Oh, lots of chores. (Laughs) We had things to do, no matter what the  weather was. If it had rained that morning and we couldn   t get in the  field, we hoed in the garden, or we hoed under the fruit trees. We had a  pretty good size garden. We had fruit trees. We canned a lot, and we  preserved a lot of the fruit. We dried fruit. Of course, like everyone else  back in the    40s we would kill hogs, and I enjoyed doing that. We made  lye soap. That   s the way everyone lived. Of course, we   d buy about 175  straight run chickens. When I told someone that the other day, they  wanted to know what a straight run chicken was.  I am not sure either. (Laughs)  That would just be as they   re hatched. You get about half roosters and  about half hens. We would eat on the roosters and use the hens for  laying. We would keep about 250 laying hens and would sell eggs, and  we   d sell some cream. The folks were kind of disappointed if they spent  more than five dollars on groceries when they would go to town because  all they   d buy, really, is sugar and maybe some flour because we would  be trading them some cream and some eggs, and we would pick  up laying mash. Of course, that   s where we got a lot of our clothes is  making the sacks into clothes.  Your mother sewed?  Sewed a lot, yes.  For boys.  Yes, just my brother and I.  Would she let you pick which fabric sack you wanted?  7  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Yes, we would do that. In fact, that   s one of the things we would do  when we were in town. We   d start picking out some colors of shirts  we   d like to have.  Pants, too?  No, we bought the pants. I wore overalls quite a bit when I was young. I  wore more high-top shoes than anything else. (Laughter)  When you mention town, what was the name of the town?  It was Ryan. It was a small town. There was two or three years we didn   t  have a car. After the war was over, we bought a 1949 Plymouth, and we  went to Wichita Falls quite a bit, Wichita Falls, Texas, to do some  shopping.  Where did you go to high school? Ryan?  No, there was a small country school called Irving Consolidated School,  and there was three small schools consolidated to make Irving. We  graduated   we, as my wife and I. She was in the same class that I was  in, and we graduated in 1953. That school closed in 1955. It was a small  school. I roomed with a boy in college. He was from Tulsa, and I told  him one day that I had gone with all the girls in my grade. He said that  was impossible. He said there was no way that you could do that. Well, I  married a third of them because I married one of the girls. There was  three girls in my class, so it wasn   t that impossible. (Laughter)  During high school you were involved in 4-H?  Yes, I was in 4-H. I had a pig to show at the fair, went to Roundup two  or three years. One of the years I went to Roundup, they asked me after I  got up there if I would drive a tractor in a contest. I did, and I won first  in that contest, tractor driving. I think I was pretty lucky. (Laughter)  I   m assuming you had a tractor on the farm to practice with.  I did quite a bit of tractor driving, yes.  Did they have mules before that?  We had some horses. Just for a year or so, I can remember working with  horses, harrowing some ground, but then in 1941, we bought a Ford  Ferguson tractor. Man, that was something deluxe because it would have  a power lift on the back of it. That was the Ferguson part of it, and the  8  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Ford was the tractor. It was a tractor that helped us a lot around the farm.  New or used?  It was brand new, yes. He got it for about, like, fourteen hundred dollars.  That same tractor would sell for more than that today. It was such a  handy tractor, and so many people like those types of tractors today  because they   re pretty handy.  The original house, tell me a little bit about it. What were the rooms,  bedrooms, living room, just the layout of the house?  The one that we built?  Yes.  Well, it was two-bedroom, a kitchen. I have the plans for it, and I have  the plans that we used for the barn. Probably, maybe, twelve hundred  square foot. We sold the farm that we grew up on about six years ago.  The people who bought it have added a room to it. They   ve replaced the  windows. They have added central heat and central air, and it   s really a  beautiful place now.  It was hard to sell, I bet.  It was. It was. When I was a little boy, around 1944, we was walking  across a neighbor   s place, and we went up to see a man who had it  rented. I thought then,    I   d like to have that place.    Well, it turns out that  some people bought that place in 1945, and I married one of their girls.  She was in my class at school, and we have that place now.  Still have a connection.  Yes.  How big is it?  It   s 180 acres.  Do you lease it?  Yes, it   s leased out to the people who have bought our place. They  would be interested to buy our place if we ever wanted to sell it, if we  ever decide to sell it.  What do they raise?  9  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Cattle, yes.  So you did some cotton?  We did early, yes. We did quite a bit of cotton. The fact is, my brother  and I would work our crops with my father, and they would work their  crops, my wife   s family. Then we would join together, and we would be  a crew in the community. A lot of people wanted to hire that crew which  included three or four of Peggy   s brothers and sisters, and then my two  would make about six of us. We would help a lot of people out with  their cotton crop.  Save money for college, then?  No, at that time, that was in the early part of the    40s, early to middle  part of the    40s. When we   d get through in the fall, folks would say,     Now, you all need some clothes for school, and you have earned some  money. You can take that money and go buy some clothes for school.     That   s the way that worked.  You could be in charge of what you bought, then. Money management  early.  I told my folks I was wanting to go to college, and they didn   t disagree  or agree. They just didn   t say much about it. I had a neighbor that was  bringing his son to OSU in 1953. I told him I   d like to ride with them.  He had an old pick-up. He come by about five o   clock in the morning. I  had one suitcase, and I had my stuff in it. I think it had one pair of blue  jeans and a pair of khakis and about twenty shirts. At that time, I had  gotten a lot of shirts for graduation from school, and they were nylon  shirts. They were nice little shirts, but they have one problem: They   re  hot, and when they get wet they just stick to your body. Anyway, that   s  the way I went to college.  There was no four-lane highways, and it took us until about noon to get  to OSU from where we were. When we got there he said,    If you boys  will get out and get your suitcases, I am going to head home.    He was  ready to get back. He said it would be dark when he got home, so we got  out, and he was ready to go home. I stayed there in Cordell Hall. That   s  where the boy I rode with was staying. He had a job in Cordell Hall  because we went up about a week early before school started, and I got  enrolled at that time. I later got a job working where he did. It was in the  maintenance department at Cordell Hall. It was real handy because we  could work there, like go out and pick up trash in a wing of Cordell Hall  one morning. He would give us an hour, and we would burn it in an  10  Finchum  Allison  incinerator in the basement of Cordell Hall. Then we   d go to class and  maybe have a break and come back, and he   d tell us to go to certain  rooms and put in lights, or he   d have some chores he wanted us to do.  We wound up working pretty much a forty-hour week by getting in  hours after five o   clock and before eight o   clock and during the day. We  would work on Saturdays. That was a good pay. That was fifty-five  cents an hour.  The main way that I made my way through college, there was a group  from OSU who would go to Belvidere, Illinois, and work for Green  Giant. I went there for three years. At one time, from our small county  there were twenty-two people going up there to work in the  summertime. Enjoyed that. We gathered sweet corn the first year or two  by hand. Then we would harvest peas, de-tassel corn. I   m not kidding,  I   ve got some timesheets for 120 to122 hours a week. That   s working  about eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. We had the opportunity  to work, the pay was pretty decent, and it was a chance to work my way  through college.  Where would you stay?  They had places there. It was a camp, and they had places for us to stay  there. The crew that we used was made up of people from Jamaica,  Trinidad, and St. Lucia who were here on work visas from their  countries. They could work very hard, or they could kind of take it easy.  If they were pulled into a field they would say,    Boss man,    (I was the  only fellow there with them)    can we make bonus today?    If I thought  the field was big enough we wouldn   t finish during the day, if the corn  was pretty good, I   d say,    I think you can make bonus.    They would  work and change off, switch off, help each other, and do all they could  to get more tonnage that day.  If it was a small field, we   d have to move. They   d be losing time. If the  corn wasn   t too good and if I said,    I think it would be hard to make  bonus,    we didn   t cover much ground that day. That was kind of a rest  day. I had a lot of fun with those fellows. They would sing calypso  music at night going in on the last load. That was really nice. They were  really friendly people to talk to. My first day that I met my crew, I mean,  within four or five minutes of whenever I introduced myself to those  eight fellows, one of them said,    You can   t make me do anything.     Well, I didn   t know what was going to happen. About four or five  seconds later a big fellow says,    Tell me what you want him to do,    so  that solved that problem for the rest of the time. A year or two later I  was still there, and we would gather sweet corn with a machine, and I  run a corn picker that would gather sweet corn.  11  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Mostly it was all guys, all males?  Yes, yes it was. There was a little difference, maybe, between us and  them. Those fellows would say,    Are you married?    I would say,    No.     They would say,    How many children do you have?    I says,    I don   t  have any.    They   d say,    I   m not married, but I have three children.     They had a little bit different way of life, which is fine.  How would you get from Oklahoma to there?  There were quite a few cars going up that way, so I always had a ride to  go up there and back. My brother went one year. From our community  and from our school that I was telling you about, there was probably  twelve or so from our school that went up there.  Any of them stay, decide to stay?  No, one of the guys married a girl from there. Those were enjoyable  times. I enjoyed working there.  During that time were you considering what your career was going to  be?  Yes. I had kindly thought about that even before I went to college. I was  at Waurika (that   s the county seat of our county) one Saturday night, and  the county agent was there. There was five or six guys around him and  talking to him about,    What are we going to do about this?    or,    What  are we going to do about that?    I thought then,    That would be a good  job to have,    so I decided early that that   s what I wanted to wind up  doing.  How did you go about finding out what you would have to do to be able  to do that?  Well, I knew you had to go to college, so I went to college and got  enrolled. There were some good advisors that helped me make selections  of courses and things.  So you graduated in    57?  Yes.  Then what?  Well, it was about a year later that I got a job with Extension.  12  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Do you remember the hiring process?  Oh, a little bit, not a lot about it, but at that time they had a thing  called   it   s a training where you go to a county for three months before  they would place you. That   s why I got to go to Ardmore. At Ardmore,  the county agent was Hugh D. E. Woody, but he was the county agent  all the time I was in 4-H in Jefferson County. He was my county agent  whenever I was in 4-H.  Of course, the ladies that worked in Extension were not permitted to be  married at that time. Whenever I was a little boy and the county agent  and the home economist would come to our school, I thought that was  nice that those two people who were married had a job where they could  travel together. Then I found out that they wasn   t married, that she never  was married. My mother took a trip with her back into Arkansas to see  her folks one time when she was a little girl. That same lady was my  home economist whenever I went through 4-H.  What was her name? Do you recall?  Oh, man  (Laughter)  I   ll have to go back and do some research to see.  Yes. Okay.  It   ll come to you.  Yes. Dora Bollinger.  Okay.  Her name was Dora Bollinger.  Where was your first office?  Well, in Ardmore I think it was in the courthouse. Then after the three  months, I moved to McClain County. I was there for a while, and then I  was activated into the Air Force. I was an Air Force reserve. They were  activated during the Berlin Crisis, the Berlin Airlift. I was in the military  there for a little over a year. When I was released from there, we went to  Pawnee County and worked in Pawnee County. Got a chance to go from  there to Frederick, Oklahoma, and become a 4-H agent there. Tell you a  story about working in Pawnee County.  Okay.  13  Allison  Finchum  Allison  The pecan specialist came by one day, Eddie Whitehead, and said,    I  want someone to go with me.    The county agent wasn   t in, so I quickly  agreed and wanted to go. We started down the road, and I said,    Now,  what are we going to do?    He said,    We   re going to find a pecan tree.    I  said,    Okay. How are we going to find it?    He said,    Well, I have asked  hundreds of questions, and I think we can find it.    So we drove into a  little town called Maramec. It wasn   t a town really. It was a crossroads  and about four houses. We took a right turn, went one block, and he  said,    I think that   s a tree.     We got out, and we are looking at the tree, and an elderly lady came to  the door and said,    Can I help you?    He said,    Well, we   re just here  admiring your tree, and if you don   t mind, I   d like to take a few  clippings off these branches. It would allow us from OSU to study this  tree more.    She says,    That would be fine.    He said,    If we were going  to name this tree, what would you want to name it?    She says,    I haven   t  even thought about it.    He said,    What about calling it Maramec?    She  says,    I think that   d be fine.    That become the Maramec pecan. It   s a  pretty popular pecan. It   s a large nut. It was a native. That   s a native nut  that was just an exceptionally good pecan. We leave there, and I said,     Now, Eddie, what   s happened?    He said,    Well, there is a person who  has entered the state seedling pecan show for the last three years and has  won, but has never said what the tree was.    And he said,    We found the  tree.     Well, that   s kind of a Paul Harvey story. That   s the first part of the story.  I do crop appraisals now, and I   ve done a lot of pecan appraisals. I was  in Bixby about ten years ago and was looking at some pecans, and this  guy says,    I have got some pecans coming in production.    I said,    What  are they?    He said,    Newlys.    I said,    I know a lot of pecans, but I don   t  know a Newly pecan.    He said,    You might know it by another name.    I  said,    What is that?    He said,    Maramec.    I said,    Really? What do you  know about Newlys?    He said,    Dr. Newly lived in Bixby. He had a real  interest in pecans. He was a doctor, and he had a telephone company.  One of his workers found a good pecan tree in Maramec.    Well, you  know that he could have gone over there. He could have, and I guess  maybe he did, take a clipping off the branches and started his own  grafting and come up with the Newly Pecans, but he couldn   t show  anyone where the native tree was because it really wasn   t on his  property. So, anyway, I   ve enjoyed knowing the story about how we  found the Maramec pecan.  Do you know if it   s still there, the tree?  Well, I   m sure it is. Yes, yes.  14  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  I drove through there a couple of years ago. I will have to go back.  Oh, you went through there?  Yes.  My   Yes, we were doing a centennial farm in the area.  For who?  For one of the oral history projects that we are doing, so we had a  reason to go that way.  Okay. Mighty fine.  So you got to learn about nuts.  Yes. Yes. (Laughter)  From what I understand, they would not place you back in the county  where you grew up initially?  That was true for a long time, yes.  You were in various parts of the state, from the south to north and then  back south again.  Went to Frederick, and then from Fredrick went to Bartlesville     Back north.     and worked with Walter Beckham.  Doing similar things in all those places, or how did they differ?  They were quite a bit different. Frederick was more farming country,  and we showed more livestock there. We would bring a semi of steers  and heifers to the Tulsa Fair. At that time, you   d spend ten days at the  Tulsa Fair to complete the showing. They required you stay that long.  That   s all changed now.  Where would you stay?  15  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  They had a place for us to stay. There was a place that we could stay  there. It   s gone now, but it was pretty close to where the livestock cattle  was housed.  Kind of like a bunkhouse?  Yes.  When you say farming, what kind of farming in Frederick?  Alfalfa, a lot of cotton, and a lot of wheat was probably their main crops  that they were working with.  And your reason for moving on up to Bartlesville after that?  Well, Mr. Beckham asked me several times to come up there, and I was  at Oklahoma State for a county agents meeting. He had a lot of classes.  He was getting instructors from OSU to come to Phillips and teach  classes. There was a plane flying over and back that afternoon after we  got out of our conference. We flew over there and flew around it and let  the guy off, and then we flew back. Then I think the plane flew back and  got him. Anyway, I was impressed enough that I decided I wanted to go  there.  Compare it with Frederick. What was it primarily? Was it farm and  cattle?  In Frederick?  No, in Bartlesville.  In Bartlesville?  Yes.  It was just a lot different program. There was not near the farming there  that there was down in Frederick, in Tillman County. It was a lot of  cattle. There was two 4-H agents, then the home economist. There was a  larger staff there. I just learned a lot of different things about Extension  there than I had in other places.  Teach some classes?  I taught classes for 4-H, yes. Let me mention that Mr. Beckham had  some pretty strong ideas, and that was fine, but he told the ladies they  couldn   t wear slacks. That stood up, I guess, all the time he was there,  16  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  but that was back in the mid-   60s. Now slacks are almost all that ladies  wear. I keep asking my wife when she   s going to buy another dress.  (Laughter)  In the    60s, too, was integration. Did you have issues with that in that  county?  No. There was very few there. In Tillman County, there was a large  population of black people left over from when they farmed more cotton  and when they had to harvest their cotton by hand. I went in 4-H to three  black schools, and that didn   t bother me. I enjoyed doing that, so that  was no problem for me.  Also in the    60s was when Governor  Henry  Bellmon was elected. That  doesn   t have much to do with this, but that was something else in the     60s, when the state switched from Democrat to Republican. He was  elected in the    60s. I think    62. Does that sound about right?  Yes, then he become a senator.  Yes, after that.  Took a trip with some kids to Washington, DC, and I had my picture  taken with him in our group in Washington, DC.  He understood agriculture.  Well, I am sure he did. He was an active farmer.  At each one of these places, were you a 4-H agent or were you the Ag  agent?  4-H most of the time, until I came here in Rogers County.  So after Bartlesville, then you came to Claremore?  Yes.  So you spent the bulk of your career in this area here?  Yes, from    71 until    94.  And you were County Director at some point?  No, when I came here.  17  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Oh, the whole time.  Yes.  Your role would have changed at that point, some of your daily activities  from a director to     Yes, but that is what I was kind of looking forward to anyway. Had one  little problem. We came here in September, and the budgets had been  made. I thought,    Well, that   s nice,    but in about three or four months  the district director come by and said,    Now, to keep your staff, you   ll  need to get a supplement to your budget. You don   t have enough money  in your budget to keep your staff.    So I went to the County  Commissioners and asked for a supplement. Finally got it, but I had to  work a supplement for about two more years before we could get all the  money at one time. When I come here, this county had 38,000 people in  it, and now it   s running around 85,000, so the county has grown a lot,  and the evaluation of the county has grown a lot. We were operating, I  think, when I come here on about an  11,000 to  12,000 budget, and  when I left it was like  150,000, or something like that. We had a four-person  staff when I left, and I think they still do now. Budgets are so  much easier now in this county because the evaluation has gone up.  What was primarily farmed here?  Mostly cattle. There   s a little bit of wheat. When I say a little bit, I know  about 9,000 acres. There   s some soybeans, and that   s not a large  acreage. A lot of hay is put up in this county, but it   s a cow-calf  operation, and it   s a steer operation where you buy steers and run them  during the summertime. That   s the main source of income for agriculture  here.  Where was your office located?  In the courthouse. Yes.  There seems to be a theme there.  Well, it is.  The county agent in the courthouse.  Yes. Let me tell you something that I started doing when I become a 4-  H agent. I would ask kids,    Do you live on a farm?    In the late    50s  probably 85 percent would hold up their hands, and that decreased  almost every year. The last time I went to a 4-H meeting here, which  18  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  would probably be about 1974, I asked that question, and one girl held  up her hand. That just tells you what has happened to people in  agriculture. It   s gotten a lot smaller. I have a son, and I kept telling him  that agriculture prices are too low. He would say,    There   s too many  farmers.    I   d say,    That may be true, but they   re leaving as fast as they  can.    All throughout those years, people were shifting off the farms to  other things. We   d discuss that, my son and I, quite a bit, that agriculture  was going through a change and that we were losing farmers, and that  was the shift that was taking place.  As that shift was occurring, how was that impacting your work?  It did. In this area, we had a cattlemen   s association that we got formed,  and we would have very good meetings with that group, seventy-five to  eighty people that would attend meetings. We had wheat demonstration  plots and other things, but our main focus here was just on livestock and  hay. One of the best programs I think I had in this county was in about  1980. We had Allen Rider, who was a specialist from OSU in  machinery. We put together a program about the new methods of putting  up hay. It was a multicounty event. We had probably about 250 people  attend, and we had a dinner for them. We started in the morning time  about nine thirty, and we didn   t get through until about two thirty in the  afternoon. That   s when the stackhand was coming out. That was a  machine that would stack the hay up, and you just pull off them and  leave them stacked there. We were making round bales, we were making  square bales, and we put up hay four or five different ways and showed  people the different methods that were available to them. It was a brand  new thing for a lot of people to see. I think that was one of our most  successful programs.  Those machines probably cost quite a bit.  Yes. They were a little bit more expensive than what they had been  using, but it was an easier way to handle the hay.  And probably less people.  That   s right.  Less labor involved.  More hydraulics.  How often would you have to go back to OSU to do training, or did they  come to you? Maybe both.  19  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Yes. I had a rural development master   s degree, but we would take more  training, and we would keep up on things when we   d have area  specialists or state specialists to come in and do programs.  Rural education was your master   s?  Yes.  I don   t think they offer that anymore.  Probably not. That was at a time when they were trying to get more of us  to have a master   s degree.  And to do what with it, though?  That was just to, I think, maybe add more status to the staff, the field  staff.  Over the years, county fairs have changed some, do you think?  They have, yes.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  Man, you talk about a lot of work when you   re talking about a county  fair. There is a lot of set up to them and a lot of it to take down. The  attendance is hard to get, I guess, now. It   s not like we used to have at  county fairs. When I first came here, there was a large crowd that would  come to the county fairs, and that has been dwindling down over time.  We have new fair buildings now, and they are very nice. It   s just a great  place to have a fair now. We had some fairly poor buildings when I  came here, but these new buildings were developed soon after I left.  What about the counties that you were in, like back in Frederick when  you were there? What was the county fair like there?  Well, a lot of livestock and a lot of crops, too, because that was a good  farming county, and a pretty good attendance at the fairs, too.  Did they have a dinner? You think of a fair with the chicken and  dumplings and pies and that kind of thing.  Oh, yes, most places, the home extension ladies would serve dinners at  the fair.  Do you know if they still do that here?  20  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  I don   t think they do. There is a place you buy food, but it   s run by  someone else.  Sad.  Yes.  When you were trying to decide to move between these various places,  was most of it just to do something different, or pay raises, or what?  Probably a little bit of a pay raise was maybe the major factor, and I  enjoyed all the places I worked. It gives you a pretty good idea of what  the state   s like.  Did you work closely with the home economist in each one of those  counties?  Sure, yes. They are a great part of Extension.  Did you continue to take groups to Roundup throughout your career?  We did here, and I went several years after I was an agent here. Even  with the 4-H, I would help them go over. I asked someone the other day,  I said,    What is Roundup like now?    because I haven   t been around it in  a long time. I don   t know what it   s like right now.  It   s probably coming up pretty soon. It   s usually in the summer, isn   t it?  Yes.  I   ll have to step outside and watch them go by. I think they   re still doing  some types of demonstrations     Yes.     and bringing something like a science fair type thing. What would you  consider some of your tools of the trade? What would you carry with you  when you were going out to visit with folks?  I don   t know that I had a lot that I took with me.  Pocket knife?  Oh, yes. I always carried a pocket knife.  21  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Did you have to do soil samples?  We did soil samples, and when I first came here we did the testing here  in the county. We would test the soil ourselves. Then we had a central  lab in Stillwater, and we started sending our samples there.  Some of the programs have changed, I   m sure, over the years. Do you  remember much what was the focus in the    60s?  No. We did some county mapping. We identified communities. They  told us that you would be surprised that there are certain lines in a  county where there is one community and it stops, and another  community starts. That is really true. You can go along a line where you  think it could be one community or other and start asking them, and  they   ll tell you what community they   re in. The people a quarter-mile  down the road will be in another community, and there is a line between  those two houses where you can draw the line of where a community  starts and ends. I don   t know if it would be that good today because  there is a lot more population here, but back thirty years ago, people had  their communities. A lot of it was school districts that they thought of,  but it was easy to find those lines.  Probably some around a church?  Around the church would be a good place to have a community, yes.  Were those type of maps kept?  I   m sure they were. I don   t know where they are now. We used to do a  lot of time writing plans at work. I don   t know where they are now.  Back in the early, early days, back in the    20s or even up to the    30s,  they did narratives.  Yes.  By the time you came on, you probably didn   t.  I did some narrative work. It was narrative reporting.  Where would those go once you turned it in? Who did you turn it in to?  In to the district directors.  Any idea what they did with them?  22  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  No, I   m not sure.  There should be some historical information there if we could find them.  You   ve heard the story about the county agent (I think it was in  Wagoner County) who, about the middle of his report, wrote,    If anyone  has read this, call me, and I   ll send you five dollars,    or something. He  never got a call. (Laughter)  I   ve read some from the 1920s. They are interesting.  Yes.  Learned about country roads and flat tires.  Extension was really needed at the time it got started. It helped people  solve a lot of their problems. When I was at Frederick I picked up  something, and I said,    What is this?    It was about twenty, twenty-two  inches long, and it was a needle. They said,    We use that to make  mattresses with.    They demonstrated how to make mattresses. They had  to do a lot of things, and as people got where they didn   t need it, then  they wasn   t used as much. But there was a lot of things that Extension  has taught people over the years.  What were some of the things you were taught at the beginning of your  career, just a few?  Hay qualities, how to increase the protein in hay, how to make things  better, reducing the back fat on pigs, how to measure back fat, feeding of  cattle for more efficiency and for weight gain, then, also, when cattle  come out of the feedlot that they wouldn   t have a lot of extra fat on  them. There   s been a lot of change from when I went to college. The  pigs were large and carried a lot of back fat. Now it   s less than a quarter  of an inch. Then the calves did the same thing. They   ve reduced the fat  on calves, and it takes longer to do it on cattle because the breeding  cycle is a lot faster on pigs. I can remember a lot of people at the shows,  at the livestock shows. They were confused.    Last year, we had these big  calves, and they were winning. This year, this judge is picking calves  that are not finished, that just look so much different.    But that was a  trend that they were headed into, cattle that would not show as much  overall fat and still be a very meaty animal. It   s been a great trend. It has  helped a whole lot.  How does something like that get started? At places like OSU?  Yes, they know where things are headed to. These judges, when they  23  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  would come to the shows, would try to tell people,    This is the animals  that we   re looking for,    but they would keep thinking,    But last year        Then they started,    Maybe we better pick them like the judge wants  them.    (Laughs) So, yes, it helped a lot in moving things along. The  shows, the county shows, helped a lot doing that, too.  Well, you mentioned you have children. Were they involved with 4-H?  Yes, they were. One of them was a Key Club member, and they both  went to Roundup.  Did you help them with their projects, or were they on their own?  Some. They were on their own quite a bit.  I know some agents wouldn   t let their children be in 4-H.  Well, that   s kind of a hard thing to handle that, how you want to handle  it. If you push them real hard and then they show up better, you can get  criticized for that.  But if they are interested you hate to say,    No, you can   t do it.     Yes.  What would they show, your children?  One of them showed a calf one year. One of them was in tractor  maintenance for a while. They wasn   t extremely active in 4-H. They  were good 4-H members, but they didn   t do a lot in 4-H.  What do you miss most about the job?  Oh, my  (Laughter) The people, the people you get to work with. But  I   ve made a slow shift out of that. I   ve done cattle appraisals for eight  banks. When they make a loan on cattle, they need someone to do the  paperwork for them. Then I have done crop appraisals for the  government and enjoy doing that. I   m still seeing a lot of farm people,  see.  How would you get hooked up to do something like that?  When I was working, just a year or two before I retired, the bank called  me and asked me if I could suggest two or three people to do their  appraisals for their cattle. I thought about it for a week, and I come up  with three names that was very good. I took it and gave it to them, and I  24  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  said,    How much work is there to do?    They said,    Not a lot, maybe ten  to twelve appraisals a year.    I said,    Would you mind if I did that on  Saturdays?    They said that would just be fine with them. So I started  doing that just a year or two before I retired. After I retired, I thought,    I  like to do that,    so I made a circle around. I picked up Wagoner,  Chelsea, Oologah, Inola, up to eight banks that I had worked for. After I  retired, the Farm Service Agency lady called me and said,    Would you  do some crop appraisal work?    I said,    Well, I don   t know what would  be required.    She said,    We   ll send you to school for a few weeks.    So I  did that, and I   ve enjoyed the crop appraisal work.  Where did they send you to school?  At OSU. It was not from OSU, but it was their department that taught  the classes.  So you started in farming and continued with your finger in it somewhat  all the way.  Yes. I was in Poteau Monday, looking at blueberries. The past county  agent there is becoming a crop appraisal person. The guy that helped me  kind of get started in it and helped me with some of my appraisals was  George Seals, who was a county agent in Bartlesville. He   s passed away  now. It takes someone, I think, that   s pretty versed in agriculture to  come in and start doing crop appraisals.  Someone who has some experience, too.  Maybe.  Well, back in the beginning did you have a mentor or a role model to  help get you started?  About every county agent that I worked with was kind of a mentor to  me. Hugh D. Woody was a good one that I enjoyed a whole lot. He was  my 4-H agent. Then the fellow I worked with, Don Conrad, was a 4-H  agent at Ardmore when I went there, and he was an extremely good  agent. He left Extension and went with the Estes chemical company and  has done very well with them.  Through the years, were you active in the association?  Yes. Enjoyed going to national meetings. My wife and I went to about  eleven national county agent meetings. We saw a lot of country that  way. We were on tours at those meetings, and then we kept up with a lot  of the national trends that was being talked about at those meetings. That  25  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  was good for us to do that.  At the state level, were you an officer or anything like that?  No, I didn   t pursue that very much.  Do you remember a Cleo Stiles Bryan?  Yes. Yes, ma   am. Did you get to interview her?  No, she had already passed before I got started with the project. I spoke  with her stepchildren a little bit about her.  Cleo was quite a lady. She could handle a crowd real well, and I   ve seen  her in a lot of programs.  They said she could really entertain     Yes.     and she did cookbooks.  Yes.  Did you have to have a new car every other year or every year?  No, I didn   t. I didn   t trade cars really a whole lot.  Didn   t have to be out on the road as much as some of the others?  Well, maybe I just used them longer. (Laughter)  Okay. A couple of the women would trade every other year, so they felt  more safe that way.  Oh, yes. I see what you mean. Yes.  You got mileage reimbursement, though?  Yes.  What else would you want to tell us?  Well, I think it   s something I would just do over again. It   s not a bad  life.  26  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Did you do radio, newspaper, TV, any of that?  When I came here there was a radio station here, and we did radio.  When I retired, I had been the longest running news columnist that they  had at the paper. That was easy. We called it    Extension Facts.    It was  easy to write those stories. The person who wrote the best stories was  my county agent in Pawnee County. He had a real knack for writing  news stories. He would just say that he was by someone   s place the  other day, and they asked a question, and he would answer the question  in the paper. That   s the way he got into describing the answers to some  of the things that people were asking about. He did a great job.  Did you keep any of your articles or columns?  I   ve got a little bit of a book about some things I did in Extension, yes.  Any memorable moments, maybe funny questions that you   ve been  asked?  I had a boy here that is a horticulture agent. He got a call   or the office  did. It was on grasshoppers, and he wanted me to go with him. We went  to the place, and it was so covered up in grasshoppers it was hard to  describe. You almost had to use your   well, we did use our windshield  wipers before we got to the house, there were so many on our  windshield. They were just eating paint off the house and everything.  That was quite a deal to find that many grasshoppers. Someone had  mowed something or done something close to them, and these  grasshoppers had moved over on their place, and they just kind of  inhabited. They were eating their flowers. They was eating everything  that they had.  How did they resolve that?  They got some chemicals and some baits and stuff that kind of brought  them under control.  About how many questions would you get during a typical day?  Oh, gosh  You can get twelve to fifteen, up to twenty, probably. A guy, I  went out with him to his place, and it was on the banks of the Verdigris  River. There was quite a few pecan trees there, and there was a lot of  pecan sprouts. He wasn   t familiar with agriculture, but he had obtained  the place and wanted to know some things he could do with it. I said,     Why don   t you just start raising pecans?    He says,    What do you do?    I  said,    Well, you can get some pecan grafting sticks and start grafting  some of these little sprouts that you   ve got here and start developing  27  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  some improved pecans.    He did. He took great interest in that. We held  grafting schools there for ten or twelve years, and he would demonstrate  how to graft. He got all that off our Extension factsheets.  I suggested the Maramec pecan. He is probably now the most noted  Maramec producer in Oklahoma. He writes news articles for the two big  pecan magazines in the nation. He is so interested in pecans that last  year a company in California come and used their chemicals to spray his  trees because he keeps such good records and stuff. I asked him one year  if he was going to graze cattle. He said,    I   ve tried it, but I   m not going  to have anymore cattle. They   re too rough on the pecans.    The next year  I said,    Did you hire someone to make hay?    He said,    I did, but they   re  too rough on the trees.    So he   s not going to do that anymore. He does  everything he can to make pecans. He   s got about twenty-five acres now  and produces over a thousand pounds an acre, and sells them for about  three dollars, three and a half a pound, so he   s doing well with his  pecans.  How did he harvest them?  He has a guy who has two pecan pickers. He doesn   t harvest them  himself. He has these guys with the two pecan pickers come in, and they  harvest the pecans in just a day or two. He gets his crop in, and most of  the time he has it sold before it gets harvested.  The ice storm hopefully didn   t damage them too much?  It didn   t, and here   s one of the reasons. He had a lot of younger trees at  the time that happened. In my work with the crop appraisals, I have seen  some beautiful orchards that have just been torn up by that ice storm.  That was in    57, about December 15 or so. We went to bed at ten  o   clock, and on the news we could see Collinsville, which is about  twenty miles west of here, and how the limbs were breaking down. I told  my wife how lucky we were that that didn   t reach us. About two  o   clock, the trees here started breaking up because we had ice on our  trees here. There   s groves that have still not got back but about 75  percent of the canopy they had in    57. Pecan trees produce on the new  wood, so they need all the canopy that they can have.  Fifty-seven, that takes it over fifty years ago.  No, pardon me. I mean in 2007. I   m sorry. I meant 2-0-0-7.  Well, it probably happened in    57, too, but    07, that   s more recent.  Yes, that was in 2007.  28  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  It takes a while to bounce back.  It does, but the younger trees stood it better than some of the older trees  did.  When you think of agriculture, I don   t think of nuts. I always think of  harvesting the fields, cattle, livestock, but not nuts, but here in  Oklahoma, pecans is a big industry.  It is. This is one of the top ten counties in the state in production. A lot  of pecans in Tulsa County, and along all the major rivers there   s a lot of  pecans.  Natives and other     Natives is still the most produced pecans in Oklahoma by far. There   s  just a good market for natives, too.  How often do you check the market for these various things? Do you do  it every day     No. (Laughs)     or just out of habit?  No, but I can tell you a little bit. In this pecan appraisal, I went to see a  guy about two months ago, and I said,    Do you have your pecans  contracted?    He said,    Well, I didn   t have, (the price has been going up)  but I decided the other day to go ahead and contract them.    Pecans are a  good price. He contracted a price that he was well satisfied with, but if it  goes up, he gets half of what it goes up. If it goes down, he still gets  what his contract was. I went back there a couple weeks later, and I said,     Did you get them sold?    He says,    I   ve delivered two big loads, and I  hope they take the rest.    I said,    What do you mean?    He says,    Well,  the price is going down.    The Japanese bought a lot of pecans, and then  they quit buying, and it   s really affected the price and then some other  things, too.  The next producer I went to, I said,    Did you contract your pecans?    He  said,    Yes, I did, but I am really hoping they take them.    Well, I went to  another guy. I said,    Did you get your pecans contracted?    He says,     No, we just had a good price, and we didn   t contract them.    I had to  contact him again about a week later. He said he could   ve contracted for   1.60, but he sold them for a dollar. So he missed out on some prices,  didn   t he? The pecan market was very good this year for a long time,  29  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  and then the price broke down quite a bit.  Economics. You have to know your math, don   t you, for this job? It   s  important to know current events and about weather.  Yes. Agriculture has changed more in the last two years than it   s ever  changed, price-wise, in my lifetime.  Why do you think that is?  One thing is they   re putting a lot of corn into ethanol, and that   s  affecting the corn prices. Cotton has been as high this year as it   s ever  been. It   s been up to  1.80 a pound. We produced cotton for twenty  cents a pound when I was growing up. I know that   s a long time ago, but  cotton is at an extremely high price. Soybeans is at a high price. Cattle is  at a high price. Pigs are at a high price. Agriculture has got the biggest  bloom on it that it has had in years and years. Consequently, agricultural  enterprises are really going up. This has been a big change. This is that  change that we were needing when I was talking to my son about  agriculture, is that the corn-producing people want to have much more  corn land next year. The soybean people want to have more soybean  land. The wheat people want to have more wheat land. There   s a big  demand for raising these crops. And the cotton, there   ll be a lot more  cotton growing if they can find the land. It   s just an enviable position to  be in.  But then if they flood the market, you   re back down again.  Yes, but our cow numbers have been in the good for about a year and a  half, and they   re still not increasing the cow numbers. It will look good  for several years. Just the other day to save a little town of Cairo   Illinois  over on the Mississippi River, the engineers decided to bust a  dam. That flooded lots of corn land and lots of crop land that is very  highly productive, a big strip of land that will lose their crops this year.  All those things, and then ethanol   you know that southwest Oklahoma  is plowing up a wheat crop right now, and those things make wheat stay  high.  Why are they doing that?  It   s just too dry. They haven   t had the moisture to produce their wheat,  and that   s in Texas, too. The wheat crop won   t start until it gets further  north.  While we   re talking about changes, how has the job itself changed,  Cooperative Extension-type jobs changed over the years? You were  30  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  saying you were in it during the best period.  We had more people in agriculture in those counties than there are now.  Those people were more anxious to have Extension because they wanted  the training and the knowledge. When I started, there was very few  people in agriculture that had college degrees. Now, there   s a much  larger number and a lot fewer producers, so, really, a larger percent of  the producers have college degrees now. They know their professors,  and they know who to call to get some answers to problems. It   s just  been a big change in agriculture that way. The education level has gone  up tremendously.  Do you have an opinion on when they changed the name back in the     60s? I think they changed it from County Agent to Cooperative Services  or something like that.  Yes. Extension Educators, and then Directors and things. That was all  right. I graduated from Oklahoma A M College, and the next year it  was Oklahoma State.  You   re used to name changes. I think it was in the    60s they did that.  They went from County Agent Office to OSU Extension office in 1966.  Yes.  People knew their county agent, but when you switched it wasn   t     They thought they lost something?  There was kind of a disconnect there.  Yes.  A large number of you actually spent thirty or forty years with  Extension     Yes.     not just a couple years and out.  No. The article I mentioned to you about the Extension Service awhile  ago tells you that these companies can pay a higher salary, and they will  pick people out of Extension to work for them. They are picking some  good employees, and they can pay them more. That   s one of the things  that   s hurting Extension right now, is the opportunity to go to work for  companies at a better price.  31  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  Finchum  Allison  It seems to be helpful if you grew up in the area, to work yourself into  the job there, if you know the area. Don   t want someone to come from  out of state to do it. I don   t know how often that happens.  Yes. Being from western Oklahoma, or more like south-central  Oklahoma, I like farming land better than I do trees, I guess, but in doing  my appraisal work, I   ve had the opportunity to go down to Poteau, to  LeFlore County, quite a number of times. When you go south out of  Sallisaw on 59 and you cross over the Arkansas River, there   s a strip of  land that   s about five miles wide and about twenty miles long that runs  into Fort Smith. They grow greens. It   s irrigated, and it   s all for a  canning company, the Allen Canning Company. I have enjoyed seeing  it. That   s a great spot for agriculture that I didn   t know existed until after  I had retired. They grow collard greens, spinach greens. I   ve seen them  harvest them. The people will tell you a lot about it. It   s a high-priced  business to be in, and sometimes it pays off very well. They get three  crops a year, and only about four or five people farm the major part of  that country. The guy that I   ve talked to the most farms about nine  thousand acres, and they farm it about three times a year. Well, he  doesn   t own any land. All his investment is in machinery. A lot of that  land is still held by who owned it a long time ago, but it   s leased up by  some large farmers.  There   s a lot of economy lessons, too, here. Supply and demand. It   s  good that some Oklahomans hang onto their land and not let some big  corporation come in and buy it up. We   ve asked you what you like the  best. What did you like the least? Was there anything you didn   t like  about the job?  You know, I   ve never thought about what I liked the least.  Writing reports? (Laughs)  That was not the top item I liked. (Laughs) County fairs was such a hard  job that that was one of the things I kind of dreaded to come along. At  first, it was hard to do budgets because we were going in asking for  money, and then we   d have to go back and ask for a supplement. That   s  almost like doing two budgets a year. After it got past that, budgets  become a lot easier. That wasn   t a big problem after the first six or seven  years here. I   ve just really enjoyed Extension. Would do it again.  That may be a good note to end on. Is there anything else you want to  say before we close?  No, but I   ve enjoyed meeting you, and I   ve enjoyed telling this story.  32  Finchum  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
