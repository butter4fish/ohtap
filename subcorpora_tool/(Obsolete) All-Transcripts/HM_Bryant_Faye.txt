Speaker 1: We're going to begin this interview.  The first part of it will be used for a documentary about Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  So, we're going to begin there.  I want to talk about your election.  Tell me what influenced you or your decision to seek the position of supreme basileus.
Speaker 2: You know, there are many times in your lives when things happen that you never plan.  I served as south central regional director and made a lot of friends, and I guess many of the sorors felt that I did a good job.  So, the boule was coming to Houston [Texas].  I was chair of that boule, and everybody kept saying, you need to run for supreme basileus now.  And I thought about it, and that was very difficult to do because I was--that was following, but it had one other supreme basileus from Houston, so I didn't know about that, you know.  I don't know whether they're going to accept two from the same city at this time, but a lot of my friends felt it was time for me to run and I did here in Houston at that boule, and the rest is history.  It's nothing you really plan, and I guess that's been a part of my life in many instances where you don't plan things.  It just happens.
Speaker 1: But was there an ascension to supreme basileus?  How would you describe your ascension to that position?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Let me start out.  I started out as an undergraduate initiated at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], very active on the campus, and involved in Alpha Kappa Alpha.  I started attending my first conventions of boules and regional conferences as an undergraduate.  When I graduated from Howard in 1958, this is my fiftieth year, and that was the year the boule was held in Washington [D.C.].  I was involved in planning for that boule, and I knew the national president, Marjorie Parker [Marjorie Holloman Parker], and all of that.  And so they always impressed me greatly.  I knew some of the founders that impressed me greatly.  And so, I have never been inactive in Alpha Kappa Alpha a day since I've been a member.  I left Howard and came back to Houston.  I had an aunt who was an AKA.  And so, I had, I knew a little bit about AKA.  And my sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] is an AKA.  And they preceded my even going to Howard.  I joined the graduate chapter here, Alpha Kappa Omega, here in Houston, and I still belong to that same chapter.  I got involved in the chapter, became the graduate advisor to an undergraduate chapter at Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas], and became the basileus of Alpha Kappa Omega. Then we went to a regional conference and this is really the fun part.  And at the regional conference, there were sorors.  I had not been nominated prior to that conference.  I was nominated at the conference from the floor.  And, of course, all of my supporters, they worked very hard that night, and we were voting the next morning.  And my supporters worked very, very hard and tied down another of those for me to win.  There was a first, and maybe the last, in Alpha Kappa Alpha that a regional director has been nominated from the floor.  So, I was elected, oh, I was young, and I thought, you know, very energetic at that time.  I became south central regional director.  I can remember even, as I was elected, it was the year that the fair was, World's Fair [HemisFair '68] was in San Antonio [Texas].  And the boule was in Dallas [Texas].  We left Dallas and going to the World's Fair, we had this big luncheon, and I had on this beautiful red dress and white cap and, you know.  That was a no-no.  And some of the older sorors said, "Come here, now you can't wear that color when you're officially representing," (laughter), "Alpha Kappa Alpha."  But, anyway, I served as regional director for South Central Region--that's Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico.  After that, I served on many national committees, and made a lot of friends across the county.  And my next step was--and I, I ran for supreme grammateus once and lost.  And the next time, I ran for supreme basileus and won.  And so, it--I've always been very, very involved in Alpha Kappa Alpha from day one.
Story_ID: 608131
Speaker 1: Tell me what else propelled your candidacy for supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was involved--I guess in leadership roles, or my job of having served in my--that's a story in itself, moving from classroom teacher to interim superintendent of the school district [Houston Independent School District] in Houston [Texas], which is, you know, one of the largest in the country where I think it's, at one time, it was the fourth largest and our fifth.  We compete with Philadelphia [School District of Philadelphia] a lot in terms of size of school district.  But there, I had the opportunity to lead.  I've been involved with local groups here in Houston.  That gave me an opportunity to lead, and so I guess I've always been out there since even high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] in a leadership role.  And I guess that's a part of my personality to just move forward.
Story_ID: 608132
Speaker 1: Well, speaking about leadership, what was your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had, serving as supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha was very, very important to me.  And I see Alpha Kappa Alpha with now more than two hundred thousand women as really POWER.  And that was my program emphasis.  Now, that acronym stood for programs of service.  That's the P, organizational impact and collaboration, women involved in global issues, economic development, and renewal.  I see any time you have a membership of two hundred thousand, you can make a difference in many different areas.  And if you come together and collaborate with others, you have even a bigger impact.  And so, we did a lot of collaboration during my tenure as national president, as well as trying to create that power, saying to sorors, you can run for office and your, your city council, and your county government, and your state government, and you can do that.  We were able, you know, time has a lot to do with everything.  During my tenure, it was a presidential election year and so, we did a lot of voter registration.  We put one hundred thousand folks on the registration rolls during that time.  It was a time that we had the first woman running for vice president, Geraldine Ferraro.  We had the first black Miss America.  I mean, there were things happening during that time, and that became a part of our thrust.  We were very, very active with other groups in pushing our agenda.  We got a chance to go to Kenya to the women's conference there and make a presentation with the Kenyan university women.  And so, we were not only involved at home, but with women issues across the country.  It was really, really an exciting time.  When people see me coming now, they say, "There's that power lady," (laughter).
Story_ID: 608133
Speaker 1: What or who influenced your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of things influenced my vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha.  Living in the world we were living in at that time, seeing the needs of all the people--women, blacks--that influenced what I thought we could do to make a difference in the world.  And the world was becoming smaller, no longer were we just, you know, at home, but it was--women's issues became worldwide issues.  And so, I think that influenced being always thinking I'd, you know, involved in politics, I was always interested in getting people elected and getting, nonpartisan.  I didn't care what you were, you know, it was not a partisan thing, but I thought that if we needed to sit at the table where decisions were made, whether it was the board table, we said to some of our brothers, you know, we're supporting you and everything, but you, you don't think women can sit there with you.  You want to make all of the decision and you want us to raise all the money.  No, no, no, we're not going to do that anymore.  We want to be at the table where decisions are made.  And so, we fought to do that, and you will find that we had many sorors running for public office during that time, and we were gradually moving into Corporate America.  The supreme basileus preceding me [Barbara Kinard Phillips] with when I was first anti- established what we called the Alpha Kappa Alpha Connection.  And I drew that plan up as vice president of Alpha Kappa Alpha, saying we ought to be able to network with each other.  So, the structure was we had the connection, a national committee.  We had a state coordinator in every state, a chapter coordinator in every chapter, so that you could move information up and down the chain.  You could get action up and down.  And I think that helped us as I moved in as supreme basileus to really work, what I call work that connection.
Story_ID: 608134
Speaker 1: So, in what ways was your vision designed to ensure that Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] of, to ensure Alpha Kappa Alpha's survival?
Speaker 2: Well, I think all of us who have served that has been and our intent that we leave the office and the organization stronger than when we entered.  And we do that programmatically, but we also do it financially.  Economic development being one of my key pieces, I, this time, I said timing is everything.  I was in office as we decided to build a newer national office building in Chicago [Illinois].  And we decided that we would build that building without debt.  And so, I get the credit for building our national office, and when we dedicated it, we did not owe one dime on it.  It was completely paid for.  We had collected millions from--and Alpha Kappa Alpha women paid for it.  We didn't borrow it from anybody.  It was across the country.  All of the Alpha Kappa Alpha women coming together to build a $4 million building without any debt, and that says that we ought to have economic security that we need if you put it together, you can do it.
Story_ID: 608135
Speaker 1: You spoke a little bit about, about the connection [Alpha Kappa Alpha Connection].  And, was this how your vision was communicated and carried out through this sorority's program [POWER] during your administration?
Speaker 2: That's one of the vehicles we used, but, you know, in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], we have a national program committee, which has a representative from each of the regions.  And I had a real, real, real sharp program committee--Dr. Freddie Groomes [Freddie Groomes McLendon] down in Florida was the chair of that committee.  We pulled together a program booklet, and then as you go into these regional conferences I mentioned to you, like we have ten regions, those regional representatives also carried the message.  When we have leadership seminars, as we do in alternate years with boule, we also are carrying the message.  When you go out and speak for Founders Day and other invitations, the chapter should carry that message.  So, it's--we have many vehicles to move our message through the sisterhood.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you specifically do to successfully communicate your vision and effectively institutionalize it as a guiding principle?
Speaker 2: I guess, you know, the supreme basileus, we always have our Ivy Leaf magazine.  That has continued, and still continues today, where you communicate with the membership.  We do, did what we call Along the Ivy Vine, which was a newsletter from the supreme basileus to the membership.  And then from time to time, we did position papers and disseminated them.  And so, we've become more sophisticated.  See, I served before email and computers and all of that sophistication.  And certainly, we have a bigger op- you know, a better opportunity now, but we did the best we could to disseminate information through all of the possible channels, from the board to all of our committee chairs, to each regional representatives on each of our committees, down to the chapter level.  And I think we communicated and that down there because people were excited about power.  I think the term, power, just added a little bit to it.
Story_ID: 608136
Speaker 1: Now, let's talk about your, your leadership style.  Which leadership style did you use to bring your vision to fruition?
Speaker 2: Well, I think my leadership style has not changed and it's still the same.  I believe that in working with any group, it takes cooperation and it takes participation, and so, you try to bring as many people into that participation as possible.  You have to also remember that you're dealing with human beings and adults, you know.  You aren't dealing with children--well, our undergraduates sometimes, or may seem like children, but you have to treat people with respect.  If you treat people with respect, then you're respected.  A very kind person just ordinarily, and they say that I can say no with a smile better than anybody that you know.  And it takes that, I think, to lead an organization.  And in doing so, you really motivate.  You are there to help sorors as to grow and to develop, and that's my role as a leader.  If I am leading, then I need to be bringing some folks behind me developing, helping to develop some of those leadership skills.  My leadership skills in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] were the same as they were in the Houston Independent School District.  My responsibility was supervising principals and schools and district superintendents, and we got along very well.  We worked together.  In fact, people still tell me, "Oh, we miss you," because they're accustomed to that involvement and that participation and that really, really respect.  And I believe that people can do and will do, if given an opportunity, and so I let them do that.
Story_ID: 608137
Speaker 1: As the individual with the ultimate responsibility for making decisions which would shape AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], what was the fundamental test applied to you?
Speaker 2: Say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, actually, what was the fundamental test you applied?
Speaker 2: I think any decision made, you have to think about what's the impact on the total membership, whether it's a financial impact, whether it's time that you want committed to a project, whether it's that sisterhood you're bringing together, but the impact on the membership should always be in the forefront as we make decisions.  It's not mine.  It's not I, but it's Alpha Kappa Alpha, as a whole, a total sisterhood.  And you must always remember, too, our purpose.  We were founded as a sisterhood, and a part of that was to be of service to all mankind, and if we keep those two principles in mind, as we serve, I think we'll be in good shape.  And that, that led me as we, you know, considered, made recommendations to the group.
Story_ID: 608138
Speaker 1: Was there a former supreme's [supreme basileus] leadership style that paralyzed--paralleled yours?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Well, we all copied a little bit off of each other, you know.  And I must say, we've had some tremendous leadership in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  I had the opportunity this past weekend to see the family of one of my supporters through the years, Marjorie Parker [Marjorie Holloman Parker], out of Washington [D.C.].  She died about two years ago and her whole--they honor her at the North Atlantic Regional Conference by naming a luncheon in her honor, and her entire family was there.  That was very special.  Marjorie was very, very special to me, but you pick up a little bit from others.  And they all have been super leaders and so, I can't say that there was anyone that gave me most of my--I just picked up the good points and, you know, all of us have some weak points, too, so I tried to pick up the strength from the others.  And I hope that those who have served after me were able to pick up some of my strengths.
Story_ID: 608139
Speaker 1: What did you learn about leadership while serving as supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Leadership is tough (laughter), very tough.  Even though you work hard every day to make the right decisions, somebody is not going to like it, you know.  Everybody's not going to agree with you ever, and so you have to learn to take that disagreement and move on, but it's tough.  I think the measurement, however, though, is that if you find yourself out front, and nobody's following you, then you're not leading, but if everybody, the majority of the people are supporting you and pushing you and helping you to achieve, then it's pretty good.
Speaker 1: What lessons learned was most instructive for you?
Speaker 2: I think probably the fact that you really have to learn to work with people and you have to learn to like people, some you may not like what they do or say, but you have to like them and love them anyway, and that's a fact in anything you do.  There are some people you, as you probably know and personality types, nothing will ever be right.  Everything will always be wrong.  But they're right there, you know, they wouldn't give it up for anything.  But I think that's--you learn that.  That's a lesson you learn that people are going to, you know, disagree, and we do so, you know, sisterly.
Story_ID: 608140
Speaker 1: So, what was the greatest challenge or controversy you faced and how did you respond to it?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Listen, I, I guess the greatest challenge of my life was my last year with my last convention in Detroit, Michigan.  And just before we got--we had all of these contracts on hotels.  One was in Dearborn, Michigan, and just before we got there, there was a NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] boycott of Dearborn hotels.  Now, that's our second largest five hundred room hotel, contracts signed in blood (laughter), you know.  Now, how--you're right in the middle of your contract and NAACP people boycotting?  And, of course, when you arrive, everybody wants to--the press wants your message (laughter).  You have to get up and say something.  And so, it's very difficult to, to really get your message right that we can't cancel this multimillion dollar contract with this hotel, but we do support (laughter) the goals of the NAACP in this particular fight.  I guess that was the most difficult thing I had to do, but there are other times that you run into difficulties.  It's hard raising money to build a national office building, to get several million dollars out of our sisters' pockets--that's tough.  But we had a leader of that drive, the one I mentioned to you, Lillian Don Thomas [Lillian D. Thomas] out of Nashville, Nashville, Tennessee, who went across the country in interregional conferences and into chapters, and we begged.  And so, it happened.
Speaker 1: On whom did you rely for counsel or guidance when responding to any challenges or controversy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think all of our past national presidents have always been there for the sitting president, and to pass on any advice that we can, and, of course, I did that.  I used them as a sounding board.  Of course, there are others that you feel close to that you also, you know, it depends on what kind of situation you're in.  If you need legal information, you find some of the best attorneys you can in the organization.  If it's a program idea in particular areas, if we're doing a health project, you find some folks in health.  We've got all kinds of talent in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  There's nothing you could really want to do that you don't have somebody with the expertise within the organization, and I mean, expert expertise.  And so, you depend on those, you know, depending on what you're doing with the expertise in the particular area.  Historically, you know, it's always good to remember the past, and how we got to the present, and we do that by conferring with our past presidents.  Why are we doing this, this way now?  There's always a history behind what you're doing and why.  Even if you want to change it, you need to know why you or where you're are.  And so, I think that past supreme basileis have played a very significant role in this organization and continued to do so.  We've gotta help to help it to grow and not to try to run the organization.  That's not it at all, but to support, and to be there for the sitting president.
Story_ID: 608141
Speaker 1: Describe an irritation that spurred you into action.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I have a lo- patience, plus--I really do, and most people say that I'm even tempered.  I never get, you know, upset about anything, but sometimes, you do.  And probably in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] when people begin to spread information, which is not true, which they don't understand all the facts and, you know, how they hear a little piece, and then it becomes a great big story.  Then you have to act.  You have to confront the person who is spreading the information and you have to inform the membership of the facts, and that you have, and that comes many times during, you know, if you're supreme basileus for four years, you're going to have to do that sometimes during your tenure.
Story_ID: 608142
Speaker 1: By what standards would you measure the success of your administration [as supreme basileus]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there are several objective ways you can look at it.  What was your impact on the membership?  What was your impact on the communities across the country and on the world?  I think, as I look back at our program components, I think in each of the areas, we can say we did very well in all of those POWER units.  I think if you look at our economic development during that time, the building of the national office building [in Chicago, Illinois], and other things that we did, I think it says we did very well.  If you look at our impact nationally and the PR [public relations] and the, and others looking at Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and becoming aware of Alpha Kappa Alpha, we did very well.  If you look at our world involvement during that time, I think we did very well.  So, I would like to say that POWER worked, that we had a powerful impact on the sorority and on the community.  And I used community, meaning larger United States of America and worldwide community.
Story_ID: 608143
Speaker 1: What one thing would you have liked to have done that you were unable to accomplish [as supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: You know, there are always things you would like to do or to complete that you don't have an opportunity.  I mean, time runs out.  Four years is all you have.  But I think most of the things that I planned, and I wanted and to accomplish, I did, so I didn't leave thinking that there was anything that I had not accomplished.
Story_ID: 608144
Speaker 1: It's said that we do not remember days--we remember moments.  Now, as supreme basileus, what was your greatest moment, your proudest moment, and your happiest moment?  Let's say with the greatest moment.
Speaker 2: The greatest moment, and maybe it's all three (laughter).  It may fall together.  I was president twenty-five years ago for the seventy-fifth anniversary.  I was supreme basileus when we went to Washington [D.C.] for the boule.  That was a magnificent boule.  Time is important.  Because we had women with so many firsts, we were able to bring them to our convention.  We had Geraldine Ferraro.  We had--well, Miss America, you remember, made a switch there during that time.  And Suzette Charles became--she was at the convention.  Even she announced, after her announcement, that was her first appearance.  The press was just all over the place because that, they had, they couldn't find her.  And we had trouble trying to get her into that room without them just going bananas, but we, we were slick enough to do it.  I think Elizabeth Dole was in one of the departments.  You know, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou--just everybody was there.  We had a march on Washington, which a sea of pink and green from the hotels to the Capitol [U.S. Capitol, Washington, D.C.], and then we had this program on the steps of the Capitol.  Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] and all the political folks were there, and it, it was just magnificent.  At that time, it was the largest boule we had had.  The Washington Convention Center [Washington, D.C.] was brand new.  They had torn it down and built another once since.  And we--our banquet was the largest seated banquet that had been tried.  It made all of the trade journals--how they planned it to serve in one sitting in that convention center about fourteen thousand folks, and all the technical things they had to do.  They divided it, like it was four banquets.  And you staff each area and, you know, it, it was really, really amazing.  But the Washington boule was a very, very, you know, it was a great time for Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  So was, probably one of my proudest moments was the dedication of the national office building [in Chicago, Illinois].  That was a proud moment that it had really happened.  You know, when you're going through building and you're dealing with architects, and you're dealing with construction folks, and you're dealing with furniture, you never know how it's going to come out, but it came out beautifully.  And today, it's one of our pride and joys, so I, I think that those two things were very, very important.  But even more than that, the day we were at, let me--and I don't mean to ramble--but the day we were at the Capitol, that's the day we announced how many people we had put on the voting rolls.  That was when we announced, that was a connection project across the country.  And so, you know, there were so many exciting times, being the leader of Alpha Kappa Alpha.  It's always something that's joyful and pleasant and exciting.
Speaker 1: Was there any one thing that made you happiest?
Speaker 2: I guess my happiest moment came with the boule in Washington (background noise).
Story_ID: 608145
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your, your legacy.  Compare the Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] you inherited from your predecessor to the one that you left your successor.
Speaker 2: I think that my predecessor--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Hold on. Let's start again. When you lean forward like that (unclear), they won't like that. So, go ahead. Sorry.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think that my predecessor and I worked very closely together, so there was a smooth transition.  As first (unclear), I accompanied her and supported her in most of the things, and she began to lay a path for that ease of transition.  For instance, she purchased the property for the national office [in Chicago, Illinois].  I built it, but if she had not purchased that property, that would not have occurred.  The connection--how she allowed me to structure the connection.  I was able to implement that because it had been started during her time.  So, my predecessor and I worked very closely together and there was a very smooth transition.  I hope that when I left office that I also left and, and my (unclear) I worked closely together, so that some of the things I started, she continued.  I started Women Involved in Global Concerns.  Janet went further out with global involvement with Africa, and things we were doing there.  We both attended the women's conference in Nairobi [Kenya] and, of course, then she went--I did African on my way out.  We had approved at the boule what we called our African Village project [African Village Development Program].  She was able to implement it, so in Alpha Kappa Alpha, there's a continuous--I think when I left, Alpha Kappa Alpha, she was able to move ahead with it.  I hope I left it stronger and I know I did, than when I became the supreme basileus because we moved into a new era, and so we were better off politically.  I mean, in terms of impacting the political scene and the economic scene, and, you know, I hope I left the sisterhood and with relationships better.
Speaker 1: That was going to be my, my next question, but who was your predecessor and your successor?
Speaker 2: My predecessor was Dr. Barb- uh-oh, was Dr. Barbara Phillips [Barbara Kinard Phillips], and she was from Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  My--the one to follow me was Janet Jones Ballard from Richmond, Virginia.
Story_ID: 608146
Speaker 1: And you talk about impact, but which of your contributions do you think had the most impact?
Speaker 2: Probably the building of the national office building [in Chicago, Illinois] because that's an inst- I mean, it's there and it will be there for years to come, and house our everyday operation [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Is that the accomplishment of your administration that you want to be remembered for or is there another?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I want to be remembered for a lot of things (laughter).  Sure, that would be probably the highlight--the building and the dedication of that building.  Probably there would be it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is there, is there--
Speaker 2: I think the other thing we did something and our involvement in global concerns when we went to Kenya and presented, with these university women, and brought those two groups together, that was a very important time for global cooperation between women, Kenyan women and American women.  I think that, that was the beginning of something special.  As I said, the boule--my, my whole program was so massive and so, you know, involved.  So, it's hard to just say one thing, you know, a lot of things are still going on, and people are still doing some of them.
Story_ID: 608147
Speaker 1: What key elements of the sorority's heritage or legacy have been powerful enough to keep AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] vibrant through the test of time?
Speaker 2: I think our founders were very, very smart women.  They came together for a purpose.  They, you know, at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] as the sorority was established, it was long before women had a right to vote or do any other thing, and there were very few women on the college campuses.  So, they knew they were privileged and they felt that they could make a difference in the world.  We have tried all of the leaders through the years to take that original statement in our, of purpose, and keep that in mind through the years for a hundred years.  And that's a sisterhood and service.  Those two precepts have kept us focused.  I'm sure, long before my time, that Alpha Kappa Alpha is a world in miniature.  You have all of the glory and the joy, but you have the meannesses and, you know, things like that.  That's life, but we've been able to say, we are going to keep service and sisterhood in the forefront always.  And I think that's what's kept us on course, has, has brought us through tough times and lean times and good times.  And as we go into our second century, I think that, that's still very much a part of us.  Alpha Kappa Alpha is a sisterhood.  That means that shapes your relationship with two hundred thousand and more women that all with the same focus.  Its purpose, service to all mankind, and we continue to try to do just that.  All of the chapters across the country focused on program and sisterhood.  That's what's kept us going. We've never left that.

Speaker 1: Is there one thing that is essential to ensure that you walk, rather than back into the next hundred years?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, we're walking into the next hundred years.  We're sure of that.  I think leadership has made sure that we move ahead.  And the current membership with the program focus, (unclear) with an economic base, we fought the civil rights battle in the first century.  Now, we got to fight an economic battle.  How do we gain economically in this country?  How do we help the poor to gain economically?  And I think we're walking straight into it, eyes open, ready for it.
Speaker 1: Now, you talk about the sisterhood and the strength there, but has the sisterhood dimension taken a back seat to the pledge to be of service to mankind?
Speaker 2: No, they're equal.  I think they have both been a part of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  I don't think either has taken the back seat to the other.  I think, parallel, we believe both and that both have to continue.
Story_ID: 608149
Speaker 1: Well what do you perceive as the greatest threat to the su- survival of the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well, the greatest threat may be within.  When you look at college campuses and I say this, and there are many who say, well, maybe we ought to just wipe out undergraduate chapters.  But there are some young women--I don't care how much you say you're against it, how much you put in policy, who believe that they must do some hazing, and that's been an ugly head in the sorority from time to time.  We have taken every step humanly possible to smash it, but there are some who decide they're going to do it anyway.  And, of course, the only thing you can do is just put them out.  I mean, you know, expel them from the sorority forever.  And we have severe penalties for that, that we must forever be vigilant about and I see that, I call that a threat within.  I don't see a threat without as long as we are true to our mission and our purpose.  We will compete with others, sure, but I don't really think it's a threat that would wipe us off the face of the earth.  I think one--I won't be here to see it, but I think 100 years from now, you'll see a celebration for the two hundredth anniversary.
Story_ID: 608150
Speaker 1: What elements of the sorority must be maintained or changed to ensure a perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: Perfect.  We hold these truths to be self-evident (laughter)--perfect.  Let me talk about whether there will ever be perfection.  There's no way you're going to have two hundred thousand women in nine hundred chapters, and expect perfection, but it is what we strive for.  We strive to get better and better and better.  And we are always striving for that perfection.  We'll never lose sight that we have, "Miles to go," (laughter), "before we sleep" ['Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening,' Robert Frost] because we are striving to be as perfect as we can, knowing that I don't think Jesus Christ was perfect, so whether it will be perfect, but we are striving to get close, as close to it as we can.
Speaker 1: Well, what must be maintained or changed to get close to--
Speaker 2: Perfection (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to the goal?
Speaker 2: As you grow, you have to put in, refine, and new techniques for communicating, for, you have to look at yourself differently.  Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], at 100 years old with two hundred thousand members and a multimillion corporation, can't perform as it did fifty years ago, twenty-five years ago when I was supreme basileus.  It takes a lot--we have to have a central structure to help to keep it going with as much flexibility for the local groups as possible.  But there are some things that you have to maintain because of the things we're controlled by.  IRS [Internal Revenue Service] controls every organization like Alpha Kappa Alpha.  There are government restrictions in terms of employment and hiring.  And so, you've got to keep all of those things in mind.  And we can't do things as we've always done them, you know, when we were smaller.  But I can't--my first boule, we met in a high school auditorium, I think.  Can you imagine twenty thousand women in Washington [D.C.]?  There were, say, fifteen, maybe ten thousand with all the guests and things, twelve thousand, in Washington when I was there twenty-five years ago.  That's almost doubling.  Now, you can't plan a convention as you planned it twenty-five years ago.  Our supreme basileus has to be everywhere representing Alpha Kappa Alpha because we're out there.  We have to be with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], United Negro College Fund board [UNCF], Africare, all these Washington entities.  Now, it's very difficult, and I think this is where we're headed.  We're not there yet, but we're going to have to do like corporations.  You have to hire, you have to pay your CEO to run the place, you know.  Yes, you have a chief officer, operational officer in the national office, our executive director, but she can't run to, and nor, nor can the supreme basileus run, and full- hold down a full-time job.  So, we've got to look, and I expect in these 100 years, we'll see that change.  Our structure is sound, and I'm sure you're going to have to tweak it as we move in.  Nothing stays the same forever, and so you'll have to do some tweaking.  But I think we're going into the next century with a sound financial structure, a sound economic base, a sound operational base.  And I think we, that's why I say, oh, we're marching straight into the next century with eyes wide open.
Speaker 1: Because you said there, that you're striving to be perfect that it probably would not be perfect.
Speaker 2: Ever.
Story_ID: 608151
Speaker 1: What is your vision?  Now, now, we just, you just said that nothing would, would be perfect, but what is your vision for the sisterhood to become, to get as close to being perfect since we don't want to say they will ever be perfect, but what is your vision?  What do you see for the sisterhood?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I am always in favor of excellence, excellence in operations because we've got to manage this Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], excellence in program as we touch lives across the country and in the world, excellent in all that we do, always remembering that in this sisterhood, you've got to remember those relationships, and we want some real good relationships as well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Alpha Kappa Alpha is 100 years old.  It is the oldest women's sorority, black women's sorority, Afro American women sorority.  Alpha Kappa Alpha, through the years, you know, we even--I was thinking the other day, we even preceded the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  We have preceded a lot of things going on in the country.  But from the beginning, we have been there in all of the struggles of our people.  We were there to say no-no to lynching.  We were there, you know, to say we ought to work together to bring about a difference.  We paid for a lot of folks in the '60s [1960s] to get out of jail.  And we were there for the Civil Rights Movement, supporters of Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, civil--and, and people forget the significant things, historically, that we have done.  And I think we're going to continue to play that role, but it's going to be played a little bit differently.  As I said, we played our first 100 years as supporters of all of those.  The next 100 years, we're going to be at the table helping to make some of those decisions about what happens in this nation and in this world.  And I think it will be a good day for the USA because I think women can make a difference.  I think their level of expertise, their sensitivity will help us to make this a better world.  And so, it may be that in this next 100 years, you may have a Alpha Kappa Alpha soror as president.  How would that be?  That's my wish for the second 100 years.
Story_ID: 608152
Speaker 1: --Going to talk about your family history and your ancestry.  And I, I'd like to begin talking about your mother.  Would you tell me your mother's name, spell it for me--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and tell me where and when she was born if you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  My mother's name was Malinda, M-A-L-I-N-D-A, Stin- Bryant--well, her maiden name was Edmond.  Then my--she was Bryant Stinson, S-T-I-N-S-O-N [Malinda Bryant Stinson].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in San Jacinto County, Texas.  That's up in East Texas, you know, they got crazy names up there in rural Texas.  Have you ever been to East Texas?  Well, you had--it, it's, they call the place where she was born the Thickets [Big Thicket, Texas], but it was out from New Waverly [Texas], so it's in that part of East Texas with Willis [Texas] and New Waverly, Coldsprings [sic. Coldspring, Texas].  Those are the little towns, but these are the little communities, you know, where blacks lived in East Texas, and it was called the Thicket.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother grew up with--she was the youngest of twelve children, so most of her sisters and brothers were older, and she was the youngest of the twelve.  And so, they grew up on, you know, in the country with a large family but a close family.  And my grandmother did a lot for them.  My grandfather died early, so it was a grandmother run family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was your grand- --
Speaker 2: --with the older brothers.
Speaker 1: --what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Malinda Edmond [Malinda Shepherd Edmond (ph.)].
Speaker 1: And your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him and I, I don't--
Speaker 1: Did, did you know his name?
Speaker 2: I did at one time--I've forgotten it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--it was Edmond, his last--I'll think of it because I have some uncles.  I think that one had his name.
Speaker 1: So, continue to tell me about your grandmother and your mother in growing up.
Speaker 2: My grandmother had all of these children, and she worked very hard on, you know, they could grow everything.  It was, it was the country.  They did a lot of--but the older brothers were able to help, you know, her to survive.  As my mother got older, and my mother then moved to--had a cousin who taught school here in Houston [Texas]--Consara [ph.], she brought my mother to Houston.  And my mother went to school in Houston and graduated from Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas], and then they sent her off to college.  And that was how my mother got out of the country to the city, but the cousin was very instrumental in helping her to get an education.  In fact, that particular cousin was a teacher here in Houston on--when, you know, the schools were segregated at that time.  And she was one of the first teachers when they opened this black high school called Jack Yates High School [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas].  And so, she is responsible for my mother getting an education.  My mother left--when she went to college, she went to what is now, it used to be Sam Huston [Samuel Huston College, Austin, Texas].  It's now Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] 'cause two colleges merged.  Tillotson [Tillotson College, Austin, Texas] and Sam Huston merged and became Huston Tillotson.  And then, that's where she started.  She went back and taught in that rural area when she began teaching before coming to Houston--well, Kelton [Texas], and then Houston.
Story_ID: 608153
Speaker 1: Do you remember your [maternal] grandmother [Malinda Shepherd Edmond (ph.)]?  Did you have a relationship with her?
Speaker 2: Sure.  She lived with us as she got older.  She, and she be, she was blind.  She, in her later years, you know, went blind, but very sweet lady.  My grandmother had come to Texas from South Carolina, those islands off of South Carolina.  And she was a beautiful woman, very dark-skinned, with beautiful--and I got none of that beautiful hair.  I want you to know that she had gorgeous hair, but she was very kind, very sweet, and she--my grandmother had so many grandchildren, had twelve children, and all of them having children, and all of them having children.  She had 100 and something grandchildren when she died.  But she lived with us in her later years and was always there, even though she couldn't see.  She had that sense of what was going on around her and was a very lovely woman.
Speaker 1: Do you--did she talk about her life in the Sea Islands at all?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't, no, she didn't.
Speaker 1: Do you know which island she was from?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  That, you know, that's one of my projects right now.  And I have said to all of my--to my girlfriend in Charleston [South Carolina], and she has invited me to come, that I'm going to Charleston.  I'm trying to begin to do a hist- trace my history, and so that's one of the projects if I could every stop traveling, I'd settle down and do.  But I'm going to find out because I am going to Charleston to--for her piece.  I could pretty much pick up in Texas, but 'cause I knew some of her sisters and brothers and all of those.
Speaker 1: Who were some of her sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They were all Shepherds [ph.].  She was a Shepherd.  That's her maiden name.  One--all of them are deceased a long time now.  I grew up around two, and then, their children, my cousin, Emily [ph.], you know, and we all went to the same church here in Houston [Texas] at that time.  But I'm going, I'm tracing all of that.  My, my little niece in Washington [D.C.] says, "Have you started?"  And she's trying to do the same thing.
Story_ID: 608154
Speaker 1: Describe your mother to me.
Speaker 2: My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] was kind, gentle, everybody loved her.  We called her Dear, never got to Mother Dear, I--we'd all say, Dear, but very kind, she would help anybody.  She did--since she was the educated one in the family, she did a lot for her nieces and nephews.  That's why they were always all around her because she brought them out of the country, and helped them to get educations, and she was very close to her nieces and nephews because they were her age.  But my mother would do anything for anybody.  She was a teacher and, of course, I guess we were--my sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] and I--it's just two of us.  We were privileged in that my mother was a teacher, my father [Willie Bryant] worked as a Pullman porter on the railroad [Southern Pacific Railroad], and so we had a lot of experiences and got a chance to travel everywhere.  And my mother who, after she left Huston Tillotson [Samuel Huston College; Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], she went back home and taught up in the country for a few years.  Then, there's a little black community outside of Houston [Texas] called Kendleton [Texas].  She taught there, and then she came into--taught about thirty-six years in Houston.  Guess what grade?  First, first grade.  She loved little kids, and she retired from the school district [Houston Independent School District], but she was very active in her church.  We were members of Wesley A.M.E. Church [Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church, Houston, Texas].  She sang in the choir.  She was a part of the Missionary Society [Women's Missionary Society], and she enjoyed doing things, plus she could sing.  She had a beautiful voice.  I'm the one in the family without the singing voice, but she could sing, and the neighbors loved her.  Everybody loved my mother.
Story_ID: 608155
Speaker 1: Now, tell me your father's name.
Speaker 2: His name was Willie Bryant.
Speaker 1: And where and when was he born?
Speaker 2: I don't know the year he was born, but he was born in Chappell Hill, Texas. (Cough) Pardon me.  Chappell Hill is west of Houston [Texas].  It's a--my mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] came from East Texas.  He came from the other side of Texas, but they met in college.  He went to Paul Quinn College [Waco, Texas], and they met during their college years.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were their names?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Sophia, S-O-P-H-I-A, Bryant [Sophia Ward Bryant (ph.)].  And my grandfather's name was Toby, T-O-B-Y Bryant [Toby Bryant].  My grandmother migrated to Texas from Alabama, up in the Tennessee River area.  And the whole family came to Texas, and they settled--her family, they--her maiden name was, they were Wards [ph.].  They settled in North Texas, and so I had rel- relatives in Abilene [Texas] and up in that part of Texas.  And my grandfather was from the Chappell Hill area.
Speaker 1: And how much education did your grandparents have?
Speaker 2: None, not, very little (laughter).  He would say very little.  They were not college trained people.
Speaker 1: And, but your--they made sure that your father went to--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was there a story about how he got to college?
Speaker 2: No.  They just worked hard and sent him--it was a church, Paul Quinn College was an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] school.  And so, everybody in the church knew about Paul Quinn.  They didn't know too much about other schools, but they knew about Paul Quinn, and that's why he went to Paul Quinn.  It was an A.M.E.--still is an A.M.E. school.
Speaker 1: What was his course of study?
Speaker 2: My father loved working with his hands.  He, he--my father was a very jolly person.  He, too, knew everybody, and everybody--they called him Chip, "Chip off the old block," you know 'cause he knew everybody down at the barbershop and (laughter).  But I'm not sure what he was studying in college since he never went into anything, except worked on the railroad [Southern Pacific Railroad].
Story_ID: 608156
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] and father [Willie Bryant] met?
Speaker 2: You know, other than being college students, and knowing each other in college and getting married, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, they met in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, throughout, they both were college students.  They weren't in the same college, but in the same general area; they met as college students.
Speaker 1: And where did they settle when they married?
Speaker 2: Houston, Texas.  They, in fact, they lived at 4219 Gunter Street, Houston, Texas.  That house is still there.
Speaker 1: And you say that you have just one sister?
Speaker 2: I had one sister.
Speaker 1: And what is her name?
Speaker 2: Barbara Jean Sol- Bryant Solomon [Barbara Bryant Solomon].
Story_ID: 608157
Speaker 1: Tell me, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory, oh, I can remember maybe--I'm trying to think--elementary school [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas].  A little before then, you know, I was always the type, I love to play outdoors, and I can remember riding my tricycle, bicycles, and stuff out, down the street.  I lived in Fifth Ward.  If you ever know anything about Houston [Texas], Fifth Ward is a whole, old, old historical area where a lot of blacks have grown up.  And we had very close neighborhoods, so you and your friends were out playing.  I remember, I can remember the unpleasant thing.  I had a dog, and I can remember when that dog got run over by a car and that was the thing that hurt me the most--my poor dog, but I moved on.  And I got a lot of bruises and things from falling off, learning to ride bicycles and skate, and do all of those kinds.
Story_ID: 608158
Speaker 1: Tell me about your neighborhood [Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, sure--
Speaker 1: Now, if you were take me on a tour, say, on a square block, what would I see in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: My old neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My old neighborhood has changed dramatically.
Speaker 1: But when you were a child.
Speaker 2: When I was a child, there were single family homes, not big anything, but nice, little single family homes with single families.
Speaker 1: Were most of the families two parent households?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  And down on the corner was a Mexican family that I knew.  That was the only Mexican family I knew at that time.  You go out there at night, everything is, you know, Hispanic, but right down on the corner, and we grew up with that family.  But I can't remember--I was thinking when you asked me that question, any household where there were children that you didn't have both parents--not that I can remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who, who were some of your friends and, and do you, who--well, who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Well, I had different kinds of friends.  I have some that grew up there that I don't, I haven't kept in contact with.  They moved off the street.  I moved off the street, and we all went our separate ways.  I have some friends that I had in elementary school [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas] and high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] I see occasionally because we have class reunions.  And I've had a chance to see some of them.  And then, they're my college friends that I get a chance to see.  In fact, I'm getting ready to go back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for my fiftieth class reunion, so I've been--they sent us a list of who's coming, so I've been excited about those friends that are coming back for that reunion.  I think you, your friendships, your college friends tend to remain in your life more than others.
Story_ID: 608159
Speaker 1: Think of a, a sound, a sight, and a smell that will take you back to that time when you were in, in Houston [Texas] where you lived on that street.  What was the name of the--
Speaker 2: Gunter--
Speaker 1: Gunter Street--
Speaker 2: --G-U-N-T-E-R
Speaker 1: --on Gunter Street.  And I want you to ex- explain to me or describe more of, of the neighborhood [Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas].  You say everyone was black except for the Hispanic family.  Who were the people, and maybe if, even if you knew the occupations of some of your neighborhood friends' parents?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Let me talk about the sound first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Running not far from our house was a railroad track.  And the sound of that train when it would come through, I can still hear that train, and it would blow as it passed, so that's a sound I'll always remember--the sound of the train moving.  I guess trains have been a part of my life, even as my father's [Willie Bryant] occupation was on a train.  So, that's a sound that I can remember--every day that train came by without failure.  Southern Pacific [Southern Pacific Railroad] ran through my neighborhood.  That train track is not active today.  That's one they have closed down.  On my block, I can remember--well, one lady was another teacher, Ms. Morales [ph.].  She and my mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] were friends so I knew her.  Across with her was a minister, Church of God in Christ minister and he had some children--he and his wife.  Right across the street from me was a large family of children.  I guess Mrs. Edwards [ph.] must have had about six children, and her husband worked at one of the companies, one of the steel companies, either Brown and Root [Brown and Root Industrial Services, Houston, Texas]--I can't remember which one, but he was employed.  Mrs. Edwards didn't work 'cause she had a lot of children.  Then, across, next door to her was Ms. Georgia [ph.], her name was Georgia.  She was a maid in a school, worked for, until she retired in HISD [Houston Independent School District], one of the schools.  Next door to her was the Kyle [ph.] family, and I don't know, I, I've forgotten what they did, but there were two boys in that family.  I see them now--one owns a restaurant, and the other one helps his brother from time to time in that restaurant so, I, I seem them.  Down the street was another family, Joy [ph.], the Browns [ph.], and those children and I were good friends because they were around our age.  The older one was in my sister's [Barbara Bryant Solomon] class, and the younger one was, I think, a year before me, but we knew, and there were two boys in that family.  There were four kids in that family.  Ms. Beulah [ph.], and the grandmother lived there--Ms. Jackson [ph.], so she took care of everybody.  I don't remember what the father did.  He was employed--I remember that.  His name was George [George Jackson (ph.)], I can remember his name, and I guess I could go and on.  And there were some on the street who didn't have any children.  I can remember two couples with no children, but that was the street.  It wasn't that long, it was just a block or two.  It was one block, but it picked up across Waco [Street], you know, that was the block I lived at.  But it was a very quiet neighborhood.  We didn't have--I don't even remember any robberies, any shootings, anything like that.  That just didn't go on in our neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Would you consider this a--what economic level would it be?
Speaker 2: I guess, from lower middle class to poor, but you know, we didn't consider ourselves poor, even though now, they would be poor, but they weren't poor then.  We would never, I never heard the term, poor, growing up--for anybody.  We were all together.  We went to school together, you know, and so, I just didn't consider 'em poor.
Story_ID: 608160
Speaker 1: Now, you said the sound was the railroad [Southern Pacific Railroad]?
Speaker 2: The railroad.
Speaker 1: What about a smell?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  I can't remember any smells.  I can remember cake cooking and stuff like food.  And some pleasant memories--we had big dinners, and everybody on the street cooked a lot.  And so, I can remember the smells of those cakes baking.
Speaker 1: And what about a sight?
Speaker 2: (Coughs) Pardon me.  A sight--I think the--I used to love--there was in our area some wooded areas.  And I didn't live too far from a park called the Finnigan Park [Houston, Texas].  I loved to walk the Finnigan Park and just stroll along the lane, you know, and into the park, beautiful park at that time.  That was probably the sight I remember most.  Even though we lived in an area that had lots of houses and things, there were also some wooded areas.  Houston [Texas] is, is still like that, you know, there's plenty of vacant land around here.
Story_ID: 608161
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about the sound of the railroad [Southern Pacific Railroad], and that your father worked for the railroad.  Did he share any stories about what went on, on the railroad (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father was always telling stories.  I can't remember too many of them now, but he was, that's why he loved to talk.  My father was a big talker and all of his friends, and I can remember some of them.  He would--everybody knew Chip [Willie Bryant] because he had a story to tell when you saw him.  He used to tease me, you know, when I was in college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] (laughter), my friends and I, we would go out, and he'd--we would come in very, very late.  He say, you know, "You're going to come in when that newspaper is going to hit you.  The man's going to be throwing the newspaper while you're coming in," (laughter).  He loved to tease me, too, but he was a good father--he was.

Speaker 1: When you were a child, when you think back on that time, you, you talked about loving to climb trees, what were some of the other activities that you were involved in, say, in your elementary school years [at Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I started out being involved in elementary school.  I started out with the scouts.  I was a Girl Scout all the way through senior high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].  In fact, you know, when we started with the scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], it was segregated, too.  I grew up in the South--now everything was segregated.  As I went to the first Nati- I was the first black from the City of Houston [Texas] to attend the National Girl Scout Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio.  That was in high school, but I had been with the scouts, first as a Brownie, and then as a Girl Scout.  I used to love to try to sing--not--didn't have the voice that some have but, you know, little elementary school choirs, you can sing in.  I didn't sing in high school choir.

Speaker 1: I went to a school called Bruce Elementary School [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas].  It was walking di--well, everything was walking distance.  It wasn't that close, but it was walking.  And then, when I left Bruce, I went to E.O. Smith Middle School [Houston, Texas], and it was my--no, let me go back--I went to E.O. Smith junior high, and the school was so crowded, it was Wheatley.  Let me back up one more time.  It was Wheatley High School which was junior and senior.  They were building a new Wheatley High School, but they hadn't completed it the year I went there.  So, seventh grade was so crowded, they had--we had low and high at that time.  The low had to go in the morning, and the high in the afternoon 'cause all the kids wouldn't fit in the school.  One day I was eighth grade when they split, and the new Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas] opened.  They renamed the middle school E.O. Smith, who had been the principal at Wheatley at one time.  I was the first group, eighth grade, first group to graduate from E.O. Smith 'cause I was eighth grade when they split.  Then I went to Wheatley--we used to call it the new Wheatley--and then I went to Wheatley High School.  And Wheatley High School was brand new and it's in Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas].  Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School] was another high school in Third Ward [Houston, Texas] and so that, those were the two rivals--Yates and Wheatley, two black high schools.  There was a third, Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington, Houston, Texas], but it wasn't as much a rival as those two.  My family moved to Third Ward when I was in high school.  There was no way I was going to go to Yates High School, no way was I going to go to Yates High School, so I rode across town to go to high school.  My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson], fortunately, taught in the Fifth Ward area, so I got a ride in the morning, but I was so involved in activities in the evening.  I was in the--we had clubs, and then I was in the little march, I thought I could really march, you know.  I had to stay to practice, and just one thing, and then another.  And so, I had to ride the bus home in the evening.  That was fine, across town.  Another one of my neighbors did the same thing, so I had company riding back home in the evening.  So, I can recall very well standing on the corner.  I graduated from high school in 1954.

Speaker 1: Now, tell me, once again, the name of your elementary school.
Speaker 2: My elementary school was Bruce Elementary [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that you remember that might have influenced you?
Speaker 2: I can remember some of my elementary teachers.  My first grade teacher, and she was first grade teacher for a lot of people in the city, was Ms. Lefond, L-E-F-O-N-D.  And she was a sweet, kind lady, but she gave you a good start.  You learned to read and begin to, you know, do your math and all of that, even as for, we didn't have kindergarten in public schools when I came along, so we started at first grade.  And Ms. Helen Lefond [ph.] was my first grade teacher, very kind and gentle soul.  My second grade teacher was not as kind, and her name was Ms. R.R. Brown [ph.].  Now, why do I remember Ms. R.R. Brown?  Because when you got in trouble, you had to write her name a hundred times--Ms. R.R. Brown, Ms. R.R. Brown, so I learned (laughter) Ms. R.R. Brown's name.  She was a good teacher, but she was a disciplinarian.  I mean, you couldn't get out of, you know, nothing.  I remember most of my teachers.  My third grade teacher, who was Mrs. Hughes [ph.], and then, my fourth grade teacher was Ms. Jeffries [ph.], and my fifth grade teacher was Ruby Thompson [Ruby Lockhart Thompson].  She was really the principal of the school.  She wore these keys on--she had a key to everything in the school.  Now, she was not the principal.  We had our principal, but you would have thought Ms. Thompson was the principal because she was in charge of everything.  And they have since named the school after her--Ruby Thompson Elementary [Ruby L. Thompson Elementary School, Houston, Texas].  There were several people in my elementary school.  The principal was Mr. Chatham [Robert C. Chatham], and before him, during--when I first started there, it was J.C. Sanderson [James Charles Sanderson].  They have named the school after both of them, J.C. Sanderson Elementary [James Charles Sanderson Elementary School, Houston, Texas], Chatham Elementary [Robert C. Chatham Elementary School, Houston, Texas].  And then, they have one for my sixth grade--it was sixth grade then, but had all the keys.  And every time I see the name of that school, I think about her.  She was--and she was from a prominent family here in Houston [Texas], the Lockharts, and they belonged to my church, and that's why I knew her a little bit, too.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, made A's, Bs, a few Bs here and there, but I was an excellent student all the way through high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what type of child were you?  Were you mischievous?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Were you quiet (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was a nice kid--no, not quiet, I've always been a talker.  Even in elementary school, I would have to, the teacher would have to get me quiet because I liked to talk.  And some of my friends, we would talk, talk, talk, and it wasn't recess to talk, talk, talk.
Story_ID: 608165
Speaker 1: What were some of the other activities that you enjoyed?  Did you like to read?  Were you involved in music or dance?
Speaker 2: I was involved in music, not in the school, but I took music from, oh, early, early, and I'm probably four years old.  I started taking music from Ms. P.O. Smith.  And so, I went to music.  I didn't take the--I was not in the dance, but the music I was in all of my young life.
Speaker 1: Was it piano lessons?
Speaker 2: Piano, um-hm.  I tried to sing in the choir in the elementary school [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas].  But the other thing I did in elementary school was to--we had a few, you know, I told you I was very active in the Brownies.  That was elementary level.  We had other clubs in the school.  I've always been, and one I can remember was the history club.  I've always been in the hi- you know, that was my major in college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  That's why I'm always looking at history stuff, but I was in the history club in elementary school.  I can remember that in fifth grade, my fifth and sixth grade.  And we took a lot field trips in Houston [Texas], you know, there are some at the elementary level.  There are--we went to the sym- had to go to the symphony.  Every year, they took the kids to the symphony.  Sometimes we'd go to the opera.  There are other monuments around Houston that they took us to--San Jacinto Battleground [La Porte, Texas] is a monument, you know, that's the little bit history of Texas.  That's where Texas won its independence, San Jacinto, and they have a real tall monument out there.  We'd park--and it's in a park.  We would take trips out of town as well.  I can remember our elementary school kids going to the state capitol in Austin [Texas State Capitol, Austin, Texas].  I remember going at seven, telling you we loved to go to, you know, San Antonio [Texas] had this big park, Brackenridge Park.  Everybody in the state would love to go San Antonio to Brackenridge Park.  So, we did a lot of fun things in elementary school, and a lot of trips and a lot of, you know, it was a good school.
Speaker 1: You began school in about 1941?
Speaker 2: When I was--what year was that?
Speaker 1: Were you six years old?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That would have been 1941.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this was war time [World War II, WWII] as well.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember about that?  Do you, can you remember some other things about that time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  I can remember during the war time, you know, they sold these bonds.  I can remember, we would take twenty-five cents a week or something, and you add a stamp to your book and when you got so much, you could take it in and get a war bond.  I can remember that.  I can remember the war time and all from the rad- .  We didn't have television--it was radio.  And I can remember the sitting up listening to the radio but, yes, I remember at that time, Houston was okay.  It, I, I don't think there was anything unusual in Houston at that time.  As now, Houston sort of stays ahead of the nation in terms of its economy and stuff.  And then, it was the same then, I think, I'm not so sure.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite programs to listen to on the radio?
Speaker 2: 'The Lone Ranger' (laughter). I used to listen to 'The Lone Ranger.'  I remember him 'cause and I can't remember the others, but that was what I listened to that all the time.
Speaker 1: And your family had a radio at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you also spoke about the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America] or the Brownies.  Where was your troop and do you remember your troop leader's name?
Speaker 2: It was at school, it was a school troop, and who was the--no, I don't remember the Brownie name.  I think Ms. Hughes [ph.] was the troop leader at elementary.
Story_ID: 608166
Speaker 1: You talked about the middle school, the junior high school, and eventually, you wind up at E.O., E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Middle School, Houston, Texas], is that the elementary school?
Speaker 2: It's a middle.
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sorry, the middle school or junior high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the transition from--now, was this school also in your neighborhood [Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a neighborhood school.  It wasn't that close though.  We had to walk, you know, we didn't have bus transportation to go to school at that time, so we walked to school, and it was a good distance to E.O. Smith.  We walked on--and that railroad track I mentioned passing by my house, we walked down that track to Lyons Avenue, and then over to the school.  It was a good walk though, but we walked it every day, every morning, and every evening.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your middle school days.
Speaker 2: My middle school days were happy days.  I guess all of my days had been pretty happy, huh?  Good teachers, caring teachers, but strict.  The difference, you know, they were much stricter than those I had had in elementary.  Some would call them mean, but the mean teachers taught you more.  And I guess that's when you're mean, when you have discipline and rigid, you know, in terms of instruction.  And it may be there that I got the first sense of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], too, because I had two teachers in that school, who were friends to my aunt that were also AKAs.  So, I knew a little bit about them belonging to something that my aunt was a part of.  Vera Caldwell [ph.] was the English teacher, excellent English teacher, but a very stern teacher.  And Miss Ayers [ph.] was the other English teacher I had there.  Math, boy, was it tough (laughter).  Algebra, because they started you in algebra early, and, but they were, they were tougher, but they were kind.  I was also involved in--that's when I learned to speak.  I had this teacher who taught speech and drama, and I was in the dramatics club, I could remember the plays that we had.  And, you know, the parents would come to see our production for the year and so, that's when I really started speaking and became a part of the drama group.
Speaker 1: What were some of your plays?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember then.  I can remember the people who were in because this little fellow, I see a grown man now.  He reminds me--, "Do you remember the play we were in at E.O. Smith?  I don't know the names," (laughter).  But Mrs. Heel was the coach, was the sponsor of that group.  Ms. Emma K. Heel [ph.], I remember her very well 'cause we were with her all the time.
Story_ID: 608167
Speaker 1: What were your, your desires or, or dreams about what you would become at this time, even in your elementary days [at Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas], you know, because when we, we start out, we say we're going to be this, and then it changes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  I thought I was going to be a lawyer.  I started out, I was going to be a lawyer--this, I wanted to be a lawyer.  It wasn't until college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] that I decided I didn't want to be a lawyer, but during elementary and middle, that's where I was.
Speaker 1: And do you know why you wanted to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Let me tell you.  When, after I grad- well, I had seen, I knew some, and I had seen some, and what they did, that intrigued me, you know, I can do that.  And they spoke and what, you know, and maybe we got a chance to visit a courtroom or something, and I saw the lawyers in action.  But I just knew I wanted to be a lawyer and televi- I mean, by that time, television is coming in, and you begin to see 'Perry Mason' and some other things on TV so.
Speaker 1: And you're still taking piano lessons at this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, I had to.  My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] wasn't going to let me stop taking piano, even though I hated it, but I was still taking pi- and my sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] could play beautifully.  I mean, she still plays.  I learned to read it better than to play it.
Story_ID: 608168
Speaker 1: And how was the transition from elementary school [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas] to junior high school?  Was it a still, was it still a nurturing environment?
Speaker 2: It was nurturing, but not as elementary school.  And when you change from one teacher all day to five or six teachers per day, then there's a vast difference.  You don't have that same teacher connection.  And for the first time, I guess, in elementary school, I had all female teachers.  And in middle school, I began to pick up some male teachers.
Speaker 1: And all of your teachers were black?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that level, right.
Speaker 1: So, you go on to the new Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas]?  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, let's see, what year would we be in, for junior high school, probably 1947 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You should be about--
Speaker 1: --nineteen forty-eight [1948], going into high school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I went into high school in 1951.  Is that right?  I graduated in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so 1951, you went into high school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to new Wheatley?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: This is a new facility?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me about the experience there.
Speaker 2: I had a wonderful high school experience.  First place, coming into that high school were kids from multiple middle and junior high schools.  Where we had been at E.O. Smith [E.O. Smith Middle School, Houston, Texas], there was a group coming into Wheatley from other schools as well, so you got a new group to mix with.  But I did a lot of things at Wheatley.  I was a good student, honor roll student, made National Honor Society.  I took Latin and belonged to the Latin club.  I wanted--all of my life, I was plump, and several called it fat, not really fat, but plump, but I was determined I was going to march in the marching group.  So, I lost weight, and I marched out for--and my last year, I was the leader of the squadron.  We, we marched at every football game and in parades, and things like that.  It was there that I also continued being a part of the Girl Scouts [Girl Scouts of the United States of America], and that I told you about that experience I had going to the national conference in Cincinnati [Ohio].  I was a student at Wheatley at that time. Wheatley also--we had a principal that was just, he had--going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and graduated, then he got his master's [degree] and Ph.D. at Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  One thing he taught everybody in that school, "You're very, very special, you can be whatever you want to be, and he pushed for you to succeed."  Dr. John Codwell [John E. Codwell, Sr.] was his name, so we got a chance to do a lot because he was determined that there would not be anything that any other kid in the City of Houston [Texas] got that we didn't get.  And so, he demanded a lot from the school board and, of course, during that time, it was very few Ph.D. blacks from Michigan, in Houston, being principal of a school, and a Howard grad at that.  So, I was elect--there was, at the end of the year during your senior year, they always have what they call Girl of the Year, so I was the Girl of the Year at Wheatley.  And that's the--I think it was Zeta Phi Beta Sorority [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.] that sponsored.  That was one of their national projects.  And they had this big assembly program, and they give you all these, all the clubs, and folks give you gifts.  It was a magnificent thing, so that was my accomplishment in high school.
Speaker 1: What did you have to do to be elected to or, or selected for--
Speaker 2: I think the teachers did, based on your involvement, and extracurricular activities, your academic standing, you know, they looked at all of that.  And when I graduated from Wheatley, I was number two in my class.  And I was hurt because the girl that was number one had transferred to our school, and was only there a year, but it was okay.
Story_ID: 608169
Speaker 1: You talked about the fact that your family had moved from, from one neighborhood [Fifth Ward, Houston, Texas] to another--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so now you're living in a different neighborhood.  Tell me--
Speaker 2: I live in the Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] neighborhood, but I go to Wheatley [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But tell me (laughter), well, tell me about the neighborhood, the, the new neighborhood that you lived in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Why did you, why did your family move to that area?
Speaker 2: Typical middle class move where you buy a bit of home in a new area that's just beginning to turn black.  It was a predominantly Jewish area in Houston [Texas].  It was Riverside [Riverside Terrace], in that area, and my parents [Malinda Bryant Stinson and Willie Bryant] moved to that area looking for better, you know, conditions.  And that's when we moved to Third Ward [Houston, Texas]--well, it's Riverside is what it's called.  It wasn't exactly Third Ward, but it was Yates' territory (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, your neighbors all went to Yates--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --your, yeah, the neighbor, the children?
Speaker 2: --except the one that had come from Fifth Ward before, everybody went to Yates, right.
Speaker 1: And do you want to talk more about the rivalry between Yates and Wheatley?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When we were in high school, we played each other in sports.  And Wheatley and Yates played every Thanksgiving.  It was just like a college or a Super Bowl in high school football, and there would be thousands of folks at the game.  And if you lost that game, you just cried, oh, goodness, that was the hurt for you to lose to Yates.  But it was, it's a highlight during that time.  Those were some of the things we had during, you know, when schools were really all black.  You created and you had opportunities.  As you begin to integrate, you lost some of that.  That was a given in Houston that every Thanksgiving, everybody from Third Ward and Fifth Ward were going to be at the stadium for the football game.  And each school presented Miss Yates and Miss Wheatley and, you know, they did that, and they crowned them during that game.  And it was fun while (unclear), you know, it was okay.  Now, I always, not only lived in Third Ward near Yates, but I went to church [Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church] in Third Ward with all the Yates people, so I knew as many people at Yates as I knew at Wheatley.
Story_ID: 608170
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, your church experience.
Speaker 2: Oh, would you believe I've been a member of Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church [Houston, Texas], Wesley A.M.E. Church, all of my life--one church.  My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] belonged to that church.  When she was growing up, she grew up in Third Ward [Houston, Texas] because my Consara [ph.] that reared her lived in Third Ward.  When she married [Bryant's father, Willie Bryant], she moved to Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas], so she knew a lot of folks in Third, and we always went to that church, too, as long as she was in Houston.  But Wesley has what, it was a large, it was the largest A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church in the State of Texas, and I guess it still is.  But during my time there, we have had only four ministers and, you know, they move you in the A.M.E. church.  The first one was Reverend Clements [ph.], and everybody loved him to death.  Then we had Reverend W.D. Williams and we just, by Reverend Coach [ph.], just retired after thirty some years as the minister.  And now, we have Reverend Griffin [Leo Griffin], but it's a spirited church, a lot going on.  I've had a lot of opportunities through my church, too, to speak.  I went to all the youth--each year, they have a Youth conference at Paul Quinn College in Waco [Texas].  I'm, you know, I went to that, I went to all the youth conferences, so I've been really involved--sang in the youth choir, real involved in church, would like to be more.  My minister just thinks I'm awful because I'm so busy.  When I do have time, I'm a substitute teacher for our bible study class.  I do go to bible study every Wednesday, but I've been on the road.  If you, if you're leaving every Wednesday, you can't get to church, but I try to get there on Sundays and, but the church has been a very, very important part of--I'm a part of the Missionary Society [Women's Missionary Society] at my church.  I try to help them out in their projects.
Story_ID: 608171
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas], can you remember a teacher or counselor that might have might have influenced you?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  I had several.  Wilma Smith [ph.] was my Latin teacher and she probably influenced me a lot, but I had several.  It wasn't just one.  There was Ms. Parrish who taught math that was very, very good.  Now, there was another, and she was a soror, who taught math--brilliant woman, but wasn't a good teacher (laughter).  She knew it all but, you know, she, Ella Walls [ph.].  I remember reading about her, and I didn't know that until I read she was the first Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], foreign travel grant, winning--you know, this (unclear), and they gave foreign travel to people to study abroad.  And she was the first to receive that award.  I found that out reading a history book, but Ella Walls, very nice lady.  She was also superintendent of my Sunday school [at Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church, Houston, Texas] for years and years and years, but she was a nice lady.  But for teaching, those two were very, very good, Eda Parrish [ph.] and Wilma Smith.
Speaker 1: And, and--
Speaker 2: But I guess my principal [John E. Codwell, Sr.] impressed us--me most because he was so involved and so concerned and motivating folks to do.
Story_ID: 608172
Speaker 1: It was a given that you would go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did you decide, and when did you decide where you would go?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] was in college at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  She had gone to college four years before I did, and she went to Howard.  So, she would come home, and I would see all these Howard stickers and AK- [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], she was an, she's an AK [AKA], and so that influenced me, but what I did was to influence my other classmates to go with me.  I have a good friend, even today, we went all the way from elementary school [Blanche Kelso Bruce Elementary School, Houston, Texas] into high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].  And her name is Eva Carol Hanner, used to be Dawson [Eva Dawson Hanner (ph.)].  Her father was a principal in Houston [Texas], and her mother was a teacher, and all of that.  And her mother and father and all of them had gone to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]--the whole family--cousins, nieces, everybody.  She went to Howard with me.  And her family, they can't understand why she went to Howard and not Fisk, but Eva Carol, that--we had, at that time, Howard was getting a lot of kids out of our high schools.  There must--and there are a lot of kids there now from Houston, but I'm sure we would ride the train to school.  See, we weren't flying yet, and we would have just about a whole car of folks from Houston going to Howard.  We would catch the Texas Eagle in Houston and it stopped in East Texas, Marshall, and they would pick up folks going to Howard.  And by the time we got to St. Louis [Missouri] where we had to change, we had a whole car.  Nobody was in there but us.  Then, we would catch the B and O [Baltimore and Ohio Railroad] in St. Louis to Howard University.  Now, that was when I entered Howard.  By the time I left, we were flying.
Story_ID: 608173
Speaker 1: Before we go on to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], tell me, did you go to the prom?
Speaker 2: Sure, of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about your prom.
Speaker 2: Oh, my prom was very nice.  We had a lot of partying--not only the prom--we had a lot of social affairs.  I remember--and I had some pictures.  Sometimes I run across them--my date from the prom, oh, I was in love in high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] by the time I got to be a senior.  Joe Ray Smith [ph.] was his name, and that was my date for the prom and the prom was beautiful.  We, we always had lovely social affairs.  We had dances at school, you know, at other times, Valentine dance, and other things so.
Speaker 1: And at the dances--
Speaker 2: I was socially active in high school.
Speaker 1: Well, at the dances, what music were you listen to as a teenager?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, the Clovers, you know, the groups was going strong, and some of them are still around.  Some of those I was listening to, but I remember particularly you had Ray Charles.  He was starting, you know.  You had Sam Cooke.  You had some of those that are still, they're still playing some of their records.  We had a--across from our school in the back, was a park, Finnigan Park [Houston, Texas], and they had dances weekly, called them canteens.  Now, at first, I couldn't go to the canteen, but we would love to go.  And then, there were other little clubs you could slip into (laughter), all the things, you know, you do as teenagers, but it was fun.
Speaker 1: Were you a part of a debutante ball?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was presented in Houston [Texas], the Smart Set [National Smart Set] presents debutantes in Houston.  And I was a debutante in what--'55 [1955]?  I think '55 [1955].

Speaker 2: And I've been very active in The Links [The Links, Incorporated].
Speaker 1: Okay, also, The Links, okay.  And, ma'am, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is February 5, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time, you're at Houston, Texas in my home at 2111 Welch [Street], A328.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, we're finishing up an interview that we started a few years ago, right? And--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 608175
Speaker 1: When we left off last time, we had you on a train with some of your friends that you talked into going to Howard, too, on your way to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: This is 1954.
Speaker 2: It was called the Texas Eagle (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we stopped in St. Louis [Missouri], and changed to B and O [Baltimore and Ohio Railroad].  These railroads don't even--I don't think they even run anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, did you, was there anything remarkable about the train trip that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the train stopped all across--they had various stops and so that we met friends from other places in Texas and Missouri.  And all the way from Houston [Texas] to Howard, we--people would get on the train, and they were going to Howard, too.  And so, we really would end up with the whole coach of Howardites.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And these are friends we met during that time and we're still friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, with the, was segregation enforced on the trains in those days?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did that affect your trip?
Speaker 2: It didn't because we had a whole coach and it was ours (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you all just had a good time.
Speaker 2: We just had a good time going, right.  And my father [Willie Bryant]--I was on the train.  They were beginning to fly at that time, but my father worked for the railroad [Southern Pacific Railroad].  And so, I could get a free, a free ride and, you know, we had to save every dime we could to pay that tuition at Howard.
Story_ID: 608176
Speaker 1: What were your first impressions of Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?  This is 1954, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I had been on the campus before because, as I told you, I had a sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] who graduated from Howard, just before I went to Howard, and I had been on the campus for her graduation.  But I was--I guess in awe coming from Houston [Texas], and going to Washington, D.C., you're really in two different worlds.  Houston is a big city, but not quite as fast as Washington.  And so, I had to get used to, first, living in the dormitory.  We had a very strict lady, who was over the dormitory, and she made sure you had to learn the city before you could leave the campus alone.  And they gave you an exam to make sure you knew the city a little bit.  And so, as I learned more about Howard and the city as a whole.  It was very exciting.  I can remember even my first year there, you know, it doesn't snow in Houston.  I saw my first big snow during my first year at Howard that fall.  And, and I was so excited, I, I ran to the window and I yelled, "It's snowing, it's snowing."  That was so exciting to me because we don't, we don't get snow here, but I loved Howard.  I loved the campus and just walking, and I've been back, you know, since I left, and I still love walking across the campus.  It brings really a good feeling.  I had a good experience at Howard University--
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: --for four years.
Speaker 1: Now, your major was education?
Speaker 2: No, believe it or not, my major was political science with a minor in education--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I was going to go to law school. That was going--I was headed for law school.
Story_ID: 608177
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that you remember that, that were influential and important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, there were several.  There was one teacher, Dr. Lorraine Williams [Lorraine A. Williams]--she was in the social science division and she really inspired me.  In fact, she was one of my mentors.  And then, there was Dr. Dorsey [Emmett E. Dorsey] who headed that department, who I thought was the smartest man in the world.  He could be giving a lecture and walk out the door to speak to somebody, and walk back in, and start on the next word that he left off on (laughter), but he was very good.  Those were two I remember in particular.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was full of all these giants in those days--James Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.], and Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown], and Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb] and all--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Franklin Frazier [E. Franklin Frazier] (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you aware of, as a--I mean, coming up there, were you aware of the significance of some of these people?
Speaker 2: No, I learned it there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know before I got there, except Nabrit.  I knew him because of--he had been here in Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about him.  Now, you had mentioned off camera that he was a lawyer for--
Speaker 2: For that Sweatt case?
Speaker 1: Yes, Sweatt v. Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950], yeah.
Speaker 2: And, right.  And he was also very close to the man who--Wesley [Carter Walker Wesley], who ran the forward--well, the newspaper [The Houston Informer] at that time.  And, you know, he had a brother who came to Houston [Samuel M. Nabrit] and so, he was back and forth to Houston as president of Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  His brother--and so we've been able to keep up with him through the years, but I knew him.  He became president a little bit later.  When I went to Howard, Mordecai Johnson was still there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, he stayed there forever.  And probably out of all of the presidents who served, you remember his name probably most--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Mordecai Johnson.  And I can recall his sermons in the chapel.  Once a year you had to hear Mordecai, and, of course, the other thing that you got at Howard, people who came to that campus, who were not working on the campus, but they came, visiting, speaking.  And I remember my first time seeing Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] was--and I (laughter), it was really funny.  He, he was speaking in the chapel.  And everybody who knew Mordecai Johnson knows that he, in a speech, he went on and on and on.  And he was introducing Adam Clayton Powell, and he went on and on and on.  And Adam Clayton Powell got up and said, "Thank you very much, but the speech has been made," (laughter) and sat down (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he eventually do his speech or did he--
Speaker 2: No, he--thank you very much, Dr. Johnson, but you've made the speech (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, he would like to--I heard from others that he would show up in classes sometimes and lecture.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Yeah, he would.
Speaker 1: The implication was that he knew everything and (laughter).
Speaker 2: And, you know, he lost--his first wife died--well, this is after he left Howard.  And he married a lady from Texas that I knew very well.  I don't know whether her son used to be president of Huston Tillotson [Huston Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].  And they had been childhood sweethearts and so, they ended up marrying each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But Howard was a great place--it still is.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Now, was, was Ho- Howard Thurman still there when you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608178
Speaker 1: What about students?  I was looking online.  I think, and I'm not sure, that maybe Vantile Whitfield, and LeRoi Jones [Amiri Baraka] were there with you [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Vantile stayed there forever.  He went from--I bet a lot of classes went through and knew him.  Roberta Flack, you know that she was there.  In fact, she was the class just ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, Roberta Flack, now, I heard that she was kind of shy in terms of singing her own music.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she did--everybody knew she, she was really good, but she's just as good with gospel as she is with jazz, and everything else, and opera, or whatever.  She's really--that Ph.D. in music is for real--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she's really a scholar in the area of music--all kinds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, was LeRoi Jones, did you know him when he was--
Speaker 2: I didn't know LeRoi Jones.
Speaker 1: I don't know if he finished or what happened, but he was there for a minute, I know he was there for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know him as well.  I knew Vantile.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Vantile Whitfield became the head of the D.C. Black Repertory Company--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and worked for the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA], you know, as a program director.  Anybody else?
Speaker 2: John Jacobs [sic. HistoryMaker John E. Jacob] that used to be the Urban League [National Urban League].  John is from Houston [Texas], too, but we were there at the same time.  He was in the class ahead of me.
Story_ID: 608179
Speaker 1: You got there in '54 [1954].  Now, this is when the Brown versus Board of Education decision [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] is, is, is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's the year I left high school [Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so, was there a atmosphere in the, you know, the Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] legal team, you know, really--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --yeah, you know, led by Thurgood Marshall and Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.] and them.  They really--
Speaker 2: I remember that decision.  I was still in Houston [Texas].  That's before I went to Howard when that decision came down.  It was the year, and I was going, I had moved from Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas] to Riverside area [Riverside Terrace, Houston, Texas].  And I was riding the bus home in the evenings because I had--I would ride to school in the morning.  My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] taught in that area, and but I was staying to practice and to this club and that.  And I remember the headlines in the paper coming through downtown, looking at the headlines in the paper, and everybody was talking about that decision.  And you know how they used to stand and selling the papers, "Read all about it."  I remember that very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did it--I mean, what was the conversation about it?  Do you remember people talking about it or the implications of it and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just that it had come down and--no, they weren't talking about the implications.  I don't think they really knew what was going to transpire--just that it, you know, it had happened, and it would impact everybody.  But, you know, southern states came up with ways to drag it out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: And so, it was probably another ten years before we really, in Houston, really felt the biggest impact of that suit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the phrase was, schools should desegregate with all--
Speaker 2: All deliberate speed.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so, they took their time.  That was deliberate speed (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, if you (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was deliberate speed, yes (laughter)--one year at a time.  That didn't work, and then they'd come up with another plan, and then another, and finally, it was all integrated.
Speaker 1: Now, schools were compelled to comply because of federal money being tied to their compliance, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So.
Speaker 2: But they gave them time to comply, like I say, ten years or more.
Story_ID: 608180
Speaker 1: So, back at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] now (cough), so political science, did, did you have, was there, okay, you talked about the department head and (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. Dorsey [Emmett E. Dorsey], um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: And Lorraine Williams [Lorraine A. Williams], she was in that area, too.
Speaker 1: What about Merze Tate?  Is she in--
Speaker 2: She was there, but she wasn't in the political science area, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and, you said the speakers would come in, you know, other than Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.], was there anybody that came through that you really remember the--
Speaker 2: Not that I remember very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1954.  Now, you became an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] at--
Speaker 2: In '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: In '55 [1955], okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, was your sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] already in AKA, too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Every time, I was following in her footsteps (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have been right for you to go there and become a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], I guess (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I don't think so.  And then, I had an aunt here in Houston [Texas], who was a charter member of the graduate chapter here [Alpha Kappa Omega], so I don't think so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, what was pledging like in 1955?
Speaker 2: Well, it was quite different from pledging right now.  Then, they, you know, they did all kinds of games.  And, and it wasn't really bad, but they did things to us that you wouldn't do right now--kept you up late and you had to perform and entertain them.  Now, I, unlike a lot of people who say they went through at Howard, they didn't hit you.  That, they could not do, but they tried everything else psychologically on you.
Speaker 1: Hm, so more psychologically?
Speaker 2: More psychological, yes.  You know, they would look for us, and they wanted you to run errands for them or something, and we would hide so they couldn't find us.  It was fun 'cause we loved to, you know, hide from them (laughter).  "Where've you been?"  "Oh, right here," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long a period of time did you have to pledge for?
Speaker 2: You were made a part of the Ivy Leaf Pledge Club, and then you stayed there maybe six months or a year, depending on the campus as you're on at that time.  We stayed--I was made an Ivy before I came home for the summer.  And then I was initiated in December, went back in September, October, November, December, so that's about six months (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --of active pledging.
Speaker 1: Okay, six months, all right.
Speaker 2: With the summer in between.
Story_ID: 608181
Speaker 1: Do you remember what kind of projects you worked on as a, as an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] in?
Speaker 2: As an AKA at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We did a lot of things.  We worked--there was a school right across the street, Banneker [Benjamin Banneker Junior High School; Benjamin Banneker Academic High School, Washington, D.C.].  And we did a lot of service projects with kids over at Banneker.  We did service projects on the campus itself.  We had tutoring sessions with students.  We served as hostesses when people would come to the campus to show them around the campus.  I think they still do that.  They have students who serve as hostesses and host on the campus.  We were always into something and we had to--what's that hospital, the mental hospital in Washington [D.C.]?  Anyway, we would--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we did a service project out there, so we were involved in a lot of service.  In fact, they started saying, from the day you pledged, this is ser- you know, we are a service organization.  And so, I guess that's still a part of me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --always doing something.
Story_ID: 608182
Speaker 1: In fact, I just got back with the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], I'm an A.M.E. church person, so I just got back from Dallas [Texas] (laughter)--
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: --still serving.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  So, organizational life is a part of what you, you know, you're very much in- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I've been a lot, I've been in, and that started at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I was on the student council.  They, they call it a Student League--I think they call it.  They didn't call it student council, but the women's league, I did a lot of participation with them.  In my academic area, I participated in the history club, you know, things like that, but I was really involved at Howard with the student council area and the women's league.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, what, what did the women's league do?
Speaker 1: Just like women's organizations today, we got women involved in campus activities.  Living in the dormitory, you tried to help people in the dormitory 'cause you know, we had women's dormitories then and so, we were involved with issues involving women on the campus.
Story_ID: 608183
Speaker 1: Now, the rules, rules on college campuses, especially on the black college campuses [HBCUs] in those days were very strict.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, unlike they are today and--
Speaker 2: You went to chapel.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: When we ate in the cafeteria, and you had to dress to go down to the cafeteria.  You couldn't go in looking any kind of way.  And you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, how did you have, was there a code for how you had to dress?
Speaker 2: Well, Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] has always had, at that time, there was a dean of woman that Luc- Lucy Slowe [Lucy Diggs Slowe], and that was their motto, you know, you are a Howard University woman and you dress a certain way, you act a certain way, you carry yourself a certain way because I think she left that legacy.
Speaker 1: What is her name again?
Speaker 2: Lucy Slowe.  She was also a founder of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 1: S-L-O- --
Speaker 2: W--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so--
Speaker 2: --E--I think she has an E on it, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But she was dean of women.  She was the first in that organization for deans of women national orga- [National Association of Deans of Women and Advisor of Girls in Colored Schools].  She was the first black in that organization.  And when I was national president, we got a chance to put a plaque in their national office honoring her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you ever break the rules when you were--
Speaker 2: No (laughter), wait a minute.  The only thing we would do, when it snows in Washington [D.C.], they may have to, you know, we wouldn't have class.  You didn't have to go to class, and it would be snow everywhere.  And we would make our way down to the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.].  We loved to go 'cause they had all of the entertainers coming, you know, all of these, these singing groups--the Clovers and the, you know, and Ray Charles, and all of them.  And we would sit in that movie all day because they'd have a show and then, they would have the movie, and then the show would come back, you know.  And we--I bet you, by the time we had seen the movie three times, we knew what was coming next and, you know, we would have to be quiet.  And people say, shh, yeah, we had a lot of fun at Howard, but it wasn't breaking the rules because class had been dismissed, you know, but we were just having fun.  The snow--we couldn't get to class, but we could get down that hill to the Howard Theatre (laughter).
Story_ID: 608184
Speaker 1: Now, what, what did you do over the summers when you came back to Houston [Texas] when you were in college?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had a lot of fun coming back home in the summertime.  We had a group here called the Howard club and they would end it every summer.  They planned a week of activities, and not only for us, the Howard kids at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], but others would come from all over the United States to join us.  We would have a picnic and a dance, a whole week of activities.  And we looked forward to that when we came home during the summers.  I would do very, you know, just ordinary summers.  One summer, I got a job at Methodist Hospital [Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas].  That was my first experience with a job, but summers were ordinary Houston summers.
Speaker 1: Very hot.
Speaker 2: Very hot--it still is (laughter), yeah, very, very hot.
Story_ID: 608185
Speaker 1: Did you, as a senior, did you have, like a senior paper to write in political science or--
Speaker 2: We did so many papers.
Speaker 1: Did you have any specific--I mean a capstone project or anything?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I don't remember that.  We were writing papers every, probably every other week, a different kind of paper.  No, I don't remember any papers that I wrote and we didn't--I know we didn't have to have one for graduation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now, what, did you take political science because you considered becoming a lawyer or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I've always been interested in political science.  I like politics.  You'll find me dabbling in it every now and then here, not in it myself, but supporting others, who are into politics on campaigns and all of that.  I've always had an interest.  My nephew teases me, say, "You look at the news all the time."  I say, "I have to see what's going on in the world," so I've always had an interest there though.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you like the news like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the fact that I wanted go to law school, too, was another reason I went into political science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], I see the United States was oriented--the president was Dwight Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, he was inaugurated while I was there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Eisenhower (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the first inauguration that I saw.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is for his second term, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, was there, what was the role of--I guess black people in the Eisenhower administration in those days?  Can you give us a kind of sense of what--
Speaker 2: I don't even remember who was in the Eisenhower administration.
Speaker 1: I don't think anybody was officially (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I, I can't think of anybody officially in his, and you get a chance--I'm trying to think who was the secretary of education.  Howard, you always got a chance to see a little bit of the federal government, especially the secretary of education because Howard, then and now, is still a part, probably the only university now that the, that the federal government funds.  And so, you always, they always invite to (unclear).  And I'm trying to think who was the secretary of education.  I'm sure they spoke on the campus at that time or either at a commencement, but so, we, we would see and, and, you know, keep up that way because Howard's budget always had to go before congressional committee and, you know, and all of that so.  And it still is a part of federal government for funding.  It doesn't cover all of it, but they do get funds through the [U.S.] Department of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I know that Richard Nixon [Richard Milhous Nixon] was vice president then with Eisenhower, and he used that as a springboard to run in '60 [1960] for president.  But who, on the national scene, would, did, would you consider in those days as looking out for the interest of the black people?
Speaker 2: None (laughter), not particularly.  There, there are none that really ring the bell with me as they were out there fighting for black people, not with the federal government.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or, if so, I was not really tuned into it.  I won't say that somebody was not out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They--I heard people say that Humphrey had a favorable--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, but he wasn't, was he--he wasn't there with Eisenhower though?
Speaker 1: No, he was a senator from Minnesota (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a senator there.  Now, Humphrey, I remember him, from when I was supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], because he died during that time.  And I was in Washington [D.C.] and got a chance to go up to the [U.S.] Capitol Rotunda and all of that.  We were in Washington kicking off our seventy-fifth anniversary that January.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I remember him later--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Hubert Humphrey.
Speaker 1: I was just talking about on the national scene for anybody--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a senator, a congressman, anybody really that you thought of as being a, you know?
Speaker 2: I can't even remember during the earlier years?
Speaker 1: We had no black Con- well, we had one, we had a couple, we had Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.] and William Dawson [William L. Dawson] would have been in when you were in school, right?
Speaker 2: I remember them vag- I remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From Chicago [Illinois], those.
Speaker 2: Right, those from Chicago, right.
Speaker 1: Those two, those are the only two in [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 2: But we're in Congress at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember Adam Clayton Powell and his tenure in Congress and, and Dawson, too.  I remember both of those, but I wasn't really tuned in to what they were doing as much because we were still struggling with the segregationists we were electing down here (laughter).
Story_ID: 608186
Speaker 1: So, we were just talking about, you know, the black presence.  Now, now were you aware of Clarence Mitchell [Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.] then, Clarence Mitchell, the--you know?
Speaker 2: Not that much.  I know the name.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, I just wondered, you know, did they, now, what did--did the courses focus on--I mean, did they--was the emphasis in the political science department on how African Americans figured in national politics at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, but not, in the political science area, you covered it all--federal government, state govern- I mean you covered the spectrum, but it didn't focus just on blacks.  It was more of a broad curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Government--you not only, and then, you compared it to governments in other parts of the world.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite political science instructor or a favorite course?
Speaker 2: No.  I've always been interested--the favorite was American government.  You know, I wasn't that interested in what was going on in other 'cause we covered governments across the world, Russia and South America, and all of those governments, but I focused on, and my focus was always on American government.
Speaker 1: Now, this is--you're in school during the Cold War period.  And, in fact, just before you got to school, I guess Senator McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] had the, you know--
Speaker 2: Had the hearings and the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he got in trouble, and his whole case fell to the ground.  Now, he was, there was, you know, searching out, they were trying to find who was a Communist, who wasn't, and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Communist Party [Communist Party USA], yeah.
Speaker 1: So, did you have any feelings about that in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that he was definitely wrong and that I think some of the instructors at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] might have been targeted by him, too.  And I can't remember the whole thing about that, but because they were so outspoken, and it dealt more, his targeting, I think, wasn't with the political science department as much as the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  I think that's where he targeted his, you know, misinformation about people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a law school being the place where a lot of those--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] cases were generated in the first place, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: You see, when I first got to Howard, Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.] was the dean of the law school.  And so, and then there were others down there that worked with him, but that's where he started at Howard--in law school.
Story_ID: 608187
Speaker 1: Now, you minored in education, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, was the idea--I've heard a lot of pe- people we've interviewed saying that their parents told them, "You'd better get an education before you (unclear)," (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, so you can get a job if you need one.  Now, coming back to Texas, using that education, I still had to take some more courses, Texas history, Texas government, you, to teach in Texas, you have to get a certificate here.  I still had to take some more courses.
Speaker 1: It's also the idea I get in these interviews that women were expected to--if they didn't finish Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], it would be all right if they got them a man.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was that the attitude mostly (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No (laughter), not really--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were determined to get a degree in--
Speaker 2: Oh, no (unclear), listen, (unclear) from Houston [Texas], went to Howard, your parents say, "You get a degree.  If I'm going to spend my money sending you to Howard, you're going to leave there with something."
Speaker 1: So, if you'd brought a man back, that (laughter).
Speaker 2: That would have been okay, but you'd better bring a degree back.  That was the primary focus.  In four years, you, you couldn't stay there forever.  You must bring a degree home in four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you, now, when you finish now, is there anything special about finishing Howard?  I mean, did you get honors or anything when you graduated or did you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I finished with honors, but it was just a regular graduation.  I loved the commencement.  I remembered Mordecai Johnson's remarks at the commencement.  I still live by the, you know, that you're now an educator or not.  That means that you go back to your communities and you serve, and you serve well, and, you know, just because you have your degree, you've got to help others to move forward.  And I remember his sermon at that commencement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said you did graduate with honors?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, just for the record, what were your honors?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they have magna, summa honors, honors.  It wasn't summa, magna, it was just honors, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.
Speaker 2: What they call cum, I remember the Latin terms coming down, yeah.
Speaker 1: Cum laude? Was it cum laude then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, cum laude, that's it.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you had what, the magna, you had the summa, magna, and then you had cum.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 608188
Speaker 1: You were going back to Houston [Texas]. Now, were you still, when, at the time you graduate, were you still thinking about going to law school?
Speaker 2: Well, I was going to rest, rest a year.  I was tired, and I came to, back home, and that's when I got the job at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I was coming back that summer, this employee was going out on maternity leave.
Speaker 1: So this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I, they asked if I would take the job.  And so, I went to work immediately for the YWCA.
Speaker 1: So, you were the interim director?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Of the--
Speaker 2: Program--not the total Y, but just program director.
Speaker 1: Interim program director?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what's the Y called?  This was called the--is it the (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Blue Triangle Branch [Blue Triangle Branch, YWCA; Blue Triangle Multicultural Association, Inc., Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, a Blue Triangle, okay, Blue Triangle Branch of the--
Speaker 2: Young Women Christian Association.
Speaker 1: YWCA, and that's in the Houston's Third Ward?
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On McGowen [Street].
Speaker 1: I've heard people--we've interviewed some of the Y executives and people that work for the YWCAs, and we have heard that the YWCA really stressed, nationally, anyway, racial equality--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and service and--
Speaker 2: That is true.  In fact, they had their first conference here in Houston of women who were fighting for equality and women's rights.  And they have one every ten years, and the first one was here in Houston.  I remember that because we were hostess for that conference.  They had thousands of women who came here from around the United States, around the world.  And I can't remember the exact words of their theme, but that was in the national theme that all YWCAs promoted--equality.  There, they were focused on women's rights, you know, that was a period of time when that became very, very important.  And now it's not as 'cause it happened just automatically many times, not just automatically 'cause we're still going through some issues there, too.  But that was the beginning of that push for women's rights.
Speaker 1: Can you remember who the major presenters were at that conference?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, that was so long ago.
Speaker 1: And so, was it held at the main Y or the convention center?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, it was convention center.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was huge.  It was a world- worldwide conference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The next year, I think, the next ten years, they were in Mexico.  I attended the one in Kenya for the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] when I was supreme basileus.  They have it every ten years--those women.  Since I've been out there, they've had one in China.  And I don't know when the next one is scheduled, but they have that conference every ten years somewhere in the world.
Speaker 1: So, this is an international conference?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were lucky enough to be in Houston (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Be in Houston and a hostess for that conference.  I can remember I was stationed where, you know, when issues would come up and resolutions, and they had to count the votes.  I was one of the counters 'cause I (unclear), so I was inside that meeting, so that I could count the votes.  It was really exciting at that time.
Speaker 1: I don't know, I'm trying to think who might have been there.  Was Eleanor Roosevelt there by any chance?
Speaker 2: No.  She--that was past.  She--well, I think Barbara representing us was there, Barbara Jordan and others.  That was about how many years ago?
Speaker 1: That would have been 19- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About forty years, fifty years, almost fifty years ago.
Speaker 1: A long time ago, yeah, 1958--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a long time ago.
Speaker 1: --and so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  Probably it was in '59 [1959] or '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So, Barbara Jordan was representing the--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, she was probably.  She, she wasn't in [U.S.] Congress then, I don't think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but she was in the state legislature [Texas Senate], I think, when we did, or either I know she was prominent--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at that conference.  I don't know which, which of her positions she was in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Barbara has always been outspoken and, you know, I mean she was always.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, so Barbara Jordan was there.
Story_ID: 608189
Speaker 1: So you served would, would you say that's the highlight of the, of the, of, of that year with the Y [Blue Triangle Branch, YWCA; Blue Triangle Multicultural Association, Inc., Houston, Texas], the conference?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so, you were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Cause I wasn't there that long.
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so, and what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it gave me a feeling because we work with kids for after school and out, we had programs going out in the community at different sites.  So, it really gave me a feel for, again, looking at Houston [Texas], and some of the needs and some of the areas of Houston because I was working in what's now called the Sunnyside area.  And so, we got a chance to plan activities and work with other groups and activities in the area for women, as well as for children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is the Sunnyside area, is it a needy part of Houston or is it a--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.  It's black Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, and probably even more so then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, would that be the Third Ward [Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: It's past Third Ward.  If you know Houston a little bit, you go past Third Ward to get to Sunnyside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a suburb, it was growing at that time. And Houston moved that direction with blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause on the outskirts of the Third Ward going away from the Third Ward.
Speaker 2: At that time, it was really the outskirts past Third Ward.  Now, it's close, you know, how the roads that-then are now four ways, four lanes.
Story_ID: 608190
Speaker 1: In '59 [1959], you went over to Booker T. Washington High School [Houston, Texas]--
Speaker 2: In '59 [1959], I was hired in the Houston Independent School District.  I did my first semester as a substitute teacher.  And I remembered because it was the fall of the year, and everybody had the flu.  And they were asking you to go into--even though I'm a secondary person, you know, they asked us to go into some elementary schools 'cause they needed teachers.  And I, probably I remember, to this day I went to a second grade class.  Now, second grade never knew how to--my mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] was a elementary teacher--so I got ready to put something on the board and I was writing it, you know.  And the little kids said, "Teacher, teacher, we can't read writing," (laughter).  And I remember, I said, oh, wait--print, you know, little kids, print.
Speaker 1: So, you were writing in cursive, huh?
Speaker 2: And I was writing in cursive, "Teacher," and they didn't, and they never call you by your name.  It's teacher, these little kids, but they, and they want to hug you and all of that.  I said, "Oh, God, will I ever get out of this classroom," (laughter)? Because all of my experience was secondary.  And so, but that was a good experience for me.  But I started working in the district then, and I stayed there the rest of my--I taught at Booker T. Washington when I got on regular.  And I was there when they started the desegregation, and that's when I left when they had to integrate the faculties.
Story_ID: 608191
Speaker 1: Now, Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas], now I know people talk about the rivalry.  In fact, in the last interview, you talked about the rivalry between Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas] and Jack Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yates, yes, and Washington.  We had a rivalry there--
Speaker 1: But Washington, you kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but it wasn't--
Speaker 1: --not so much in Washington.
Speaker 2: Well, you see, Wheatley and Jack Yates played on Thanksgiving Day.  And there would be thousands of folks in the stadium, forty thousand came to see that, those high schools play.  For years, it was this, you know.
Speaker 1: I just get the feeling from--I heard you describe that on the last interview, the game and all that.  And I get the feeling, and you correct me if I'm wrong, that the Booker T. Washington wasn't considered a rival because it was considered maybe a lower status school?  Is that the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we didn't look at it the same way.  It wasn't lower status--it just wasn't Yates.  That rivalry on Thanksgiving Day, now we played--what is it--Armistice Day, I think we played Booker Washington.  We played both on the holiday type thing, but we would beat them easily.  It wasn't the kind of--I guess, though the two teams had met on Thanksgiving Day, it was serious business.
Speaker 1: Now, the Booker T. Washington was the oldest of the two schools, correct?
Speaker 2: It's the oldest, uh-huh.  It's still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was?
Speaker 2: Now they moved sites.  They used to be in Fourth Ward [Houston, Texas].  They, they built a new school before I started working out on Yale [Street].
Speaker 1: So, they had a new school then?
Speaker 2: At that time, when I started, it's not new anymore 'cause it's still there.  We worked, but they have all new schools now--Yates.  They're not in the same original buildings.  A new Wheat- they just, about two years ago, three years ago, built a new Wheatley.  It's on the same site facing another way, but it's a beautiful building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Booker T. Washington was the original black high school, but they had just built a new school when you started?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: 'Cause before, before, it was in Fourth Ward.  My mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] graduated from Booker T. Washington.  It was the only school in Houston [Texas] for blacks for years.
Story_ID: 608192
Speaker 1: What was the atmosphere like in Bo- Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] when you were teaching there?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was wonderful I loved--it--the school did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Pe-, Booker T. Washington, I'll always remember and appreciate.
Speaker 1: So, was it--
Speaker 2: A lot of kids I taught there, and I see them now.  They're adults now, but I still keep up with some of them.
Speaker 1: So, was it--I mean, was it achieving academically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --up with the standards of Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] and the others (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, oh, it was always academically.  It never went down.  Booker T. Washington had high academic standards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that was never a problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you taught, did you teach political science?
Speaker 2: At Booker T. Washington, I started out teaching--I taught Texas history.  I taught American history.  I taught government, and I taught economics.  In the curriculum in the social (unclear), in high school, you have to take American history, civics, and economics.  And at one time or another, I taught all three in high school.  The Texas history was my first semester when every--all kids in middle school have to take the Texas history.  And it was a combined school when I first went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a jun- it was really junior-senior high school.  Then they moved the junior high school, and it was just a senior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did Booker T. Washington celebrate Black History Month?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Black or Negro History Week, then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, all and they still do.  All of the schools in Houston [Texas], even the white ones now, try to do something at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, in terms of the curriculum, was it a struggle or was it a problem trying to teach black history in the curriculum of say, Texas history?
Speaker 2: No, well, Texas history, no, 'cause you got black history and Texas history, a lot of it, and we--you emphasize that kids still do the Texas history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered if the curriculum (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Listen, we got black cowboys--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--
Speaker 2: --in Texas.
Speaker 1: --were they infused into the curriculum?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean into the textbooks and that sort of thing for Texas history?
Speaker 2: Well, not at that time.  You had to do it as a teacher.  It wasn't in the text, but not all of it, but more of it's in there now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was getting at in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Texas has a lot of black history and black communities that are still going.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And we have probably here the Buffalo Soldier Museum [Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, Houston, Texas], which is really an outstanding museum here in Houston that's doing very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I might have to check it out.  I haven't (unclear) go to the museum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, check it out.  They built a new building, too. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were at Booker T. Washington High School for about ten years, you said, about--
Speaker 2: I think it was about ten.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I'm going to find the correct dates for you.
Speaker 1: So around-
Story_ID: 608193
Speaker 1: Around 1969, you became a counselor, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a counselor at another high school.
Speaker 2: Bellaire [Bellaire High School, Bellaire, Texas]
Speaker 1: Bellaire, okay.  Now, was, now this is part of the--was this due to the integration plan (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. I went to Bellaire when they did, what we call the crossover.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now this--
Speaker 2: Bellaire was just the opposite of Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] in student population.  It was predominantly white and heavy Jewish population--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and very few black students.  They began to transfer in.  They moved some in on transfer.  We had what was known as M to M, majority to minority transfers.  A minority to majority transfers for students and kids could transfer into a school where they were in the minority.  And so, you found kids beginning to transfer into Bellaire on those type of transfers.  But Bellaire and it was, and probably still is, the highest academic school in, in terms of kids passing National Merit [National Merit Scholarship Program], and it was a struggle.  They all wanted to get into the University of Texas, whether they qualified or not (laughter).  So, you found yourselves there with your group every--and we were alphabetized.  It was a large high school, too, writing a lot of college recommendations.  We had a big college night where all over the United States, the colleges would come for college night 'cause they wanted those students, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was a different population completely.  But what I found out, kids, whether they were on that side of town, or from Booker T. Washington, all of them had the same kind of problems that, as a counselor, you have to work through with them.
Speaker 1: Now, it would seem like some of the problems would be unique to the changes they're going through, (unclear) the racial change, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, true, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And you're at, you're, here you are a counselor at a time you're at the period of the most dramatic social change.  So, do you have any stories from that period?
Speaker 2: No, but what I found, kids accept each other very well.  They, they, we've had no problems with the kids accepting each other.  You had to work with minority kids to feel wanted in that setting, but you had to work with your other Jewish--what I found, their relationship to their parents sometimes was different, whereas all the black kids didn't know about the parents leaving for a month or two going to Europe, and the maid taking care of the kids.  And so, they have certain feelings.  But our black students, and to get, make sure they can participate in all of the things that's going on in that school, the clubs, the cheerleaders, you know, that you just don't recruit athletes.  And then, you got a minority team, and all-white cheerleader squad, those kinds of things you have to deal with.  I had, I had to do that, even as deputy superintendent over schools [Houston Independent School District] 'cause they would get all the way up there, where parents were complaining about the cheerleaders.  That becomes the most important thing in the school (laughter).
Speaker 1: And interesting how that might be the focus, but so did--were most of the black students from another neighborhood that came, they went to Bellaire (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, Third Ward [Houston, Texas] and Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: So there would be a bus in from Third and the Fifth Ward?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that probably made a little bit difficult to be involved in all activities 'cause they had to go back right on the bus.
Speaker 2: It did, um-hm, but sometimes, they would ride the city bus.  I mean, if they wanted to really, they, they would, and had enough, you know, funds, they'd ride the city bus back home in the evenings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about the parents at Bellaire?  Were they accepting with the white parents accepting with the integration of the school?
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Um-hm. Yes.  We didn't have--by the time we got to integrating the student population, they were accustomed and ready for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't have anything like Boston [Massachusetts] where parents tried to turn the bus over?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, oh, no, no, no, no.  And I think because, here again, Jewish parents are a little bit different from other whites.  They really understand, and many of them had been involved in desegregation efforts in the city because we had other desegregation efforts going at the same time--the lunchroom counters and the, you know, other institutions in the city.  They had to go through the same thing.
Story_ID: 608194
Speaker 1: Now, when did Houston [Texas] go through those kind of changes?  Was it, was that like, when you got back in '58 [1958], was Houston still basically segregated?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, public accommodations and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --restaurants and--
Speaker 2: Now, public accommodations probably started first with your chain hotels and things.  That was broken down, and we had a committee in the city and I, and I, I'd always will pay a tribute to that group who sat down--white, black, Jewish, and they decided we're not going to let happen in this city what has happened in other cities.  And, you know, the--we're going to make sure.  So, they sat down, and they integrated hotels and things with no problems because this group had decided that we're going to do this the right way.  Now, Houston had its problems, you know, we had the sit-ins, the marches, and all of that.  In fact, I just bought a book that my sister [Barbara Bryant Solomon] recommended by Eldrewey Stearns [Eldrewey Joseph Stearns] who was the militant that led the movement here.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Stern, Eldrewey Stearns.
Speaker 1: Stearn?  El--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I'll show you the book so you can get the title.
Speaker 1: L. Gruitt?
Speaker 2: Eldrewey--
Speaker 1: Eldrewey, okay.
Speaker 2: --Stearn.
Speaker 1: Eldrewey Stearn.
Speaker 2: I'll show you the book that he has written--they have written about his involvement.
Speaker 1: Now, is that a black person?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --in the Civil Rights Movement from Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, were they involved in CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] or anything, or SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], or any of those groups?
Speaker 2: It wasn't CORE.  It wasn't SNCC.  It was--
Speaker 1: NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] youth or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, it, it wasn't, and these were on the college campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure--it wasn't, it wasn't CORE.  I guess it would be--what's the other one that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was with?
Speaker 1: Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a large Operation PUSH group here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess we had some SNCC, too.  I'm not sure of the group, but I'm going to show you that book before you leave, so you'll see what I'm--you may want to read it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) depends on the time period is--I can't put it, so when did he start agitating for a change?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the exact time, but it was probably in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you got here, he hadn't really started cranking up yet but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, after I got here, I mean, all of this came after I came back to Houston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, early '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the '60s [1960s].  A lot of it was in the '60s [1960s]
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, early '60s [1960s] or middle '60s [1960s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Middle, all (unclear) the '60s [1960s]--I would say the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, Eldrewey Stearn.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I'm going to show you, so you get his name right--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --show you the book.
Story_ID: 608195
Speaker 1: You were a counselor at Bellaire [Bellaire High School, Bellaire, Texas].  Now, do you have a story, a counselor's story for me?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you remember something that happened that kind of stands out that kind of exemplifies the era?
Speaker 2: No, no (laughter), probably not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was, you know, I enjoyed working at school.  It was different from what I had worked in before.  They had more resources because the parents put it there.  And, but it was a good time.
Speaker 1: Can you think of the toughest problem you ever had there?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've had kids who wanted to commit suicide.  And I've had those kinds of problems that you had to deal with.  But they were the same, counseling problems at Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas] and Bellaire were the same.  Kids are kids.  They have the same kinds of problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608196
Speaker 1: I was just asking you off camera, but I'll ask you on camera about bad counselors.  I know we, we often hear from black students in all-white schools and mostly white schools.  They get bad counselors around a college or no counselors.  And so, did you hear any rumors of that or did you--
Speaker 2: I'm sure that at Bellaire High School [Bellaire, Texas], when I first went there, there was one black counselor and five white counselors, that they knew nothing about black colleges [HBCUs].  I tried to help them understand, first, where they were, by name, and began to get at them to come to our college day.  See, a lot of times, they don't know because they're not involved.  In the big college there, you got Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] and all these big schools.  And all of the state schools, UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas], SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas], and all of them to include the black colleges.  They knew about Texas Southern [Texas Southern University] because it's right here in Houston [Texas].  And they knew a little bit about Prairie View [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] because it's close.  But the others, they knew nothing about.  And I would say that that's still true in many of our schools that unless you put forth an effort, those of us that know the black colleges, to get them involved, and then the black colleges have to get involved.  You can't sit over there and say, "I'm not a part."  You got to say, "I'm coming, too."  And I think that's where, many times, they have been left out because they didn't exert themselves.  And nobody else, you know, if you don't push yourself, nobody else is going to push you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that is still true.  A lot of counselors don't know that much about black colleges.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, you think really that they--most of those counselors meant well.  They just hadn't been exposed to--
Speaker 2: Had not been exposed, did not know anything about, especially UNCF [United Negro College Fund] private colleges. They knew a little bit about the state schools in Texas.  But Paul Quinn [Paul Quinn College, Dallas, Texas], they didn't know anything about Paul Quinn, or Morris Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia], where is that, you know (laughter)?  No, they didn't know it.  And, and many of them still don't because they are coming through programs where--

Speaker 1: Billy Reagan, who was the superintendent of the schools [Houston Independent School District] around 1975--
Speaker 2: Billy Reagan stayed in Houston [Texas] twelve, more than twelve years, as superintendent.  He probably was the most, was well known, and is still, and the politician who knew how to survive and to get things done.  He's still around.  They've named a school after him in Houston [Billy Reagan K8 Educational Center], and he knew the black community.  He knew the Hispanic community.  He knew the white community.  He knew how to deal, deal with all of them.  And, right now, I tell somebody, he makes more funerals than I do (laughter).  Wherever somebody dies, he's right there--black, white, or Hispanic.  But he was an outgoing fellow.  He could walk in a room, and before he left, he had his--he was going around shaking hands with everybody in that room.  He knows more people probably in this city than most folks.  But he was a politician, so he could survive it all, plus he was innovative and creative, and that helped.
Story_ID: 608198
Speaker 1: Now, one of his [Billy Reagan] ideas was magnet schools.  And he put you on the team to develop magnet schools for the City of Houston [Texas].
Speaker 2: I was there at Bellaire [Bellaire High School, Bellaire, Texas] at that time as a counselor, and what I'd, what--how I got involved with that, at that time, which I did mention before, I was president of the Houston counselors association.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I--as that position, they needed a counselor representative on that team.  And that's how I'm sure I was selected for that team because of my involvement in the counselor, Houston counselors- I was their president, so I represented that group on that team.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This was around 1975 or so.  And, okay, so now, you did that until--I mean, you, so did you go to the board directly from Bellaire?
Speaker 2: To the magnet school team--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they put together.  I was the counselor representative on that team. From there, I went to central office.  I did not go back to Bellaire High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, basically, you stayed in the central office for the rest of your career.
Speaker 2: For the rest of my career.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, from '75 [1975], so you became the director of magnet schools--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Around what, '76 [1976] or so?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You did that until 1979 or so, I think.  So, now, how did you, tell us how you became director of magnet schools or what the--
Speaker 2: Well, on the team that put magnet schools together, we had super- district superintendents.  He pulled--I think out of the thing, he pulled two or three of them.  We had teachers.  We had all kinds of folks.  And I guess that when the team ended, and what we did first, we divided to sell--we had to sell the magnet school program to Houston.  So, we divided into two or three teams, and we went into the district offices.  And our goal was to make sure that all of the citizens in our district had the information.  And I did two of the dis- four, five, six, I did three of the districts at that time.  There were two of us that were assigned four, five, and six.  You have to meet with the principals, give them all of the information, and I did that.  Then, the following school year, kids were transferring in, so I sort of assisted in implementing that concept that we had put together.  And from there, I was appointed director (background noise).
Story_ID: 608199
Speaker 1: Now, what was the idea behind the magnet schools anyway?
Speaker 2: Our theme at that time was the finest education that money can't buy.  That was the theme.  That's how we sold it.  We believe that if you create programs of interest to students that they will achieve.  And so, we had themes at K through twelve [kindergarten to twelfth grade].  Fine arts, we had math and science.  We had in the high school level, we had kids learn how to fly planes with air knot--I've forgotten that title of that school, but anyway, they learned how to fly a plane.
Speaker 1: Aviation?
Speaker 2: Aviation.  We had chemical science, science program in one high school 'cause it's all industry in this area.  And we had the support of our industries in this area.  They helped to support those programs that we put together.  We had foreign language programs.  We had--Yates [Jack Yates Senior High School; Jack Yates High School, Houston, Texas] had a communications high school.  They still--and these programs are still going, so, and we must have done a pretty good job.  We--and so, thematic--if a kid is interested in music, he's going to do well in reading and everything else 'cause he's coming to school excited about what he's doing.  We had horticulture for the little kids in elementary.  We had--I'm trying, I'm going through them.  As a part of that magnet school program, we set up a camping program where we took a predominantly white campus, a predominantly black, and a predominantly Hispanic, and they went to camp for a week.  We own this property--well, a family owns this property up in the Huntsville area, called Camp Olympia [Trinity, Texas]--best experience those kids had.  Then we had, we taught them while they were there, the outdoors, science, and, you know, and they still go there.  It's a wonderful pro- but all of that, we tried to make it very exciting.  We had to decide--where do you put these programs, so we chose campuses where it wouldn't be too difficult to transport kids.  You had to do all of that as you created this program.  And it's still real--the magnet schools, they line up to get in them right now.  And so, as I look back with my involvement in the Hou--that's probably my legacy to the district [Houston Independent School District], the magnet school program.
Story_ID: 608200
Speaker 1: Now, these programs as you're saying have stood the test of time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, yet, there were some schools that wanted to secede from the district [Houston Independent School District].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what you're telling me.  They were--
Speaker 2: Well, see, we were just starting then.  That's when we were starting.  We had this group in the Galleria area which, as you know, is very much a part of Houston [Texas].  It was that area so, but the judge didn't buy it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they actually wanted to secede like the confederate states or--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --like some Texans still talk about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) 'cause they still talk about that.  They get crazy down here (laughter).
Speaker 1: A Republican--
Speaker 2: You know, they get crazy down here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you had to fight that in court then--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to go to court on that.
Speaker 1: And also, a big part of what you were doing was that you had to deal with the [U.S.] Department of Justice, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You had to--
Speaker 2: I became a consultant for the Department of Justice, and worked with other school districts across the country in setting up magnet school programs.  I became a witness for the Department of Justice, as I can remember going to Lubbock, Texas, and did a lot in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and where else, to Dallas [Texas].  We helped Dallas create their program, so we did a lot with other school districts as well.  I was one of their main witnesses when they got ready, not only for court, but to help school districts design and develop magnet school programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said, you remember Judge Cowan [Finis E. Cowan], right, the--
Speaker 2: That was the first judge we had and then, we had another.  I can't remember that second one's name, but Judge Cowan was the first one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a federal judge here in this district [U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas], so we were in federal court all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did it make it rough on you or did you or was it--
Speaker 2: Well, I became the star witness.  And every time we had to go, Judge Cowan--I think he got to know me as in testifying until I think he really believed what I was saying.  And so, it went very well.  We, we would come out of court in good shape each time we went.
Story_ID: 608201
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, is this around the time that Dr. Barnett [Herman A. Barnett, III] became the first black on the school board?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, he, he was no long- --
Speaker 1: He wasn't on it?
Speaker 2: He was, way before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was on the school board way before then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, you were telling before we started about the black representation on the Houston school board.  It's never been more than two, right, in the history?
Speaker 2: There are three on there right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I said two, but there are three--I, in my mind, quickly going through, we have one in district four, Paula [ph.].  We have this lady, who is just--and I can't even remember her name.  She was elected following Carol Galloway.  And we have Larry Marshall, so you have three on there right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, out of nine, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In those days, you had like one, right?
Speaker 2: We had one when Barnett and all of them were on, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, and Dr. Barnett, he was a medical doctor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who is--okay, he represented the black community.
Speaker 2: And then, we had Reverend Everett [D. Leon Everett], was on there by himself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 608202
Speaker 1: Around 1979, you moved to the department of human services, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what, what prompted that move?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in big school districts, you always got to hire and fire folks (laughter).  And I guess they needed somebody over--we were trying desperately to hire teachers and to work with our teachers and our administrators, and the vacancy came.  And the superintendent decided I could do a good job over there, and so he sent me to person- to human resources.  Well, he recommended me to the board for human resources.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it went well.
Speaker 1: From what I understand, and this is even coming, even from, you know, living in the North that Houston [Texas], along with Atlanta [Georgia], and some other cities in the South, were experiencing an influx of black college [HBCU] graduates who saw opportunity in what we were calling the Sun Belt in those days.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: We had, we had, we had a lot of this, still, black teachers.  And at that time, the number grew of black teachers.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, remember now, we're sitting right in Houston with black colleges.  We got Texas Southern [Texas Southern University] in Houston, and Prairie View [Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] down the highway, and so they sent a lot of blacks into our school district.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we're blessed, you know, like that.  We're not like districts outside the South.  We were able--that's not a problem hiring blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you said they were, that Houston Independent School District was trying desperately to hire more teachers when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but we, we hire about, with the turnover that we have, a thousand teachers a year.  That's still going on.  We have to hire teachers every year because we have about what, twelve thousand, and the turnover is great sometimes.  It depends on how the turnover as to how many we have to hire.
Speaker 1: Now, is--
Speaker 2: And then the population is growing.  We've had a--Houston is still a growing city, and with the population growing, we have to add teachers.  Then we have these special kind--it's not just teachers and just, it's specific.  We need math and science.  We need computer teachers.  And the state, that's now mandated in the curriculum.  And, of course, you know, math and science has always been an area where you can't find enough teachers.  So those two areas, in particular.  Now, elementary is not as bad.  And foreign language, just specialty areas, vocational, which is a department I supervised at one time.  The, that department because it's, you know, what we're teaching there, you have to find specialty teachers.  You don't find too many teachers out there can teach cosmetology.  And you don't find a lot of teachers who can teach--what is that, the farming stuff, you know, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Agriculture.
Speaker 2: Agriculture (laughter), I call it the farming stuff.  And those kinds of specialties that you're looking for teachers is sometime hard to find, especially if they got to have some education along with it, you know, so.
Speaker 1: So people that know agriculture or beauty culture, but they don't have the rest of it?
Speaker 2: They may not know education.  You know, you can't just walk it and teach your cosmetology.  You got to have a few education courses, so they really have them, you know, we can hire them on special certificates and, you know, there are creative ways you can get folks into the classroom.  But that was my job in human resources, to make sure, and principal hiring, district superintendents, and all of that, I had to make sure they were advertised, then.  We have a big human resources department.
Story_ID: 608203
Speaker 1: You were there until around 1979, is that--no, no, you started in human resources around '79 [1979], and you were only there, like a year--
Speaker 2: About two.
Speaker 1: --two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And once you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I went to school administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I went to instruction.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the deputy superintendent of instruction?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: There, I had all of the academic programs in the district, all, and we did all of the curriculum for all of those areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had--I had what we call general instruction.  I had special education.  I had vocational education, and along with the academic programs, I had the police department (laughter).  And I laugh every time I tell, I said, I supervised the police department for a good while.  And then, I had athletics, all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have supervised everything in HISD [Houston Independent School District], other than the business and, and, you know, that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Of all those different components you just named, what was the toughest one to supervise?
Speaker 2: Probably the police department, and I say that 'cause you got to make sure, you know, anything that happens on a school campus, you've got to be there.  And, and schools now can have anything happen at any moment--well, you know that.  In a city, it can become very crucial for safety, and one of our primary goals in the district was to provide safe, secure campuses, and it still is.  One of the district says, I hear, they're doing pretty well.  We haven't had any problems as I--that made the newspaper--let me put it like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there certain problem schools when you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, and there still are.  The location and, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But those schools are doing okay, too.  We haven't had any problems on campuses, period.  You have to really stay on top of that.  We have security guards on all of our high school campuses anyway.  That, we've had for a long time--
Story_ID: 608204
Speaker 1: I want to just switch gears a second and ask you about, I want to ask you about Barbara Jordan, 'cause I think a lot of black people, you know, consider her the most famous black person from Texas and all that.  And she was in [U.S.] Congress, I guess, during this period of time, right? No?
Speaker 2: Which, during?
Speaker 1: Like, well, while, when you were at the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I was at school, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: She had-- she and then, Mickey--no, I think Mickey and Sheila [Sheila Jackson Lee].  Barbara was a little ahead of them.  When I became a deputy superintendent [of the Houston Independent School District] and all of that, I think Mickey and Sheila were in Congress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Barbara had--
Speaker 1: Had retired from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) right.
Speaker 1: And she got sick.
Speaker 2: She got sick, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But--
Speaker 2: But I knew Barbara from Fifth Ward, from Houston [Texas].  We were in high school [at Phillis Wheatley High School, Houston, Texas] at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yet, do you have any reflections on her service to the local area here?
Speaker 2: Barbara was a good congress per- well, she was good in the state legislature [Texas Senate].  She was good as a congresswoman from Texas, very good, and she worked for her district [18th Congressional District], so she was very good.  And so did Mickey and Sheila doing it right now.  They are on top of what's going on in their districts, and they support the public schools in their district.  We have had good support coming from Washington [D.C.], our representatives in Washington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think their schools named for Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, I know, outside of the State of Texas, you know.  I know it's a Mickey Leland School in Chicago [sic.].
Speaker 2: We don't even have a Mickey Leland school, come to think of it.  We have the airport, part of the airport for Mickey [Mickey Leland International Terminal at George Bush Intercontinental Airport, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, so I mean these are, you know, high powered, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --politicians coming out of the Houston area (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Wanted, I know.
Speaker 2: And all of them have done very well and are respected highly in this district--I mean, in, you know, their districts.
Speaker 1: Mickey Leland was involved, especially in international (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's how he died.
Speaker 1: Right, on his way to Ethiopia, right.  So, okay, I just wanted to ask about them on some level.  And I didn't get to Sheila Jackson Lee yet, but we're--I guess we can mention her later but--
Speaker 2: Well, Sheila is right that I--we can rest assured if there's any money for anything in education, she's trying to get it for her district [Texas's 18th Congressional District].  And when they were given--what do they call them when united in the budget, then they get those special deals going?  We got a lot of those special deals through Sheila--funding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One line, one line item for one time--we got them.
Speaker 1: Those earmarks that--
Speaker 2: Earmarks, that's what they call them, right.
Speaker 1: Politicians claim that nobody else should get, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, Sheila got them for us when there was an opportunity available.
Story_ID: 608205
Speaker 1: Deputy superintendent of instruction, now this is the '80s [1980s].  Now, you got in the '80s [1980s], you got--Houston [Texas] has its first woman mayor when Kathy Whitmire [Kathryn J. Whitmire], right, in '81 [1981]--I think she's elected--the first one.  Did that make any difference in how the city was--I mean, did it--
Speaker 2: Not for school districts.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Now, okay, so--
Speaker 2: See, our school is what, in Texas, you call it independent school district, so you're really not dependent on the city.  You know, they, and, and the board operates outside a city, not like some cities where they report they're tied to the city government.  It's independent in Texas.
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois], the school board is controlled by the mayor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right--not here. No connection other than trying to work together on some things.
Speaker 1: So, that's why it's called the Houston Independent School District.
Speaker 2: That's all over Texas.  We do not tie into city government.  They're independent school districts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you think that's a good thing?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I'd hate to have to deal with the mayor and city council for a budget (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that the unique thing about Houston as we were saying before this interview, is that the mayor runs, only serves for two terms--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean, two years.
Speaker 2: And the superintendent can stay twelve.  Billy Reagan was here twelve years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Rod was here six or seven.
Speaker 1: So, the possibility, there'd be more stability--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --either good or bad with the superintendent of the schools and it would be--
Speaker 2: That, right, and, and that has been one of the advantages in the Houston school district, the stability of the superintendency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause when you were superintendent, deputy superintendent of instruction, Billy Reagan was still the superintendent, right?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: I think when I went to instruction, Joan [Joan M. Raymond]--we had two others between, before Rod.  We had Joan Raymond, and then, we had Petruzielo [Frank Petruzielo].  Now, they didn't stay long--neither one of them.  And then, we had Rod Paige.  And I served between Petruzielo and Rod Paige as an interim.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, Rod Paige was the first black superintendent of the schools, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Boney [J. Don Boney, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right, you said J. Don Boney--
Speaker 2: Boney.
Speaker 1: --and, yeah, J. Don Boney.  And when was he elected (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know the year.
Speaker 1: So, that's after Billy Reagan and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was still in the department of schools at that time because he left us and went to Houston Community College [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's Jew Don Boney's [J. Don Boney, Jr.] father.
Speaker 1: Is his name Jew Don Boney, too, or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Is any--
Speaker 2: We just always call him J. Don Boney.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And maybe Jew--I don't know.  Jew Don is not a junior [sic.], so it's probably not--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: --'cause he's not a junior.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Yeah, I always wondered about his light, how he got his name.
Speaker 2: Jew Don?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know how he got that name (laughter).  He--let me tell you, his father was quite an educator.  Jew Don used to be very, very militant.  He was out there, left the university.  He went to University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  I don't think he ever finished the University of Texas, but he was so militant.
Speaker 1: And what about his father?  His father wasn't considered a militant, no?
Speaker 2: He wasn't militant, no.  He was steady.
Story_ID: 608206
Speaker 1: So you were deputy superintendent of instruction until around 1984, I guess you did that for about two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then, they combined that with school administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, during that--
Speaker 2: So, what I picked up on the school administration, I picked up all of the district superintendents 'cause we had this--we were divided into districts.  And so then, I became the supervisor of the district, which led down to the schools because all of our schools were under a district superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, let's see.  Now, during the time that you were serving in the department of instruction and as, you were the president of the national- you were the international president of the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were elected international president in '82 [1982], I think it was?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now did this, so you got like a big job, and now you've got to, you know, you're president of a big organization.  Did they ever conflict in terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had a good superintendent (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who understood that I would be travelling.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, you didn't have to worry about no struggles there.  I mean, did they complement each other?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, definitely.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how they--
Speaker 2: Well, I think I learned a lot in HISD [Houston Independent School District] in terms of leadership skills that you could transfer to Alpha Kappa Alpha, and vice versa, as you deal with people.  And that was very important.  As you lead, try to lead black women, you need certain skills.  All of them, very smart women, you know, and, and they all think they know a little bit, so you have to really be very careful in how you deal with that.  Same thing, when you're dealing with principles and others in the school, so the skill sets that you need are similar.
Story_ID: 608207
Speaker 1: Just for the record, you probably covered this in the first part of the interview, but as president of AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], you launched the African Village Development Program with Africare. You completed the national office building.  You expanded the international vision by creating long range, a long range planning committee.  You established connection as a, you established connection--I don't know what that is, as a standing committee, and appointed a government relations team.  Those are some of your accomplishments as president.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me talk about my beliefs and what led me to certain decisions.  Each supreme basileus has a program theme.  Mine was POWER, P-O-W-E-R and that stood for certain things.  I believe that when you have more than a one hundred thousand women active in anything, that's POWER, because you can help to influence decisions.  So, the POWER stood for programs of service; organizational impact and collaboration; women involved in global issues or concerns; economic development; and renewal, so that we're always going to be involved in programs of service as a sorority, locally, regionally, and nationally.  The organizational impact and collaboration is how we deal with our partners.  I call them our partners--the Urban League [National Urban League], the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], National Council of Negro Women, and all of the other groups that we are part of, and we work through those organizations, too.  That's that organizational impact.  During my tenure, we did a conference at--we got a grant from the Ford Foundation [New York, New York], and we did a conference at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] on economic development, and women involved in global issues.  Economic development, the, our whole concept, we built a national office building--cash, because we believe that you don't have--if you got that many members out there, if they each give you a little bit, you got enough to pay for it.  So, we raised several million dollars to build that national office building, to buy the land, and build the building.  Well, Jane Byrne helped us with the land.  She was mayor in Chicago [Illinois] at that time.  And she saw to it that we got that land because there were others who wanted it, too, but so, she was really, really great in helping us there.  But that's economic development.  You're taking your dollars and, you know, making them work.  But we hired a black architect.  We had a black construction company, and so that was putting your money back into the black community in Chicago.  So, that dealt with economic development and, of course, renewal is getting all of us inside the organization, and internally to really continue the concept of sisterhood and, you know, all of those things.  Now, that was my thrust.
Story_ID: 608208
Speaker 1: The other thing, the connection is our legislative, a piece which connects all of us across the country.  If there's a message I want to get to every AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], it's through that body.  It has regional representatives, chapter representatives, all the way down, so we can send out a message, and it goes all the way down to our membership.  That's that connection.  And we use that to register the voters, or to--that's our, really our legislative and political arm.  And that you--now all, you asked me about connection, and that brought about all of the other, but that is what connection means, that you ought to be able to tap these hundred some thousand women, and make a difference.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah, there's a lot of, a lot of women involved in AKA.  I was at the convention in Detroit [Michigan].  A friend of mine was filming it, you know.  I saw, it's just, it's staggering to see all the people that I met (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you there during the convention in Detroit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a few years ago, about five years ago.
Speaker 1: I was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you probably were (laughter).  I didn't know you but (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was there.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Just for a minute, I was there for a minute.  I didn't stay long (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I still believe very strongly that a group of women with the finance, the know how, and they can make a difference.  And we started pushing women to run for public office.  You know, we ought to be out there on city--and not just in [U.S.] Congress, but we ought to be on the city council, the county commissions, all the way up.  That's power. And so, the connection was pushing that, getting women involved.
Story_ID: 608209
Speaker 1: You also appointed a government, a government relations team that I thought was interesting, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Wa- now they operated in Washington, D.C., and what they did was to--up on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.], when something was pressing that we were pushing, or something we were trying to prevent, they were meeting with congressmen, and they were our contacts in Washington.  The other organizations headquartered in Washington, they were collaborating with.  And that's, that was their function.  You tracked everything that's going on in Washington that we ought to be involved in or we ought to know about, and that was that team.  And they would go the hearings and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this, so both your jobs kind of, your jobs complemented one another.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I suppose a lot of the teachers in Houston [Texas] were black women as well.  They probably (unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm. We had a large black, uh-huh.
Story_ID: 608210
Speaker 1: Now, you were deputy superintendent of instruction [for the Houston Independent School District], oh, deputy superintendent of school administration, that's where we are now.  I guess, from about, 19--I guess, from '98 [1998], until you retired, right?
Speaker 2: Well, with the change and title further down.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  And you saw Rod Paige come in as superintendent.
Speaker 2: He was on the board of education, so I really worked with him closely when he was president 'cause he had been president of the board.  And then, I saw him come in as superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And he made me the executive deputy superintendent.
Speaker 1: Right, right. Now that's, that's, that's also in '98 [1998] then?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1998.  Now, at the time--oh, you were the interim superintendent, too, for one year--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in '97 [1997], right?
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven [1997].  That was between Joan Raymond [Joan M. Raymond]--no, Petruzielo [Frank Petruzielo], and Rod Paige.  I was between those two superintendents.  I was the interim superintendent.
Speaker 1: Now, they said many people probably thought, and probably called for you to become the superintendent and--
Speaker 2: Well, but I didn't want that job (laughter), I did not want that job.  I loved what I was doing, but it is a seven day, twenty-four hour a day job when you're superintendent of schools.  And you've got all the budget to worry about, and all the folks, and the parents, and the politicians.  I'm not that good a politician.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the--is the politics of it that really, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, I just, I wasn't ready to be superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, they, even after I retired, you got some folks say, you need to go back and be the superintendent.  They don't like the one we have now, but he's doing okay.  He's just a different breed.  And a lot of folks are, you know, on him, they don't like him.  I didn't--I said, well, he doesn't, you know, the man just passed a billion dollar bond issue, so he must be doing something right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, who is the current superintendent?
Speaker 2: He is--what's his name--I can't even remember the man's name.  I'll think of it in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came here from San Diego [California], but he had been only there about two years.  He came out of Charlotte, North Carolina.  That's where he served longest--Grier [Terry Grier] is his name.  He's, he's white, he's the first time we've have a--I guess a white man.  Well, we had a woman, and then we had a Hispanic, and now we have a white male.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Grier is the current superintendent (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grier is the current superintendent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, so you were Rod Paige's superintendent.  Did you have a good working relationship with Rodney?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, wonderful working relationship.  He tells everybody that I ran the school district (laughter).  And we're still good friends, yeah, he's, he's, he's--Christ, I loved Rod.  He was good to work with.
Speaker 1: He became secretary of education under George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush] at, at a certain point.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we interviewed him [sic.]--I guess, in 2002 or 2003.  And I know he's, I know, I remember his remarks about No Child Left Behind [No Child Left Behind Act of 2001] as--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a good idea that it was underfunded, that's what he was saying.
Speaker 2: That is true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, he, Rod really pushed.  All kids can learn and we've got to make sure that we don't leave any of them behind, that they all are moving and achieving.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And from what I read, the test scores here in Houston [Texas] were high when he was superintendent (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were.  They still are doing pretty good, they still are doing pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How does--
Speaker 2: I don't keep up with them as closely as I used to.
Speaker 1: How did Houston compare with other cities when you were in, in the, with the board of education?
Speaker 2: They, for urban school districts, they were doing pretty--one or two, you know, with urban schools.  We always compared ourselves to urban school districts.  And the Council of the Great City Schools, which has all of the urban school districts, that's New York [New York City Department of Education], Chicago [Chicago Public Schools], Los Angeles [Los Angeles Unified School District], Houston, Dade County, Miami Dade County [Miami Dade County Public Schools], your--I think, your twenty-five largest school districts in the country.  And that's the group we usually are looking at, as we look at how well we're doing.
Speaker 1: What was the toughest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they also have mostly minority students--a large blocks of your minority students.
Story_ID: 608211
Speaker 1: What was your toughest challenge in being a deputy superintendent?
Speaker 2: My toughest--I think it's always focused on instruction, and whether you have the right curriculum out there for, that all of our kids can be successful in.  And we redid our curriculum, and we redid this testing program, always looking at, you know--will this impact learning in the school?  That's tough, especially when you got three hundred and some campuses, trying to make sure that all of them are achieving.  We have a large number of black students and concerns in this district--a large number of bilingual students.  They can't even speak English, you know, so trying to make sure you had a curriculum in place to meet the needs of all of these, especially education, a large number of special education students, that you have something in place that all of these groups are learning.  And that there is, there has always been, and we still are working on it, a gap between your whites and your blacks, and your whites and your blacks, and your whites and Hispanics.  And we'll try to close that gap, so that all of them are learning and moving, and we've been successful at closing some of that gap.  I don't know what they're doing right now 'cause I really, I haven't focused on it recently.  But that was our goal, that there would not be a big gap in there, that these kids learn, can learn, and these can't, but that they all are learning.  Now, for black kids, it may mean you have to do a little bit extra to catch up and that's fine.  And we were doing--Houston [Houston Independent School District] was doing great.  Well, I was not in the district when Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], but then we had a whole group of kids coming in from Katrina that we had to catch them up 'cause they were way behind.  And so, that, since I left, that has been a challenge to everybody, making sure--their school districts in Louisiana were a little bit different from ours.  They weren't accustomed to the structure that we have in school.  I mean, you have to behave.  We don't have any (laughter), you know, and so, but they're doing better.  Those kids are doing better.  They didn't leave.  They don't want to go back 'cause they, their parents are saying, I want my kid to stay here, so they're here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Those are the students who came in after Katrina in 2004 [sic. 2005] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 608212
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you did as a school administrator [for the Houston Independent School District], what, what are you the most proud of?
Speaker 2: Magnet schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the impact that they have had--the kids do very well in those schools, in those programs.  That's what they found out quickly.  When we first started, there was skepticism in the back.  Well, here, they, you know and, but the kids have done so well in magnet school program, people are knocking the doors down to get in.  And schools, who didn't want to be bothered, are now trying to be a magnet school, so I think that's good.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 608213
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could go back and change it or--
Speaker 2: No, I've done okay.  I've done a lot in HISD [Houston Independent School District].  I've done a lot in Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and other organizations, and so I'm still involved.  Like I told you, I'm very active in my church.  You know, people think when you retire, you can do, you got plenty of time.  So, I've tried to adjust what I'm doing, so I'm not just doing, trying to do everything.  I'm on the board of Region 4 Educational Service Center [Region 4 Education Service Center, Houston, Texas], so I'm still connected with education.  They service all of the school districts in a region, and it's about twenty something school districts in our region.  So, I've expanded that outreach and education from (unclear).  I represent H- HISD on that board, and that's been very interesting.  I've been--this is my second year on Region 4, so I'm giving them my time.  I have been on the Historic City Archaeological and Historical Commission [sic. Houston Archaeological and Historical Commission].  I'm no longer--I served there about seven years, but I'm not there anymore.  I gave some time to the Houston History Association [sic. Houston History Alliance].  I'm not on that board anymore.  You find yourself just going to meetings and I said, "I don't need to be doing this."  I still am very active, like I said, in my church [Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church, Houston, Texas] and the Missionary Society [Women's Missionary Society] in my church where that, and I'm their historiographer, that I'm trying to do some history for the church Missionary Society.  What they're going to do about every ten years, they publish a history and so, we're updating the history there.  And so, I'll be updating it for this particular area.  I give a lot of time to Top, my Top Ladies of Distinction [Top Ladies of Distinction, Inc.] because they have a teen group [Top Teens of America].  And my Houston [Texas] chapter of Top Ladies, we have about a hundred teens we work with and so, I give them some time.  Now, that's enough, don't you think?
Speaker 1: That's a lot, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's a lot, so I needed to cut some of the things I was doing.  And I figured that the Houston history commis- you know, and I guess it was the group I was working with, too.  I get impatient with some folks (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I said, "Well, I don't need to be doing this," but I'm still very active in those things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were telling us earlier that there's a new Buffalo Soldier Museum here [Buffalo Soldiers National Museum, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, here in Houston.  It's over on, off of Southmore [Boulevard] and 3rd [sic.].  It's not, it's coming toward Midtown [Houston, Texas].  There's a whole museum district in the city, which has the Houston museum of this, that, and the other.  And Buffalo Soldiers Museum is in that area.  We also have one that just opened, the, what is it called--black, black history museum [Houston Museum of African American Culture, Houston, Texas] in that area, too.  So, I haven't worked with them directly, only through other organizations who support them.
Story_ID: 608214
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I have some deep concerns, especially with our youth.  I think that our youth and, and it's a generation that had everything.  And I mean that may be part of the problem, that we've given them everything they desired.  And so, they think it's theirs, you know, what I mean?  And they ought to have it whether, whether they worked for it or not.  Somewhere we've got to bring our kids back to realizing that you can achieve.  It takes a little work to achieve.  You don't have to be the dumbest kid in school.  You should be the smartest.  And they aren't doing well in many schools, and it's not the school system.  It's our kids and their parents, you know, when--well, I know it's a new day, and that kids have much more freedom, but there were some things you did, and you just didn't do.  You were taught at home, you do this and you don't do this, and our kids are missing so much of that, but they want it.  Once you get them under control, they want it.  They don't mind being controlled.  They prefer that.  They need structure.  And my concern with black kids is they are not taking advantage of all of the opportunities that they have.  And that's why we've got to work with our youth on, and that's why I still work somewhat with Top, our Top Teens group [Top Teens of America], and the youth at church [Wesley Chapel A.M.E. Church, Houston, Texas] I work with, so I think that they need our help.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what are some of your hopes?
Speaker 2: My hope is that we will continue to have prosperity and peace.  My hope is that the president of the United States [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] will be successful during these four years, and that the mean folks out there, who dislike him so much, will have a change of heart, you know, and leave him alone, you know, they're mean, related to him.  And that we will have peace and prosperity.
Story_ID: 608215
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only have--my mother [Malinda Bryant Stinson] had two kids and you see the two of us there.  My father [Willie Bryant] died, oh, while I was working at Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Houston, Texas], I guess.  He was a Pullman porter, so I've been reading that book on the Pullman porter, you know, there's a history book out on them now.  So, I grew up--my mother taught school here in Houston [Texas].  My father was a Pullman porter, and we grew up in Fifth Ward [Houston, Texas].  My mother comes from a very large family and my father had a smaller family.  So, I have, I don't have any children of my own, but my aunt, my father had one sister, and she died when her kids were small, so I've reared them.  They've been my kids.  I have a girl and a boy.  They're grown now and they have children, so I do have two that I reared, okay.  And they are still--one has, the girl doesn't have any children.  The boy has a little girl, so now I have the little girl.  She's coming up.  My sister has four kids--she's married.  She has three boys and a girl, so they are mine, too.  In fact, a nephew living with me now, one of her sons, as he finds a job is, and so, I'm just like his parent, you know, so I've grown up with a lot of kids.  My mother had twelve sisters and brothers, so I got first cousins anywhere you want to go (laughter).  And when my [maternal] grandmother [Malinda Shepherd Edmond (ph.)] died years ago, she had about a hundred grandchildren, you know, so there's a whole big, that's my mother's family.  Now, my father only has the one sister living and so, it was not a large family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we are still the, my sister and I, she's been involved in education, but higher education and so, we both have been in education.
Speaker 1: Yeah, both educational administrators (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She's a dean at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California]?  She was--
Speaker 2: She was provost, but she was dean of graduate school first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, she moved to provost, so she's done very well at US- she's done very well, and she's on boards of this, that, and the other.  She's on--what's this private school that's all over the world, that she's on that board, and they travel and she does, oh, it's real known and, and renowned, private.  It's high ed, all of is high ed.  Her, her interest has been purely high ed, and she's been on the board of social--here she was--her undergraduate [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and graduate degree first started out in social Work.  And so, when she finished UC Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], she came back to Houston.  And she was the first black that they hired as a social worker at VA hospital [Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Houston, Texas] here.  Then, when she got married, they moved to Los Angeles [California] and she was on the staff at VA hospital there.  Then, she went back to USC and got a doctorate and so, she's been around USC ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is Dr. Barbara Solomon [Barbara Bryant Solomon], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so, so was your mother satisfied with your career?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter), yes, yes, she was proud of both of us.
Story_ID: 608216
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think you've covered a lot of it.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  Well, here comes the last one.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think I would like to be remembered as one who gave a lot to make this world a better place.  And when I say that, I mean of my time, my finances, my, you know, involvement that somewhere along the way I have touched those who can do all right for themselves, and they can then touch others.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Yes, is that all (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's it, that's it.
