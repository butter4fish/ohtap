Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for most of my adult life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 14, 1958; Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm an attorney by, by training and by licensing and my title is General Counsel of the United States Department of Veteran Affairs.

Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?

Story_ID: 35203
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a kind of warm-up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I love various types of seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite color?
Speaker 2: I'd probably say purple.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 1: Umm.  I love the spring, especially after the Daylight Savings Time begins and the weather is warm and the days are, are long.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: I love the beach.  I grew up in Ft. Lauderdale [Florida] and so I love places where there's the ocean.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: I can't say that I do.  Overall I like the sentiment behind what Nike says in terms of "Just do it," but also I'm inspired by Philippians 4:13.  It says, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35204
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separate from your father's side and then we'll, will put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother's name is Elizabeth Reese Gunn; for Elizabeth, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H; Reese, R-E-E-S-E; Gunn, G-U-N-N.
Speaker 1: And is Reese your mother's maiden name?
Speaker 2: Reese is her maiden name, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Birmingham, Alabama on March 29, 1941.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and, and are there any stories about what they were doing in history?
Speaker 2: Well my, I, I know of the immediate generation prior, prior to her.  My, my maternal grandfather whose name was Stewart, Stewart Reese, S-T-E-W-A-R-T and her mother's name was Lula McCurdy Reese.  McCurdy, of course, being her, her maiden name.  My grandfather was born roughly May of 1903.  I believe my grandmother was born in about 1902.  The, I don't know the date, but she died in 1958 actually a few months before I was born.  My grandfather, on the other hand, lived until 1995 and so I got to know him pretty well.  Both of them were born in what's known as Alabama's Black Belt, around Lowndes County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: My grandfather, his mother I'm, I'm told, was Native American; father Afri-African American but I don't know for instance the tribe that, that she was a member of.  I'm just told that she originally came up from, from Mississippi in, into Alabama.  That's, that's about it.  On my, on--as far as my grandmother's concerned, her, I got to know her mother, my great--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --grandmother, Annie, Annie May McCurdy.  Annie May McCurdy was also born in Lowndes County, Alabama and I believe had about five children.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: My maternal grandmother, Lula, again she never, she never worked outside the home.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: She raised a very large family.  I believe she had fourteen children that lived to adulthood; a total of sixteen, sixteen births.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now your, your great-grandmother would have been born in the 19th Century.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  She was born in the 1880s.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: I believe around 1884, but I'm not positive about that date.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And you know, as far as you know this side of the family was all, you know, as far back in history as you can go they, they were in Lowndes County or around Lowndes County,--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Alabama.
Speaker 2: That's, that's the only location that I, that I can trace it to and that's based largely on many conversations with my maternal grandfather who had an excellent memory.  I wish I had recorded more of what he had to say over, over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35205
Speaker 1: So, now this is, you said it's [Lowndes County, Alabama] in what they call Alabama's Black Belt--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I know Alabama has a large black population --
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --so I'm just thinking where the Black Belt (laughs) (simultaneous) (unclear) how was that determined.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  I, I understand that the term actually refers to the richness of the soil and it is west of Montgomery [Alabama].  So we're talking about areas like Selma and Lowndes County.  I believe the county seat is Lowndesboro, and it borders Dallas County where we have Selma and Dallas County borders--I'm not sure if it's Montgomery County, but the county with Montgomery in it.
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: So that area, it is a very large black population, but due to the richness of the soil, it was valuable real estate during slavery, slavery times.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So a large population of, of slaves and cotton was a, very much a cash, cash crop.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This would be a Black Belt in, in two senses because of the labor, the need for black labor, and the black soil I guess.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, now this is historic area as, in terms of the Civil Rights Movement.  You know there has been a book written on Lowndes County called 'Bloody Lowndes'--
Speaker 2: Umm.
Speaker 1: --you know, written by a, a Professor [Hasan Kwame] Jeffries that--I was at a book party--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --just last year.  In Selma, of course, and Dallas County and all that area--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The march, the famous March from Montgomery to Selma, you know that Dr. [Martin Luther] King made in '65 (1965).  But your family wasn't there (laughs).  Right?  During, oh--oh well, some members of might have lived there.
Speaker 2: Well, at least not my, my immediate family.  My, my maternal great-grandmother, Annie May McCurdy, she had a brother; I believe his name was Will, and I'm told that there's actually a, a picture.  I'm not sure if it was 'Look' or 'Life' magazine that was, that had photos of the March from Selma to, in, in--into Montgomery and that there's my, my, one of my great-aunts told me that Uncle, my Uncle Will and members of his family are, are in, in one of those, those photos of the, the group marching on, on the way to Atlanta [Georgia].  I mean, on the way to Montgomery and he and the other folks are up on the hill watching them.  Not participating in the march, but watching them as, as they went by.
Story_ID: 35206
Speaker 1: Are there any stories on your mother's [Elizabeth Reese Gunn] side of the family about Emancipation or, or reconstruction?
Speaker 2: I wish I knew those but (laughs), but I really don't, don't know those, those stories.
Speaker 1: Because you've just got a, I mean a generation and a half, you know, from Emancipation right there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Your great-grandmother [Annie May McCurdy] being born in 1884, Reconstruction would have been over and people in Alabama and other parts of the South were going through what we call the "nadir of black history"--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where, you know, it was almost as bad as slavery.
Speaker 2: You're, you're absolutely right.  I've studied that era a, a bit and the, the advent of the Jim, Jim Crow laws and the, to the extent there had been advances in that immediate period of Reconstruction as a strong effort to, to abate all of those.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So I wish I knew what was happening there.  I know that my, my maternal grandmother [Lula McCurdy Reese] was, work primarily as a domestic most, most of her life and my grandfather [Stewart Reese] worked in the, the mines.  He moved to Alabama in the, I'm, I'm sorry, he moved to Birmingham [Alabama] in the 1920s and went to work in, in the mines and eventually in the steel, in the steel mill there.   Later on did work as a handy man and as a yard man in his, in his older, older years.
Story_ID: 35207
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Elizabeth Reese Gunn] say about growing up?  Did, did-did she grow up in that area?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Birmingham [Alabama], so she grew up in, in the city.  What she talks about if the fact of having a, being part of a very large city.  I'm sorry, not a large city, but a (laughs) large family where she always had her brothers and sisters around her.  I believe my mother had two sisters and two brothers that were, that were younger than her.  Her name, her nickname was actually "Baby Sister."  I think that was because there was a, a gap of, of several years between the sister who was next older, older to her and, and my mother, but that's basically what, what my mother relates are, are stories around that just being there in the house with her, her brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did she, how far did your mother get a chance to go in school?
Speaker 2: She initially went to the tenth grade and she, she dropped out of high school; actually to have me at, when she was seventeen years old.  Years later when I was in, I believe middle school, my mother went back and got her high school, high school diploma and she had a, a series, series of jobs, but she actually spent more than twenty years in a, in social services and retired around 1999.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so she worked for a, a social service, a social service agency in Birmingham?
Speaker 1: Well actually, no.  My, my--
Speaker 2: [unclear]
Speaker 1: Actually in, in Florida.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35208
Speaker 1: My folks, my father [Willy Julian Gunn] who was a, a teacher, graduated from Miles College, which is in Birmingham [Alabama], got a student teaching job in Anniston, Alabama and then was recruited to a black high school in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] called Dillard High School.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so my, my parents [Gunn's father and mother, Elizabeth Reese Gunn], who by that time were, were married, they moved with my brother and I, who was born, my brother Demetrius was born in 1960 and the four of us moved to Ft. Lauderdale in, I believe that would have been 1962.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35209
Speaker 1: Look, let me get your father's side, side of the family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's name is Willy Julian Gunn.  His first name is W-I-L-L-Y, middle name Julian, J-U-L-I-A-N, Gunn.  My father was born in Opelika, Alabama, which is in--well it's not that far Montgomery, Alabama, about sixty miles to the east and it's also not very far Columbus, Georgia.  So it's very close to the border between Alabama and Georgia, not far at all from Auburn, Alabama.  It's Lee County, Ala-Alabama.  His, his mother and father never married.  His father's name was Elsie Gunn, E-L-S-I-E, and his mother's name was Lula, Lula Pearl, born Lula Pearl Penny, P-E-N-N-Y, I believe; but later married a Mr. Johnson.  So her name became Lula Pearl Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you've got two Lulas, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Two grandmothers named Lulas.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. So there any, any stories on your father's side of the family go, go back to Reconstruction or, or-or, or Emancipation?
Speaker 2: I, I wish I could share some but I, I-I                                                                            really can't because I don't know them.  My, my father grew up in a, a house.  He spent a lot of time he tells me with his mother's parents.  A gentleman by the name of Robert Penny was his grandfather and, who was also born in the, in the 1880s.  His wife, I don't recall her, her name.  I never met her.  I did know my paternal great-grandfather and he died in the, in the 1960s.  So I got a chance to get to know him just, just a bit.  My father--
Speaker 1: What was his name [unclear]?
Speaker 2: Again, my, my paternal [great-grandfather?] grandfather was Robert Penny.
Speaker 1: Oh, paternal.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, all right.  I thought that was your grandfather.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's right.  My, well to trace back my father's were Lula Pearl Johnson and Elsie Gunn--
Speaker 1: Elsie Gunn.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --my, his mother's father was Robert Penny.
Speaker 1: I got it.  Okay.  I got it.  So he, he lived through the '60s [1960s] you said.
Speaker 2: Until about about 1967 I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, my fault.  Okay.  Okay, did he have any stories that he shared with you about--
Speaker 2: Not, not that I, not that I recall.  I didn't spend very much time with my paternal grandfather since we were living in, in Florida during, during that period of time.  My parents [father and mother, Elizabeth Reese Gunn] did send my brother [Demetrius Gunn] and I back to Alabama during, during the summers when I was very young but most all of that time practically was spent on my mother's mother's [Lula McCurdy Reese] side of the family.  So I got to know that side of the family much, much better.  And since my paternal grandmother and grandfather never married, I didn't, didn't get to know my, my paternal grand-grandfather until--well actually I got to know him around the same time.  He had moved following his father and brother to central Florida, a place called Sebring, Florida, S-E-B-R-I-N-G and I had many trips to Sebring over the years where he and his brother and others worked in the orange groves there.  That's the heart of citrus country.
Story_ID: 35210
Speaker 1: Now your father [Willy Julian Gunn]--so he grows up and did he grow up in Opelika [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did--went to, I believe, a Darden High School which was the black high school in Opelika.  He was a, a good student throughout and ended up going off to Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  And when he got to Miles, he lived with one of his mother's [Lula Pearl Penny] sister and eventually went to work at the University of Alabama at Birmingham [Alabama] Hospital, the University Hospital, where I end up being born a, a few years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in--he graduated from Miles and became a teacher right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is, is there, did your father have any stories about growing up in Opelika that he shared with you?
Speaker 2: You know, very, very little.  He talked a little bit about, you know learn, learning to swim and not in swimming pools but just in, in swimming, swimming holes.  He told me stories about how the warnings that he received about how dangerous it was growing up black in, in Alabama, about relatives and such who were; who had to leave town because of some indiscretion; who were, who were spirited, spirited away.  I, I don't know, don't know many of the details but I, I do have this lasting impression that, you know, as we talk about now about the Trayvon Martin case being in the news, it was very dangerous to be black in, in the South during, during that time, during that timeframe.
Speaker 1: You know lots of story in Ohio about people in Alabama that had to leave Alabama at one point or another.  That's how they wound up in Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, so at Miles College he becomes a teacher.  Now, now is your father the first person in this family to go to college or--
Speaker 2: I understand that he was not.  He was the first in his immediate family but one of the things my dad told me that his [maternal] grandfather had, Robert Penny, had relatives, cousins and such, who had also been, been educated but I, I never, I never got to know those folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35211
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Elizabeth Reese Gunn and Willy Julian Gunn] met?  So I assume they met in Birmingham [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father had a, a cousin, a first cousin by the name of Samuel Lee McFarlane, I believe, and Sammie Lee lived a street away from my mother and he was the one that introduced them. I don't know the circumstances behind, behind that but I think my father was living with my Aunt Mattie who was Sammie Lee's mother and the sister of my maternal, my paternal grandmother [Lula Pearl Penny] and, again just, just a street away.  So they, they met and like I said I was born out, out wedlock but they, they decided to get married later on and have been together ever, ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I guess they're, they're close to about 50-53 years of, of marriage now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as you were saying earlier, your brother [Demetrius Gunn] was born in 1960--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then your father had an offer to teach in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida; at Dillard High School] around '62 (1962)?
Speaker 2: Yes, '61 (1961) or '62 (1962).
Speaker 1: Okay. And so that's how the family ends up in Fort Lauderdale.
Speaker 2: Indeed.  I'm told that I was about two years old when we moved.  So, I believe that probably was around 1961.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35212
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' [Elizabeth Reese Gunn and Willy Julian Gunn] personalities, their talents, how they look, how they walk, talk--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --their opinions even, who do you, think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I think that I'm a very nice combination between the two of them.  My father is one of the most inquisitive people that I know.  Many people wouldn't want to visit a museum with my father because he's the type of person that wants to read every placard (laughs) at, at the museum.  You know he'll, he'll stay all, all-all day long.  My, my mother is a very gregarious person; very much a giver.  She has, she truly has a gift for giving and she gives in so many different ways.  She cooks for people.  She visits people.  If people are in need, she gives.  She gives money if, if she has it; so just a very, very, very generous, generous person.  I think I, I can't say I'm the giver that my mother is but that's something that pulls on my heart quite, quite a bit but like my father I'm also an inquisitive person.  The, the intellectual side is something that I take after, after him.
Story_ID: 35213
Speaker 1: My father [Willy Julian Gunn] would, took us on, on various vacations as I was growing up and those vacations made a last, lasting impressions on me.  In fact, in 1967 we made the major trip of, of my youth which I still think, think about very fondly and had lasting impressions.  We left from Fort Lauderdale [Florida], went to Sebring [Florida] where we picked up one of my, my uncles and then we went from Sebring to Cape Canaveral [Florida].  So we observed the space, the space program there; went from Cape Canaveral; spent a night in Savannah [Georgia] and then went up to Charleston [South Carolina] where we visited Fort Sumter; from Fort Sumter we went up to Williamsburg [Virginia] and observed Colonial Williamsburg and I believe it was in Williamsburg where the seeds of becoming lawyer were first planted with, with me and it was just a notion of hearing the stories about the Founding Fathers of, of the nation and seeing how many of them were lawyers really impressed me.  And the thing that impressed me I think more than anything else was the flexibility that the law degree could, could give one; that lawyers did so many different things and that I was always drawn to leadership and that was another thing that impressed me.  But from Williamsburg we came here to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] for the first time and this was again the summer of 1967 and we visited all of the, the major--well I won't say all, but we visited the, the great sights here:  The White House, the [U.S.] Capitol, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial and, and the Smithsonian Museum. And again, I, I fell in love with Washington, D.C. at, at that time.  We went from Washington up to New York and saw the, saw the big city, visited the Empire State Building and the Statute of Liberty, then came back down through West Virginia and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], but we had relatives in both of those locations, and finally down to Birmingham [Alabama] and back, back to Florida.  All of this in a 1964 Valiant:  five people, two of us little, little boys [Gunn and his younger brother, Demetrius] at, at the time but from my vantage point it was just an incredible, incredible trip.
Speaker 2: Hmm, in a Valiant.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Um hmm.  In a Valiant.  Four door, but not very large (laughs) at all.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  That's quite a story.
Story_ID: 35214
Speaker 1: Now, now you just have the, the one brother [Demetrius Gunn]?
Speaker 2: I have one, the one brother and then I have a half-sister, my father's [Willy Julian Gunn] ah--we share fathers.  Her name is Marilyn Rowell, R-O-W-E-L-L, and Marilyn lives in Columbia, South Carolina and my brother Demetrius lives in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35215
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: What I recall I-I recall being conscious of age when I was four years old.  I have bits and pieces of, of being in Birmingham [Alabama].  Before that I have an aunt who is about nine years older, older than I am.  Her name is Ruby.  We called her "Tampa" and I, I have this memory of being down on a pallet and I believe she must have had a, some candy or cookie or whatever and she was taunting (laughs)--saying she wasn't going to give us any.  And so I have, I have that that bit of a memory.  I can't say exactly when it was.  I'm pretty sure it must have been around two or three years old.  I also can remember seeing the 'Amos and Andy Show' on, on television in the early '60s [1960s] when we were living, still living in, in Birmingham.  And so again just bits, bits and pieces there.  But the first time that I can recall being conscious of being a, a certain age was I was four years old and we were in what were then the Lenox [ph.] Apartments in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35216
Speaker 1: So, now can you describe the--did, did you live in the same location the whole time you were in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] or did you move once, twice or a lot of times there?
Speaker 2: When we first, first got there and I guess it, it probably was about three, three years total.  The first three years it seemed like we moved frequently and those were all in, in apartments.  We initially lived--the first place that I'm, I'm sure that we, we lived was at a set of apartments called the Lenox Apartments, which still exists in northwest Fort Lauderdale.  They would--people would call them the Green Apartments.  Now you'd probably say low-income housing, not very far from where my, my father [Willy Julian Gunn] taught at, at Dillard [High School].  Then we moved to the Madison Apartments; more Green Apartments, all black area.  But in 1964 my, when I was  in the first grade, my parents [Willy Julian Gunn and Elizabeth Reese Gunn] purchased a home, which they still have, and that's the house where I mostly grew up in.
Speaker 1: Okay and what--how, how would you describe the neighborhood that, that the house was in?
Speaker 2: All, all black neighborhood in an area called Westwood Park.  There were three housing developments right next to each other:  Westwood Park, John F. Kennedy Estates and Larkdale and these are all in northwest Ft. Lauderdale.  Actually they were unincorporated Ft. Lauderdale; now this area has been incorporated by the city of Lauderhill of, of Florida.  So again, all black, not very far from the, the city dump but the, the houses themselves were, were nice.  I think the standard model called for three bedrooms and one, one bath and there was a, a Florida room on each of these, was like a small den.  It's like a screened in porch area--
Speaker 1: So are these--
Speaker 2: Yes?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Are these like a housing projects or, or-or developments in terms of--
Speaker 2: A, a development--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a like what we'd called a subdivision.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: --all right.
Speaker 2: Um hm.  So they, so they were owned, owned and I remember going, you know, with my parents to look at the, the model, model homes in 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay, sub-divisional housing.  Okay.  So they, were these brick or--
Speaker 2: Concrete brick, stone, concrete brick.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now--well, go on.   You were describing them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: Again, the neighborhood, you know you had a, you had a range of folks.  My, my father being, being a teacher, you had him.  I think the next, next door; the lady next door was a domestic, someone across the street, older, older couple.  I guess you would call it a black middle class neighbor, neighborhood with a, a range of, a range of folks, folks in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So was there a main street that went through your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It bordered two, two main streets.  One was 19th Street, Northwest 19th Street and the other was Northwest 31st Avenue; which became Martin Luther King Boulevard around '69 (1969) or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35217
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Hmm!  Well I went to elementary school at Dillard Elementary School [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] which was right next to Dillard High School where my father [Willy Julian Gunn] taught.  So as I was gr--first through six, sixth grade, at least after we moved to the, to Westwood Park and to, to that house I would ride into school with, with my father and we would have to pass by the, the incinerators and the, the city dump.  So you know the odors from that, which were mostly the odors of burning or burnt, burnt refuse.  And so I, I remember that initially.  I think over time the, the techniques for controlling that got, got to be, got to be better but I, I do recall that.  I remember the sounds of the ice cream truck which would be coming through the neighborhood in the afternoon when we got in.  I learned sports in the, on the streets.  We didn't have any parks that would, that were, that were nearby and so we played different games in the, in the streets.  We played like stick ball game.  We played a game called Fumble which we also played with a, with, with a bat.  I wouldn't call it stick ball in that it was an actual bat but usually using a tennis, tennis ball as, as our, as our ball and the idea was to cleanly field.  You take turns at bat and you had to cleanly field the, the ball.  If you cleanly fielded it, then you got a chance to bat.  If you didn't, then that was a fumble and the person would continue, continue to bat.  We also played touch football in-in, in the streets.  You know, the idea of a park and playing ball in such was a little bit foreign to me for the most part although there was a, like a pauper's field next to a graveyard which was not, not very far away and there were times that I would join the--some of the guys in the neighborhood and go over to this field and we would play some tackle, tackle football.  That wasn't one of my loves but I, I do recall doing that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now what about music or you know you could smell the, the dump--
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: --but there, there, was there any better smells around than--
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  My mother [Elizabeth Reese Gunn] loved, loved barbecue and on Friday evenings one, one of the best smells was the smell of the barbecue pit not very far from the Green Apartments where we had got, gotten our start in Ft. Lauderdale.  We'd go, often times go over for barbecue sandwiches and that was, you know, just a great smell of the smok-the charcoal smoke, smoking of ribs and so that was a, a fabulous, fabulous smell from-from, from my youth.  The other smell that that I have was a very sweet smell and that is that my--we had a nice yard, the corner lot and we had gardenias beside, beside the house.  And so I remember, you know, especially in the, the springtime the smell of blooming gardenias and, which is a lovely, lovely smell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I was asking you about sounds.  Was music important to you growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  There was a black radio station called WRBD AM.  I believe it was 1430; 1430 or 1470.  But WRBD played all the hits and it featured disk jockeys who would, would talk with, (laughs) with the music (laughs), they'd cut-in frequently (laughs), offering their comments and such.  And so you know listening to folk like James Brown, Joe Tex, you know, Wilson Pickett and many others.  You know, just soul, soul music that was, that was a great memory but WRBD was the, the station.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35218
Speaker 1: Now in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] are, are you--I'm trying to picture where Ft. Lauderdale is.
Speaker 2: About thirty miles from north of Miami [Florida]--
Speaker 1: Um hm.
Speaker 2: --and about sixty miles south of West Palm Beach [Florida].  Maybe not that, quite that far southwest of Palm Beach but between forty and, and sixty miles and its right, right on the coast.
Speaker 1: I know it's a popular vacation location--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and did you have a chance to go to the beach much or--
Speaker 2: I did.  You know I have one memory of going to the beach in-in, in Ft. Lauderdale when the beaches were still segregated and so the black folk would have to catch a ferry to what I understand is now called Dania Beach.  The nice thing about Dania Beach is that there were shade trees there where on Ft. Lauderdale Beach you have palm trees, but palm trees aren't really shade trees.  But I believe they were called Australian birch trees.  And so on the Dania Beach where the black people had to go we didn't have the palms but you did have the birch trees which provided some, some shade.  And so I remember riding this, this ferry.  I probably was no more than about four, four years old when we did that.
Speaker 1: Was the beach out on, on an island on something or, or--
Speaker 2: Uh--
Speaker 1: --on the other side of--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I don't think it was an island per se but you had to cross--maybe a bit of an island, a cause-causeway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that was before a, before a bridge had been built to, to make access, access easy.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35219
Speaker 1: All right, so, well tell us about school now Dillard Elementary [School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you like school?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  I went to Helen's Nursery so I didn't have uh--I, I believe they probably called it Helen's Nursery and Kindergarten and I went for one year.  I don't think I really learned a lot.  You know, I don't know if I, I probably knew colors, I probably knew the ABC song but not, not a whole lot.  I certainly didn't know how to read when I went to, when I went to Dillard Elementary School.  So one of the memories that I have my father [Willy Julian Gunn] being a teacher particularly and he taught English most of the time, when I got to--when we moved into the house, which was in October of 1964.  My father, rather than being able to go outside and, and play, my father would sit me down and we went through the reading, reading lessons and such so that I could get up, up to speed; and those lessons were invaluable because I don't recall actually struggling in school but I certainly got up to a point where reading became a lot easier to me and, of course, reading is, is such a powerful key that by the, by the end of that year, by second grade I was, I was up to speed and I was in, certainly in the top group.  Because in, in those days the, you know, it would be just one teacher in the room.  We didn't have a teacher's aide or, or anything else and my first grade teacher Mrs., Mrs. Foreman would have groups.  So it would to Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 and you wanted to be in Group 1, well at least I did.  Maybe it's just a competitive nature part of me.  And that was the highest level reading group.  I don't think I started out in that group but by the end of first grade I'm, I'm pretty sure that I was in, in Group 1 and that, that pretty much, that continued throughout elementary school where I was a good student.  We got Ss and Ns I think for satisfactory, not satisfactory first through third grade, at least then.  If memory serves me right I think we transitioned to traditional A, A through F scheme and I, I did, did very, very well and so I'm, I'm not sure about the, the grading in terms of when, you know, when that transition, when that transition was.
Speaker 1: It's usually after primary school when they start you with grades.
Speaker 2: Um hmm, and may be that was it.  If, if that, if that's so, then I was certainly an all S student, all satisfactory and I remember one of the proudest moments of, of my youth and my career in elementary school was that my teacher, my fifth grade teacher, Ms. Ethel Downing, gave, gave me a trophy at the end of the year.  I was ill and couldn't receive it in person but I got it eventually and it was for being all around boy because I was, I was good in a number, number of areas.  And I also had many leadership opportunities in, in elementary school--
Speaker 1: Hmm!
Speaker 2: --and those paid, paid huge dividends.  You know one of my--while I say I'm an attorney, I'm actually a person that's been blessed with many leadership opportunities throughout my life.  When I was a-in fourth grade, I was a-the homeroom or the-my class representative to the student counsel.  In fifth grade I became I became the treasurer of the student counsel and by the sixth grade I was the president of the student counsel.  And, and those were elected positions and I was, and so I continued to do different things in student government and to have other opportunities over, over the years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35220
Speaker 1: Now I-I read that, that the church afforded opportunities too for leadership right?
Speaker 2: It certainly did.
Speaker 1: What church did your family attend?
Speaker 2: We attended the Greater New Mount Olive Baptist Church [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and my parents [Elizabeth Reese Gunn and Willy Julian Gunn] still attend Mount Olive Baptist.  In those days it was Rev. George E. Weaver was the, was the pastor of the church and I joined which I was about ten years old; got baptized at, at that church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you participate in what Sunday school in the--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: I don't know what they call it.
Speaker 2: I did, the Sunday school, the Easter pageant, the Christmas play and various other, other things.  What church did for me, you know, getting the opportunity to memorize speeches and be in different, different programs, it built up confidence.  Also in elementary school I had opportunities to appear in plays and such and I-I found myself on the stage at, at an early age.  And those, those opportunities have, I believe I still continue to call upon the, the confidence that I, that I gained in, in those settings to this, to this day.  It gave me a very, very firm foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35221
Speaker 1: Now I've read that early in life you decided; what you were saying that that trip to-the, the long car trip in the Valiant--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you went to Colonial Williamsburg [Virginia] gave you the idea that you wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Um hm.
Speaker 1: Was this, so what I'm, I'm wondering you know what aspect of that trip, you know, made you think about the law cause, cause in Colonial Williamsburg, I don't know, when I think about the personalities, I mean--I don't know.  What, what; tell us, what, what was it?
Speaker 2: Well I think hearing about Patrick Henry and hearing about Thomas Jefferson, these governors of Virginia, and these men about town in old Williamsburg, Williamsburg of the 18th Century.  That was, that was fascinating to me.  For some reason Patrick Henry's supposed words of "give me liberty or give me death," that those, those rang, rang with me.  Now I wasn't reconciling what these gentlemen were saying with the fact that they were slave holders.  At (laughs), at that time that, that came, that came later.  But when I saw that and then came here and I continued to, to hear about such things, wow!  The, the Lincoln Memorial--well Lincoln was a lawyer and I'm, I'm hearing about these different things.  All of those things I think played, played a part and say "Hmm, this law thing is, is very, very interesting."   When, when I was very young, I was like many, many young, young children in that I was focused on; people ask, "Well what do you want to be when you grow up?" and I might say "I wanna be an architect.  I want to design buildings" or "I wanna be a fireman."  Well I don't remember fireman, but I certainly remember saying that I wanted to be an architect and so just different ideas popped into my head over, over time.  But this, this law thing I, I think when Ms., when Mrs. [Ethel] Downing Dillard Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] gave me the award for being all around boy, that really was important to me because, and it still is important to me from the standpoint of that is who I am, from the standpoint of I have many, many interests and so when I saw that law was something that allowed one to branch out and to do a great many things that, that was appealing.  That resonated with the person that I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35222
Speaker 1: Now it is often said that someone with a breadth of knowledge, you know, would make a better lawyer because they know about lot of different things.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: So now, you know, what did you like to do when you were growing up?  Did-did, did you have time, did you have to work or anything growing up or did you have time to explore?
Speaker 2: I, I had time to explore.  I was always involved in, in activities.  Again from elementary school [Dillard Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] I was in, in the plays and I liked, I liked to perform.  I've al--I suppose I've always liked to be on the stage.  I got opportunities to, rather than being in the talent shows at, at elementary school, I was the master of ceremonies for the, for the talent shows.  And so my teachers gave me opportunities to do, to use my voice and so that, that was fun.  I liked to read.  You know I had a, a traumatic experience when I was about nine years old, the summer of 1968. My, my maternal grandmother died, Annie May McCurdy and that, I'd been pretty close to my maternal grandmother.  Before then I, I'd gone to funerals and such, but that was the first time that I can recall not going to the funeral of a close family member.  My mother [Elizabeth Rese Gunn] went but my brother [Demetrius Gunn] and I and my father [Willy Julian Gunn] we, we stayed in, in Florida and there was something about that experience that I, I found, I found traumatic.  I don't know.  Perhaps I would have been better off going, going to the funeral.  But I found myself in a period of time where it was difficult to sleep, I stayed up a lot.  One of the things that they kept me through, it provided many opportunities to read during, during that times.  I'd be reading late into the night.  I was a frequent customer at the, at the library.  They had reading charts and such and I was, I was near the, near the top, if not at the very top of, of the readers where you'd get your block checked off if you've read, read a book.  And I was just reading, reading all, all the time.  So I would so that I love to read.  I did like to play with my, my colleagues.  (Laughs)  Colleagues, (laughs) with my playmates, my neighbors and we would play the, the different games that I mentioned:  Fumble, Kick Ball, you know a little form of baseball in, in the streets, a little Four Square and different, different games.  So most of the games seemed to be around, you know, some form of athletic competition and and some, again some football.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35223
Speaker 1: Now in '68 (1968) Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did--was that discussed in your home very much or [unclear]--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I recall getting the news that Dr. King had been shot I think it was a Thurs-Thursday night because we were dying eggs and such.  We were gonna have a, a Easter party.  I think the next day was, was Good Friday and about to have a break, a break in school.  And I recall being, being home with, with my mom [Elizabeth Reese Gunn] and someone else was over there and hearing this news.  You know, I was very much aware of Dr. King before then.  I had, being from Birmingham [Alabama] I had relatives that; I had an aunt and uncle who marched during the, the time when the, the Commissioner of Public Safety, Bull Connor, turned the hoses on, on the young people.  I can recall the funeral of the three girls who were killed at the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church.  And so those were all you know part, part of my memory.  So I very much remember Dr. King's death and watching the funeral on TV and participating in a march.  I believe that Sunday there was a march that you know after church a group of churches got, got together and had, had marched, had a march there in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Now in terms of movement in Ft. Lauderdale were you, do you remember any of that or did your, your par--were your parents [mother, and father, Willy Julian Gunn] are part of any of the organizations in--
Speaker 2: I. I can't--
Speaker 1: --Ft. Lauderdale?
Speaker 2: --recall you know any protest movement in, in Ft. Lauderdale per se.  I don't know if there was an active movement.  I think in the summers, I'm not sure if it was the summer of '67 (1967) or '68 (1968), but there were riots in, in Ft. Lauderdale.  I don't know what you know if they were precipitating events.  You know those were years people talk about there being long hot summers and violence certainly was, was alive and well in, in the black community in Ft. Lauderdale and very close.  Some of this violence was near places where we used to live before moving over to, to Westwood Park.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35224
Speaker 1: So now did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: I did.  In 1970 I, I think is when I left elementary school [Dillard Elementary School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida].  So off to, off to the seventh grade and I went to Nova Middle School in Davie, Florida.  Davie is D-A-V-I-E. And that was the time forced busing started in, in-in the Ft. Lauderdale area.  If I'd gone to my neighborhood school, I would have gone to Lauderhill Middle School along with my classmates.  But Nova was built as an experimental school where children were allowed to work at their pace.  There were open classrooms and it was quite a distance from me.  So I would still have to, I'd have to get over to; well actually my father [Willy Julian Gunn] would drop me off for, for a bus and the bus was a couple miles away from, from where we lived and he was on his way.  At that time he was leaving Dillard High School for South Broward High School.  So in, in Ft. Lauderdale racial integration took on the form that children from black neighborhoods such as myself were being disbursed largely to integrate the, the other schools.  And for me it was off to Nova, Nova Middle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it you're being bused into a mostly white school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But beca-but Nova was unique because children were coming from all over the county because of the experimental nature of the school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how did, did you have to test into this school?
Speaker 2: No, no I didn't.
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: No just, I think you opted, opted in.
Speaker 1: Okay, all.  So well how, how did it work?  Did you, did you take to the, the open policies of the school?
Speaker 2: There was a part of me that loved the freedom but if you looked at, you know, grades and progress (laughs) and such. I don't think that I was, it was the, the best fit.  I think I'm a person and at that age to be pushed a bit.  There were some areas like science [unclear] which has remained with me where we had what were called Learning Activity Packages called "LAPs" and I would do LAP after LAP.  I would complete these packages and go on and take a test and I'd be successful and I was far ahead of my peers with, with respect to that.  There are other areas you know being so far from home I didn't have, feel the same sense of accountability that I once felt at Dillard Elementary where my father was basically across the parking lot and could be called at any time.  School started, classes didn't start until like 10:00,10:00 in the morning because people again were coming from all over the county and classes ended about 4:00 in the afternoon.  And typically to get home I think the vast majority of the days that I had to walk, walk the two miles or so home.  It wasn't--I didn't particularly distinguish myself academically during my middle school days.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Now by this time; now did you know any black any lawyers in--
Speaker 1: I did not.
Speaker 2: --Fort Lauderdale [Florida]?
Speaker 1: I surely didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so your grades are kind of, they're okay but not; you weren't doing your best work?
Speaker 1: Right.  When I graduated from sixth grade as, you know, I was president of the student council, involved in some of every, everything there was to be involved in, top, top student.  You know to the extent a sixth grader can be a big man on campus, (laughs) I was the big man on campus.  Seventh and eighth grade, particularly eighth grade I, I cut some classes to play basketball out, out on the courts because there was so much freedom and I think it was really a bit too much freedom for me.  And also it was an environment; some of the classes were taught in areas was, where there were no walls.  So there were big, big open spaces where groups of students were together and there were too, too many distractions for me.
Story_ID: 35225
Speaker 1: Now you're pretty tall.  You're, what are you?  6'4", 6'5" [height]?
Speaker 2: Actually about 6'7".
Speaker 1: 6'7".  Okay, all right.  So were you tall as a youth?
Speaker 2: I was.  I was always above average height.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I take after members of my mother's [Elizabeth Reese Gunn] family.  My, my father [Willy Julian Gunn] is only about 5'10"; my mother is about 5'8" but she had brothers at least two of whom were 6'5" or over.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you gravitate towards basketball [unclear]?
Speaker 2: I did.  That was my number one sport but the first sport that I played in an organized manner in, in a league or anything was little league football when I was in, in the eighth grade and we did at a placed called Holiday Park in, in Fort Lauderdale [Florida].  My parents signed me up and I would have liked to have played basketball but the basketball opportunity was on the middle school team there in Davie [Florida] and I guess I didn't present that convincingly enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I was just wondering about, so you didn't play basketball in middle school then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Formally anyway.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35226
Speaker 1: Alright, so, so now where did you go to high school?  Did, did--
Speaker 2: After my middle school [Davie, Florida], that middle school experience, my parents [Willy Julian Gunn and Elizabeth Reese Gunn] and I agreed that let's try the so-called neighborhood school.  Neighborhood school though was about ten miles away and it's a school called Piper High School in Sunrise, Florida.  It had only opened about a year, a year earlier.  So brand new school in an area that was largely undeveloped and like I said about ten miles away from where I lived but all the kids in my neighborhood went to Piper, Piper High, and because that was, that was a large part of the population of the black kids for that school.  When I got there, Piper in, in--during my time there Piper was about 20 to 25 percent black.  When I got to Piper I found more structure than I had experienced in, in middle school and I started to hit my stride.  It took me a while again and in one instance, at least with respect to math but I got involved in sports almost right, right away.  My earth science teacher ended up being my coach for basketball and first, first day or first week or so of class and he would say that cross country would be a great way to get in shape for basketball and so I went out for the cross country team.  And so I, I ran cross country my first and second year, as freshman, sophomore and I played basketball ninth, tenth and twelfth grade.  Had an experience as a eleventh grader that where I didn't end up; started the season but didn't finish the season.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I didn't quite understand that last part.  Now you, you started the season in the eleventh grade but you didn't finish?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did you get injured or--
Speaker 2: Oh no!  In the eleventh grade so I'd, I'd played in ninth grade:  started the season off as a starter on the team, eventually lost my spot.  Again that was my first time playing organized basketball and a guy who was much shorter than I but a lot tougher than I ended up taking, taking my spot.  And it was a great learning and humbling experience.  I played a lot more, got better, got, got a little more tougher.  As a sophomore I started the entire season as, as a center on the team.  So in eleventh grade the idea was to move up the varsity and I, and I did move, move up to varsity and we had ah, a, a situation.  The coach of the team he made a comment to, to one of the guys during--a white coach and Coach Hall and he made a comment to one of the guys on the team, a guy by the name of George Hardy, who was my, my classmate.  George had done something that Coach wasn't satisfied and Coach Hall made a comment along the lines of "Hardy you better get your black ass up!"  And that didn't sit very well with me.  Afterwards I, I remember--this was around Game 3 or so of the, of the season and we had a meeting, actually had a meeting at my, at my house.  And we decided that we wanted to do something about the, the coach's, the coach's remarks.  And so what we arranged was a, a protest and that we were going to walk off the team and that we were going to speak to the principal, Mr. Biel, about why we were walking, walking off the team.
Speaker 1: Now I take this isn't the only offense that Mr., Coach Hardy had made ah--
Speaker 2: Coach Hall.
Speaker 1: Hall--
Speaker 2: Coach Hall.
Speaker 1: --Hall, Hall.  Okay.  It was Hardy who he yelled at.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this wasn't Coach Hall's first offense and there were, there were; were there, there a stockpile of grievances or--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --just that one?
Speaker 2: I, I can't, I can't recall others at this point in time.  I think that, I honestly cannot recall others and as I think back now, as you know being fifty, fifty-something and the, you know more than thirty--well I guess, that was probably 1974.  So we are almost forty years later.  I probably would have handled the situation a bit differently, but at that, at that time I was, I was offended as were several other members of, of the team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35227
Speaker 1: So that one remark basically that, that people took exception and the black students I guess-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the black players and so well what, what happen?  Did you carry out your plan?
Speaker 2: Well we went to see the principal; we let him know about, about the situation and told him that we're, we're going to walk, walk from the team and myself and a few others guys did in fact walk from the team, ended up leave, leaving the team and not playing that year.  A few guys who had initially walked out decided to go back and I remember having a conversation with my, with Coach Ingraham.  Who taught me and coached me in, in ninth grade and Coach wasn't so much trying to get me to, to, to go back but he would say hey--I would recall a conversation "Willie Gunn look you're going to go to college.  You're going to succeed regardless of where you go.  You have some guys on, on, on this team," and he was talking about one of my classmates and team mates in particular, that if he; basketball can be a way for him to, to go forwards.  "So you need to understand that he needs to be back in, in that environment."  I didn't try to hold anybody back or anything along those lines.  I was a participant even though the, this walkout we had the meeting at my house.  I don't necessarily know if I was the ringleader but I did feel that; I guessed I must have felt that the coach didn't have my best interest at, at heart.  So I didn't want to be a part of, of, of the enterprise but some of my team mates went, went back.  And at the end of the eleventh year that was actually Coach Hall's last year of coaching there and the next year Coach Ingraham, who had been my ninth grade coach became the varsity coach at, at Piper High School.
Speaker 1: Did, did you play in your senior year?
Speaker 2: I did.  [Simultaneous]  So I went back to the team and I started and had, had a good season.
Speaker 1: So what position did you play?
Speaker 2: I played center or I guess what you know four five as they, they use the terminology today.  We had a team where we misran an offense with a point guard and really four post players is, is how you know who would swing out but most of my time was spent under, underneath.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I would figure that.  You, you were probably the tallest on the team or--
Speaker 2: (Smiling) I was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I was, and I was if not 6'7" I was at least 6'6" by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 35228
Speaker 1: So, now in high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] did, did your grades improve?
Speaker 2: My grades improved throughout.  I had an experience as, as a freshman where there was a period of time I think I must have lost my, my Algebra I book and Algebra I just wasn't clicking with me.  I, I don't think I really concentrated on math since sixth grade and it, I paid a price for that in, in ninth grade, nearly flunked out of Algebra I, wasn't doing my homework, wasn't spending sufficient time in that.  My dad [Willy Julian Gunn] told me after ninth grade and squeaked by I think with a D average in that class that I needed to take general math.  And I did and I got As in general math as a tenth grader and eleventh grader and then as a, as a senior I took geometry and got an A there.  So I got on track.  By the time of sophomore year I was getting just about all, all As and I ended up graduating in the top ten, ten percent of my, my high school class.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, now did you run for student office, office in high school too?
Speaker 2: I did.  At the end of my tenth grade year I ran for student council vice president and I think after a moving speech I, I got, I got a rousing speech, I got, got elected as vice president.  And during my junior year it was, it was interesting.  I had the chance to lead the pep rally and such.  So I had a lot of visibility on, on, on campus.  My--it's interesting the day of the very first student council meeting, we're getting ready for the meeting and the president of the student council who was a senior passed out, had to be taken to the hospital and she was out of school for a while, and I ended up you know stepping into her duties.  She came back later on but because she was out for a while I stepped into those responsibilities, started doing the pep rallies and got a lot of, lot of exposure and I was involved--even though my junior basketball didn't work out, I had, my time was filled with all kinds of other activities to include student government.  By the end of my junior year I ran for president of the student council for my senior year and I ran unopposed and so that's, that's what I did as a, as a senior.
Story_ID: 35229
Speaker 1: Now while you were a senior in, in high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida]-- well junior and senior, I guess, year ah--I'm thinking about the Watergate hearings--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that take place.  Now they're televised you know--
Speaker 2: Absolutely!
Speaker 1: --and the screen is filled with lawyers--
Speaker 2: (Smiling) Yes.
Speaker 1: --John Dean, everybody, you know, all these lawyers--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --Sam Irving, you know; judges and lawyers all over the place.
Speaker 2: [unclear]
Speaker 1: So did, did you watch the--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --hearings?
Speaker 2: --sure did.  I sure did.  I don't, I don't recall now if that was the summer of 73' of the summer of 74 but I watched the Watergate hearings and you know these figures that you mentioned.  I remember seeing Barbara Jordan, Sam-Senator Sam Irving, absolutely, and seeing John Dean and John Mitchell testify.  And it was fascinating; so many moving parts, riveting TV.  You know, even you know for a, a young teen like, like myself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, high stakes courtroom drama or hearing drama or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --every day.
Speaker 2: Indeed.
Speaker 1: And a recap every night of it.
Speaker 2: (Smiling and nodding.)  Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So was this like a, um reinforce your desire to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: I, I think so.  You know I will tell you in 1986; so fast forward--I'd just graduated from law school and I went to my ten-year high school reunion, having graduated in 1976.  When I went to that reunion, I opened up a high school yearbook that, that was there.  And so underneath everyone's name they had ambition and for mine it said attorney and that was like a revelation for me because I didn't have a conscious memory of having stated that.  So yes when I was you know when I was nine years old or so that seed was planted but it wasn't something that I was consciously pursuing over time.  But as the years went by I, there were opportunities that came up and things that I did well in and so it just, it just made sense.  It, it felt right for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35230
Speaker 1: What was this, was this Piper High School [Fort Lauderdale, Florida] completely integrated in terms of the teaching staff too?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And teachers, black or white, did you have any mentors at Piper?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I mentioned Coach Butch Ingraham, actually Coach Richard Ingraham, who had attended Dillard High [School, Fort Lauderdale].  My father [Willy Julian Gunn] taught him and one of the first things he told me he said "Your dad gave me an F."  (Laughs)  So that was an interesting start.  He was my teacher in like I said earth science and my ninth grade basketball coach and my coach of the varsity when I, when I was a senior but he gave many, many opportunities.  In fact, I became the captain of my ninth grade team and so he was, he was definitely a mentor and unfortunately he died prematurely in 2005.  But he was a very, a very good man and made a, made a really big, big difference in my life.  Mrs. Cora Sudden(?) taught me college review English and rhetoric and Mrs. Sudden was one of the most demanding teachers.  I had an incident when I was a senior in, in high school where the, she assigned a, a term paper and this term paper was due either late April or early May.  And I remember hearing some of my classmates talk who said that you know the term paper was worth so little comparatively that they weren't going to turn in the term paper because they had done the calculation and they could get a zero on the term paper and still do all right in the class.  That sounded like an appealing idea to me.  So I decided to follow that, that strategy.  I'd done some work but hadn't, wasn't close to finishing the paper.  Well Mrs. Sudden used the teachers' directory to call my father and by this time I'd already been accepted into the Air Force Academy.  I believe I got my notice of acceptance around April 19th.  So the timing I know it was after that.  And Mrs. Sudden told my father what, what I had done.  She didn't know the reasons but she told (laughs) him that I hadn't turned in the paper.  And so my father and I had a conversation and he told me that Mrs. Sudden says that you didn't turn this in and what you needed to know that even though you've been accepted to the Academy, offers of admission can be withdrawn.  So she's going to give you another opportunity to turn in, to turn in this paper.  So I think I had like till the end of the week and I had a couple of all-nighters in there but I turned in my paper and she marked me down a letter grade in each, each of three categories but I ended up with an A.  And I still reflect on that and I've had an opportunity to tell how much I just appreciate thinking enough about me to not allow me to get away with foolishness.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now were you uh, any other mentors in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. [Unclear]
Speaker 2: Mrs. Powers was another English teacher.  I never had her for a class but she was the advisor on the class play I think my junior year and she was also the advisor for forensics.  I never was a debate student but I did go out for the public speaking program.  Again, opportunities opened up my junior year and it's when I did that and I found that I was very good at extemporaneous speaking and I was thinking about debate but she was the director of that.  She was, she was pointing out to me, said why are you saying w-i-t-h.  Why are you pronouncing that "wiff" and she was saying that is properly pronounced "with."  And so she was pointing out different, different things to me and challenging me and providing me with opportunities and also encouraging me.  Another teacher, Mrs. Peachy Rose was an English teacher; maybe because my dad [Willy Julian Gunn] was an English teacher, these folks made a difference but uh--
Speaker 1: Mrs. Peachy Rose.
Speaker 2: Peachy Rose from I believe Barstow, Florida.  And then those were a few that you know really, really stand, stand out.  Also my student government advisor, John Gordon, was my student government advisor as a junior and I certainly consider him to, to be a mentor.
Story_ID: 35231
Speaker 1: Now did you take ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] in uh--
Speaker 2: It was not available in my high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] so I, I did not take it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay; so no ROTC.  What kind of counseling did, did you have?  Did you have good counseling in, in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did but I, I think, well I know I was tremendously blessed having my father [Willy Julian Gunn] and having my father as you know a teacher being in the school system, being an educated man.  Again back to my father's family, my dad was a only child up until he was about fourteen or fifteen years old and that's when my grandmother had another set of children.  And so my Aunt Ernestine was, was born in, around 1954 I believe and then an Aunt Doris that was born about a year later and then an Uncle Carl who was born in 1956.  So my Uncle Carl is just two years, two and a half years older than I am and so while I'm in high school, my dad was working with him and encouraging him to look at college and look at different opportunities.  One of the things that he talked to him about was ROTC ad looking at that as a possibility of ways of going to school.   So I was looking at some of this material thing, things through that and also the services were advertising in student government publications and such.  And I loved what they had to say.  The service academies for instance were all marketing themselves around the all, the whole person concept.  And the idea you know you need to be good academically, athletically and from a militarily leader prospective and the ROTC programs were similar.  And again going back to Mrs. [Ethel] Downing in fifth grade about being the all-around boy, I said, "That's, that's it!"  I was as a high school student, I was a good student but again because of that rocky start in Algebra I had to work my, work my grades up, my grade GPA [grade point average] up, then I had to, in athletics I was a, I was a good athlete but I wasn't an all-county or here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] there's all-Met.  You know I wasn't that type of athlete.  No Division One schools were coming to watch me play and as far as, but from a leadership perspective I was leading some of everything.  So I was off the charts as a, as a student leader but no one was paying, that I knew of, was paying or giving scholarships for student leadership.  So from my vantage point what I wanted to do what was really in my heart in those days I wanted to go to school and have someone else pick up the tab.  I didn't want that on my parents [father, and mother, Elizabeth Reese Gunn] because I thought I was good enough to, to do that.  And so when I told my dad about my interest in ROTC and my interest in the academies, he was more than happy to help me to apply for nomination to the service academies and make sure my applications and such were filled out properly.
Story_ID: 35232
Speaker 1: Now, now are you, did you apply to all the service academies or--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did, and in, around December of 1975, so December of my senior year, I was invited to Tallahassee [Florida], the state capital where Senator Stone, one of the senators from Florida was, had invited, I only remember boys.  Maybe there were girls there because, of course, the first class of women entered the services academies that following fall, in the fall of 1976.  But he invited people that applied and were interested in service academy nominations to meet his panel of, of advisors who were considering who the nomination should go to.  So my parents [Willy Julian Gunn and Elizabeth Reese Gunn] paid for me to go up to Tallahassee.  I travelled on my own up there and the, I went in, into these interviews with the attitude of any service academy that wants me, it doesn't matter.  Annapolis wouldn't be bad because again I'd fallen in love with [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] when I first passed through here and so Annapolis being close to Baltimore [Maryland], close to D.C. that, that seemed to be interesting.  West Point [United States Military Academy] not that far from, from New York.  Air Force Academy, ennh, not nah, not as much but--I was, I was willing to consider.  But when I got to Tallahassee, I was listening to different folks talk, especially the white guys, there weren't very many black, black guys there, but I was listening to various ones talk about how their first choice was the Air Force Academy and I remember asking somebody why.  He said it's the wave of the future and so I--its high technology.  Don't know if they used the term "technology" in those days but it's, it's something, it's, it's, it's modern.  And so I started to think about the, the Air Force Academy really seriously around that time.  And also that year I had a recruiter from the Air Force Academy Minority Affairs Office come to my high school--
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: --and he started advising me and following me and tracking me and encouraging me to retake the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test], which I must have taken about five times.
Speaker 1: Really!  Did, did you score low the first time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes I did; particularly in math and so I needed to get those scores up.  So he would provide me with advice ad counsel in terms of how to improve my scores.  One thing he told me, "Don't guess."  If you have no idea what the answer is, leave it blank.  If you can narrow it down to two, then go ahead and--
Speaker 1: Guess.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: --answer it and so just the test taking technique.  Not realizing we're not focusing in on the fact that on the SAT they took off for wrong answers but they didn't penalize you if the answers were just blank.  So I, I, I appreciated, I appreciated that counseling.  My gr--and my scores went up gradually and by that spring I had scores that were high enough to get over the, the minimum hurdle to get into the Academy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35233
Speaker 1: Now did, did they [U.S. Air Force Academy] offer you any kind of scholarship then?
Speaker 2: For everyone that goes to the service academies are on full scholarship--
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is something I'm sure a young, any young people watching this interview in the future will want to know too.  So if you go the, any of the service academies and you're accepted and you get in, you, you don't have to pay tuition?
Speaker 2: You don't have to pay anything.  I think they ask you to bring a check when you get there to help with the initial expense for your, your uniforms but not only is there no tuition, you're also getting paid while, while you're there.  So you get a, a salary during, during that time.  So all of that was very appealing (laughs) to, to me as I looked at opportunities.  Plus I'll tell you my, when this gentleman, I'll have to go back and check his name.  I think his name may have been O'Neal but he was a member of the Class of 1975 from the Air Force Academy and he came to my high school.  He was with the Minority Affairs Office and he gave a presentation.  I attended that presentation and he talked about how tough the service academy was, how tough the Air Force Academy was but yet he knew it was the right place for him.  And I guess it was the middle school experience of learning that I needed to be in places that, where I can be pushed, where people could push, push me.  It sounded like a, just a great fit, very competitive.  And so my senior year I applied for four schools.  I applied, I believe it was--well actually I applied for, for three schools directly.  I applied for the University of Florida because my guidance counselor and others encouraged me to, encouraged everyone to apply for a state school.  And I applied for George Washington University here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia].  And I applied for Howard and I applied for George Washington because again, I loved, loved D.C. and (laughs) going back to that trip in the 1960s.  And then I applied for the service academies.  And when I had the presentation and this, and this lieutenant was calling me up and giving me feedback on my scores and the things I needed to do, missing aspects of my application that made, that made a, that made a difference to me.  You know he was, he was tracking me.  Maybe it's the way a top athlete feels when they are being recruited by a, by a school and, and they'll often say, "Well, this one started recruiting me years ago and they always stayed in touch and it made a difference."  Well, it definitely made a difference for me and I believe that's where I was supposed to be.  And that was the Air Force Academy.
Story_ID: 35234
Speaker 1: Tell us about the [U.S.] Air Force Academy.  Who were some of the personalities there that made an impression on you and did you see yourself becoming a pilot or something at that point?
Speaker 2: Well if you'll allow me to, I'd like to go back a little bit.  I, I mentioned earlier that I'd gone to Senator Stone's event in Tallahassee [Florida] in, in December of that year.  Around that time, I'm not sure, it may have been that I'd already had the visit from the, from the lieutenant from the Academy's Minority Affairs Office or it was shortly thereafter that, that I went to that but a nomination didn't come from, from that.  Instead, I, I still remember it was the night of the State of the Union Address in January of 1976 that I got a phone call from Senator Lawton Chiles who later on became the governor of, of Florida.  But he was a U.S. senator at, at that time.  And Senator Chiles called me and (laughs) you know asked me if I would be interested in being nominated to the, to the Air Force Academy, and I told him certainly.  I think he mentioned that one of the people on his list of nominees had, had dropped out and so I was very pleased to have, to get that nomination.  So I believe the way that it worked the lieutenant from the Air Force Academy visited my school in, in the fall.  I told him that I was already in the process.  I'd asked for nominations from the senators and from the congressman, our house, house of, member of the House of Representatives and then I went to Tallahassee.  It didn't work out that way but because the help of the Minority Affairs Office they made sure that I, my name got proper consideration and so I was just very, very pleased.  A few months later, as I mentioned, I, I had to take the SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] multiple times in order to get scores high enough but in April I think it was around Spring Break that I got news that I'd been accepted into the Air Force, Air Force Academy.  And I was excited.  My dad [Willy Julian Gunn] asked me, maybe it was my mother [Elizabeth Reese Gunn], who initially (laughs) asked me if I was going to accept it or if I was going to do something else.  My dad's attitude was "of course he's going to accept it," but that was also my attitude that I was really convinced by that time that the service academies were the best, best place for me.  And so I went off the Air Force Academy in the third week of June of 1976.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't have much of a summer off--
Speaker 2: I sure didn't.  [Simultaneous]
Speaker 1: --[unclear] right off.
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida], had graduation around the June 7th I believe and then off to the Air Force Academy and I get there I believe on June 27th and start on Monday.  I'd have to check the calendar but I believe it was Monday, June 28, 1976.  So I had a, a summer of about three weeks.
Story_ID: 35235
Speaker 1: Before doi-before going out there [U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado] I had been working out.  People had warned me about the high altitude; it's over 7,000 feet above sea level.  You know people talk about Denver [Colorado] being the Mile High City, well add a couple of thousand feet more and you got the Air Force Academy there in the foothills of the, the Rocky Mountains.
Speaker 2: That's in Boulder [Colorado], right?
Speaker 1: Colorado Springs [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Colorado Springs?
Speaker 1: Colorado Springs.
Speaker 2: I keep wanting to make it Boulder.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, okay--[Simultaneous]
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: --Colorado Springs.
Speaker 1: Indeed.  And so I, I got there.  I traveled with two guys that I met also from Fort Lauderdale [Florida] who had also gotten appointments.  They, two white guys, one from Stranahan High [school] and another I, I can't recall which school that he had gone to but, but I think there were actually four guys from Ft. Lauderdale there at the Air Force Academy entering in, in the Summer of '76 and at least three of us graduated.  One I lost, I lost track of.  The Academy, I was expecting it to be tough and it was.  (Laughs)  It was very tough, very, very demanding.  You, you get there and by the end of the first day they have you marching.  They have, upper classman are administering discipline.  They're, they're leading the, the cadets, the under, under, the new basic cadets.  And you get there and it's the first six weeks is basic cadet training and so they're, they're stretching you physically, mentally.  You're having to learn knowledge, memorize various things:  poems, quotes, the mission of the Air Force Academy, the mission of the Air Force, man's flight through life is the same by, sustained by the power of his knowledge; (laughs) some of things that I remember.  Memorizing all four verses of the Star Spangled Banner, various things and then you, you had milestones and you had to check them off and it was phenomenal.  I remember my first roommate; a guy from Kansas City by the name of Dale Haar, H-A-A-R, and Dale was in love with his high school sweetheart Tammy and he'd constantly talked about Tammy, and Dale was a basic cadet superstar.  It was ironic though I think he ended up leaving the Air Force Academy before the end of his, his first year.  I did okay in, in basic cadet training.  I wasn't a superstar that Dale was, didn't memorize the stuff quite as, quite as fast but I got through everything and wasn't labeled a screw-up, which was a good thing.  So I get to my squadron, I was in 17th Squadron.  There are forty, at that time there were forty squadrons of cadets at the Air Force Academy.  Basic cadet training is, was over by early August and classes were starting around August 9th if, if memory serves, serves me right.  But it was very early August that classes were starting and classes were demanding.  You know in a typical school you're talking about you're talking about 12-14 semester hours, including all the requirements that they had on us it was 18-20 hours.  And the Academy was very much an endurance test, demanding.  You had to be, you had to learn time management and you had to master time management.  There were many people there that had been honor students, valedictorians and salutatorians, leaders of, of various sorts and some that didn't make it even though they'd had stellar academic careers up until that point.  They didn't make it because all of the demands that were forced, forced on them and, and not only was it demanding at, with respect to quantity, a large part of the curriculum was mandatory classes.  Later on you can major but that first year just about all mandatory and pretty, pretty demanding stuff.
Story_ID: 35236
Speaker 1: Now what about uh, that was the question I asked in the beginning here, what about mentors and personalities there in, at the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado]?  Who, were there any--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were there any people like that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely and, and I'll just say that I've been blessed throughout my life with mentors of, of various sorts.  A couple that, that stand out, my-my freshman year I would call mentors or role models from, from afar.  There was a guy from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I believe whose name was Walter Grady.  He went by the name of Tony, Tony Grady; black Cadet Lieutenant Colonel who was on the wing staff, which is the highest level of cadet leadership there.  The guy was sharp.  You'd see him in his uniform and it look like his creases you could cut your, yourself on, on his creases and such.  Another guy, who's a lawyer now, living in South Florida, Darryl Jones.  Darryl Jones was from Jackson, Mississippi but Darryl was like the Vice Wing Commander.  The second highest position that a cadet could, could hold.  Black cadet; sharp again.  And you know to see these guys in these high positions of cadet leadership was really, really amazing and inspiring to me.  And so they, they were, they were a big deal.
Story_ID: 35237
Speaker 1: But something else that, that happened to me [at the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado].  After I had got into my squadron there as school was starting, I think it was like a night or two before classes start, I had a guy coming to my, my room from Columbia, South Carolina.  He was a member of the Academy Class of '77 (1977); unfortunately didn't, didn't graduate.  But his name was Ernie Hogan.  Again black, black guy and he came in with a guy by the name of Donny Alston.  Donny was class of '78 (1978), white guy.  And they come into our room and I'm, I'm 6'7" [height], probably weighing about 170 pounds at that, that time.  And my roommate, a guy by the name of Rick Thielly [sp], I think Rick was from Minnesota but I'm not, not sure.  But Rick was about 6'4" or so, stocky; could have been a tight end.  They're asking us if we knew how to play football and we did.  Do you know how to catch?  Yeah.  You uh, can you throw?  Yeah.  All that time on the street of--[unclear] besides my parents' [Elizabeth Reese Gunn and Willy Julian Gunn] house in Fort Lauderdale [Florida] paying off and he, and he said there's a game called Flicker Ball and we want you guys to come out for Flicker Ball intermurals.  We were the wing champions last year and we want a repeat.  So you guys are going to be on the Flicker Ball team.  (Laughs)  All right.  So we went out for Flicker Ball and Flicker Ball is this game that they play.  I don't know if they play it at all service academies, but they play it on a field not quite as long as a football field, maybe about 80 yards or so and it has a goal at the end.  A square, square backboard with a net in the, in the middle, maybe 18 inch square in, in the middle and you play with a football.  You can't run forward with the ball.  You can only advance the ball by, by throwing it.  You can run backwards, you can run laterally but you can't run, run forward otherwise it's a turnover.  And so, and then--
Speaker 2: So, the--
Speaker 1: Yes, go on.
Speaker 2: --ok, well is the goal to get the ball in the goal?
Speaker 1: (Nodding)
Speaker 2: On the other end?
Speaker 1: Right.  [Simultaneous]
Speaker 2: What is right?
Speaker 1: One, one point if I believe it was one point if you just hit the backboard with, with the football or its two points, two points or three points if hit, hit it through the net.  And so--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --that was, that was the goal.
Speaker 2: So how does, how does it work?  You, you can't run with the ball.  You, you have to throw it as soon as you get it?  [Unclear]
Speaker 1: You have to, you have to throw it; well you can take as long as you want.  There's no time but you also have an opposing team there.  So they're trying to intercept, trying to get, trying to get a turnover.
Speaker 2: But they can't tackle you or anything?
Speaker 1: They can't tackle you but they can block, block the shot--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and if, just like in basketball, if, if they foul you as you're attempting to make the, the toss, then you get, you can get a free throw.
Speaker 2: Now is there, can you pass it to your team mates?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's how it's advanced?
Speaker 1: Indeed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Advancing it by passing it to your team mates who are down, down the field.
Speaker 2: Okay, sounds interesting.  Something like something we would have made up in middle school but--(laughs)
Speaker 1: Uh huh, uh huh.  It was a lot, a lot of fun but I ended up going out on the Flicker Ball, for Flicker Ball, got a lot of playing time, as did my roommate.  And lo and behold, the team repeated as Wing Champions and so that was instant credibility because a squadron is all four classes with the fourth class being the, the target of all of a lot of attention.  (Laughs)  And if you can have credibility as a freshman of being somewhat knows their knowledge, someone who's not a screw up, who has a good, good uniform, then that goes a long long way.  And so I got instant credibility fall semester of my freshman year.  I'm on the Wing Championship Flicker Ball Team.  So in my squadron I, I was golden so, so to speak and so that was very helpful.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35238
Speaker 1: Now I know in the, I've heard anyway there's a height limit in, in terms of being a pilot--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but uh, so even though you're in the [U.S.] Air Force would you, could you qualify to be a pilot at 6'7"?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I got to the Air Force Academy I was pilot-qualified.  I had the, the thing that throws a lot of people off is the, is actually the eyesight and I had 20/20 vision and so I was pleased.  I was happy to be pilot-qualified but flying was never a dream of mine.  So I saw being at the Air Force Academy since they produce pilots, I saw being pilot-qualified as just a great a fringe benefit.  The fact that, "Hey this is nice, nice to have."  But it was interesting.  For the first time in my life you know earlier I mentioned changing ambitions as I was coming up, which I don't think is all that uncommon.  Well for the first time in my life I was around people at the Air Force Academy that I heard story after story of people saying things like, "Hey when I was like three or four years old and looked up and saw planes flying, I knew I wanted to fly planes."  And there were so many people that I came into contact with that were at the Air Force Academy because of the desire that they had to fly and to be a pilot.  That was never my passion.  So as a senior at Academy because I was still pilot-qualified and just under the height, height requirements I had to take a course, pilot screening course, which led to being able to solo in a single engine Cessna.  Well it was an interesting experience because I found myself getting air sick in, in the patterns as I was you know preparing to land and also during different maneuvers and such.  And I really believe it was just my body telling me that, "Hey this is not your thing."  And so I turned down the opportunity to go to pilot training because I was eventually able to get past the air sickness but it wasn't something that I was passionate about.  On the other hand, I did have a couple of pre-law classes at the Air Force Academy.  I did very, very well in those and thought that, "Hmm, maybe I want to be an Air Force JAG [Judge Advocate General]," and eventually that, that came to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35239
Speaker 1: Now this is--I don't know.  I'm probably not the only one that has this notion that everybody that goes to the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado] is going there to be a pilot--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --but there other, you're saying there are other paths at the Air Force Academy--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --You don't have to be a pilot?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  Now they do want a large percentage of their entering class to be pilots but the [U.S.] Air Force needs other, other folks as well:  space operators now, and navigators, not as many, and various other professions.  And in fact, when I was there, there were twenty-some different majors that a person could go into, including aeronautical engineering, astronautical engineering and various; all of the service academies I guess at their heart they started off as engineering schools and they, they've grown and they've gotten curriculums that are more diverse.  But certainly a large percentage of, of my time there was spent in science and engineering courses and also math.  And so after my weak start in math, I started off in a remedial math course, but I knew math could be a challenge for me so I concentrated on it.  I'd been sent some materials after I got accepted.  I did that preliminary work and at the Academy math never proved to be, to be a challenge for me because I got that affirmed foundation and I emphasized it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35240
Speaker 1: So were there any instructors [at the U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado] that, that you considered to be you know important?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Two really stand out:  one General Malham Wakin, Malham, M-A-L-H-AM.  At that, in those days he was Colonel, Colonel Waken was the head of the Philosophy and Fine Arts Department, and by the way Wakin is W-A-K-I-N.   And he taught me I believe it was Philosophy 301.  And so I was introduced to the works of Plato and you know reading, reading about Socrates and reading the dialogs, which I found fascinating and, actually it was Ethics 301.  That was of course and it was the introduction to philosophy, though philosophy and ethics.  And Colonel Wakin was such a great teacher and the dialogs of Socrates were just; I, I found inspiring and just so very interesting.  After one of the, the classes that I had with him and I was a frequent contributor he asked me to stay, to stay behind and I, I did and he asked me what my grades were and I told him I was averaging around a 3.1 [grade point average] overall. And he told me that was too bad and he went on to explain that he headed the Academy's group that screens students for graduate level scholarships such as the Marshall, the Fulbright and the Rhodes.  And he said that because the way I presented myself orally as well as in writing that he believed that if my grades were higher and you needed at least a 3.7 to fit through that, that screening process that he believed that I would be an outstanding candidate for one of the graduate scholarships.  I was, I was inspired (laughs) that, that he thought that; that I could be competitive for such a program if I had higher grades.  But because of my deficiencies in-in, in math and science; oh well.  Because they were challenges for me I was concentrating basically on getting by.  Ironically, my first semester at the Academy I was a, I made the Dean's List.  My second semester I made the other Dean's List, meaning academic probation because I failed second semester chemistry and it was maybe a little bit of overconfidence, not doing my homework, not doing the, the work that was required.  It ended up being a blessing and I'd be happy to talk about that but you'd asked me about a mentors and people that I looked up to.  Well I saw Colonel Wakin, now General Wakin, just a year ago and any time I see him or come into contact with him I tell him you know what, what a big difference he was.  He was just a phenomenal teacher.  Another phenomenal teacher that I had was a then Captain Curtis Martin and Curtis Martin was a black Academy graduate, I believe Class 1971.  Who'd played football at the Academy but taught English at the Air Force Academy and I had him for two courses.  I had him for a, just a regular English course, a literature course, and then I had him for a black literature course.  And it was just thought, thought provoking.  The questions that he asked, the things that he had us to, to read, they were, they made a powerful difference with, with me and I have very, very fond memories of, of being, being in his class.  So for me those two teachers stand head and shoulders above, above the rest that I had in, in class.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35241
Speaker 1: At a certain point you started considering towards the end of; what, what--oh, let me go back to this story.  You said there's a story here in, in the--
Speaker 2: Chemistry?
Speaker 1: --Yeah, the chemistry,
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well after making the Dean's List the first semester, you know I think my first semester not only did I make the Dean's List, I made the Superintendent's List.  So there are three, in those days there three lists that you could make:  you can make the Dean's List for academic excellence over 3.0, you make the Commandant's List for military excellence in being among the top in your class there and if you made both of those lists, you're on the Superintendent's List.  And this was very conspicuous because you'd wear, you'd wear this insignia on your, on your uniform indicating what, what list you were on if you're on a list.  And so I got to wear the Superintendent's List because I was, I'd scored high with my peers and with the upper classmen on the military ratings.  And so I had a reef for that with a star in the middle.  So I was, I was doing it.  (Laughs)  I was, I was full of myself.  Uh in, I don't know.  I, I went home [in Fort Lauderdale, Florida] my; for Christmas and my, one of the things I think about is that a girlfriend from my, my senior year in high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale].  It was like you know all that magic that was present before was, wasn't there anymore and when I went to see her you know she was looking at a magazine and such and made it clear that she wasn't interested in, in having a close relationship anymore, so that, that put me on a setback.  And so I went back to the Academy after my two weeks at home and when I got there and, and went into the second semester chemistry I had a teacher who I wasn't inspired by and so I decided that I was just going to get by.  I was going to coast in chemistry aiming for a C.  All I need is a C to get by because I'll do well in the other courses.  Well I did well in the other courses but I aimed too low (laughs) in chemistry, ended up flunking the course.  And so I had to; rather than going home and you only get the summer at the Academy is divided up into three three week periods.  And I was scheduled to go home that first three weeks and when I learned that I was, I'd failed the course, I had to go to summer school and so I forfeited summer vacation.  But that's, going to summer school was such a great experience.  I had to retake chemistry but while, in during the academic year chemistry was equations and, and formulas and such and lab work.  During the summer no lab work.  It was all really learning how to put data into equations.  I made an A that summer, had a series of teachers but I learned principles that helped me tremendously later on in engineering courses and such.  And so some of the gap that I'd had due to that poor math background, I was, I was able to make up for in, in that summer of chemistry and it helped me.
Speaker 1: Was it because you had like a more intense concentration during, during the summer?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Were you only taking chemistry?
Speaker 2: I was only taking chemistry.  That was my only job there so however many hours a day, I don't know if it was four hours or more, but that was it and three weeks, every day I got, and I got it.  And so it helped me later on.  I had physics, engineering, mechanical engineering and aero [aeronautical engineering], astro [astronautical engineering], thermal; various other engineering courses that that we had.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35242
Speaker 1: So now, now did, so did [U.S.] Air Force have a basketball team? Did you ever--
Speaker 2: They did and so I was thinking very seriously about, I wasn't recruited for the [U.S. Air Force] Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado], I was for, you know by Minority Affairs Office but I wasn't, so I wasn't recruited as an athlete.  So I, I got there and I was thinking, "Ahh," you know, "I'd like to go out for the team and see, see how I do" and I'd watch some of the guys play and figured I might be able to hold, hold my own out, out there and so I was thinking very, very seriously about it.  But also I got involved in student government as a freshman.  I became my squadron representative and to the class counsel and the spring of that year I was elected vice president of my class.  Well when I got back to, that summer while I was in what they call R Flight, the remedial flight for summer school I was playing basketball every day and you know just building up my game and such and having, having a good time with that.  When I got back to school in the fall after a couple of summer programs, other summer programs, I found out that the guy who had been elected president of, of the class he was on academic probation now and I was off because I had made the A in, in summer school and I still had, despite making that F, I had over a 3, 3.0 average.  So they, they called me in and said well because he's on academic probation. He can't serve as president of the, of the class.  So it fell to me.  So my sophomore year I became president of my, my class.  I figured at that point I'm better served leaving basketball alone, just staying in intermurals, doing my thing with the class counsel as class president and so I said goodbye to my basket--, my formal basketball career as, as far as school, school was concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35243
Speaker 1: Now you, you were talking about the level of talent the [U.S] Air Force was playing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did, did--I'm tempted to ask this question.  Because there was a height requirement for pilots, I mean did you have anybody on the team over 6'7" [height]?   I mean could, could you get anybody taller than that on the, in the [U.S. Air Force] Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado]?   You know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were a couple of guys.  I remember one guy, Class of '79, by the name of Randy Grecious played, Randy Grecious played on the basketball team and he was about 6'9"--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there were a couple of other folk around that, around that height.  But certainly you know the, the number one image for the Air Force is the image of the fighter pilot.  And the stereotypical fighter pilot certainly isn't long and lean.  It's a much, much shorter, more compact individual, and so I was certainly one of the tallest folk on campus.  There weren't many people at 6'7" or, or taller.
Speaker 1: And you said Air Force is playing talent like Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Indeed.  I played Marquette my, my freshman year and Marquette went on to win the national championship in, in 1977.  I believe it was my sophomore year I recall them playing; it may have been my sophomore or junior year they played the University of Maryland at a time when Maryland had--was it was Bernard King's brother?  I'm thinking about just some of the guys that, that Maryland had in, in those days.  Of course those were the days of Left, Lefty Driesell and such and so--
Speaker 1: Wasn't [Les Lambias? unclear] on that, on that team?
Speaker 2: That was before a few years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --before Lambias.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they had, they were, they were a talented bunch.  So it was a Division 1, Division 1 program.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is big time college basketball.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Even though the Air Force has never been known as a power in basketball--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but--
Speaker 2: No.  Although they did very well in football over, especially during the 1980s and '90s after I'd left. Because when I was there the football team I think won eleven or twelve games in the four years that I was there and that was memorable because football games were mandatory.  Cadets would, a portion of the cadet wing would have to march onto the field before the games and some of those games, especially in November would get pretty cold.  (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35244
Speaker 1: All right. So, so you start as a senior thing about JAG [Judge Advocate General] Corps--
Speaker 2: Right.  I, I started [simultaneous]
Speaker 1: --and this is a path to become a lawyer and still you know and in, in the service.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And the JAG Corps is judge advocacy--
Speaker 2: It's a Judge Advocate General's Corps.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was, but even though I was thinking about it a little bit, I'd taken my first pre-law course as a junior, scored an A.  You know, certainly near the top of the Order of Merit; just the, the test, the principles came easy to me.  My senior year I took another course; same, same results, the hitting it out of the park.  And in talking to the pre-law professors, who were JAGs I talked to them about you know life as a JAG and those instructors encouraged me with respect to that but I wasn't able to go directly into law school from, from the [U.S. Air Force] Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado].  The Academy, the Air Force offered a couple of programs.  One called the Funded Legal Education Program where it would be an individual's job to go to law school and all expenses would be paid.  And that program sounded like a, a great deal and I applied for that a couple of years after I'd graduated, got into all the law schools I that I applied to.  I think I applied to six or seven schools including Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Georgetown [Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia] and got into all those schools but the Air Force said no on my application for the Funded, Funded Legal Education Program or what we call FLEP.  I, I was thrilled to get into Harvard because I was actually stationed in Massachusetts in the Boston area and so got a chance to find out more about that, that institution and I asked for a deferment and, and grant and was granted that deferment.  And so the next year I applied for the funded program and I got in.
Story_ID: 35245
Speaker 1: Okay. So immediately after graduating from the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado], no--well, well let's just, let me ask you now did you graduate from the Academy with any honors or any special recognition?
Speaker 2: I did.  I graduated from the Academy with Military Honors.  Throughout my time at, at the, at Academy I was on the Commandant's List every semester.  I was on the Superintendent's List.  Which again Commandant's List for military, for being hear the top of the Military Order of Merit; on the Superintendent's List for Dean's, Dean's List for academics and the Commandant's List.  And I graduated I believe I was like number 21 in my class.  This is, we entered with a class of 1,560.  We had, had 899 folks who graduated, to graduate and I was number 21 out of that on the Military Orders.  I graduated with military, military honors; academically uh, I was about the top, I was in the top third of my class and they combined the two and I think I was in like the 170 range overall when they combined, combined the two, so certainly square in the top, the top quarter of my class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was, so your parents [Elizabeth Reese Gunn and Willy Julian Gunn] came out for that?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Everybody?
Speaker 2: Parents came out, my brother [Demetrius Gunn] came out, cousin came out and we celebrated.  The Academy was an extremely demanding place and I saw people that left the Academy, that were asked to leave as late as weeks before graduation and so I never had the sense that "Hey it was all done," until it was done.  And, but I'm just so glad that I had an opportunity to go to school there.  It was definitely the place that I was called to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 35246
Speaker 1: So where were you assigned first?  Now you're commissioned as a Second Lieutenant right--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --[U.S.] Air Force?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: My first assignment was the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to work in that Minority Affairs Office because a couple of reasons.  One, when the lieutenant had come to my high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] and called me and encouraged me, that was the key to my getting into the Academy and so I wanted to be able to return the favor.  And I believe so strongly in the Academy in that education and the fact that it is a free education.  Of course you have a commitment but you're not leaving school with any debt and it's one of the best schools, all the service academies, among the nation's most prestigious institutions; that I wanted to tell the story and I wanted to help recruit students for the, for the Academy.  So I was fortunate to get to ask to remain, to remain there and I did and so that became my first assignment.  So I went off for a month of vacation, came back around the beginning of July, and I ended up being at the Academy up until, so that was July of 1980, ended up being there until September of 1981.
Story_ID: 35247
Speaker 1: So I have a delay because of a school I was scheduled to go to for my, for my, well it was scheduled to be my first post-Academy [U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado Springs, Colorado] career and that was in contracting.  I had to go to Denver [Colorado] for a, a course in, to prepare to be a contract negotiator to help our draft and negotiate government contracts and so I did that.  In September I was done with that, that course.  In October, I was off to the Boston [Massachusetts] area--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: So this is Hanscom Air Force Base.
Speaker 1: Right, called Hanscom.
Speaker 2: Hanscom.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Hanscom Air Force Base--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --in Bedford, Massachusetts, borders Concord and Lexington, so right where the American Revolution started.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, Bedford, Massachusetts.  So, this is where you were when were, were accepted by Harvard?
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.  I'd been there for about two years when I was accepted.  So I had three years, a little over three years of service when I went into Harvard, Harvard Law [School, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 35248
Speaker 1: Okay. Now before you entered law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you got married, right?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Now, now where did you might your wife [Dawn Gunn] and--
Speaker 2: My wife was in the [U.S.] Air Force Reserves for a very short period of time.  I think her military career lasted all of about four months; long enough for us to get married.  We met on November 19th of 1980.  I'd been on, I'd been at the base [Hanscom Air Force Base, Bedford, Massachusetts] for less, less than two months when we, when we met and we got married the following August.  So nine months later on August 4 of 1981.  (Laughs)  Is that right?  No, no.  I'm sorry, 1982.
Speaker 1: '82 [1982], right.
Speaker 2: Right, 1982.
Speaker 1: So, so you met her at Hanscom?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 35249
Speaker 1: So and, all right; so tell us about Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: About Harvard?
Speaker 1: Yes, about Harvard.  Now you, you--
Speaker 2: Ahh! Well--
Speaker 1: --Were you going to school full time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Well again, I get to the Boston [Massachusetts] area there in the fall of 19-1981.  Met, met some guys, some other, some other officers a group of black officers, three or four guys and they--I'm, I'm the new guy there and they decided to take me on a tour or to show me around the area.  That's my Saturday in town.  And so we went into Boston and stopped in some places.  They pointed some things out and so we're driving and around twilight we hit Harvard Square and for me it was love at first sight.  It was such a dramatic.  I think about it in terms of a dramatic shift from the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado]; which is truly beautiful.  It's pristine.  Its striking architecture, the spheres of the chapel against the, the aluminum spheres against the backdrop of the Rocky Mountains.  Well Harvard is right there in the city of Cambridge and Harvard Square was electric with color and sound, music and colors and there were acrobats and people with different colored hair, and (laughs) a lot of stuff going on.  And I'm like, "Wow!  This is electric.  I, I love this."  And so the the, the gates to Harvard Yard, right across from Harvard, Harvard Square and it was like for me, "Ahhh!  I'd love to go to school here."
Story_ID: 35250
Speaker 1: And a friend of mine, actually who I'd gone to high school [Piper High School, Fort Lauderdale, Florida] with, when I told him I was applying for, for law school at, at one point and I talked about different schools and Harvard wasn't on my original list and he asked me why not Harvard.  And I don't know what I, what my response was.  He said, "That's supposed to be the best.  Why not, why not try for that?"  And one of my mentors who was a JAG [Judge Advocate General's Corps] was one of the law professors.  I didn't have him in class but a Colonel Wilson; one of the things when I talked to him about going to law school, he also encouraged me.  He said why don't you just apply for top tier schools.  Just apply for schools in the top, top ten or he may have said top twenty.  And so he was, he encouraging me with respect to that, felt that with the grades that I had from the Academy and such that I would be competitive for those schools.  So, so I thought about it but quite frankly I found Harvard very intimidating, just the concept.  I didn't know anybody that had gone to Harvard but I had some experiences.  I was dating a woman out in, when I got to the Boston area in, in the fall of 1981 I was, and before meeting my wife [Dawn Gunn], I had, was still dating a woman out in Colorado.  So there were a couple of times I went back to see her and when I'd come back it was on, may be it was like Thanksgiving and Christmas time I was in cabs, I shared rides with people who were students at Harvard.  And I, I talked to them and such, it was like.  So each time the school was coming back into my consciousness but I had to get past my level of intimidation.  And one of the things that helped me tremendously was that after I met my wife I learned that she had gone to Yale Drama School [New Haven, Connecticut] and she'd also gone to Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, Rhode Island.  And the Rhode Island School of Design also known as RISD is right next to Brown University [Providence] and she'd taken classes at Brown.  So the whole concept of the Ivy League she was very familiar with that and she encouraged me a lot; and just said, "Hey, you're intimidated by them."  They should be intimidated by you (laughs) and so you should, you should go ahead and apply.  And so I took her advice to heart and when I initially applied to Harvard, I did it a day of two before the deadline.  And it was interesting.  I had to put some advice into operation that I'd been giving kids the previous year when I was traveling around recruiting students and I was telling them to, if they were interested in the Academies, if they were interested in other opportunities to apply, to move beyond fear.  And I had to move beyond fear in order to, in order to do that.  There was this intimidation that I was experiencing and this, this fear of rejection.  "What if I'm not good enough?" or "What if they don't accept me?"  And so I said, "Well, you'll never know unless you apply."  And so I applied and I'm, I'm very glad that I did.  I was very successful at, at Harvard and never would have known that but would have been left wondering if I had not applied.
Story_ID: 35251
Speaker 1: Now do they start law school the way they do in 'The Paper Chase' [film]--
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: --by telling you to look to your left and to look to your right?
Speaker 2: I think there have been a bit of a student rebellion in the, in the, in the 1970s.  I believe it was where students at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] demanded some grade reform and, and they got it.  The students were successful.  So what that meant was the Harvard Law School that I entered in 1983 was a very secure institution.  The students were also secure.  And so rather than some of the other schools that were striving to be like Harvard, Harvard, here's my interpretation, took the attitude of if you got in, you're good enough to graduate.  Because if you weren't good enough to graduate that would imply that we'd made a mistake and we don't make mistakes.  So (laughs) it was--
Speaker 1: Now this is shared by a number of people that went to Harvard for undergraduate School.  I've, I've heard that--
Speaker 2: Uh huh.
Speaker 1: --you know, quite a bit.  That they think that the hardest part of going to Harvard is getting in Harvard--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and once--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you're in there they don't want you to fail.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly in contrast to the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado].  Remember my class 1560 in, 899 to graduate and it was like they took this perverse pleasure in seeing how many they could get off.  But that was certainly not the case at, at Harvard Law and I'm glad it wasn't (laughs) but something else I experienced.  Remember when I was telling you that at the Air Force Academy you wore this insignia.  So if you're on the Dean's List, you have a star on your uniform?  I suppose you could choose not to wear it but it was the culture that you, that you wore it.  Well at Harvard I had no idea how I stood up.  I of course got grades but I didn't know how these grades compared with other people.  I wasn't living in the dorms; maybe they talked about grades in the dorms.  But they didn't talk about grades the way we talked about grades at the, at the Air Force Academy.  So I did something.  My sophomore year or my second year of law school I, I knew that I was going through, that I was going to be working with the, in an Air Force office that, that summer between my second and, and third year.  Actually yes I, I think it was that that, that summer I had a, an experience where I said well, but I need to know where I stand up and how I stack up.  Can I be hired by a major firm if I wasn't already obligated to the Air Force and so I, I went on some, a series of interviews.  I interviewed with three or four, knowing they weren't going to go anywhere ultimately, but I nevertheless went; and in one of those interviews the interviewer asked me about my grades and so I told him.  He said "Wow, those are good.  Why don't you have them listed on your resume?"  (laughs)  I said, "I, I never thought about it."  And so the first indication that I had, that the grades that, that I was getting there were were, were pretty decent.  And you know even though I never made a C, my lowest grade was a B minus during, during my law school years but I didn't know if everybody else was getting Bs, B pluses or, or what or As (laughs) and so a B minus a, a very low, low grade. But as it turned out I ended up graduating with honors there cum, cum laude and so I'm, I'm glad to have had that experience.
Story_ID: 35252
Speaker 1: Now there are some great teachers there.  At least had great reputation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I really thinking about the Afro-American teachers, of course there, there are great others too.  Did you meet Charles Ogletree or--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and Derrick Bell.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Charles Ogletree I consider a friend and, and mentor.  He started teaching there when, when I was there.  So my second year was his first year as a visiting professor and he's a visiting professor who never left.  I think he'd all, been active with the Trial Advocacy Program, perhaps before then but in terms of coming in and having a full slate of courses and teaching responsibilities.  I had him there for Advanced Criminal Procedures as well as Trial Advocacy and stayed in contact with him ever since.  The book that he wrote on [Henry Louis] "Skip" Gates [also a HistoryMaker], Professor Gates I have that in my, my bag now.  I'm trying to make, make time for reading it, with current events it's, I think it's a very timely, timely read.  So he was a great, great, great teacher.  Another teacher Randall, Randy Kennedy--
Speaker 1: [unclear]
Speaker 2: --who's been a thought provoking writer and instructor.  I had him for a course on race and law but my top teacher at, at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] was Judge A. Leon Higginbotham--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Third Circuit Court of Appeals from out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  I had him for Race, Racism and American Law and I did my third year paper with him.  I took in my second year, so 1984 to '85.  He would come into Cambridge for one, once every two weeks and we'd, he'd do a seminar from like 3:00; I think it would be like 3:00 to 6:00 or 3:00 to 7:00.  He'd sometimes take us out for, for dinner afterwards.  Ahhh!  But it was such a rich experience.  He was a fan of Thurgood Marshall.  He was a fan of former Chief Justice Warren, Earl Warren and he would divide the class up in two when we're considering Seminole cases having to do with the race such as Plessy v. Ferguson or Dred Scott or Brown.  He would divide the class up into different firms.  There'd be a Warren firm; there'd be a Marshall firm and man.  [Unclear] of Hasty I think.  He, Charles Henry Hasty, Judge Higginbotham was on the Third Circuit and I believe that Judge Hasty had also been on the Third Circuit of Appeals.  But I considered him a mentor.  Late, years later when I was applying for, years later when I was applying for the White House Fellowship Program he wrote a letter of recommendation for me; and one of the amazing things about him similar to Charles Ogletree in terms of just impacting a lot of lives.  There are a lot of people that I know and run into that were mentored by Judge Higginbotham just m--touched many, many lives in his writings such as In, 'In the Matter of Color'.  He was just a great scholar and a great historian as well.
Speaker 1: Was Derrick Bell there when you were?
Speaker 2: Derrick Bell had left and I think during the time I was there he was on, he was serving as a dean of the University of Oregon School of Law.  I believe that's where he was at that point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I heard Professor Bell speak a couple of times during, during those years but never had an opportunity to take his class.  Another person who was there who was a tenured professor who, but who died my first year was Clive Ferguson.
Speaker 1: Umm.
Speaker 2: Then Derrick Bell was the first tenured professor and then Clive Ferguson came, came in who was a Harvard grad came in, was a tenured professor but unfortunately I never had an opportunity to, to take a course from him nor did I have an opportunity to take a course from Professor Bell.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anyone else?  I, I don't want to just talk about the black ones but you know--.
Speaker 2: Well those were, you know they certainly made a difference for me.
Story_ID: 35253
Speaker 1: It was interesting.  I had a situation; mentors have played such a powerful role in my life.  After I got accepted into Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I got the Funded Legal Education Program [FLEP], it was the summer of 1983.  So I'm preparing, tying things up and I run into one of my [U.S.] Air Force mentors, a guy by the name of Tom Bain and Tom was a few years senior to me, several years senior, senior to me.  But he says, "So yes."  So we saw each other on the street and then we pulled over cars and we were talking and he says, "All right.  So you're on your way to Harvard."  I said, "Yes, I'm, I'm excited."  He said, "So am I."  So he said, "Now you have to graduate with honors."  (Laughs)  And that was like a whole paradigm shift because I'm concentrating on the fact that I got in but he's upping the ante and he says, "Now you have to graduate with honors."  And so I took the challenge on and I said "Okay, so how am I going to do that?"  And one of the things that I thought about is, "Well, in order to graduate with honors you need to take courses from teachers that are, are good teachers and teachers that you're going to be inspired by."  And I think I wrote it down somewhere that I believe that if I can take advantage of the courses by the Afro-American professors, then I will up my interest because again, they're going to be role models for me and I, and I can learn from them.  So I, I took courses from the Afro-American faculty members to include the ones that I mentioned Randy Kennedy, Judge Higginbotham, Charles Ogletree, also the dean of the University of California Law School, Chris Edley(?), who was also a great teacher that I had for Administrative Law who was always very, very approachable, and then a woman who I've lost track of by the name of Linda Green, who was a visiting professor there who I took for Constitutional Law and so they were certainly near the, near the top of my list.  I never had let's say Professor Dershowitz of Professor Tribe, who you know are often in the media and such, but Harvard [University] was such a rich environment.  Each Thursday during the time I was there pre-email days we would have a newsletter, paper newsletter placed in our student cubbies, our mailboxes, and these would be chocked full of different activities that were going on within the university and the university had an agreement with other schools in the Boston [Massachusetts] area where you could take courses there and you could attend activities through various places and so, I just wanted to squeeze in as much as I could get.  There were a couple of times that I looked at taking courses at other schools.  I, I signed up for a course at the Business School but the logistics were too tough.  I did the same things for a course at the Kennedy School of Government but I, I ended up dropping those.  But I went to singular events over, during the time that I was there.  There was a Professor, Dr. Harold Cruse I think from the University of Michigan who wrote the 'Crisis of the Negro Intellectual' that became the catalyst for a, a group that I, I developed.  I said "I"; a group of folks developed there, where we established an informal group.  We never formally chart, chartered it but it was a black law school discussion group and one of the things that I, I love above it in looking back on it:  We had people that participated in that group they include Jackie Berrien, who is the chairwoman of the Equal Opportunity Commission.  She was my classmate and she was one of the people that after attending the Harold Cruse lectures we decided to establish this group to talk about big issues of the day and there was also a Professor Odeana Neal of the University of Baltimore School of Law and then David Hall who is the President of the University of the Virgin Islands, former--
Speaker 2: [unclear]
Speaker 1: --dean of Northeastern School of Law and Provost at Northeastern School of Law.
Speaker 2: I think he's nearly as tall as you.
Speaker 1: He is.
Speaker 2: I know him.
Speaker 1: He is.  David, David played professional basketball in Europe for a while.
Story_ID: 35254
Speaker 1: But one of the things that we did as a, as a group was we decided that rather, after getting together a couple of times and really enjoying the dialog we decided to continue to meet.  But we said we're not just going talk.  There has to be a public service component of our meetings.  So everybody, we're not going to you know say that you have to do this given thing but everyone needs to sign up for a, a public service; a way of giving back.  And so I signed up for a mentoring program.  My wife [Dawn Gunn] was involved.  I think the first one of these meetings we had it at my house in fact and, and different people did different things.  But that was so powerful.  We, this was during the time of an Ethiopia famine and so we had a bake sale so that we could donate money to.  Another occasion we did like a bake sale for a Mississippi freedom school.  And there we, we came across the freedom school in the Boston area and we donated money to that after doing a public service project.  And we actually, and we also helped them to clean up some, some things that they had.  And so that was rally powerful and so when I think about you know my, my classmates; yeah you would expect people from Harvard to go on and do different things but a lot of people go on to do things but they're making money and such.  But when I think about my, my classmates and, and the people that participated in that group and how they're serving, that I find truly amazing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 35255
Speaker 1: So Harold Cruse, it is interesting here that you all you know you're involved in a study group around his book, 'Crisis of the Negro Intellectual.'  This is, this is, Cruse was; this is a cautionary book--
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: --for black intellectuals--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in terms of identity and purpose, well what you do with you know these, with your intellect and your degrees and that sort of thing.  What, what did, how did it affect you really?
Speaker 2: You know I don't remember the details but you know you're saying that reminds me of the fact that you know Carter G. Woodson who was one of the first blacks to obtain a Ph.D. [degree] from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  In his book, The Crisis of the Neg--in his book, 'The Mis-Education of the Negro', he made similar points of people who're getting these educations and not necessarily people being of service to the community--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so one of the things for me going back to, as I mentioned to my professor at the [U.S.] Air Force Academy [Colorado Springs, Colorado], Curtis Martin, during the black literature course, one of the points he made in, in, in I think all of the people who have taken the class were, were black; but the point that he made was remember you have a privilege here and you may not consider it so but it is a, a privilege.  And if we look at [W.E.B.] Dubois' point of view about being among the talented tenth, you are, you are it.  And so, and the other thing that you need to keep in mind is that even though you may not consider yourself to be among the, the elite, people are going to look at you as such.  And so it's a question of how are you going to comport yourself.  What, what, what are you going to do about it?  And so for us, the people that were members of that group, I think all of us had a heart to serve and so it was, it was a good way of being grounded in terms of what are we going, what are we to do, what contribution are we going to make uh, the--the, for, toward, toward the struggle for equality, the, the struggle for civil rights, for human rights.  And so it was, it was a powerful grounding that, that it provided to be able to come together to talk about what are our responsibilities.  And I think that's why, that's what prompted the call to service; that it is not enough to just talk.  You have to serve now.  You can't wait.  You need to do it now.  And, and I've tried to hold on to that through, through my, my core, my life.  I, in, I mentor a great many people and I often talk to them about the need to serve and, and not waiting.
Story_ID: 35256
Speaker 1: Now is there a, a chapter in black student law association there at the college?
Speaker 2: There was.  There was.  BLSA, black students' law association [Black Law Students Association] and I was, I was active in that.  But my sophomore year I decided that I needed more hands, well at the end of my freshman year I decided that I would like to get more hands-on experience and that I learn best by not just being exposed to theory getting some practical application.  And so I went out, applied to become a member of Harvard Legal Aid Bureau and that's where I spent the bulk of my time in terms of extra-curricular and such at, at Harvard and eventually ended up being elected president of, of that organization.
Speaker 1: That's right.  So, so what, what, now what do you do at student level in terms of the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau?  Are you like law clerks for--?
Speaker 2: Well you are student, student lawyers and so the Legal Aid Bureau was focused on providing legal services to low-income individuals for civil legal services in issues such as housing law and domestic relations were and also help with, with benefits.  And so there were clinical prof-clinical lawyers ad, ad basically adjunct professors who were on the staff and each student attorney would be assigned to a clinical lawyer who we would meet with on a weekly basis to go over our cla-cases, to talk about what needed to be done and to get, to be provided with advice.  And so we could, we could actually appear in court under the supervision of a Massachusetts lawyer and those lawyers would be our, our faculty advisors.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35257
Speaker 1: So when you finish Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '80s (1980s), '86 (1986) right?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: You go back to the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now was it, I'm trying to form how to ask this.  Was there, was there a crisis in consciousness going back to the, the regular Air Force after this intellectual, this deep intellectual experience here?
Speaker 2: Not, not really.  A couple of things happened:  For one thing I never left the Air Force and that the Air Force was sponsoring me. They were paying me.  I'm (laughs) thankful for that.  And during the summers I did internships on Air Force, in Air Force offices.  So the summer between my first and second year of law school I worked at Hanscom Air, Air Force Base [Bedford, Massachusetts], so just a few years, few miles away.  Between my second and third year I came down here to D.C. where I worked in a appellate, a criminal appellate office on, on the government's side and so I got to read a, a great many cases.  But something did, did happen to me between my first and second year of law school and that was that I got a chance to serve as a pro-not a prosecutor.  They called it a recorder in an administrative discharge board and there was a black enlisted guy on the other side and it was, it was interesting and I was pursuing, helping my side with the case of course in going forward.  And one of the things that as I reflected on my experience there I was struck by, by two things:  One, I already knew that I was a very competitive person and so the desire to win was, was strong there; but then there was also what really struck me was when I was confronted with the fact, "wait, there's a human being on, on-on the other side here.  So are you so focused on winning that you lose sight of that, that human being?"  That was the crisis of conscious, so it came before law school was, was-was over.  And so what that made me think about was you know a prosecutor is supposed to be about the ends of justice first and foremost.  The win is second.  You know you pursue the case because you believe that is in the ends of justice to pursue that case.  And so being in that, in that administrative discharge board while still in law school and being confronted with that experience from coming to grips with these conflicting emotions that, that helped me a lot to start focusing in on, "Hey let's never lose sight of the fact that there's a person there and let's concentrate on doing the right thing as opposed to just winning a case."
Story_ID: 35258
Speaker 1: Yeah, back to my initial question though.  Am I in asking that question am I selling the [U.S.] Air Force cheap in terms of the depth of, of-of thought about you know human rights and the things that you discussed--
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: --especially those black professors at Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Those guys are champions of human rights--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and I mean, I mean [unclear], I mean Leo Higginbotham, I mean you know.  I mean so you hear what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, yes I, I think perhaps you are selling the Air Force short in, in this sense.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: As I mentioned, with Judge Higginbotham I did my third year paper.  Each, each student has to do a major, major work and my work was on the history of racial policies in the United States military from 1940 to the presence, so from the 1940s to the 1980s.  And so I looked at such things as the efforts of A. Philip Randolph in the 1940s launching a march on Washington to protest segregation in the military as well as the lack of opportunities there, there.  I, I-I looked at other, other efforts; [Harry S.] Truman's executive order integrating, integrating-integrating the services.  And then one of the most fascinating things in the research that, that I found was the history of blacks in the U.S. military during Vietnam where there were unrest on the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk, on some bases and in different, in different locations and so you had a lot of unrest in the military.  And one of the reasons there was unrest was because of perceived disparities in the military justice system.  Because under the Air Force and Army model, I think it was all the services, you had a staff judge advocate who is a senior lawyer who is assigning the prosecutor to the case, as well as the defense counsel to the case.  And so Judge Nathaniel Jones [also a HistoryMaker] of the Sixth Circuit of Appeals, who has n--
Speaker 1: Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um hmm, Cincinnati.  At that time in the '70s, he was General Counsel to the, to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], well he was appointed as the, he was appointed as the uh, I believe it was a chair of a commission that looked at racial unrest in, in-in mil, in the military and he and, and others out with a report recommending changes to that military justice system.  He said you know, people feel that there, that the deck is, is stacked against them.  And so one of the things that the military, that the Army and Air Force did is that they established a sec-a separate defense counsel corps with the, with a separate chain of command.  So it was a, a separate corps in the sense that you would always be a defense counsel but when a person served as a defense counsel as an assignment they had, their chain of command just was other people involved in the defense as opposed to being beholden to the prosecutor or the staff judge advocate, the senior lawyer on, on-on the base.  And so I think that what I learned was that the military had a history of racial, of facing racial issues, racial unrest and taking actions to deal with those, those issues as well.  So I found that fascinating.  So even though I've been an Air Force officer before coming in, as I was leaving law school and becoming a JAG [Judge Advocate General], I had the benefit of that, that research which was helpful to me; and so with race, being conscious of who I am as an Afro-American that was very helpful to me and important to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well thank you for that because I (laughs)--
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: I thought about that [unclear] maybe I'm selling cheap here and they but the, you know the, the-the military has come a long way--
Speaker 2: Yes!
Speaker 1: --from the days when, who was head of operations. [Johnson Chestnut] Whittaker at West Point [United States Military Academy] could be accused of cutting his own ears off and chaining himself to a bed and beating himself up--
Speaker 2: You're right.
Speaker 1: --and then dismissal from West Point, you know, court marshaled or whatever--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to you know today when you know you can you know expect some sort of trial you know (simultaneous) [unclear]--
Speaker 2: Or you think about General, General Davis.  The, the first black grad of the Twentieth Century enduring silent treatment at Benjamin O. Davis Jr. they enduring silent treatment at, at West Point in the, in the 1930s--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and so the military has come a very long way. You know with our "don't ask, don't tell" [policy] being repealed in the, in the last few years.  One of the things I reflected on is that the military's history with respect to race is analogous in many ways to the, to the struggles with respect to gays being accepted in, in-in the military and I think there are certain things because of the military command structure that there are things that with the military can serve as a great model for the, for the rest of society.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  People often say the military is ahead of the rest of the country in (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: In some ways it has been.
Speaker 1: --you know because it has to resolve issues in public you know that were private.  You know organizations don't necessarily have to or are not pushed to the way the military is.
Speaker 2: I agree.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 35259
Speaker 1: So, anyway--so now so you come out [of Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in '86 [1986] and you are involved in the JAG [Judge Advocate General's] Corps in California, right?  At--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --Mather Air Force Base--
Speaker 2: Called Mather.
Speaker 1: Mather.  (Laughs)  Okay.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: No problem.  But these bases are named after people and so (laughs)--
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: (Laughs) That's the thing.  So how they choose (simultaneous) (unclear)
Speaker 1: I been batting low the past couple of days.  Every time I get a name--
Speaker 2: (laughs)
Speaker 1: --I get it, you know, I get it wrong but that's, but Mather Air Force Base then.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  So, so you're there from '86 [1986] to '87 [1987]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so what was it like what you thought it would be?  I mean once you got, you're come, you come out of Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and is it, was it, was the JAG Corps the way you thought it was going to be?
Speaker 2: Yes and one of the great advantages that I had in terms of managing my expectations was the fact that I had those two internships while I was in law school. So after my first year I was at a base there in Massachusetts and then I came to headquarters and saw JAGs in action.  And so before leaving law school I had the firm impression that I was coming to an organization where I was going to be around a lot of talented people.  So even though I'd come from Harvard Law School, I-I felt the JAGs could hold their own.  So I was, I felt very, very good about that and I found that to be the case when, when I was there.  I was proud to be a part of, of the institution of the, of the JAG Corps.  My, my first assignment there at Mather after, after law school, my first boss was a guy by the name of, Tom Fiskus (ph) and Tom had been an the Air Force Academy grad.  And quite frankly, my wife, Dawn and I were a bit concerned.  Dawn told me on a couple of occasions, "Hey Will you're an [U.S.] Air Force Academy grad, Harvard Law School.  You may go to work for some jerk who's going to be intimidated by you and yeah, wow it could really be ugly out there if you work for somebody who's trying to hold you back."  And I encountered the opposite.  Tom Fiskus who was a major at that time and later on became the lieutenant colonel while I was working for him, he was an Academy grad.  Ambitious person that he saw me as someone who could help take him to where he wanted to go.  (Sirens sounding)  And eventually he became, years later he became the Judge Advocate General, the top lawyer in the [U.S.] Air Force.
Speaker 1: Um, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35260
Speaker 1: When I first got to Mather [Air Force Base, California] in the fall of 1986, I worked as a prosecutor in the base level office and then in January of 1988 I became the Area, what's called the Area Defense Counsel.  I was essentially the public defender on that base and so I, I represented everyone who came to, came to see me from the lowest level enlisted people to senior, senior officers.  If I had conflicts of interest or I was overburdened and I could call on others in the defense community to come help, help out on the cases.  I did that job for about a year and a half, primarily representing people there at Mather.  And then in the summer of 1989 I became; I was called the Circuit Defense Counsel.  My office moved about fifty miles away.  My family didn't move but my office moved a few miles away to Travis Air Force Base [California] and there I had region-wide responsibilities spread out over six or seven states.  As I think back it was California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona and Hawaii and so I traveled around and in that capacity I represented people in in major, in, in major cases.  And I loved both, both of those jobs as an Area Defense Counselor and as a Circuit Defense Counsel.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 35261
Speaker 1: Now in 1990 we have here that you became a White House Fellow?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well as a senior at the [U.S.] Air Force Academy I had, I had a friend, a young lady who came out for a visit, and she had with her this brochure about the White House Fellows program.  And I took, I took a look at the brochure and it had biographies, short bios of the current class of White House Fellows and I saw it and said, "Wow!  This is cut-out for me!"  And, but ask I saw those bios and saw the things that the people had done at, at that stage in their career, I knew that I was far too junior for it.  But I started to send off each year for the application and each application would have the bios of the current class and the, it became a goal of mine to become a White House Fellow.  Finally in 1989 I suppose I appli-well actually 1988 I applied for the first time for the White House Fellows program and I made it after filling out the application I made it to the regionals.  I had a regional interview in Los Angeles [California] and felt I'd just had a great day but I didn't make it to the national finals.  I actually had a mentor, a guy by the name of Pat Sweeny, who is a black JAG [Judge Advocate General], who was a colonel military judge who presided over my, one of my first cases as, as a prosecutor, who talked to me about the program.  Now I was already aware of it but he then a Fellow I believe in the, during the [President Ronald] Reagan Administration and early in the Reagan Administration.  And so he became a person that I called upon for advice on the White Fellows program.  Well that first year as I said when I went for the regional interviews I had a great day but part of the application asked for you to send in a draft or a memo, a policy memorandum proposing some type of policy to the President of the United States.  And you know it wouldn't actually get to the president but they wanted to see how well you write, wrote and how, how well you reason.  Well my policy proposal that year as, since I was serving as a defense counsel in particular.  I said, well I want to write; I wrote about the, how the military should repeal this ban on gay service members because it didn't make sense to me that in all volunteer force we were getting rid of people because they were gay and when, if we came into a time of conflict, that person who's serving and all they'd have to say is "I'm sorry.  I have to leave now.  I'm gay."  And (laughs) that just didn't, didn't strike me as, as making a whole lot of sense.  And so I argued the case and so I sent that in as my policy proposal.  After finding out that I was not selected, I got a letter from one of the interviewers and he told me that he was disappointed that I hadn't been selected and encouraged me that if I was interested I should reapply.  But also told me that while he didn't agree with my policy proposal, he believed that that had distracted some of the other interviewers--
Speaker 1: [unclear]
Speaker 2: --while, during their deliberations, while no one would admit to it he firmly believed that there were some that were uncomfortable with that proposal and therefore they marked me down.  Well the next year I, I suppose I was, I didn't keep the same policy proposal.  I wrote on something different and that year I got, I got all the way through and I was named a White House Fellow there in the, in early June of, of 1990.  And came to [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] a few weeks later for a series of interviews to figure out where I was going to be placed and the fellowship year begins right around, right after Labor Day and it was a phenomenal year.
Story_ID: 35262
Speaker 1: Now this is a, the president now is George Herbert Walker Bush.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is 1990, the year he nominates Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court?
Speaker 2: I, I believe he nominated Clarence Thomas in 1991.
Speaker 1: '91 (1991), right.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you, you were, were you there for that?
Speaker 2: I was!  I was still a White House Fellow when he was nominated I believe but had, had transitioned by the time that he was actually confirmed to the court.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I guess, before we get to that I'll just ask you what are the, well what did you do as a White House Fellow?
Speaker 2: I worked in The White House Office of Cabinet Affairs part of the Executive Office of the President and I was involved in a section of that office called Cabinet Liaison.  I've told people that I considered it being like a communications officer and my job was to, this was before the prominence of CNN and other 24/7 news outlets, so what was going to be in the paper was a big deal.  And so I had a portfolio of cabinet agencies that I had responsibility for tracking and I had White House Liaison in those agencies that I would be in contact with and it was important to find out what the pressing issues were, was there something that was going to be on the front pages the next day or those going to be on the, on the news shows that, that evening and make sure that the information got to the, the correct offices.  So I had a series of offices or series of agencies in my portfolio.  They included FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency], and for FEMA when there were presidential disaster declarations, then I would shepherd those declarations through the White House to make sure they had proper staffing, that the right offices reviewed them and signed off on them before being submitted to the president.  Also had a responsibility for the Department of Transportation and responsibility for the Department of Veterans Affairs, where I am today, and for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  NASA was a treat because the, the space program had, had a hiatus following I believe the Challenger [Space Shuttle]--
Speaker 1: Disaster.
Speaker 2: --disaster.  And so the president would welcome each group of astronauts back to the White House.  The astronauts' spouses to, to the White House and I would escort each, each of those groups.  Plus for Veterans Affairs, (Sirens sounding) [pause] for Veterans Affairs I would also escort the leaders and executive directors of the Big Three veteran service organizations in, into the White, into the Oval Office to see the, to see the president.  So we're talking about the American Legion, Disabled American Veterans and Veterans of Foreign Wars.  So I got several visits into the Oval Office that year and, and when the astronauts came to town, Mrs. [Barbara] Bush would host the, the astronauts and their families up on the top, on the, in the personal residence, the private residence of the president.  So that was a, that was a treat.  So those were a few things that I did.  Each evening at, typically at 5:00, there was a standing staff meeting with my principal.  My principal was a woman by the name of Edie Holliday who was an assistant to the president and I worked directly for a gentleman by the name of Michael Jackson.  Michael went on to become the Chief of Staff at the Department of Transportation, later on in the George W. Bush administration he became the Deputy Secretary of Transportation and the Deputy, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.  I believe he was the first ever Deputy Secretary at Homeland Security. (Simultaneous)  He was my immediate supervisor.
Speaker 1: Michael Jackson.
Speaker 2: Michael Jackson.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think from Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 35263
Speaker 1: So, so when you were there when the Clarence Thomas, well we can that; what was your impression of this--once again there's a public hearings on television, everybody's talk-talking about it.  What were you thinking?
Speaker 2: Well with the Clarence Thomas hearings I uh, (laughs) fascinating theater.  Yeah, I was torn.  I think I grew up in a household that you know taught, talked the loyalty, loyalty to blacks.  And so here you had an incident where you had this black man being nominated, didn't really have a whole lot of insight into his, his politics.  There were some people during the [Ronald] Reagan Administration that were very, very vocal.  Clarence Thomas wasn't as vocal as say Clarence Pembleton who (laughs), we're like "Wow!"  They were presenting a whole different vision of the world that I wasn't at least accustomed to.  Clarence Thomas I hadn't really heard of before; didn't have a high, high profile.  I did find it amazing that President Bush who talked so much about meritocracy and such that he made the claim when Clarence Thomas was nominated that this was the most qualified man in America to, to do this job.  I said, "Huh.  That's interesting (laughs) that, that he's making that statement."   But then just to see the drama involved with Anita Hill and the allegations coming forward and then my mentor Charles Ogletree [also a HistoryMaker] serving as her advisor.  And so seeing him on TV you know beside her, it was fascinating, truly fascinating.
