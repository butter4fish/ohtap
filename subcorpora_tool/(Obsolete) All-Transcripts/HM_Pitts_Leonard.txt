Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Leonard Garvey, L-E-O-N-A-R-D; Garvey, like Marcus, G-A-R-V-E-Y; Pitts, P as in Paul, I, double T as in Thomas, S, and I'm a junior [HistoryMaker Leonard Pitts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind the name, Leonard Garvey Pitts?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know for sure.  My grandfather [John Wesley Pitts] was, was you know, long dead when I was born, and my father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] and I never discussed it.  But just from what I know of my grandfather, I interviewed some people about my grandfather when I was working on one of my earlier books.  And they told me he was real--as one of the men put it--he was into civil rights before we knew there was a civil rights.  And given that I had an uncle whose name was Paul Laurence Dunbar Pitts [Paul Pitts], and given that my dad was born in 1924, which was when Marcus Garvey was the most--pretty much the most famous black man in the world--I think it's very likely that the Garvey comes from Marcus.
Speaker 1: I think so.  Yeah, it seems like a race conscious family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My grandfather apparently was very, you know, as they used to say in the '20s [1920s] race man.  It seems he was very much that.  And as I said, I've got an uncle named--whose name was Paul Laurence Dunbar Pitts.  And my dad was born in '24 [1924], so it all seems to fit that it comes from Marcus Garvey.
Speaker 1: Do you know if your grandfather was a member of the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association]?  Los Angeles [California] did have a strong chapter.
Speaker 2: Actually, my grandfather would have been in Mississippi at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I do not know.  I do not know, you know, if he was a member of the UNIA or not.  I'm planning to undertake some family research to answer a bunch of those questions.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: October 11, 1957 in Orange, California.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The City of Orange County--of Orange, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a writer, columnist for the Miami Herald.  I'm also a novelist and, occasionally, although not at the moment as we're speaking, a college professor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is October 23, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Washington, D.C. on--I think we're across the street--or about two blocks from the White House.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 652353
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I have too many favorite foods.  Shrimp, red beans and rice.  And I always say that chocolate is proof of God.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dark chocolate (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green.  Green is my--color of life.  Green is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.  I love--Christmas is my favorite holiday, but I love the fall, particularly since I've moved east.  And, you know, you get the weather changing, getting colder.  You get the leaves changing color.  I just think it's a really, really beautiful, you know, time of, time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the la- do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Paris [France] is probably my favorite vacation destination.  But I have to tell you, the favorite vacation we ever took, was earlier this year we went on an Alaskan cruise.  And it wasn't so much the destination.  It's just the vacation, just the idea of floating on the ocean with nothing to do.  You know, it was just the best vacation I've ever had, and I can't wait to do it again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.  I don't know that I have a favorite phrase or saying.  You got me--I may have a bunch of, you know, things that I would--that I say I guess specific to, given, you know, circumstances.  I'll tell you what I li- what I like.  And it's funny, because I used to say this first.  And then I heard Rocky Balboa said it (laughter) in the last, the most recent of the Rocky movies ['Rocky Balboa'].  But essentially it's, it doesn't matter how hard you can hit.  What matters is how hard you can get hit, and stand back up again, which has always been sort of a life credo for me.  So, I was really, I was really fascinated to hear that coming out of Rocky Balboa's mouth in one of the la- in the last Rocky movie, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To me, to me, that, that's what life is about, because you're going to get hit.
Story_ID: 652354
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --separately.  And we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then we'll put them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Agnes Rowan [Agnes Rowan Pitts], R-O-W-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Natchez, Mississippi, and it was May 27, 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What ca- what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Just to her grandmother.  I know her grandmother was Cordelia Letcher [Cordelia Hays].  I do have some information, and I haven't--I don't have it in memory, I have it written down somewhere, about a relative before that who was actually--fought in the Civil War for the Union, fought in one of the black regiments.  But I haven't, you know, I don't have the name handy and memory to be able to tell you.
Speaker 1: Well, what's the story?  What's the story?
Speaker 2: I talked--that's literally all I know.  It was one of those, you know, divine providence, you know, of God things.  I was getting ready to do some family research, and lamenting the fact that I know nothing of my mother's family, and was looking through a baby book that my mom had for me, fifty-six years ago.  And she's never--I--you know, I've looked through it several times.  She got this book and never filled it out.  So, there's really nothing to see.  But this one time I looked in there, I happened to see an envelope, and it was from my grandmother.  My grandmother had sent to my mother all the relatives that she, my grandmother, could remember.  And I--as many times as I'd looked in this book, I had never seen this.  And it's just fascinating to me that when I decide, okay, I'm ready to do some family research, this literally falls into my lap. Literally falls out of the book into my lap.  You know, this thing from my grandmother that was done, you know, fifty some years ago.  I was just very, very pleased about that.  But I haven't--you know, I've written the names down, but I don't have them, you know, firmly in memory.
Speaker 1: But she said that this male relative did fight in the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I can get the name for you, if you want it.
Speaker 1: Well, we'll, we'll get it.  You don't have to get it now, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --maybe we can get it afterwards.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But your male relative did--and did they fight in Mississippi, or--?
Speaker 2: I believe he did fight in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have the regiment and everything.  And I have--it was at ancestry.com, their website.  And I plugged him into the family tree on there.
Speaker 1: Was he in the United States Colored Troops?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, you probably don't know if he got any kind of pension or anything?
Speaker 2: I know nothing about him.  That's one of the things I want to start researching.
Speaker 1: So as far as you know, are your mother's people from around the Natchez area (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, as far as I know, they're all from the Natchez area.  My mother's grandmother was Cordelia Letcher, who stayed with my mom, at least when they were young.  And then my mother's mother was Rachel Hays [Rachel Hays Rowan], who married a man named Pearl, P-E-A-R-L, Rowan.  And I believe his--either his first name or his middle name was Sylvester, because I went looking for the records at one point and found a Rachel Hays who was married to a--I believe it was Sylvester P. Rowan, but he was always known as Pearl.  And my mother was very finicky about the pronunciation.  And she'd be mad at me now, because she always said (pronunciation) Pearl or something that she said to make it sound not like the woman's name (laughter) of Pearl.  But it's P-E-A-R-L, so, you know, take your best shot.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But that was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Pearl Rowan?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And now, do you know what he did for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked at a box factory.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what about your grandmother?  Did she have a special skill or anything, or--?
Speaker 2: Not as far as I know, not as far as I know.
Speaker 1: So did, so did they live in, in the town of Natchez?
Speaker 2: Yeah, on Catherine Street.  I think it's now Catherine Street [sic.], but then it was St. Catherine Street, in Natchez.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652355
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] say about growing up in--did di- did she actually grow up in Natchez [Mississippi], or did she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, my mom was born and raised and grew up in Natchez.
Speaker 1: Natchez has an interesting history--just the dif- different snatches of things you hear about.  Just like Mississippi or New Orleans [Louisiana] in some ways--up river or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And what they always say is that it's one of the towns--you go there, and for, you know, people who are into, you know, certain aspects of antebellum, you know, life--it's sort of a mecca, because it's one of the places that the Union troops did not level.  So, you go there, and there's a lot of, you know, people who are into the romance, and I put that in quotes, people who are in the romance of plantation life, and whatever that meant, you know, before the Civil War.  Go there and see all the--the mansions are still standing.  And you know, so it's really kind of, kind of interesting.  And I don't know if it's unique, but it's, it's very distinctive in that regard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know it also has a history with the Indians [Native American], I think.  The Natchez Indians resisted--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know a whole lot about it.  But yeah, that's because Natchez Trace Parkway comes right into, right into town.  And I think it's named after the Natchez Indians, if I'm not mistaken (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 652356
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] say now- say about growing up, you know, in Natchez [Mississippi]?  What was, what was the (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not a whole--you know, I was, you know, I, I wish now that I had listened more. (Laughter) In fact, I think a lot of kids do, and, you know, people do when they get to be my age.  So, I don't remember a lot.  I do remember, you know, that she would talk about the segregation.  I do remember that she would talk about--she talked--and this may have not even been in Natchez.  But when she was a little older and was working, I believe, maybe for a doctor in Memphis [Tennessee].  I may be wrong about where this anecdote took place.  But I remember she always talked about there was this little white girl.  She was working as a domestic in the family, my mom was.  And there was this little white girl that came to her and asked her could she, you know, rub her skin.  And my mom--you know, puzzled--and the child rubbed her skin and says, "Grandma says it's dirt.  But it's not dirt, it doesn't come off."  And my mother, my mother told that story I guess thirty or forty years later.  She was just so, you know, so furious at that old lady, you know, for telling--for telling, you know, this child that.  Of course, that was the way of the world back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Attempting to get, I guess, the child to express contempt for black people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the child is, you know, she's a little girl.  She doesn't know any better, you know.  But it was just, it was just the way of things back then.  One of my mother's friends, when I was writing my book ['Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood,' Leonard Pitts], told me that my mom was, you know, I guess the very picture of the domestic who didn't take no stuff, you know (laughter).  And apparently there was some lady that she worked for in Natchez that she got into a row with, because the lady wanted to instruct her about how, you know, to do the work.  And my mother's point to her was, "You just let me know what it is you want done.  I know how to do my work.  You just let me know what you want done, and get out of my way," essentially was, was the way that went.  So, you know, I was just kind of glad to hear that story.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  So, now did your mother have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: Nope, neither parent finished even high school.  I think--the best I can determine, my mom did seven years.  And I think my dad [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] did seven years as well.  But the thing about my mother is that even though she only had the seven years, she was, she was very big on education.  She was very big--you know, the woman was, she was always reading.  So, you know, you--I guess she was what you would call self-educated.  She always had books around her, and newspapers in particular.  I just always remember her with the news- with the newspaper and the L.A. Herald Examiner [Los Angeles Herald Examiner], usually.  So, you know, she was--she did not have book learning or a high school or college degree.  But she was, she was very well read and very, very intelligent.
Story_ID: 652357
Speaker 1: Well, let me--so, I take it your parents met, you know, in Natchez [Mississippi], or?
Speaker 2: My parents met in Natchez.  My father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] was in the [U.S.] military.  And the story that I'm told is that a warship was docked, you know, there at the river [Mississippi River].  And there was sort of social, or some sort of party.  And my mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] was too young to be there, but (laughter) snuck on the boat anyway--took my aunt Kate [Katie Rowan] with her.  Aunt Kate was much younger, but she had to take Aunt Kate, because if she didn't take Aunt Kate, Aunt Kate would rat her out.  And so they go on the boat and my mom meets my dad at this dance, or at this social whatever.
Story_ID: 652358
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side, and then we'll--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we'll complete this.  So, your father's full name is?
Speaker 2: Same as mine,
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Leonard Garvey Pitts [Leonard Pitts, Sr.].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, well, what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dad was born May the 5th, 1924 in Mashulaville [Mississippi].  And, you will need help spelling that.
Speaker 1: Yes, what--
Speaker 2: M-A-S-H-U-L-A-V-I-L-L-E, Mississippi, which is essentially--it's the quintessential wide spot in the road.  Mashulaville is about ten miles west of Macon, Mississippi, which is itself, you know, not exactly a huge town.  It's a very small place.  And then, you know, you go ten miles west of there, and you've got little crossroads.  And that's where my dad grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he's in rural, rural Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was very rural.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was--my grandfather had a farm.  He wasn't a sharecropper, which is interesting.  He--my grand- his wife, my grandmother, had a piece of land that came down from her father [Richard Cook], and they worked that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How far back can you trace your ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I believe there was--obviously I know my grandparents, John Wesley Pitts and Annie Cook Pitts.  And before that, I believe on John Wesley's side, there was a former slave named Dennis [Dennis Pitts], I believe with one N [sic.], who married apparently--and I haven't been able to--again, I haven't done the research and I haven't been able to confirm this, but he married an Irish woman named Louisa [Louise Pitts].
Speaker 1: They actually married?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was apparently married to an Irish woman named Louisa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, several of my aunts have very--had--most of them are dead now, but had very fair skin.  I had one aunt--as a matter of fact the one aunt who's still living, used to talk about how--I forget exactly how it worked.  But during the Second World War [WWII, WWII] when there was rationing, apparently there was different rationing for blacks, for black women, than white.  You could get more nylon, apparently, if you were white than black.  And this aunt was--would apparently pass for white for the purpose of getting enough nylons for her and her sisters.  So, you know, that--for whatever that's worth.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, let's see.  So, as far as you know, your father's family was from around that area of Mississippi (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) As far as I know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Mashulaville.  I know they were all, they were all born there.  As far as, you know, his parents, I don't know where they were born.
Speaker 1: So, they have a history that goes all the way back to slavery in that area, in Mashulaville?
Speaker 2: I don't know if Dennis was from Mashulaville or not.  Again, that's something that I'm, you know, that's on my list of things to find out.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 652359
Speaker 1: So, your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] grew up on, on land that was owned by--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --his father [John Wesley Pitts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And about how many acres did they have?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't want to lie, but I believe it was six hundred and some odd acres, eventually.  It was a pretty, pretty nice piece of land, you know.  I'd have to double check that.  But I think that's--I have the right acreage.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of land.
Speaker 2: I think I have the right acreage.  I'm not--again, don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't swear me to it in a court of law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay, so is there--is there a story as to how the land was acquired?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.  I do have the--I believe I have the deed, the original deed, you know, among the papers at home.  But I don't know the story about how, you know, coming out of--coming out of slavery in the late 1800s--I don't know how they would, how they got this.  I have no idea.
Speaker 1: I just wonder if that had anything to do with the relationship with the white people and--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --Dennis' [Pitts' paternal great-grandfather, Dennis Pitts] relationship with the white woman, or--?
Speaker 2: I, I (makes sound)--I don't know.  You know, there is--there is, you know, a lot of--there's a lot of mysteries, you know.  And I think I'm hardly unique in that, among, you know, among African Americans.  But there's a hard--a lot of mysteries and a lot of things that, you know, that I don't know that I'd like to know.  I'd like to know about Louisa [Pitts' paternal great-grandmother, Louise Pitts].  I'd like to know where my Irish roots go back to, you know (laughter).  I've got a picture which I think is of her, you know.  And I'd like to, to, you know, know a little bit more about that.
Story_ID: 652360
Speaker 1: What did your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] say about growing up in Mashulaville [Mississippi]?  Was it--because it was so rural, was--did he have a different kind of experience than your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] had in Natchez [Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He didn't talk a lot about his growing up.  He used to talk--he used to tell stories about, you know, military life.  But he never talked a whole lot about, about growing up in, in Mashulaville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of what I know about that, I learned in doing research for my book.  I wrote a book in 1998 called 'Becoming Dad' ['Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood,' Leonard Pitts].  It was part memoir.  And for that, I went down to Mashulaville and interviewed a lot of my father's friends and, essentially, you know, reconstructed his life.  So, most of what I know about that time comes from there.  I know about him and my uncle Corral [Corral Pitts] taking--you know, getting up before dawn to milk the cows and taking--apparently the--I don't know how--what the container was--out to the road so it could be picked up by the, by the dairy.  I know about them apparently having to walk the--you know, if you had a date, it was essentially an all night deal.  Because you had to walk into Mashulaville ten miles away and, you know, go and do whatever you're going to do on your date, and then walk back to, (laughter) you know, to Mashulaville from Macon [Mississippi].  And I try to think of how many girls (laughter), you know, I would have been that fascinated with, to walk twenty miles, you know, in a night to see, and then get up in the morning and get the cows.  That just seems like a lot to me.  But, you know.
Speaker 1: That is something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: That's something to consider.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, what else did you find out about your father?  What did they say about his personality and his--
Speaker 2: My dad was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they said he was--he was a fun kid to play with, but he--you know, he was kind of, he was kind of rough.  He, you know, he had a temper on him which, you know, I can attest.  And he was always in trouble with his, with his dad [John Wesley Pitts].  You know, my grandfather was kind of strict.  He was a, he was a, he was a minister, and was apparently, you know, real strict on the kids.  And everybody else would fall in line, but my father, you know, had a, had a different itinerary.  I'm told the story about my father getting some naive boy to kick a hornet's nest, or something like that. (Laughter) You know, yeah.  So, you know, that's (laughter) that's the kind of guy dad was.  Oh, and they told a story about my dad--and I use this actually in one of my novels.  I use the story in one of my novels.  I told the story about--they told a story about dad lying under the house and throwing rocks out and hitting, you know, hit you in the ankles.  You know, he's under there, so he's hard to get out.  And so, he's, you know, got the impregnable position, and he's torturing everybody that walks up to the house.  You know, so, yeah, that wa- (laughter) that was Dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 652361
Speaker 1: So, he [Pitts' father, Leonard Pitts, Sr.] went to about seventh grade, too, you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then I take it he was drafted into the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think he--let me get my math together.  I think--I'm not sure if he was drafted or if he lied about his age, and ran to join.  I think he might have lied about his age and ran to join, just to get off of the farm.  Because I think he joined fairly you--he was born in '24 [1924].  So, the war breaks out in '41 [1941].  So, he's what, seventeen or something like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he'd be about the age that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --close to eighteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's really close.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I just have the sense that he, there was something he really wanted to, you know, wanted to do.  He wanted, you know, I think to get away from the farm.  And, you know, he's one of the--there were a bunch of kids, and he's one of the younger of the kids.  And by that time, you know, the kids are starting to go away and to do their own lives anyway.  So, you know, I think he was very eager to get away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did he serve overseas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He served in--I have a picture of him that's marked Belgium.  And I also found out after he died, actually, that he was a driver on the Red Ball Express.  And I--you know--you know, you put two and two together.  My father used to always tell us, wanted to tell us war stories when we were kids.  You know, I was kind of young when dad died.  So, we were kids, and weren't really interested in hearing.  One of the things he used to always say was, "I can drive anything with wheels."  And, you know, being the smart ass kid that I am, I would say, "Can you drive an airplane?"  "No."  "Well, an airplane has wheels."  You know, what I realize now--you know, having grown up and trying to (laughter) become a little less than of a smart ass--he was saying that he had been a truck driver on the Red Ball Express, which was really--you know, I mean, a real live thing.  These were guys that are like the unsung heroes of the, of the invasion of France, you know, in '44 [1944], I guess it was.  So, you know, he used to say that he was a heck of a driver--he could drive anything with wheels.  And those guys could.
Speaker 1: Now, the whole idea of the Red Ball Express and the significance of that, and the Tuskegee Airmen and the Triple Nickel [555th Parachute Infantry Battalion] guys, and all the rest of them, it wasn't really revealed until, say, the '70s [1970s].  People didn't start talking about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what their contribution actually was.
Speaker 2: And most--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And even after the '70s [1970s], I don't think there's a whole lot of talk about the Red Ball.  Everybody knows about the Tuskegee Airmen by now, but.  And my dad died in '75 [1975].  So, whatever, you know, recognition there was to come, he really didn't live long enough to see it.  And he certainly didn't live long enough for me to, you know, to figure it out--oh, he made a contribution to this war.  I mean, I didn't--you know, in 1975 I didn't care too much about the war itself, which was thirty years behind at that point, much less, you know, what did my dad do in the war.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And, of course, it's my loss (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it's--yeah, that's--I don't think that the soldiers themselves appreciated the significance of what they had accomplished.
Speaker 2: No.  I mean, they--you know, without them, the, the, the advance of the invasion of Patton's [George S. Patton] tanks just grinds to a halt.  You know, these guys kept--you know, kept the [U.S.] Army supplied, you know, apparently racing at breakneck speed (laughter), and woe unto the poor French pedestrian who gets into the way.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There was a TV series for a while with Ivan Dixon playing a driver on the Red Ball Express (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I remember that.  It was after 'Hogan's Heroes.'
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I remember that.
Speaker 1: They didn't last long, but that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when people first started talking about--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what the Red Ball Express was.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: So, did he [Pitts' father, Leonard Pitts, Sr.] meet your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] when he came back to the states, or?
Speaker 2: He met her before he left, before he shipped out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was supposed to wait for him.  And she went and got married, because she wanted to get out of the house.  And I think that marriage lasted probably a few months.  And then when he came back, you know, they--he found her I guess, and they reconnected.  And they were together from then on.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, because--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, that he would come back to Natchez [Mississippi] to find her, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Apparently, something went right on the warship (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, they get married in Mississippi, in Natchez.  So, did your father--
Speaker 2: Actually, I don't know.  Let's see, where did they get married?  They got married in Holly Springs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm pretty sure it's Holly Springs, Mississippi they got married.  You know, they were together for a while before they actually did get married.  They were--they got married--they got back together after the war [World War II, WWII] in '47 [1947].  And then they, you know, were seeing each other or whatever until '52 [1952].  Fifty-two [1952] I think it is, they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652363
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] working in Memphis [Tennessee].  Were they living in Mem- Memphis for a few years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At some point. I, I've never been able to put together the chronology.  But at some point--there was Holly Springs [Mississippi] with my aunt, one of my father's sisters, and one of his brothers.  They were in Holly Springs together.  And then they were in Memphis, where my dad [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] was driving a cab.  I've got a really bad picture of him in front of this cab that he drove.  And my mom was working as a domestic for Dr. Thorsen [ph.].  And I always remember his name, because she seemed very--for some reason, she really liked Dr. Thorsen, and she was very proud of Dr. Thorsen.  At some point, I've got to go to Memphis and find an old phone book and look up Dr. Thorsen.  You know, but she would--you know, she worked for Dr. Thorsen in the--in the, I guess it was in the early '50s [1950s] or the late '40s [1940s], somewhere in there.  And then my father reenlisted. Well, not reenlisted.  He was in the--I always get the chronology mixed up.  He was in the [U.S.] Army first, and then the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] the second time he went into the [U.S.] military.  And that was during the time of the Korean conflict [Korean War].  But he did not go overseas.  He was stationed in California at--okay, what's the Marine base--Twentynine Palms [Marine Corps Training Center Twentynine Palms; Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, Twentynine Palms, California]?  Camp Lejeune [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune] was North Carolina [Jacksonville, North Carolina]. He was also there, but he was at--
Speaker 1: I know Quantico [Marine Corps Base Quantico] is Virginia [Quantico, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm blanking.  He was at, he was at the military base down in Orange, Orange County [California], Pa- well, Palm Springs [California] area.  There's a military base whose name I know well, but I'm blanking on it.  But that's where he was--Marine, Marine base.  And he was there during the Korean conflict.
Speaker 1: Now, is there--the Marines is a pretty tough branch of, you know, corps to just join after you've been in the Army and then you decide to get in the Marines.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did he see that as the best opportunity for himself?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Again, I didn't--you know, when my dad was alive, I wasn't paying a whole lot of attention.  My dad died in '75 [1975], the year I turned eighteen, and he had been sick for a couple of years.  So, you know, I was like probably fourteen or fifteen the last time that, you know, we were really able to talk, and I wasn't much interested.  You know, to tell you the God's honest truth, I was interested in girls and Marvel comic books.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: It's not unusual.  And so, I mean, you know, it's...
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean there's a lot--you know--there's a lot of stuff I wish I'd asked him.  I wish I'd--you know, I wish I'd--I have pictures of him from that period.  I believe he was a cook, if I'm not mistaken, or a steward.  But you know, beyond that, I don't know a whole lot.
Story_ID: 652364
Speaker 1: All right, so, this is how your family gets to California, with your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] in the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, because everybody else in my father's family had left.  They were, they were you know, the classic Great Migration.  Everyone else in my father's family had left and gone to Chicago [Illinois].  At some point, he was in Chicago.  I tell you--Holly Springs [Mississippi] and Memphis [Tennessee].  At some point, he was in Chicago and then from--reenlisted and wound up in California.  So, everybody else in my father's family is in Chicago.  My mother's [Agnes Rowan Pitts] family stayed in Mississippi, and my father ended up in, in Southern California.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Chicago seems to be the terminus for, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mississippi folks that want to get out of Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Exactly, except for my dad, who, as I said, went there and hooked a left.
Story_ID: 652365
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities--their dispositions, how they look, how they walk, talk, their sense of humor, everything.  Who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: (Pause) People tell me I look more like my dad [Leonard Pitts, Sr.].  And, you know, I've you know, fought against it, and don't think I have so much of it now, but I think at one point, I had my dad's temper.  And, you know, temper is sort of a theme that runs through, you know, my dad's side of the family.  But in terms of, you know, temperament, or, you know, intellect or whatever, you know, that's all my mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts].  You know, in terms of wanting to--you know, always being caught with a book in your hand, or something like that.  You know, that's more mom than anything else.  Although dad was a storyteller, he wasn't a reader at all.  But my dad was a storyteller.  You know, and I think that's something that I got from him.  You know, I love to tell stories on family members without regard to truth or actual factuality (laughter) of what you're saying, (laughter) you know, and just see if you--just see if you can get a--see if you can get a rise, see if you can get a laugh, you know.  And you know, and I'll do that, you know, sometimes just to amuse the family.  I mean, there's a story about how in Hurricane Katrina, you know--not Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Andrew--the ceiling was about to ca- fall in, and my wife [Marilyn Pickens Pitts] didn't realize it.  And I pulled her loose.  I pulled her free just before the ceiling came in.  Which, you know, is kind of you know, heroic enough.  But after telling that story for twenty years, it's become just sort of (gesture) (laughter), you know, huge and grandiose.  And I think I'm wearing a cape, and I think she's standing there going, "Oh, my god."  You know, just, you know, I just like to layer stuff on.  And I think that's directly from my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a tall tale teller.
Speaker 1: Did he have, what was his favorite tale?  Did he have a favorite tale that you know?
Speaker 2: He had a favorite tale that he used to tell about my mom, which in deference to her, I will not tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: Are you sure you don't want to tell?
Speaker 2: I'm positive I don't want to, because I don't want to be haunted by my mother.
Speaker 1: I see, I see.  Is there another tale of secondary importance, that--
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  That's the only one that, that, that really comes to mind.  I mean he--you know, this was--because there was one he repeated a lot.  But--
Speaker 1: Nothing about the war [World War II, WWII]?  Did he have a story about the war?
Speaker 2: Not really.  He was always trying to get me to march in step, which was one reason I hated walking anywhere with him, because he always wanted me--I have no rhythm, you know.  All this stuff about black folks having rhythm, I have none.  And he always wanted me to march in step with him, and I never could.  So, you know.  But in terms of stories about the war, not really, no.  Again, I wasn't, I wasn't listening.  I wasn't, you know, I wasn't paying close attention.
Story_ID: 652366
Speaker 1: Parents moved to California around the same time that the Dodgers [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] did I think, right?  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was--the Dodgers was what, '51 [1951], '52 [1952], something like that [sic.]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.  It was close.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so yeah, so yeah about the same time the Dodgers went west.  I mean every--you know, it was a sort of--a lot of folks moving west at the time.  But California was sort of undiscovered country in a lot of ways, I think.  You know, because that's--the Lakers [Minneapolis Lakers; Los Angeles Lakers] came out a few years after that, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Later '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They were in Minneapolis [Minnesota].
Speaker 2: --or '60s [1960s] or something like--yeah.  And then people were starting to realize there's all this land out here, let's populate it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you have brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I have a brother and two sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you give us their names in the order of their birth?  And, like, what are they doing now?
Speaker 2: I was the first.  My sister, Linda [Linda Pitts Davis] who--she's been a nurse all her life, all her professional life.  I'm not sure what she's doing now.  It's in the medical field, but I don't know precisely what it is.  She was second.  My brother, Keith [Keith Pitts], was third.  Keith works in telecommunications.  And then my sister, Rachelle [Rachelle Pitts Burnett] was--is, I believe still a legal secretary.  And Rachelle is R-A-C-H-E-L-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, when you grew up, then, was this--was the nuclear family the family in the household?  Was that it, or did you have other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that was it.  We were--you know, you look at a lot of other families, blended families and, and, and whatever.  And we were sort of like the classic--you know, mom and dad got married, had children, and never had any children outside of the marriage.  I have no half brothers or sisters or any of that running around anywhere.  It was me and the three of them, and that's, that--and we're it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, with the two parents [Agnes Rowan Pitts and Leonard Pitts, Sr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 652367
Speaker 1: I read that you grew up in South Central Los Angeles [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was--what was your neighborhood like?  Did it have a name, or?
Speaker 2: It was out--we lived all over South Central.  My dad [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] was not working.  My dad was an alcoholic for, you know, pretty much all of my life.  And so, he was seldom working.  And when he did work, he'd keep a job maybe for a couple of--you know, a couple of months I think was probably the best he ever did.  So, we lived in Watts [Los Angeles, California] for a period.  I think that was December of '66 [1966] to May of '67 [1967], we were in Watts.  We lived in Aliso Village [Los Angeles, California], which was a housing project then.  We lived at 79th [Street] and San Pedro Streets, 68th [Street] and Hoover Streets.  We lived in the Westlake area [Los Angeles, California], which is actually not South Central.  It's more, I guess west of downtown a little bit.  I don't know if you know the city, but up around by the Echo Park area [Los Angeles, California].  We lived around there for a while.  You know, I tell people if you want to get a sense of--I went to six different elementary schools.  So, that gives you a sense of how often we were, you know, we were moving around--six elementary schools, one junior high school, and then one high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your father didn't, didn't re- you said he didn't have a job that lasted very long, and--
Speaker 2: No.  He was--and when he did work, he was a, he was a janitor.  He worked--I remember he worked at Park La Brea towers [Los Angeles, California] at one point when I was very young.  And the other reason I remember that is because they had a Christmas party.  And I can't remember a whole lot about this Christmas party.  I must have been like three or four years old.  But apparently, it really blew my mind--Santa Claus and candy and whatever, because I remember longing for it (laughter) the next year.  But by then, you know, that situation was gone.  But I, you know, some part of me still wants to go to a Park La Brea Christmas party.  It must have been--it must have been great.  I don't know what all it was, but we--you know, Santa Claus, candy and a bunch of kids and lots of noise.
Speaker 1: Now, was that near the La Brea Tar Pits and all that?
Speaker 2: I think it is near La Brea.  I've looked it up online.  Park La Brea apartment complex, I think is still standing.  And I believe it is over by the La Brea Tar Pits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If not, it's, you know, I mean it's--it's all named after La Brea the boulevard [La Brea Avenue], which runs north, south, over in there.  So.
Story_ID: 652368
Speaker 1: So you--all these schools.  That's a lot of schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, now, you--I r- also read that you knew you wanted to be a writer when you were five years old.
Speaker 2: I always say I knew I was a writer when I was five.  I think that, you know, I think that God gives you certain gifts.  And it's up to you, you know, whether you, you know, follow that gift and try to maximize it or not.  And I always--from the time that I was five, I knew that this was what I was--that writing was what I was put here to do.  And, the--you know, one of the reasons that I, that I feel confirmed in this, and that I know this, is that I have always known how to do things as a writer that I didn't learn that there were words for, or that these were techniques, until years later.  I'm talking about into the '90s [1990s].  I did not know that there were techniques or ways to verbalize some of the stuff that I do as a writer until I started--you know, I was asked to teach writers workshops.  And that was the first time I'd ever had to think about and intellectualize and verbalize what I've been doing instinctively.  See what I'm saying?  So, this was just some stuff that I knew how to do.  I read, you know, every writer that I could get my hands on.  And I just sort of knew how to do certain things.  And then learned later, oh, that's a technique called alliteration. Or, oh, that's assonance or, oh, you're using parallel construction there, or whatever.  I didn't--I didn't know the words, I just knew how to do the stuff.  So, that's, you know, that's what I mean when I say that okay, this is something that was sort of, you know, sort of born in me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, knowing this at age five implies that you were writing at age five. Which means that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] taught me my--my mom taught me my ABCs, you know.  I was the classic first child, absorbing all of mom's attention.  So, I was, you know, taught my alphabet and how to, you know, how to spell my name, and some rudimentary reading at the kitchen table when I was like three or four years old.  I went to, I went to school knowing how to read--and, you know, to my grade level or whatever--knowing how to read and to and write a little bit.  So, you know, I was always ahead in that regard.  I paid for it by knowing absolutely nothing about math (laughter).  So, that, you know, it kind of balances out, you know.  But yeah, mom--you know, mom made sure that I knew that stuff at a very early age.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your first writing?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I guess this emerges at age five at least, right?
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is an embarrassing story I will tell you (laughter).  My first writing was a character, a little boy in glasses who could fly, and had super strength and a cape.  And his name was Super Leonard.  And that was, (laughter) that was my very first writing.  There was a boy--the Wilson family that we used to play with in Aliso Village [Los Angeles, California].  And there was a boy named Robert [Robert Wilson (ph.)] in that family that I used to play with.  And he was Robert the Rattlesnake.  And then--yeah, I know (laughter).  And that--those were my first writings.  And I still have copies of some of that stuff.  And it's mostly sound effects, (laughter) which is really (laughter)--I didn't have a lot of technique then.  It was mostly sound effects and, and, and you know, and, and exposition, and lots of pictures with big fists flying, and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 652369
Speaker 1: Did you kind of pattern your writing after books you were reading, children's books, or--?
Speaker 2: My first writing teacher, per se--I don't--and you know, I always tell people, and people ask me who was the most influential writer on you?  My most influential writer was Stan Lee of Marvel Comics [Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.; Marvel Entertainment, LLC] fame.  He was the first writer that I consciously wanted to, to be like and to emulate.  And to this day, a lot of the stuff that he did in terms of alliteration--and he likes using the odd word.  You know, a lot of that stuff still survives in my writing.  But yeah, Stan was the first guy that I read, and said, I can do that.  Then after that, there was Beverly Cleary, the children's author, who is still living, and I think, somewhere within sight of her hundredth, her one hundredth birthday.  Beverly Cleary and Erma Bombeck, believe it or not.
Speaker 1: Erma Bombeck.
Speaker 2: Erma Bombeck was a big influence when I was a kid.  My mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] read her, and seemed to get some enjoyment out of her.  So, I would read her, and I really loved her, which--you know, I got invited to a symposium that was being put on for her some years ago.  And people were kind of surprised.  You know, I mean Erma Bombeck was a white middle class housewife who, you know, sort of liberated housewives in terms of, you know, writing about their lives and their aspirations and their struggle, with humor, which had never been done before.  But what did I--you know, as somebody who was black, male and a kid, (laughter) you know, at the time she was doing her writing--what did I find in her?  I don't know.  I just liked reading Erma Bombeck.  You know, so--and I, you know, I think that there was something--you know, I think there's a certain universality in good writing that maybe you don't have to be the target audience to get something out of it.  At least that's what--you know, that's how I feel.  I just remember she used to have a column in the--that ran in the L.A. Herald Examiner [Los Angeles Herald Examiner].  And my mom read it, and then I read it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting, the small world we live in.  Because I told you I read you in the Dayton Daily News.
Speaker 2: Right. That's her--
Speaker 1: That's where she started.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: She was from Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's where I went--some sort of, I think it was at the university.  What's the name of the university there?
Speaker 1: The University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think it was at the university there.  They had something for Erma.  And somehow they got word that I, you know, I grew up reading Erma Bombeck, and I was invited to, to participate.  And more than one person asked, in essence, "What are you doing here?"  (Laughter) It's like, hey, I read her, too.  I was a big fan of hers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a local documentary produced about her by public television, narrated by Phil Donahue.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Who also--whose show started in Dayton.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that, okay.  Yeah, yeah, she's, I think an underappreciated writer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Erma Bombeck.  Stan Lee is a, he's a very literary comic book writer.  I mean, his allusions are to Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] and--
Speaker 2: And the Bible and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, all kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stan--
Speaker 1: --high brow literature.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stan--high brow and low brow.  Stan was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's true.
Speaker 2: Stan was some of everything.  You know, his Thor character came--you know, the language came directly out of Shakespeare and King James [King James Version].  And, you actually had to be able to read some, to really understand that.  I mean you know, people look at comics and it's, oh, you know, guys in tights fighting other guys in tights, you know, over the rooftops, and colorful pictures.  And there's that aspect of it.  But Stan was also doing some serious literary stuff within that, within that frame.  And, you know, I mean, as I got older I began to appreciate that aspect of it I think, I think a lot more.  But yeah, he was, he was very--he was very influential.  He's the guy that made me say, you know, I can do this.  I want to do this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with allusions to modern and ancient literature, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'The Iceman Cometh' [Eugene O'Neill].
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  Yeah, and this wasn't Stan, it was Roy Thomas.  But the first time I ever read the poem, I am Ozymandias ['Ozymandias,' Percy Bysshe Shelley] it was in Avengers, I'm going to show my real nerd credentials here, 57 ['The Avengers #57'], I think it is, where they take a page and they just--and they do that poem.  Look upon me and tremble, and two legs in the sand stretch away.  That was, you know, that's the first time I ever read that poem.  So, there's a whole lot of stuff going on there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Percy Shelley [Percy Bysshe Shelley] and Marvel.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's something.
Story_ID: 652370
Speaker 1: So, anyway, so you're reading the comic books.  And was it--the--was it just, just incidental that you were, you were given the comic books?  And would your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts] buy you these, or were they--
Speaker 2: After my mom saw that, you know--
Speaker 1: --affordable literature at the time?
Speaker 2: They were affordable literature, and they were an escape.  You know, life was not easy.  You know, my dad [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] was--you know, when he was--you know, really had tied one on--he could be kind of abusive, you know, physically abusive.  And I was a, you know, I was a kid with glasses, you know, going to school in some of the not nice neighborhoods.  And you know, not athletic (laughter), not particularly social.  So, you know, you deal with a lot of stuff that you deal with as a kid in that situation.  And comics were my escape.  And my mom would--you know, she'd--she didn't have a lot of money, you know, but she'd always find a way to slip out a couple of dimes.  That's all it cost then.  You know, she'd slip out a couple of dimes.  And I'd go down to the market and see what Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four were up to, you know.
Speaker 1: You were often the new, the new kid in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, which I--yeah, I'd never even thought about it until, you know, actually just now.  But yeah, on top of that, I was always the new kid in school.  Six years of elementary school, six different schools.  So, there was always that aspect going as well.
Speaker 1: And there's the aspect of you having the responsibility of being the oldest.
Speaker 2: Yeah, being the oldest kid, being the oldest male--the oldest kid period, my mom's oldest son.  You know, you've got a household that's, you know, always kind of, kind of on edge.  You know, my father was not really crazy about the fact--you know, my father wanted a son who would, who would be outside, you know, running and brawling and getting into trouble--I guess more like what he had been as a kid.  And to this day, you know, my idea of a great day is it's raining outside, and I'm inside with a stack of, with a stack of something to read and some snacks.  You know, life doesn't get any better than that.  That is the--that is the, that is the pinnacle of life, right there.  And so, he, you know, he didn't really understand that.  I remember being ordered to stop reading, you know.  Yeah, and he'd take whatever--you know, he'd take the comic books away.  And I remember one time, this was on Hoover Street [Los Angeles, California], I picked up a, I picked up a tube of toothpaste and started reading the ingredients, you know, just--because I told you I was a smart ass.  Just--you know, you're not going to stop me from reading.  Fine, you've got the Fantastic Four, but I've got Colgate [Colgate Palmolive Company], (laughter) and I'll read that.  And, you know, I think I must have been kind of a frustrating child, you know, for him to, for him to kind of deal with.  He had really no basis for, for really understanding that. He wasn't--mom was the reader.  He wasn't really the reader.  And this whole idea of reading for enjoyment and writing, you know, when you could be outside throwing a baseball or whatever--it just didn't, he didn't understand it.  He didn't, he didn't--
Speaker 1: So, your mother encouraged you?
Speaker 2: My mom encouraged me, you know, greatly.  Mom was very proud, you know.
Story_ID: 652371
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers along in the early years? And I'm not going to get to high school yet, but in grade school--all these six grade schools, was there a special teacher or mentor that comes to mind (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mrs. Harrison, Laura Harrison [ph.].  She was at my last elementary school, which was San Pedro Street School [San Pedro Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: And what did she do?
Speaker 2: She, I think I was just her little pet.  She pulled me aside and made me the--we used to have assemblies every week.  And she pulled me aside, and made me the announcer for the assemblies.  And I had a little speech, so I had to--I think I still have one of the scripts.  And you know, and she'd--you know, I'd read the little script of whatever the school's announcements were for that particular week.  I remember her asking me--and this is really kind of--it struck me then, and it strikes me now, you know, even in hindsight.  I remember her asking me to take some kid, you know, some big kid, you know, under my wing (laughter), like I had wings.  You know, and help him, because she thought, you know, he could do--well, he could be a good kid, but he needed a good influence.  And I'm like, you know, I was running from this guy last week.  I mean not literally, but that's, you know, that's what I'm thinking.  This guy--you know, but to please her, I kind of tried to do it.  It was also the principal at that school, Renee Boring, which is I think is a most unfortunate name for an educator.  But her name was Mrs. Boring.  And she, she was the principal.  And I remember that after school they used to let me into, into the office to use the electric typewriters and the mimeograph machines.  Not the Xerox, because this is pre-Xerox, but the mimeograph machine (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you could type?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was probably hunting and pecking then.  I didn't learn how to really type until junior high school.  But--
Speaker 1: And what were you copying?
Speaker 2: I wasn't copying, I was writing. These are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, the mimeograph machine, what were you--?
Speaker 2: My stories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my stories.
Speaker 1: So, you'd type one of them, and then run copies of them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was typing them and, you know, I'd mimeograph, you know, mimeograph some of the stories that I was doing.  So, I still have copies of some of those as well.  When I was ten years old, my mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] got me my own typewriter, it was a toy typewriter, in '67 [1967].  And you know, I think I beat that thing to death in pretty short order. 'Cause I--you know, it was only a toy, but I was always hammering on that thing.  Yeah.

Speaker 1: Were you engaged in activities in the community?  Did--was there a boys club or--
Speaker 2: No, just church.
Speaker 1: --Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America]?  The church?
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I was--mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] took us to My Hope Missionary Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California] in 1966.  We were baptized into that church a year later.  And, you know, that was--to the degree there was anything outside of school and home, that was pretty much it.  I was a member of the junior choir, and we rehearsed on Saturdays and sang on Sunday.  It was me, my sisters [Linda Pitts Davis and Rachelle Pitts Burnett] and brother [Keith Pitts].  It was the English [ph.] family and the Stewart [ph.] family.  We were in the junior choir.  It was a very small church, and we were the junior choir.  And the adult choir was sort of, you know, staid--no not--they were a little more--how do I want to put this?  (Laughter) I'll, I'll just say that we were rocking.
Speaker 1: You all were more exciting than--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were, we were kind of rocking, you know, we were kind of rocking it, you know.  And, you know, we actually got pretty popular.  People, you know, would ask for us around South Central [South Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], you know, just to come and sing at their churches.  So, we always--you know, I don't want to call it touring, but we did visit a, (laughter) you know, we visited a number of churches around there.  I can't sing, which is the interesting part about that.  But I used to always say that they kept me in there so that I would encourage everybody else to sing louder, (laughter) so that I couldn't be heard.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the choir director?
Speaker 2: Joy English [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who I still know to this day.  As I said, it was the English family.  So, she directed the choir, played piano and had--I guess it was her five daughters, four daughters--I gotta count them--daughters in, you know that were members of the choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was the Pitts family, the English family, and there were three from the Stewart family.

Speaker 1: Now did, did you think about, when you were a youngster, writing for the movies?
Speaker 2: Not so much when I was a youngster.  I thought about it when I was a little older, probably in my early twenties.  But when I was a kid, no, I didn't think too much about writing for the movies, no.
Speaker 1: And did you--living in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], did you ever encounter any of the stars or, you know, the actors and--?
Speaker 2: Not until I was older and, you know, I was doing, you know, arts and entertainment wri- criticism, I met a bunch of people.  But when I was a kid, the closest thing I met--the closest thing I met to a star was Montie Montana, who was a cowboy.  I don't know if ever actually acted, but he was famous for his rope tricks, and he was in the--he was in the Rose Bowl parade [Rose Parade], I think every year.  And he came to our school once, and that was, you know, that was a big deal.  But other than that, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So, local black cowboy?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't black, actually--
Speaker 1: He was white. Okay.
Speaker 2: He was white, Montie Montana.
Speaker 1: Montie Montana.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652374
Speaker 1: Something special going on--is going on by the time you get to high school, right? You're--how are your grades in school?
Speaker 2: My grades are good, except the English--I mean, in math, anything related to math or science.  But if it's--if it's English, if it's history, if it's social studies or civics, it's, it's, it's pretty easy to me.  You know, I used to--again, talking about how, you know, some things you're just put here to do.  When I'd do spelling--we'd do spelling tests in school.  And they'd give you the, give you the words at the beginning of the week, and you've got the week to study them.  I never studied for a spelling test in my life.  Give me the words.  Okay, got it.  And then Friday, I'd ace the test, you know.  Whereas in math, I got Cs and Ds and worked extremely--I never worked for any grade in English.  I worked hard for every C and D I ever got in math (laughter).  I worked my tail off for those Cs and Ds.  English was more or less--it was more or less a breeze.
Speaker 1: Was it hard to concentrate on completing a formula all the way through, or doing the steps?
Speaker 2: I just didn't understand it.  I never quite understood what it was I was supposed to be doing.  Fraction--you know, after we got past basic addition and subtraction, I was completely lost, and have remained so.  You know, God bless the man or woman who invented the, you know, the calculator.  Because when you got to fractions, much less algebraic equations and geometry and all that stuff, I was, I was completely lost.  You know, but as far as, as far as the other stuff, it was easy to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you score high on the standardized test for English and--
Speaker 2: They, I don't remember the English scores.  I know that they said I was a gifted kid.  I joined the gifted program in '66 [1966], I think it was they tested me, and said that I was gifted.  And--
Speaker 1: You were how old then?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966], that's the year I turned nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, you know, they started skipping me.  They skipped me--half of the--we used to have four--it was 4A and 4B, or it's 1A and 1B, whatever--the first half and the second half of the year.  And they skipped me, I think it was 4B and 6B or 7B, I forget.  But they skipped me--they skipped me a couple times.  Actually they skipped me in all, three times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because I heard you graduated from high school at age fifteen.
Speaker 2: Actually, I started college at fifteen.  That was the last time they skipped me.  Something called the Resident Honors Program at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California]--which means that under that program, you finish your--you go from your eleventh grade in high school directly to your first year in college.  And you sort of are given credit for your final year of high school as you're finishing your first year in college.  So, because I'd already been skipped so many other times--and because my birthday is late in the year--when I started college at SC, I was fifteen.  And then I came back the following June, got my diploma from, from Fremont High School [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California]; and came out of college when I was nineteen years old.
Story_ID: 652375
Speaker 1: --Was acting, you know, was raving and acting crazy.  And I remember Walt [ph.] looked at me, he was so embarrassed.  And I was, we were only like twelve years old or whatever, so I didn't have a way to say this.  But what I wanted to say is, "Hey, man," (laughter), "I see this at home.  Don't sweat it, show me, show me the comic book."  It was like, you know, he was very embarrassed.  His father was going crazy. I was like, nothing new, man--different address, same story.
Speaker 2: Okay, we're rolling again.  You were saying off camera that your situation wasn't unique.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: And in fact, I think I read where you said that you were in some ways lucky that you had your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] at home.  Some people didn't have that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  I've come to that conclusion, because after I wrote the book, 'Becoming Dad' ['Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood,' Leonard Pitts] which was about my relationship with my dad, I started to meet in book signings, all of these men--and women for that matter--who had, you know, bad dads.  But their dads left the house at some point.  And what I discovered was that in a way, in the long run, I was luckier than they are, because they've got all of these questions: why did my dad abandon me?  Why didn't my dad want me? Who is my dad? Where is my dad?  What's he like? Et cetera, et cetera.  And there's--they seem to be incomplete in a way that I don't feel like I am.  I don't have questions.  I don't like the answers I've got, (laughter) you know, but I don't have questions.  I know who my dad was, I know where he was, you know.  He was not the best dad that, you know, in the world, but I think he was--I think he, given his infirmities, and I'm talking about, you know, the alcohol and some of the other issues, I think he did, you know, the job that he was capable of doing.  A guy that I interviewed for my book put it like this, and I'll always remember it.  He said that you don't get angry with a hog because it wallows in slop.  That's what hogs do.  You know, my dad was--you know, he did what he does, or what he did.  And it wasn't, you know, it wasn't out of malice.  It was, okay, I'm a farmer's son with a seventh grade education, seven years of education, and a drinking problem.  And, you know, this is how, this is how I manage it.  This is the best that I can do.  And, you know, once I came to understand it like that, it was a lot better for me.  Everybody told me--I'm probably jumping ahead a little bit, but my--I'm told that when my father was in his final illness, that he apologized to everybody, you know, for what he hadn't done.  He never apologized to me.  I was away at school, you know, apparently on that day.  And I kind of wish that I, you know, kind of wish that I'd been there.  But, you know, I don't--I don't hold any, any grudge with him.  I think it's kind of sad to go through your life and go through your middle age and your old age holding grudges against, you know, your folks for what they did or didn't do.  It is what it is, it was what it was.  And now, you're facing with--you're faced with today, let's move on.  You know, that's kind of how I am with that.
Story_ID: 652376
Speaker 1: So did, did you have to take on additional responsibilities because you were the oldest?
Speaker 2: I kind of did, more so after, after he [Pitts' father, Leonard Pitts, Sr.] died.  I remember there were--you know, and I was able to work a little bit.  I, I remember there were a few Christmases that, you know, that I helped mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] to, to put together for the younger kids.  And, you know, that was always--I was actually kind of proud of that, you know, to be able to help her.  Because my mom was one of those mothers who, you know, made magic with nothing, in the way of material, you know, resources, in the way of money.  I never knew--I never had an idea that we were poor.  (Laughter) I never had an idea that we were poor black kids on welfare in the ghetto.  I had no idea.  I didn't realize this until much later, because, you know, I don't recall wanting for anything.  Mom found ways.  She robbed Peter, she paid Paul, she was the coupon queen.  But all I know is that, you know, I had what I wanted, you know.  If I asked for something for Christmas, you know, by golly--you know, stuff appeared.  You know, Santa Claus is magic.  You know, stuff appeared.  We never, you know we never were without for, for food.  I just don't, you know, I don't remember, you know, being, being deprived at all, you know.  And I think that's also true of a lot of folks.  You grow up and you're, oh, poor was me?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I did not, I did not know that.  I thought everybody had sweet bread for dinner (laughter).  Some of you were going to the store and getting donuts and things like that, I mean, for dessert.  Some of you were going to the store and getting donuts and chocolate.  Oh, man, sweet bread is cool.  Kool-Aid, you know, I mean.  Just--
Speaker 1: Now, what was sweet bread?  This is--
Speaker 2: Mom made sweet bread, which is--
Speaker 1: How was that made?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know how it's made, but it's a pan of--just like this cake that she would make.  And, you know, a little butter on top and some sugar.  You know, my brother [Keith Pitts] can make it, you know.  My brother talks about making it just for old times' sake, you know.  But I'm not a cook, so I don't know how it works.  Mom made sweet bread.  You know, she had all--just a bunch of stuff that she made, which, you know, is to this day the best stuff I've had.  That's, you know, that's good eating, you know.  And so, part of me to this day still wants some Kool-Aid (laughter) every now and again, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite flavor?
Speaker 2: Grape.  Well, it's funny.  And this (laughter)--I associate different flavors with different foods.  You know how you have your red wines for your beef, and (laughter) you know, your red wine with your beef, and your white wine with your fish and your fowl?  Well, you may not have known this, but grape Kool-Aid is for red beans, orange Kool-Aid is for spaghetti and things of that nature, you know.  Cherry Kool-Aid, that's for chicken, things of that nature.  It was all, it was all associated in my mind, and made perfect sense to me, you know. Oh, we're having red beans tonight?  Okay, I'll get the grape Kool-Aid.
Speaker 1: Well, that's deep.  I like--I'm glad I asked that question (laughter).  I'm glad I asked that question.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, you're making me want some grape Kool-Aid and red beans, which is really kind of--(laughter) you know.
Story_ID: 652377
Speaker 1: I also have a note here that you were sending stories to magazines at age twelve.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I started, I started submitting at twelve.  I was first published at twelve, and--was it twelve?  No, I was first published at fourteen in the L.A. Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel].  It wasn't a paying thing.  The Sentinel is a black newspaper in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and they published a poem of mine.  But I started sending stuff out at twelve.  There was a--you mentioned teachers that influenced you.  When I was in junior high school, there was a librarian named Mr. Barbee, B-A-R-B-E-E, James Barbee [ph.].  And Mr. Barbee bought me a subscription to The Writer, which is a writers magazine.  He was one of those teachers that, you know, sort of, he--you know, he had sympathy for me, I think, or empathy.  And he used to let me hang out in the, in the library during recess, so I wouldn't have to deal with craziness from some of my classmates.  And he bought me a subscription to The Writer.  And I saw--you know, I'd read this and see that, oh, people will pay for this stuff.  You know, you write, and people will--you send stuff out to magazines and people will send you money back.  Okay, let's try this out (laughter).  So, I started sending stuff out to magazines, literary magazines and things when I was twelve.  And they sent it all right back.  You know, and I still have, I still have some of those rejection notices.
Story_ID: 652378
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were your favorite writers?  You know, I know you mentioned Stan--Stan Lee, Roy Thomas and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the comics guys (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Erma Bombeck.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but were you reading--I mean--
Speaker 2: By that time, probably still not, probably still more juvenile authors.  There's a guy that--or maybe a woman, I don't know--that did the Danny Dunn series.  I remember I was big on that.  And then, you know, Beverly Cleary and, you know, whoever else.  I didn't get into other stuff until probably past my mid-teens.  I had a thing for Joseph Wambaugh for a while.  You know, I was really crazy about him.  And, you know, I was probably in my early twenties when I discovered Stephen King, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Now, were you, did you like 'The Twilight Zone,' on television?
Speaker 2: No, I never watched 'The Twilight Zone,' for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Rod Serling was one of the better TV writers, a lot of people say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  I'm sort of picking up on him after, you know, after the fact.  I watch him occasionally on Netflix, but I never watched a whole lot of 'The Twilight Zone.'
Speaker 1: So, did you watch a lot of TV at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh yeah.  You know, you name it.  Beverly Hillbillies ['The Beverly Hillbillies'], 'Bonanza,' Brady Bunch ['The Brady Bunch'], 'Mannix' 'Here's Lucy,' 'Bewitched,' 'That Girl,' (laughter) you know, the whole--'Chico and the Man,' 'Sanford and Son,' 'All in the Family.'  My favorite show was, and still is 'M*A*S*H,' you know.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the age of the blaxploitation movies--the so called, anyway--black exploitation movies, the black movies.  Did you go to the movies a lot?
Speaker 2: I never saw 'Shaft' until years later.  I did see 'Shaft in Africa.'  And I don't recall if I saw 'Shaft's Big Score!' to this day, although I do have a copy of it on CD--on DVD [digital video disc] at home.  I saw a few of those movies.  I was-- I began to be offended by them, you know, by the middle '70s [1970s].  I remember writing this letter to the editor of Soul magazine, which was the first place I ever worked as a writer. And writing this letter, you know, to the editor about, you know--if all that you knew of African American, black life, actually, then--was what you saw in some of these movies, you would think we didn't love, we didn't this, we didn't--I was way up on my high horse, you know, about some of those movies at the time.  I just saw, just rented 'Hammer' from Netflix a few days ago, the movie with Fred Williamson.  And what struck me wasn't what it said about the black image, it was just how bad it was (laughter).  I looked at this movie and it's like, this is one of the worst movies I think I've seen in a very long time.  'Shaft' isn't even that great.  'Shaft' is, you know, 'Shaft' is good.  'Shaft' isn't great, but 'Shaft' is important because of--it's like the first time you see a black man as sort of this assertive and sexual and macho and don't take no stuff hero.  So, I think it's important in the cultural sense, but just as a movie, (gesture) it's okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  I was just wondering.
Story_ID: 652379
Speaker 1: Now--oh, before we leave--you leave grade school.  You met your wife in grade school, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I met my wife in the fifth grade.  Yes, I had a habit of having crushes on girls--I was, you know, I was the quintessential shy kid.  And I used to have a crush on every pretty girl in every class.  And I met Marilyn Pickens [Marilyn Pickens Pitts] in fifth grade at 111th Street School [Los Angeles, California].  And the family story goes that she invited me to her--let's see, this is in 1967--so, it's her eleventh birthday party. And first I'm heartbroken, because she's eleven and I'm still ten, so she's an older woman.  (Laughter) And, you know, but then the invitation comes, and there's just: to Pitts [HistoryMaker Leonard Pitts].  I used to have that invitation--I had that invitation until like the '90s [1990s], and the kids got into some of my stuff, and I haven't seen it since.  But it was an invitation to Pitts.  And I always tease her, "You didn't even know my name, woman."  And I couldn't--I think I told you, I have no physical whatever, so I couldn't dance.  And we go to this party, and she's just this vision--this beautiful little girl in this pink mini dress and fishnet stockings--because this is 1967.  And everybody's dancing except me.  I'm standing on the wall, you know, with this fat kid that was a friend of mine named Tony [ph.].  And we're just sort of standing there as the two outcasts.  And they were doing a dance called the L.A. Stomp which basically, all you have to do is stomp.  And you know, Tony goes out there in the middle of the floor, and he's dancing with my girl.  And he comes back, and he says, "All you got to do is stomp, just like you're killing roaches."  And I went out there and I L.A. Stomped, you know, (laughter) to my heart's, to my heart's content, trying to get this girl's attention.  So, yeah, that was me and Marilyn in fifth grade.  We actually moved suddenly.  I forget--you know, probably a dispute with the landlord or something.  That was the shortest we were ever anywhere.  We were only there six months.  So, we actually moved very suddenly, and I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  And I remember--this is pitiful (laughter).  I remember we were driving away from the school, and I was looking for her crossing the campus.  I think I actually saw her.  It's like I never saw again.  And then I'm calling, you know, for years afterward, until I got older.  And it dawned on me that if she does have a--if the family does have a phone, which obviously they do, it's not going to be in her name.  For years afterward, I'm searching the phone book for her name, you know (laughter).  That's how, that's how deep this crush was.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You didn't tell me I was going to have to embarrass myself so much, you know.
Speaker 1: No, no, you don't you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: We're moving into high school now, so we're getting beyond that (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So I can get really embarrassed, okay.

Speaker 1: So, this is Fremont High School, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, John C. Fremont High [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: John C. Fremont, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you're age--are you twelve, thirteen?
Speaker 2: I started Fremont in '71 [1971]?  Yeah, so I'm how old then?  September '71 [1971], I'm four- no, September '71 [1971] I'm fourteen?  Yeah.  That doesn't sound right.
Speaker 1: No, it seems like you ought to be younger rather than older--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because you--
Speaker 2: I tell you math wasn't my strong suit.
Speaker 1: --started school at fourteen, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you would--
Speaker 2: I started--I was in the eleventh grade in--let's work backwards.  I was in the eleventh grade in, I was thirteen.  I was in the eleventh grade--yeah, yeah, I was thirteen years old.  I was thirteen when I started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I turned fourteen about a month after.  That's what it is.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what was Fremont like?
Speaker 2: Fremont was, you know, it was, it was a black school in a blighted neighborhood.  So, it was all the stuff that you'd expect.  I remember one day there was a--you know, we had to close the school and dismiss classes and evacuate the school, because the Crips and the Bloods were having, were having a gunfight, you know, somewhere on campus.  It was, you know, more of the--you know, bullies, and the sense of, you know, being an outcast.  We had some good teachers there, though.  There was Mr. Jacobs, who was my English teacher.  Lloyd Jacobs [J. Lloyd "Bud" Jacobs, Jr.] was my English teacher.  And I just remember, you know, liking him a lot and, you know, feeling just very, like, understood, I guess by him.  He seemed like a good guy.  But again, I was only there for two years.  That's where I re-met Marilyn [Pitts' wife, Marilyn Pickens Pitts] for the first time.  I saw her in English class and, you know, went up to her and said--because I was a little cooler by this point, and I could actually talk to a girl somewhat.  And I went up to her and said--asked her if she remembered me, and was shocked that she did.  But then I think she left school.  So, again, we just sort of--we bumped into each other (laughter) and then sort of went, you know, went the other way.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but, now, so, you were--you still remained kind of shy in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was writing, I was writing--still writing my, my poetry.  And I wrote a poem called 'Musings' [ph.].  And it was this shy boy poem, you know, I've loved you from afar.  I've looked--you're so beautiful.  I wish I had the courage to speak to you, whatever, something like that.  It was sort of like--if you can remember the song, 'Just My Imagination' ['Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)'] by The Temptations, which was basically a shy boy song.  And I remember Yolanda Harrington [ph.] read that, read that poem.  And she asked me--and she was just very impressed, "Wow, who's this for?" And I don't remember who it was specifically for at the time. It might have been for her (laughter).  But I remember I sort of weaseled out, and never really gave an answer.  And I've always kind of regretted that.  Darn, I wish I had said something.  I might have had a date that night.  You know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Whoever asks, just say, "You" (laughter).
Speaker 2: I should have.  I wasn't, I wasn't smart.  I told you I was going to embarrass myself more.  I should have said, "It was, it was for you.  It was for you."  But no, I--I didn't.
Story_ID: 652381
Speaker 1: So, did you get your first poem published in, in high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: No, my first was in--let's see, I was fourteen.  So, yeah, I guess I was--I guess I was in high school, yeah.  I was probably a freshman in high school.  It was published in the Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did people see it and take note of it, or--
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think--you know, life didn't change or anything like that, no.
Speaker 1: All right.  But it, did it feel good to have--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, the thing about creating, you know, about writing, is you have this thing that exists only in your head.  But you're a- you bring it into being by force of will and talent.  And that's always a great feeling.  To this day, that's just a--that's sort of a small thrill when I write something and I know it's going to appear.  But still, just to see it, you know, online or whatever with your name on it, that's, that's, that's a great thing.  So, yeah, it was a kind of a thrill.  Oh, wow, maybe I can do this.

Speaker 1: Before you finish Fremont [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California], then you got involved in the special honors program, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was Resident Honors Program at, at SC [University of Southern California].  That's where I went from eleventh grade at Fremont to freshman year at USC.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is right--right in Los Angeles [California] itself?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, so, how was that experience?  Did you-I mean--
Speaker 2: That was a--socially, that was the most awkward time of life, for a number of reasons.  First of all, I'm fifteen.  So, you got all the stuff that goes with being fifteen, you know, with girls, and trying to get a date or whatever.  Secondly, I'm two to three years younger than everybody.  And this is at a time, you know--I always say that if she's fifty and you're forty-seven, or she's thirty-five and you're thirty-two, it's not such a big deal.  If she's eighteen and you're fifteen--huge deal.  You know, so you had that.  And then, you know, it was the first time that I was, you know, a minority.  I was white--I was a black kid at USC.  And, you know, the City of L.A. was so, was so--like I guess the rest of the country was--so racially segregated--that until I was ten or eleven, twelve years old, maybe even older, I thought that L.A. was a majority black city.  I literally thought this.  I remember going to the L.A. Zoo [Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens, Los Angeles, California] when I was eight years old and all the other kids, you know, white kids, were there from their schools.  And I was wondering, where did they come from? How did they get in L.A.?  Because the L.A. that I knew, you know, was black.  So, I go to SC at fifteen, and you know, I'm this black kid, you know, and pretty much the only one in the dorm, that I can recall.  Ron Howard was there at the same time.  But I was the black kid who was in Trojan Hall, and I'm, and I'm pretty much the only one.  And that was--you know, so for all those reasons, there was a great sense of social dislocation.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Ron Howard from television at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, I knew who he was.  And I didn't know he was in the dorm until he came down to our room once looking for somebody.  And I, you know, being an idiot, made an Opie [Opie Taylor] joke--like that was the first time he'd heard that, (laughter) you know, in life.  And I was saying to myself, if I could just--if I could just have found some way (laughter).  This is after--this is after the Andy Griffith thing ['The Andy Griffith Show'], and before 'Happy Days,' okay.  If I had just found some way to just sort of impress him, or do something other than making a stupid Opie joke, who knows where I'd be today, you know?  But nope, I had to go for the quick, for the quick funny, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, well. (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were young, you were young.
Speaker 2: Ron, I'm sorry.  Call- call me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: University of Southern California [Los Angeles, California].  So I read here that you started sending materials to Soul magazine, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Soul is a black entertainment tabloid, published nationally--published out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And by this time, I'm really getting into, into music.  And I'm, you know, I guess it started when I was--'72 [1972], '73 [1973].  In 1972, '73 [1973], I started, I really just discovered, you know, music: Spinners [The Spinners] and The Temptations and Gladys Knight and The O'Jays, and Bloodstone and Blue Magic, and you know, all the people who were making music at that time.  And so, you know, other than writing, this--and maybe, you know, comics--this was the only thing that really had any interest for me.  And so, I sent a letter to Soul magazine.  I--what happened was there was a band called Third World.  They did a concert on campus at SC.  And at the time, Third World was not--they had some hits in the '80s [1980s], but at this time, they were unknown.  So, after the concert, it was just, it was easy enough to walk up to the lead singer--he's sitting right there--and say, "Can I do an interview with you?"  And he does the interview, and I write it up and I send it to Soul magazine on spec, which means on speculation, which is, you know, if you like it you'll pay me for it, or I'll get a job from it.  And I sent it to them.  And I waited like six months.  I never got an answer.  And finally, I called up there and I got Regina Jones on the phone.  Regina is the publisher.  And she tells me they--you know, she doesn't know.  But if I bring up--bring, you know bring a copy of what I wrote up there, you know, she'd be happy to take a look at it.  And I catch the bus, and it's a two hour ride up to, you know, up to Melrose Avenue from SC.  And Regina reads it, and she's in there with the editor, Connie Johnson.  And Regina says, I can't remember the exact quote, but something to the effect of, "It's been a rainy day, but here comes the sun."  And that's sort of how, you know, Regina talks.  And, oh, you're talking about me?  And she loves, she loves my stuff, and suddenly I'm a stringer for Soul magazine, you know.  And I'll tell you the upshot of that story, which always kills me.  Years later as the editor of Soul, I'm going through a file, and I find the story that I sent to them, originally.  And appended to it is a letter from Regina's husband and co-publisher, Ken Jones, which essentially says, "Don't call us, we'll call--we won't call you."  You know, "Thank you, we're not crazy about it" (laughter).  And I just said, I sure am glad I never got that letter, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: Gee whiz.  That's something.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Soul, they were located on Melrose Avenue.
Speaker 2: 8271, yes.
Speaker 1: Were they part of the Holloway House [Holloway House Publishing Company] locations, or the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Soul Publications [Soul Publications, Inc.] was an entity unto itself.  They published a magazine, a slick magazine, for I think three or four years called Soul! Illustrated.  But Soul magazine itself was a tabloid, quarter fold tabloid, that published from sixty--I want to say '6 [1966] to maybe early '80s [1980s].  And I was there from, all told, from '76 [1976] to 1980.
Speaker 1: I think, yeah, they were in all the newsstands and the supermarkets and (unclear).
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652384
Speaker 1: So, yeah, as you were saying Third World--you know, reggae didn't really catch on in the United States until maybe the later '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was out here, but nobody really was paying--
Speaker 2: No. And Third World, when they finally did hit, they were more--they were doing more of a pop thing.  They had a song called, 'Now That We Found Love' which was like a pretty big hit for them in the '80s [1980s].  But in '75 [1975], '76 [1976] whatever, when they came to campus, they just did their show and then they were just sitting around.  Hey, cool, opportunity.
Speaker 1: Those were the early days of Earth, Wind and Fire, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about the middle--mid- Earth, Wind and Fire started like--I mean it got, started to get big in like '73 [1973] I think, '74 [1974], somewhere in there.  So, they're starting to really peek right about then.
Speaker 1: So, so, were there a lot of groups based in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] then?
Speaker 2: There were a lot of groups that came through L.A., even if they weren't based there.  You know, between '76 [1976] and '80 [1980], I interviewed probably, you know, every--certainly everybody I wanted to talk to, and pretty much everybody who was anybody in black entertainment at the time.  I did The Jacksons.  I did, like I said, The O'Jays, Diana Ross.  The first time I was ever on an airplane was to go to Las Vegas [Nevada] to do Gladys Knight.  Ashford and Simpson [Nickolas Ashford and HistoryMaker Valerie Simpson], George Clinton--that was my first trip to New York [New York], to hang out with George Clinton and Parliament-Funkadelic at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  You know, so I did that.  All of them pretty much--particularly in music.  I didn't do a whole lot of actors, although I did some.  But particularly in music--I was writing about that stuff all--right, left and sideways.  People ask me sometimes, did you interview So and So?  And I literally did so many interviews that I don't recall if there's certain people that I've met.  You know, particularly some of the lesser stars.  But Bootsy Collins, you know, we went out to his farm in the Cincinnati [Ohio] area, and his mom [Nettie Collins] cooked for us.  I mean, you know, it was, it was fun.  And my plan was--you know, this is--I'm finishing college [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] and, you know, getting ready to go out into the world.  My plan is that I'm going to spend a couple years as a music critic, and then write a novel.  And, you know, get a million dollar advance check, and life is wonderful from there, you know.
Speaker 1: That's something, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you went from actually being a kind of a square to being the chronicler of all the black popular music, musicians.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.  I guess you could say that, although I think I probably was still a square, and probably will at some level always be (laughter).  But yeah, I mean I became that guy.  You know, I was at concerts three nights a week.  You know, I, you know, tickets for--you know, tickets for whatever.  To this--one of, one of the things that took me a long time to get over when I left entertainment writing, and I did it for eighteen years total, was not being able to pick up a telephone and say, "I want tickets to such and such.  And I'd like this aisle" (laughter).  That was, that was the best thing in the world, you know.  "Yeah, I want to go this movie, and I want two tickets for that concert, please."  And they'd just show up.  That was just very, very nice.  Very fun.
Speaker 1: So, your writing carried weight.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I never thought about it until--but I'm told afterward that I had a reputation for being somewhat of a harsh critic.  And I look back on it, and I was.  In some cases, I was probably, you know, a pretty snotty critic, I think.  But I took this stuff seriously.  You know, I took this music seriously.  I took, took it seri- I took the art form seriously.  And, you know, my writing I think reflected that.
Story_ID: 652385
Speaker 1: So did, did you ever give a bad or lukewarm review to some group or individual who was considered a star?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Eddie Kendricks (laughter).  Eddie Kendricks hated me, you know.  Later, I'm told--I didn't see this--but I'm told that Mariah Carey wept, you know.  Because we did, you know, me and--I was working for the Miami Herald at the time, and Debbie Wilk [ph.] was working for the Sun Sentinel.  And we reviewed her first concert of her first tour, and she wasn't very good.  I, by this time, had mellowed and tried to say it diplomatically.  Debbie was not mellow at all.  But between us, we pretty much ripped her, and I'm told that she wept in her dressing room afterward.  But, yeah, I mean--you know, Barry White, I gave a, you know, pretty harsh review to.  Later in life, it was really fascinating.  I gave a review to Frank Sinatra.  And it was really kind of an awkward moment, because this was toward the end of his life.  And you can see that a lot of, you know, what made him Sinatra, is gone.  And you gotta tell the truth, and say this.  But by the same token, you don't want to be unnecessarily cruel to this guy.  So, I wrote this really diplomatic review saying, you know, essentially that you know, Frank Sinatra is a great American legend, and wonderful, and this and that, and it was really not a good show.  And I got all this, you know, these letters from his fans who were very upset, you know, with me for that.  You know, they weren't fooled in the least.  But I also got this thank you from Frank Sinatra, which, you know, it's this handwritten note.  It's still in my things.  And at first, I thought, he didn't--he didn't read closely and doesn't understand that he was slammed.  And then I thought, no, he did read it closely, and understood that he was slammed, but understood that I tried to also pay respect.  You know, so that was--I know that's completely off the point.  But when you asked about--
Speaker 1: No, but that's, that's all important.
Speaker 2: --you asked about famous people that, you know, that I've written, you know, negative reviews of.  Yeah, yeah, there have been a few.
Story_ID: 652386
Speaker 1: 'Super Bad'? (Musical beats) doop, doop, doop, doop, doop, doop.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Phelps "Catfish" Collins [Catfish Collins].
Speaker 1: (Musical beats) Doop, doop. Doo doo doop.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): You have speed.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any rate, okay.
Speaker 2: You're ta- you're going to take me back.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, yeah, we were talking about these musicians.  Who did you--who were you su- what musician or entertainer did you really--whose raw talent really just surprised and impressed you, in person? I mean--
Speaker 2: In person?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that you, that you just--you know, were actually better than you thought they were.
Speaker 2: I don't know if there was anyone that was better than I thought they were.  But just--you know, in person I was always impressed by The O'Jays and [HistoryMaker] Eddie Levert, just incredible showmen.  Gladys Knight, I'm trying to think.  There was nobody who was--you gotta remember, you know, we're talking about the era where what you did in the studio, you could usually reproduce on the stage.  You know, we're not in that era now.  We're in an era now where you do stuff in the studio that you have no hope of repeating on stage, and people maybe are surprised when you can sing.  But back in that era, if you could sing, you could sing.  You know, so, you know, you go to an O'Jays concert and, you know, Eddie Levert is climbing on top of the piano or doing the big knee drop or whatever, and you're getting what you got on the record, plus some.  You know, I just, you know, I've always felt fortunate for the era of music that I came up in.
Speaker 1: And of course, you've got all the Motown [Motown Records] personalities out there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You had the Dick Griffeys, Dick Griffeys.
Speaker 2: The Whispers.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Leon Sylvers III, it's his hit maker, yeah, yeah.  All that--Howard Hewett, all these folks.  Randy Crawford--who wasn't as big a hit as some of them, but just was an incredible, incredible singer.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] George Duke recently passed away (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I know.  I know, I know.
Speaker 1: We interviewed him a couple years ago, and I was surprised to find out all the people that he helped produce music for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where he gets no credit on the albums.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: He was telling us about it.  Anita Baker and a whole bunch of people that--
Speaker 2: I did not know that.
Speaker 1: --that he just--he, you know, they, they--he produced the music, but it was part of the deal that he wouldn't say anything.
Speaker 2: Wow.  That, I didn't know, wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: But, so, did you have a favorite, or favorites, of those groups?
Speaker 2: The Temptations.  Always and forever The Temps, just a huge Temps fan.  Dennis Edwards and David Ruffin, you know.  I didn't really appreciate Al Green until years later.  My sister liked Al Green, and that was reason enough for me to hate him.  But (laughter) then when I grew out of that thing with my sister, I listened to him again and like, oh, what was I hating?  This man can sing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that white album had one hit after another.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Yeah, the Reverend, the Reverend is just an incredible singer.  And Willie--William Mitchell, the producer, really knew how to, how to use him.  You know, if you hear Al in concert, Al in concert doesn't do what Al does on the record.  He does more of his natural thing, which is to be a shouter and whatever.  But Willie Mitchell, you know, said that the silence is what would make those records work.  If you ever listen to a live version of anything, Al, live, to me is just--is a disappointment, because he, you know, he shouts.  He shouts well, but I know a lot of people who can shout and bring that (makes sound) out of their voices.  But that other thing that he did, that real, you know, 'Love and Happiness' thing, he's the only one--he patented that.  He was the only one doing that.  And, you know, and that's--that's Willie Mitchell's influence.
Speaker 1: Songs like 'Simply Beautiful' is really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Real soft.  And I mean, you know, I didn't know he could do that other thing, until I saw him in concert.  And I mean, it's cool, it's great.  I like, I like a shouter.  But Al, the only person that can do 'Love and Happiness' the way you do, is you.  Apologies to, you know, to the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] who did, 'Let's Stay Together,' you know (laughter).  Al, the only one who can do that really is you.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 652387
Speaker 1: You were involved more or less with Soul magazine and writing about entertainment for about eighteen years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.  I did Soul from '76 [1976] 'til '80 [1980], and then I spent most of the '80s [1980s] doing freelance work.  I also worked at a couple of news radio stations.  I was essentially cobbling together paychecks.  I was doing freelance work for a bunch of publications.  I was--there was a radio, a syndicated radio show that I wrote for and edited and called RadioScope.  I did that.
Speaker 1: All right.  But before we let it get away--you graduated from USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: I graduated from USC (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: --in '77 [1977], yes.
Speaker 1: Summa cum laude, too?
Speaker 2: You know, that's (laughter), there's a story there.  You got that from somewhere online?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And I'm trying to get that offline.  I have no idea.  What happened was on graduation day, there was a--I saw there was a--after I graduated, there was a ceremony.  And I asked one of my friends, "What's this for?"  He said, "Oh, they graduated magna cum laude."  "What does that mean?"  "Oh, well magna cum laude is you've, you've averaged an A."  "And summa?"  "Okay, and summa means you averaged a B.  And cum laude just means you averaged a C."  I was like, "Okay, that makes me summa cum laude then."  And that's where that came from.  Nobody ever designated anything.  And I put that on a, on my earliest resumes.  And years later, I've come to think about it.  You know, there's probably more to it than that.  And if you're summa cum laude, somebody probably should tell you that, or should have told you that.  So, you know, I don't know what cum laude I am (laughter).  And I--you know, but it's like, it's like--you know, with the Internet, once it's there, it's there.  But in the name of truth in advertising, I may be some kind of cum laude, I have no idea.  I know I graduated from the University of Southern California doing about a B average.  So, for whatever that's worth.
Speaker 1: Now, did you stay in California, or did you move?
Speaker 2: I was in California for many years.  I was in California until I was thirty-four.
Story_ID: 652388
Speaker 1: So, you got married in 1981?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there, is there a story about how you all finally got together, after all those years?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Marilyn [Marilyn Pickens Pitts] brought her sister to Occidental College [Los Angeles, California], which had some sort of program for high school students, I think, looking to go to college.  She was in the parking lot with her sister, having driven her sister.  I was in the parking lot with my brother [Keith Pitts], having driven my brother.  Marilyn was married at the time, had two kids.  And that marriage was, you know, circling the drain, and they were separated.  And you know, I did the whole, "Hey, yeah, I remember you" thing.  And she always talks about the fact--and I guess by this time I'd gotten cool, and was no longer quite so shy, that I gave her my card. (Laughter) And she, she--it takes her to really talk about that, because she wasn't really--I think she thought I was trying to impress her or whatever.  And I don't know, maybe I was.  But I gave her my card, you know, and said, "Oh, let's get together sometime."  And she didn't want to, but her sister that she was there with, her sister said, "Give him a call, you know.  You're about to be unmarried.  He's got a job, you know," (laughter).  And she called me, and we've been together more or less ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So, that, that, that's the story.
Story_ID: 652389
Speaker 1: So, married 1981?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you, you were mentioning these jobs.  Now, you were a writer for 'Casey Kasem's America's Top 40' [sic. 'Casey Kasem's American Top 40']?
Speaker 2: Actually, by that time it was 'Casey's Top 40.'  Casey [Casey Kasem] left, and I forget the name.  I'm blanking on the name of the company that produced 'America's Top 40' [sic. 'American Top 40'].  But he left the company and could no longer use the name.  So, he went to Westwood One and did a show called 'Casey's Top 40.'  And that was the show that I was a writer for in '88 [1988], I believe it was, 'til '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, I listen to the show quite a bit on the highway, driving from place to place.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, you would write the script that Casey would--
Speaker 2: We would write the script.  We would edit--everybody used to always ask if the dedications were real.  The dedications were real.  We'd just clean them up and, you know, make them--put them into script form.  But they were all, they were all real.  We'd do that.  And we'd do the little trivia, you know, things that--
Speaker 1: Anecdotes?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the anecdotes and stories (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About the artists and--
Speaker 2: We'd write all that stuff up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a good show.  And it's interesting listening.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and tell us about RadioScope.  I know I've heard that, too, and I'm trying to place exactly what it was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there from '83 [1983] 'til '86 [1986].  And it was an entertainment news program.  And I, you know, was editor and writer and sometimes chief cook and bottle washer.
Speaker 1: And where did that emanate from?
Speaker 2: That emanated from Lee Bailey Productions.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Lee Bailey, right. Lee Bailey, right, right, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that was produced in Los Angeles [California], too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he have his own studios?
Speaker 2: He had a studio in his house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a studio down I guess where the garage would have been.
Speaker 1: So, the show is produced there and then syndicated around the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To the radio stations?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Lee Bailey.  Now, he had been with the Mutual Black Network one time way, way back.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You would have been, you know, in high school [John C. Fremont High School, Los Angeles, California] I think when that was going on, I believe.
Speaker 2: When I--I just remember him as a deejay on KUTE 102 [KUTE Radio; KSCA Radio, Glendale, California], I believe it was.  He was there on there with Lucky.  I went through a thing where I was, just had a real thing for deejays, and thought I might want to deejay at some point.  So, it was him.  There was a guy named Lucky, Lucky Pierre, I believe was also on KUTE 102, and a couple of others--Don Mac, on KGFJ [KGFJ Radio; KYPA Radio, Los Angeles, California].  And I just, I kind of knew all these guys at some point because I was, I was, I was a groupie (laughter) I think, following, you know, following them.
Story_ID: 652390
Speaker 1: Now, this work on RadioScope and on 'Casey's Top 40,' did this, this work lead naturally to you writing for documentaries?
Speaker 2: Well, the documentaries that I did were radio documentaries.  And yeah, it did, I guess.  I was, when I left RadioScope I did a documentary on the history of black America, 'Who We Are: Life and Times of Black America' ['Who We Are: The Life and Times of Black America'].  And then when I was with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That sounds like a major project.  I mean, you know, trying to--
Speaker 2: It was eight hours.  I syndicated it with a, with a friend of mine.  We formed our own limited partnership.
Speaker 1: Is this your--now, had you--because you've done subsequent work in African American history--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and you seem to know it.  And we were talking before we started--
Speaker 2: That's where my interest--that's where I started.  I always say that, you know, I understand--what I know about history came not because of school, but despite school.  I didn't really have any interest in history in school.  I, you know, I did enough to get my, to get A's in it.  But I've always been, felt as if I was kind of shortchanged in school.  Because in school, what they ask you--at least back then and probably still now--is to know the names and dates, of--that certain things happened.  And they always want to talk about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff [United States Tariff Act of 1930], and just a bunch of stuff that wasn't of any particular interest to me.  And I remember at some point, I got out of school, out of USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  But I'm going back to Doheny Library [Edward L. Doheny Jr. Memorial Library], because I discovered that they have these archives of the old newspapers.  So, I think it might have started for fun, but then it starts, you know, for research, but then it becomes a thing I do for fun.  Let me go look and read the coverage of, you know, the Pearl Harbor attack.  Or, let me go and read the coverage of the Watts riots, or the Kennedy assassination.  And this is fascinating.  And it's not about names and dates.  It's about, you know, emotion and drama and gossip, and just all of this stuff in life and death.  And the thing about reading it in the newspaper is--unlike in the history book where it's neatly packaged and, you know, the author has this sort of top down view, because he or she knows how it came out--in the newspaper, they don't know.  The Watts riot--Los Angeles [California] is burning down right now.  People are going crazy, it's scary.  And you get that vibe from reading it.  And this is where I started to become really fascinated with history.  And so, when I started--when I did, you know, 'Who We Are' in '88 [1988], you know, that was the--you know, I relished doing that, because I got to study African American history in particular for this project.  And that just sort of inaugurated, you know, what since then has sort of been, you know, just the love of reading and writing about history.
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors in this regard?
Speaker 2: In terms of history?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.  It was completely self--you know, self-directed.  I guess self-directed study is what you call it.  I read [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin, I read Lerone Bennett, Jr. [HistoryMaker Lerone Bennett], I read Leon F. Litwack [Leon Litwack].  You know, there's a book by Jervis Anderson on the Harlem Renaissance ['This was Harlem: A Cultural Portrait, 1900-1950'] that I read two or three times.  You know, you start reading all this stuff, and it's like--and you're saying, why didn't somebody tell me this?  This is what history is?
Speaker 1: Now Litwack, was he at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], or USC?  One of those (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think he was at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]. Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Berkeley. Berkeley.
Speaker 2: But he did a book called 'Been in the Storm So Long' ['Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery,' Leon Litwack] and he did another book called, oh, geez, I'm blanking--after 'Been in the Storm So Long,' he did another book, 'Trouble in Mind' ['Trouble in Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow,' Leon Litwack].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Which is about, basically, the lynch era.  And his books are just visceral and painful and powerful.
Speaker 1: And he includes a lot of the narratives--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: --in the sequel.
Speaker 2: You know, he tells you--and it's not about the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, and it's not about names and dates.  It's about this is the stuff that happened.  This is what-- this is how we got from there to here.  And that's, you know, that's how history has come to fascinate me, and why I really get frustrated with people who think history is boring.  History is not boring.  What's boring is the way we teach it, and talk about it.  History is fascinating.  History is sex and drama and, you know, life and death, and whatever you want.  You know, but we don't, we don't really--we don't really get to that.
Speaker 1: Now, did you frequent at all the Aquarian bookstore [Aquarian Book Shop, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Not as much as I should have.  But yeah, you know some L.A. if you know the Aquarian bookstore, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alfred Ligon, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I used to go to the Aquarian--like I said, not as much as I would have liked to have.  And Eso Won [Eso Won Books, Los Angeles, California] kind of took off after I left L.A.  So, I've not done a whole lot of time there.  I've been in there a few times, but not a lot.  But yeah, I mean you know, I reached a point where I realized with some regret I'm not going to live long enough to read all the stuff, in particular, all the history that I want to read, because there's just so much to know.
Story_ID: 652391
Speaker 1: So, this is--where did you start with 'Who We Are' ['Who We Are: The Life and Times of Black America']?  Did you start in Africa and then kind of (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It starts with the explorers--with, you know, Esteban [Estevanico] and, you know, his exploring, you know, which is now the American Southwest.  It talks about Mansa Musa.  I took a lot of stuff directly out of [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett's book.  He has this whole section where he talks about what Africa was, and the surgeons at Timbuktu [Mali], and the University of Sankore, and all of this stuff.  This stuff came directly---and I interviewed him also for this.  A lot of stuff came directly from his book ['Before the Mayflower: A History of Black America,' Lerone Bennett, Jr.].  And we moved from sort of, you know--that history of--obviously through slavery.  And until 19--until the mid-1980s--where I think the big story and the high point where we left--it was Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] run for the presidency.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, run Jesse run.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, and you also produced one called 'King: From Atlanta to the Mountaintop,' right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before--that was actually done for Lee Bailey Productions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a biography of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And that was a two hour program.  I think that ran, that aired in '86 [1986].  It ran--because it ran in conjunction with the first King holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day].
Speaker 1: And towards your last year in Los Angeles [California], you wrote one called 'Young Black Men: A Lost Generation.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was for Westwood One.  That was narrated by Avery Brooks.  I also did a thing for them called--I did a thing they asked me to do, on Madonna.  And I put it like that because I had no particular interest in writing about Madonna.  But I did do a 'Madonna: Blond Ambition' [sic. 'Blond Ambition: The Madonna Story'].  I did that for them.  And then I did a documentary on African American music for syndicated called, 'Roots, Rock and Rhythm.'
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting that you, you were chosen to write 'Madonna: Blond Ambition.'  It speaks to the fact that your writing is good, and interesting, I guess.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, and I've done music criticism, so it wasn't, it wasn't, you know, a hard thing.  It wasn't a hard hitting expose thing, either.  They were trying, you know, to put together a package with some Madonna music and some interviews, and--that they could sell to radio stations.  So, you know, I did it because I'm employed by them to do that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 652392
Speaker 1: Now, you left L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I left L.A. (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And joined the Miami Herald?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now how did that hook up?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I never thought I would leave L.A.  I was of (laughter) I was of the impression, you know, when I was a bit younger that I used to feel sorry for people who weren't in L.A.  You know, because it was the center of the universe.  Like, how could you want to be anywhere else?  I felt sorry for people who lived in other places.  And I guess it was one of those God things again, because I got a--but my mom [Agnes Rowan Pitts] died in '88 [1988].  She died of breast cancer after a long battle.  And, you know, I was just sort of at ends.  And I did, you know, I think that same year I started with Westwood One.
Speaker 1: Now, before--we didn't mention it, but when you were about fifteen, your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] passed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father passed when I was fifteen.  He passed--no, my father passed when I was eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1975.  He died December 27, 1975.  And then mom died in '88 [1988] of breast cancer.  She died on April 15, tax day, of breast cancer.  And the thing that I was about to say was that I, you know.  So, I never thought that I would leave L.A.  And I got this offer.  I got this call from The Boston Globe that they were looking for a music critic.  And this has come through Bill Flanagan, who's at editor at Musician magazine.  He's occasionally seen on CBS news on Sunday morning ['CBS Sunday Morning'] now.  But he was an editor of Musician magazine at that time.  And they'd come to him for a recommendation, and he recommended me, which is really interesting because I did work for them, but it wasn't like big takeout pieces.  I did these little short pieces that they sometimes ran in the front.  So, I was really fascinated that he, that he, that he offered me--that he gave them my name, rather.  But, you know, and I asked him a very stupid question.  You know, "Boston Globe--you want me to be your music--does that mean I have to move to Boston [Massachusetts]?"  "Well, yes, that kind of is what it means."  No, because, you know, I'm thinking about L.A. is the center of the universe, you know, and I really don't want to go anywhere.  And then I hang up the phone, and I'm thinking that was really kind of dumb.  First of all--because my mom's dead, so what's really holding me here?  You know, I've got my sisters [Linda Pitts Davis and Rachelle Pitts Burnett] and my brother [Keith Pitts] but, you know, other than that, what's really holding me here except the fact this is where I've always been?  But by the same token, I'm kind of in a career cul de sac.  I've been trying to write this--you know, trying to publish--the great American novel hasn't happened.  And I'm working in radio which is--you know, I'm bringing home paycheck, but radio is not a writer's medium.  Radio is a music medium, and an announcer's medium.  So, I'm really not doing anything that furthers me as a writer.  So, I call Bill Flanagan back.  Now, keep in mind, I've never had a job offer from--I've never had a feeler like this from anybody, like the one I got from The Boston Globe.  In all these years, it's never happened.  I called Bill back, and I tell him what happened.  I said, "You know what?  I shouldn't have turned that down.  If somebody else calls you, you know, and is looking for a music critic, you know, go ahead if you want to, you know, and give them my name.  And you know, I promise you I'll take this one more seriously."  And like a month later, if that, I get a call from the Miami Herald.  Yeah.  So I say, okay, I was destined and meant to leave.  It was time for me to leave L.A.  I get a call from the Miami Herald, and they bring me down and they talked, you know, they talked to me.  We talk, and the next thing I know, I'm writing a couple of spec pieces for them.  Their concern is that, you know, as a guy who's written pretty much all R and B and black artists for all these years, can I do, you know, other stuff?  So, they assigned me to write a theme piece on Sting.  And you know, I'd go and listen to a bunch of Police [The Police] albums (laughter), and think about Sting, and then write about it.  And having thought, I write a piece.  And then you know, and they like it.  And they asked me to, you know, do another piece on spec, then I'm their music critic.  And that's April of 1991.
Story_ID: 652393
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, '91 [sic. 1992] is also--correct me if I'm wrong.  I think that's the year of the Rodney King riots in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  That was--
Speaker 1: Did you get out of there before then, or?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  I was, yeah, I was in Miami [Florida] at the time.  I'm trying--are you sure it's '91 [1991]?  It might have been '92 [1992], because I don't remember my family being in L.A.--
Speaker 1: Could--maybe--
Speaker 2: --my wife [Marilyn Pickens Pitts] and kids being there.
Speaker 1: It's in that area--
Speaker 2: It's definitely in that area, because I remember I wrote about it for the Miami Herald.  It was the first thing that I did for them I think, that wasn't--no, Magic's [Magic Johnson] announcement that he had HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] was the first thing I think I did for them that wasn't strictly, wasn't strictly music.  And then I did a piece for them on, you know, just watching--basically just watching my neighborhood burn.  Because the King riots started, if I'm not mistaken, at Florence [Avenue] and Normandie [Avenue] which is, you know, way in walking distance of one of the many places that I lived in L.A.  So, it was just a surreal thing, of seeing places that you know--in the helicopter shot--you know, going, you know, going up in flames.  And I wrote a piece for them on that.  And, you know, started from that point, you know, doing stuff for them, being allowed to do stuff for them that wasn't strictly music.
Speaker 1: Also, on that same note--and I don't know if you ever wrote about it.  But the riots in Miami--seems like there was a riot every couple years in Miami. Liberty City [Miami, Florida] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was a little earlier.  Yeah, there was--that didn't happen while I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a little earlier. And there was sort of a palpable fear in Miami, you know, of it happening again.  You know, at that time, I do remember that very clearly.  The people who had been in Miami during those years, they had a, they had a real fear of it happening again.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because before I think the L.A. riots, there hadn't been a American race riot in, like that in a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think the Miami riots were in '82 [sic. 1980] the McDuffie riot. Arthur McDuffie.
Story_ID: 652394
Speaker 1: In 1992, you're a Pulitzer Prize finalist.  What was that for?
Speaker 2: That was for arts criticism.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, a body of work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  The Herald [Miami Herald] submitted my work, and to my great surprise, I was a finalist.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite piece from that period?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did a--well, I did a piece when David Ruffin died, which is a personal favorite.  But I think the best thing I did--and one of the best things I've ever done probably--is a piece I did on Elvis on the twentieth, I guess it is--anniversary of his, of his death ['Elvis' Lasting Influence: He Cut Across Racial Divide,' Leonard Pitts].  Let's see, Elvis died--no, Elvis died in '77 [1977]? Eighty-seven [1987]? Was it the fifteenth?
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976] or '77 [1977], one of them.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Because twenty years would make it '97 [1997], but I don't remember the piece being that, that early.  Maybe it was.  But I did a piece for the anniversary of Elvis' death, which is one of my favorite things that I ever did, yeah.  It was on, you know, Elvis as, you know, basically a racial trailblazer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, let's explore that a little bit, because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I know black people have an interesting--
Speaker 2: Relationship with Elvis?
Speaker 1: With Elvis, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah they do.  You know, I think there's a certain built in resentment about Elvis as quote, unquote, king of rock and roll.  In the piece that I'm talking about, I wrote a line that said that there was--the resentment came--and there's sort of a sense that, you know, like you know, somebody calling Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] the king of Bolivia, or something like that.  You know, king of--.  But the problem with that--you know, the problem with that is that Elvis Presley had talent.  Elvis Presley wasn't Vanilla Ice.  You know, the whole thing about Elvis that angers people is, you know, one, what Sam Phillips said, "If I could find a white man with a Negro sound, I could make a million dollars."  That hurts.  But then the other thing that hurts is you know it was true.  You know, that Elvis had a, had a potential that Chuck Berry and Little Richard, who were his contemporaries, did not have, by the fact that he was a white--he was a good looking white boy in the 1950s, and they weren't.  But the thing that makes it impossible to dismiss Elvis is he wasn't just some, you know--well, he was this truck driver off the street--but he wasn't just some guy, you know.  Elvis could sing, and Elvis belonged where he was.  And the fact of the matter is--you know, for as much, you know, as there was anger--black anger about Elvis and as much as the rumor went around which is, you know, has never been verified and is probably not true, about him supposedly having said some really bad things about African Americans: "The only thing black people can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes."  Not true, didn't say it.  But for as much as that stuff exists, most people don't know that the third most popular black music artist of the 1950s was Elvis Presley.  After, I believe it's Dinah Washington, and I think Bo Diddley was the, was the other.  But the third--the third most popular recording on Billboard magazine--the third most popular black music artist of the '50s [1950s] was Elvis Presley.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the records were in the households, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black people went to see his movies.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Jet magazine--my--I'm married to one.  You know, love her some E- if I was going over a cliff and Elvis was going over a cliff at the same time, and my wife [Marilyn Pickens Pitts] could only save one--I think she'd save me (laughter) but I don't know how much I'd bet on it.  So, you know, there was a lot of love for Elvis, you know, in the black community.  There was a, there's a great quote--I think it's from Jet magazine--about how some black girls saw him on Beale Street [Memphis, Tennessee] and quote, unquote, took off like scalded cats.  You know, [HistoryMaker] B. B. King--you know, Elvis famously thanked B. B. King for quote, unquote the early lessons.  So, you know, there's a great reservoir of affection for Elvis in the black community that's also mixed up with this, with this other thing of knowing that--you know, okay, he achieved what he achieved by dint of talent but also, you know, Chuck Berry never had that same chance (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, so it's really a complicated thing.  But such is race in America.
Speaker 1: There's another aspect of it, too, that--I know my grandmother really loved Elvis Presley.  She really respected him as an entertainer and all that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But when Elvis passed--and I've heard this story over and over again from black folks that worked in offices where the white people closed the office down.  They were crying all day.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: And they couldn't understand--you know, the black people didn't really react that way, even though they liked Elvis Presley, but they didn't like him quite as much.  I mean, they didn't demonstrate it that much.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well the piece that I wrote though--it's funny you said--the lede was twenty years ago, Elvis Presley died, and I didn't care.  And I thought it didn't matter.  And the whole piece is about why it actually did matter.  You know, because when he died--I mean, Regina Jones, my publisher, wanted a piece in Soul magazine.  And I wasn't the one to write it.  I was--I mean, okay, I mean I wasn't--I didn't have any antipathy toward it, but it wasn't anything that I felt like, oh, god, I gotta write it.  And I remember she--we had this white stringer that we'd use, Mike Friedberg [ph.], and Mike wrote our Elvis piece, because I didn't have any particular interest in writing it.
Story_ID: 652395
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think, think--we were talking about Elvis [Elvis Presley].  Do you think in your, your musings about Elvis and research about Elvis, that he opened the door for black music to come out on the Top 40 stations, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I think Elvis made it, you know, made it possible to even, to even think, you know, of black people and white people listening to the same artists on the same radio stations.  Because before that, that didn't happen, you know.  Even during much of the early part of his career, that stuff didn't happen.  You hear all these stories of white people of a certain age.  They'll tell you about listening to music--you know, listening to (gesture) that music, to black music, under the covers, you know, with the, with the, with the flashlight, you know, with the radio turned down way low so dad couldn't hear that they were listening to this stuff.  Elvis was one of the first artists to have that truly, you know, pan-racial appeal, particularly in--in rock and roll.  I guess you could make an argument that there's certain of the big bands as having done that.  But, you know, in the rock and roll era, Elvis was like the first, you know, guy who really kicked that door open.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, not just peek it, peek it open--but just to, just really kick that door open.  I--you know--
Speaker 1: One of the attempts--they attempted to have Pat Boone sing 'Tutti Frutti' and other things, which--
Speaker 2: You ever heard that?
Speaker 1: --the record sold in the white community, but they didn't--
Speaker 2: But they're not remembered, and they're sure not loved.  Have you ever heard Elvis--I mean Pat Boone--yeah, I actually bought it, just to hear it.  And it's just, it's just very polite and just very sort of, you know, mid-'50s [1950s] crew cut (laughter) music.  But you know, it's not, it's not rock and roll.  You know, and he, you know, he's in sort of an odd place now, because he's obviously still alive and has lived to hear that stuff, you know, kind of repudiated.  But he was essentially used to clean up black music for white consumption.  Okay, kids, if you just gotta have this stuff, we'll give it to you in a nice clean sanitized version, so that you don't have to listen to the tall, black, homosexual with the pompadour and the lipstick.  (Laughter) You know, because that just that--you know, these are the 1950s, and that just freaks us out.  So no Little Richard, we'll give you Chuck Berry.  But the kids knew what the kids knew, and the kids wanted what the kids wanted, you know.  So I, I just find it, it--one of the things I like about music, and one of the things that I tried to do as a critic for the Herald [Miami Herald], was to write about music as a social artifact.  You know, so in other words, not just about it's got a good beat, or doesn't have a good beat and you can dance to it.  But it's about what does this mean in the time period in which it was set?  You know, Motown [Motown Records] to me was a part of the Civil Rights Movement.  Motown was integration, you know.  Disco was basically a nation that has--that is, you know, fed up with Watergate and with riots and with--let's just dance.  You know, there's a social connotation to all, to all of this music that, to me, you know, made it fascinating as, as, as, as a subject to write about.
Story_ID: 652396
Speaker 1: Yeah, does, does music still--is still a topic that comes up in your columns?
Speaker 2: Nah, not so much.  I stopped--you know, when I stopped being a music critic in '91 [1991], I kind of--I really withdrew from listening to a whole lot of stuff.  I occasionally hear things now that I, that I like.  Most of what I hear, I always tell my kids I've heard it before, you know.  I tell them I knew Lady Gaga when her name was Patti LaBelle (laughter).  So, except that Patti LaBelle could sing, you know.  But as far as the whole I'm going to wear an outlandish costume well, yeah, there was a group called Labelle that did that.  There was a guy named Elton John, there was a guy named David Bowie.  You know, they all did that, forty years ago.  So it's--
Speaker 1: Josephine Baker way back then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jo- yeah, thank you.  So, it's like, you know, I get the sense that I'm seeing a lot of stuff that I've heard--that I've seen before and that I've heard before.  So, I don't have as much interest.  Plus, so much of it feels so corporate and machine made right now that it's not even funny.  I remember, you know, back--I'm going to date myself.  But in the era that I came from, the music companies were run by people who were, who loved music.  You've got the Erteguns, Ahmet [Ahmet Ertegun] and Nesuhi Ertegun, at Atlantic [Atlantic Records].  You had obviously [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy.  You know, you got all--you got John Hammond.  You've got all these people who loved the music.  And now, it's basically run by lawyers and accountants.  And I think that from my ears at least, from my old ears at least, there is a difference.  I just don't have a whole lot of interest in stuff that sounds like it was cut and pasted together, you know, on an Apple computer.
Story_ID: 652397
Speaker 1: So you're, you're basically a music and arts critic when you start at the Miami Herald?  Do you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, '91 [1991] to '94 [1994], I did that for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then what happened in '94 [1994]?
Speaker 2: I went to a concert at Joe Robbie Stadium [Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida].  Actually, this happened in '93 [1993], but we weren't able to get the change in effect until '94 [1994].  I went to a concert at Joe Robbie Stadium.  It was Public Enemy and U2.  It was one of the better concerts I've ever gone to, and it was some of the best seats I've ever had, because I'm like four rows back from the stage.  And Public Enemy comes on, and they do their set.  And then Bono comes walking down the, this platform that they had, this--you know, to come to the stage.  And U2 is getting ready to do their set.  And I'm standing there--thirty whatever years old--with my notepad getting ready to take my, you know, my notes on the second set.  And this--just wave of kids comes rushing down from out of nowhere, from the cheap seats.  And I always tell people that they were knocking down anything that was old that happened to be in their path.  And I fit both descriptions.  I was thirty whatever, and I was in their path.  And, you know, I went down on one knee.  And the guy who got up was different from the guy who had been knocked down. (Laughter) I said, I think I'm getting a little old for this.  And I took my wife [Marilyn Pickens Pitts]--because we got kids all around us and kids are just--you know, they're partying and they're doing their thing.  And I just--yeah, I mean I'm enjoying the show, but I'm there to take my notes or whatever.  I took my wife and we went up to the nosebleed seats that these kids had vacated.  And I watched the rest of the show from there.  And I said to myself, okay, you're done.  Because any time you leave prime seats to go to the nosebleed seats, it's probably time to look for something new to do.  And I just, you know, I just felt like I'd, I'd had enough.  You know, I mean I'd come from the era of The O'Jays and The Spinners and The Temptations, to the era of New Kids on the Block and Milli Vanilli.  And I just wasn't really, I wasn't really loving it.  You know, Milli Vanilli--obviously famous as lip syncers.  New Kids on the Block, you know, were, you know, chosen, you know, mainly because they were pretty, they looked good.  There's not a whole lot of musical, you know, whatever there--which they said.  And it was Danny Wood I believe it was said in an interview with me, "You know, we're not the greatest musical group in the world."  Okay, thank you.  I thought it was just me.  And I just felt, you know, disconnected.  I didn't want to do it anymore.  My eighteen years was enough.
Speaker 1: That was the age of the music video shows on television and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the whole, you know--
Speaker 1: --MTV [Music Television; MTV] and--
Speaker 2: --music--music as spectacle.  And I still argue to this day--music is something that you hear.  It's lovely to have a video or whatever to go with it.  But if it's not (gesture), if it doesn't do anything in the auditory, you know, canal then I don't care about how fantastic your video is.  I don't care that you wear a meat dress to the awards ceremony.  Give me a song.  Give me a song that I--that says something to me that I like.  And there's less and less of that, you know.  My grandson came to me a few years ago (laughter).  He insists that he can play the keyboards, you know.  He never had a lesson, and he can't play a keyboard.  What he can do is get on that computer and pick out some things and then, you know, cut and paste it together until he has something that sounds like a song.  I told him, "Do me a favor.  If you ever meet a man named Joe Sample, don't say to him 'I can play the keyboards.' Because he'll either laugh in your face, or he'll start crying, or he'll punch you.  And I won't be able to help you, okay.  Because," I said, "this guy is a guy who can play the keyboards, who studied this, you know, and has been playing for longer than you and I have been on Earth. And, you know, and actually does this, as opposed to having cut and pasted something together."
Speaker 1: So music was changing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.  And you know, I confess to, you know, having become that crotchety old person I guess that I never--that I thought I never would be, but.

Speaker 1: You were, you were mentioning that you, that you liked Public Enemy at the time, in their concert?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I did, particularly around the era of 'Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black.'  You know, I used to like that album.  Chuck D had a lot of interesting things to say.  Flavor Flav, before he became a reality show, you know, whatever, was doing some interesting stuff.  You know, sort of challenging, you know, our conception of--of black.  And playing with, actually, our conception of black stereotyping and black image, with the big clock and the, "Yeah, boy," and the whole thing.  You know, there was just some--artistically and musically, there was some interesting stuff going on there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that I was ever a huge rap fan, but you know, there were a lot of groups I did like.
Speaker 1: Were there any other rap groups you thought were really significant in those days?
Speaker 2: Significant in those days?  They weren't per se a rap group, but I always liked Bell Biv DeVoe's 'Poison.'  I thought that that--that that song was significant, because to me it was like the first time that you had R and B and rap--you know, the hip hop sensibility blended really seamlessly.  Most of the time, what you have is some aging R and B star who'd sing a chorus and then the rappers come in, you know, to do their thing and kind of, you know, juice it up.  And then the aging R and B star comes back in and finishes the song.  And it's--basically, that's what it sounds like.  It sounds like somebody's grafted a rap onto some old person's song, to make it sound like something else.  And 'Poison' was like this song, where it was just like organic--the whole thing just sort of, just sort of really fit. And I just thought it was a really groundbreaking piece of music.
Story_ID: 652399
Speaker 1: So, now, now what did you do to, to change course?
Speaker 2: I went to my editor (laughter).  I went to my editor and said, "Please don't make me go to another New Kids on the Block, you know, or Milli Vanilli, or whoever's, show."  I told him that I was, you know, burned out on doing pop music.  I was really kind of, had of trepidation about this.  Because the Herald [Miami Herald] has hired me just a few years before to do pop music, and I'm telling them I've just had enough of this.  And I don't want to lose my job, you know.  And I have the idea--you know essentially, why don't you just let me write a column about whatever I want to write about?  You know, and I look back on it in hindsight.  And boy, was that a crazy thing to do. But it kind of worked.  The thing about my music column, as I told you a moment ago, is that I'd always written about music as a social artifact.  So, I used music to talk about--you know, with Elton--I did a piece on Elton John and used music to talk about AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  And I used Peter, Paul and Mary to talk about race.  And you know, and on and on and on.  So, it was always, there was always an element of social commentary in my music commentary.  So, essentially what I was saying was, let's--let me just do the music--the social commentary--and leave the music commentary to someone who actually cares about it.  And, you know, they, they, my editor actually said yes.  Steve Sonsky was my editor at the time.  And he said yes, and he said give him a couple of weeks and they'd make it happen.  And took about a year, but they did make it happen.
Story_ID: 652400
Speaker 1: Now, what was the atmosphere like, you know, for you as a, a black columnist at the Miami Herald?  I mean were there other black columnists there, or?
Speaker 2: There was me and there was Bob Steinback [Robert Steinback] and, I guess, Bea Hines [HistoryMaker Bea L. Hines].  Bea Hines did more about religion and community stuff.  But in terms of, you know, politics and social issues, and things of that nature, it was me and Bob Steinback.  And as far as the atmosphere, not so much anything that I noticed within the paper.  But, you know, the reaction comes from ou- from outside the paper more.  I mean, there's some stuff from inside.  But most of what you're going to get as a black journalist is from outside.  People to this day, count, or purport to count, because they're always wrong, but count the number of columns I do on race, you know.  "All you ever write about is race.  Seventy-five, 80 percent of what you write about--."  "No, actually it's not, sir.  By actual count, it's not.  You know, go take a look."  Because I'm anal retentive enough to have been told this so many times, that I've actually gone and counted.  And in any given year, it's 25 percent, something like that--maybe 30 percent on the year when I'm really going at it.  And why are you so pressed that you're counting it anyway?  Do you count how many columns that George Will writes about Republicans and [U.S.] Congress?  I don't think you do.  You know, there's sort of this patronization that comes with, "You know, you're very talented, and you can do other things."  Which again, no one has ever--I would swear no one's ever said to George F. Will, or to Kathleen Parker and the rest of these people.  But it's, you know, it's--you know, they present it as a thing of you're writing about this one subject too much.  And that's not what it is.  What it is is you're writing about a subject that makes me extremely uncomfortable, stop doing it.  Because there's no columnist in the country that does not have a core subject, or two, that he or she returns to, you know, on a frequent basis.  But this particular subject scares people.  Because that--you know, that's the kind of stuff that, that you deal with.  The only thing I ever had from editors was once--they (laughter) they told me once you're writing too much about--they did the same thing, you're writing too much about black stuff.  And you know, I said okay.  I dutifully tried to moderate it.  And then they came back and told me I wasn't writing enough and--you know, six months later.  And at that point, I just said, you know what?  I'm going to write what feels like it needs to be written, for me.  But this is--I was new to this at the time.  And there's really--it's really hard to know, you know, what's going on.  But what I've come to find out is that this is very routine.  All of this is very common for African American columnists, for African American journalists.  This stuff happens all the time.  I've, I've had the experience of being on both sides of the conversation where a new columnist calls a more experienced African American columnist and says, "This is happening to me.  Has this happened to you?  What do I do?  Is this normal?"  I've been the guy who's made the call--I called Dennis Hunt of the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times].  I've been the guy who received the call a few years later.  So, that's how I know, okay, this is just--this is just the routine.  This is just what happens.
Story_ID: 652401
Speaker 1: Now did you ever--I mean do you have a, I guess a formula or a philosophy for your column, how, how you approach writing it?
Speaker 2: I bristle at the word formula (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ha- I hesitated, to see if you would say that.
Speaker 2: No.  I, you know, it depends on what I'm trying to achieve.  There's different--you use different voices for different things.  You may use sarcasm or satire for one thing.  You may use a more dry and analytical voice for another thing.  You may use a colloquial voice for, for something else.  It depends.  I tend not to write a whole lot about politics, per se, although politics, you know, will often have a tangential relationship to what I'm writing.  But I write more about social issues and what somebody called the politics of the human condition.  They did that on one of the sales brochures for the column.  And I always liked that phrase, because that to me is more what I write about.  I don't write about what bill is going to do what in [U.S.] Congress.  As a writer, I generally don't care.  What I like to talk about is what does what's happening in Congress or what is, what's happening in schools, or what is happening in whatever place, say, about who we are as human beings and as Americans, and how we treat each other.  That, to me is the interesting subject.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you approach--what's a typical day for [HistoryMaker] Leonard Pitts?
Speaker 2: There is no such thing as a typical day.  That's the one thing I've learned.  It's just that whatever happens, come hell or high water, Tuesday and Thursday are deadline days, and I've got to produce columns on those days.  So, you know, to the degree there is a routine on Tuesday and Thursday, I'm up and I'm hammering at the column.  And nothing else intrudes until the column is done, which is usually about two o'clock in the afternoon.  But as I always tell students when I do writing classes, writing is not just what takes place at the keyboard, writing takes place here (gesture).  So, the day before each column is written, I am--you're scouting for subject matter.  And I'm deciding, as I've told you, what voice I'm going to use, what is it I'm trying to say, what is it I want to accomplish with this column?  As I'm sitting here, I'm thinking, you know part of my brain is working on, you know, the column I've got to write tomorrow.  I've got to do a piece on the rollout of the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010], and what a disaster that has been.  And I'm figuring out, okay, how am I going to approach that?  What points am I going to make?  How--you know, balancing things, et cetera, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So do you, like, immerse yourself in the news, or do you just go through a normal day, just you know--?
Speaker 2: It depends on how desperate I am for a subject matter.  Sometimes subjects just jump at you.  When Dr., when Dr. Ben Carson [HistoryMaker Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.] said--made this ill chosen remark likening the Affordable Care Act to slavery, I wasn't looking for a column. It was just sort of a gift from the column gods that dropped into my lap.  I think that happened on a Friday, so that's been--that meant, you know, Saturday, Sunday and Monday I really didn't have anything to do.  I was ready to go Tuesday.  It just, it just sort of--was there.
Speaker 1: How did it come to your notice?  Were you watching the FOX News or were you--?
Speaker 2: I think I saw it online.  I don't watch a lot of TV news.  I find TV news pretty much worthless.  But I'm online a lot, cnn.com.  You know, miamiherald.com, all the newspaper websites.  And I think at some point somewhere in there, I saw that.  And it was, it was, it was a gift.  And, you know, and I, and I went right for it.  And that--what it meant was I didn't have to spend Monday saying, okay, what am I going to write about?
Story_ID: 652402
Speaker 1: You utilize letters that are written to you, too, a lot?
Speaker 2: I've done--I haven't done that in a while.  You mean using reader letters?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I, I've done that.  The problem with doing that is that--actually I did that earlier this year, so I can't even say that I haven't done it in a while.  I tried--I tried to wean myself off of it.  But the thing about doing that is there's an inherent unfairness, in that, you know, as a reader you don't have that megaphone, and I do.  And I try to minimize that by not giving identifying information about the reader.  I'll just--usually I'll just use a first name, or something along those lines.  But the things that people say are sometimes so breathtaking and amazing that I can't not respond to them in a public way.  People say things that are just astonishing to me.  And, you know, if something is really just troubling my conscious--if something is really on my mind, that's usually a sign that that's something I need to write a column about.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can give you a bunch of examples, unfortunately.  There was one where I'd written a column about the lack of audience for historical movies.  And I mentioned the varying responses to 'Rosewood,' 'Beloved,' 'Saving Private Ryan,' and 'Schindler's List.'  And some reader sent me a note saying that the other two, the latter two movies, had enjoyed greater success because they were about--they were (gesture) American, in caps.  They were American, they were about American themes as opposed to being narrowly tailored to a, to one racial group.  You know, because 'Beloved' and 'Rosewood' were about African American history.  And that really struck me, because the other two, the other movies I listed, 'Schindler's List' stars a British actor, if I'm not mistaken, Ralph Fiennes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: Ralph Fiennes, yeah, British actor.  A, you know, a cast basically of non-Americans.  It's about what happened to Polish Jews (laughter) in Poland during the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  The other movie is 'Saving Private Ryan,' which takes place in France and stars, you know, is an all-white cast, which is fitting because, you know, the [U.S.] Army was segregated at that time.  That's more American, in quotes, than 'Rosewood,' which took place in Florida, and 'Beloved,' which took place in Kentucky and Ohio.  And so, yeah, I had to, I had to deal with that, (laughter) you know, as a writer.  And I just kind went off on that reader, because that just really sort of spoke volumes to me about how--who we perceive as being part of America.  You know, particularly, 'Schindler's List.'  I mean British actors, Polish Jews, Poland, is more American than black people in Florida in this person's point of view.  So, yeah, when people do that kind of stuff, I tend to write about it.  I tell people I have a, I have a great tolerance for differences of opinion.  But I have like zero tolerance for stupidity.  And when you do something like that--that just sort of, that just sort of sets me off; and it's hard for me not to write about it.
Story_ID: 652403
Speaker 1: Now in 1999--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --your, your book, 'Becoming Dad' ['Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood,' Leonard Pitts]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --published.  'Black Men'--
Speaker 2: 'And the Journey to Fatherhood' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'and the Journey to Fatherhood.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, you had five kids by then, right?
Speaker 2: I sure did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the motivation for it?  I mean, I guess, well--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) For the book (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You tell us, though.  I--we can guess, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually, I had written a bunch of sort of light, humorous, columns about fatherhood.  And I got a, I was approached by this publishing company that wanted me to write a book of, you know, fatherhood reminiscences, you know.  And I told them that's a lovely idea, but there's this comedian named Bill Cosby who did it first.  And I just didn't see myself competing with Bill Cosby.  And besides that, you know, given that a book is such a--a book requires a level of discipline and commitment that you're not going to be able to bring to bear unless you're really engaged in the subject.  And I told him if I'm going to write about fatherhood, then I want to write a more substantive book about me and my father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] and this whole issue of what it's like to not have had a good father, and then try to make yourself a good father.  Because that's, that's what I was living.  I became an instant dad when I married Marilyn [Marilyn Pickens Pitts], and then we had three kids of our own.  So, you know, they accepted my counterproposal, and that's how 'Becoming Dad' came to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well, what are some of the observations you make in the book?
Speaker 2: I talk about the fact that those of us who did not have good fathers would kind of wind up making it up as we go along.  You know, most people who had a dad in their lives draw from that experience, draw from that example.  But those of us who did not, we are sort of in a position of trying to figure it out.  We look at TV dads--and I thought I was the only one who did this until I wrote the book.  And I heard a lot of people, "No, no, I've done that too."  We look at TV dads, we look at other people's dads, we look at our moms.  You know, all this, to try to figure out what our model of fatherhood is going to be.  So, you know, I talked about, you know, talked about that.  I talked about, you know, the idea that a lot of what ails our communities, particularly in the African American community, I think can be traced to the absence of dad.  I think that's sort of an under discussed, but very important aspect.  And what was interesting to me, was in talking to these--you know as men in general we have this reputation for non--not communicating our thoughts and, you know, and grunting and scratching ourselves and whatever.  And I spoke to all these men about their dads and their role as fathers.  And what surprised me was how articulate and thoughtful these guys were.  Every man I spoke to had thought--you could tell they've given serious thought to this, about what they--and even the guys who were doing a lousy job had given serious thought to why they were doing a lousy job, and what was it they needed to, to, to fix?  So, this is something that was obvious, at least to me, obviously on, on, on men's minds.
Story_ID: 652404
Speaker 1: I guess is, are there essential qualities a father has to have to be successful?
Speaker 2: I think as any parent, not just as dad, but any parent, you have to be willing to give yourself--you have to be willing to make mistakes.  You have to understand that you're going to make mistakes.  And if these, if they're made with love and if you correct them, they're usually not going to be fatal (laughter).  I think, you know, and I'm thinking of the scene, I think it's the movie 'Parenthood,' where the father is making his son play third base or something, or how to play shortstop.  And he fantasizes that forty--twenty years later, the kid's on the tower with a sniper rifle (laughter) because his dad, you know, (laughter) made him play.  And that's very real.  I look at that series and you know what, yeah, I've had those--I mean obviously it's an exaggeration.  But I've had those feelings.  So, I think you have to understand that kids are resilient, first of all.  But I think for dad in particular, the most important thing that dad can do, is be there.  And that seems like such a little thing.  But the thing that you have to understand, and yeah, this is sexist, I understand, but the perception is, for kids, and for us as a society, mom has no choice.  Mom has to be there, you know.  Right or wrong, that's the perception, you know.  But dad, in the way we formulate it, seems to have a choice.  So, as a kid I think it does something for you when dad's choice is to be with you.  And think about it.  How many dads are just not, just not there?  You know, either they're, they're, they're completely gone, or they're physically present but emotionally and mentally checked out, emotionally and mentally gone.  You know, so when dad chooses to engage with you and dad decides that you are important enough that I am physically there and you have my undivided attention, I think that's a very important and very powerful thing that really we don't pay a whole lot of attention to.  I--in the book ['Becoming Dad: Black Men and the Journey to Fatherhood,' Leonard Pitts] I interviewed a teacher, one of my kids' teachers, as a matter of fact.  And she was talking about--they did two events in the spring.  They did a moms tea and a dads--and a fathers tea.  And you know, the kids, you know, prepare the classroom, and they have the snacks or whatever.  And mom comes to school and sits at the little table with the kids, and they do their thing.  And the teacher told me the kids enjoy that.  It's really nice.  But it's a whole different level of excitement when the dads come.  You know, because again, dad has options, and I'm not saying it's right, you know.  To any women who will hear this, I'm not saying it's right, I'm saying it is.  It's reality.  You know, the perception is dad has options, and dad chose to be with me today.  That is so powerful.  You know, that's very powerful.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I don't want to skip over anything.  But you know, I next to wanted to--want to raise the 9/11 article ['Sept. 12, 2001: We'll Go Forward From this Moment,' Leonard Pitts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is 2001, September 11th.  You wrote a column that, you know, got national--well, they all get national attention on some level.  But this really got big national attention.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 652405
Speaker 1: What was it about your column ['Sept. 12, 2001: We'll Go Forward From This Moment,' Leonard Pitts]? What did you say that really got people so excited?
Speaker 2: Have you re- have you read that paper at all?
Speaker 1: I've read parts of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--you know, I wrote that column--I began that column even before the second tower [South Tower of the World Trade Center, New York, New York] came down, I think.  And I wrote it with a sense that we didn't--you know, at the time I started writing, we didn't know who had done this.  We didn't know what the reasoning was.  You know, so it was--and I couldn't write about Middle Eastern terrorism or domestic or whatever.  So, I went with the only two things I did know, which was one, this made me very angry, and two, that I was--I believed that as Americans we would come together over this, and we would get whoever was responsible.  And if you look at that column, it doesn't say anything terribly deep.  Those are the only things that it says.  And I think that what happened was that's what everybody was feeling.  I think it caught what ever- what everyone was feeling.  Because when that piece appeared the next day, I opened my email queue and there was, there were five hundred emails.  And I went through them, and it there was far too many for me to answer.  So I just sort of, you know, sorted through them and looked at a few, representative, and then closed the box.  And after I clo- as I closed the box, there were a thousand.  And every time I went through and sorted through them, there were five--there were more.  And by the time I stopped counting, there were thirty thousand emails, you know, from that, from that particular column.  It was just--it was just incredible.
Speaker 1: You said that--I guess whatever the gripe that the perpetrator had--you quoted in the column, you said, "You just damned your cause."
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Which, you know, I think--I think there was a sense that, you know, you're going to make us--that they were going to make us fear, they were going to make us to, to respect their cause.  And I felt that whoever did this--and I think, you know, the sense was that it was probably terrorism from somewhere afar--that they didn't, really didn't understand the character of this nation (laughter).  And they didn't really understand the contrariness of this nation--that to do something like that is not going to win you respect and it's not going to win you--it's not going to win you fear.  It's just going to resolve people that they're going to come get you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Richard Gephardt [Dick Gephardt], you know, read it on--
Speaker 2: Richard Gephardt read it.  Regis Philbin read it on television.  They set it to music, they put it on posters (laughter).  That column went all over the place. That column did things that I've never seen any column by anybody ever do.  It was just, it was, it was amazing.  At some point--and people would ask me if I was proud of it.  And it was sort of a, I had sort of a distance from it.  It's like if you have four kids and you raise them, and you treat them all the same and you love them all the same, and three of them do well in life but, you know, the fourth one, you know, becomes a Nobel laureate, and goes to the moon or something.  It's like, well, you know, I treated them all the same. So, it's hard for me to, to, to accept any special credit or claim on that one.  It just--I wrote it, and it did what it did.
Story_ID: 652406
Speaker 1: I just--just popped in my mind.  I forgot to ask you about something that I'm sure you probably wrote about that--but, you, you must have written something about Rodney King back in the?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I wrote about the--I didn't have the column when the actual beating took place.  But I did have the column--I didn't have a column, I was allowed to write about the, the riot, the King riot.  And I just wrote about how--actually I wrote about the verdict and the riot.  I just wrote about how fatigued you get when you are--as an African American, you are completely--you are continually denied justice.  And I think this is something that people who are not an African American sometimes don't really appreciate--the fatigue that sets in when you go to the justice system looking for justice and there is no justice.  And the Rodney King case was a perfect example.
Speaker 1: And then later, I mean, almost ten years later, the verdict, the O.J. Simpson verdict, comes in.
Speaker 2: And actually, it wasn't ten years.  It was '95 [1995], I think it was.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But do you think they're related, in terms of the jury's decision around O.J.?
Speaker 2: You mean as payback?  No, I think that there's a, I think there's a tendency to read a lot into that.  I think that the O.J. Simpson case [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995], on its own merits, says less about race than it does about money and class.  I think that if you or I--or I'll speak for me.  With the evidence that they had against him had gone to court with the inability to hire the dream team of lawyers, we would still be sitting in jail.  And--but race is, has a power to distract people to such a degree that it becomes a thing--it becomes the only thing that anyone sees.  But I think that, you know, had O.J. Simpson not had the money that O.J. Simpson had, you would have probably seen a very different outcome from that.  Now, that said, I was disappointed in African Americans--I was just disappointed in Americans, period, in attaching such racial prominence and importance to that case.  I was disappointed that black folks were cheering the acquittal, like black folks have just won something.  You've won nothing.  You know, this is a guy who probably killed his wife, who went free.  And whatever the legal justification for that is, you didn't, we didn't win a darn thing.  You know, and the white folks who equated, you know, themselves to--you know to--who basically started singing nobody knows the trouble we've seen, and how can the justice system do us this wrong?  Please, you know, let's talk some Emmett Till and--and let's talk some, you know, century of lynchings and photographs of the lynchers, and nobody ever, you know, does time.  And then we can talk about the justice system doing us wrong.  I just, I was embarrassed for black folk and white folk (laughter) in, in the reactions to the O.J. Simpson verdict.  It was just, it was not America's finest moment, any American's finest moment.

Eric Rudolph, the Atlanta Olympic Park bomber.  It included a column on a man who was, who died after a run in with police in Cincinnati [Ohio].  Let's see.  Oh, and there was a column in there that was an open letter from Pat Robertson to God, asking for a plague of locusts or something, because the liberal media is just getting, it's getting to be too much for him.  Oh, what else was in there?  There was a column on Amina Lawal who was a Nigerian woman who was set to be stoned under Sharia law, for supposedly being unfaithful or sexually promiscuous, I guess.  There were ten in all.  How many have I named?  Like six or seven?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's a good, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember those columns. Those were, (laughter) those were like the home run hitters, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there one you're the most proud of? (Unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In that package?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, no, those are all daddy's children (laughter).  You know. I mean any package of columns that wins, that you know, wins you a Pulitzer, I love them all equally.
Story_ID: 652408
Speaker 1: Two thousand nine [2009], you wrote your first novel, I think, right? Was that the?
Speaker 2: The first to be published.  I've been writing novels since college [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] but, yeah, that's the first novel to be published.  It was called 'Before I Forget' [Leonard Pitts].
Speaker 1: And it's about a soul singer who was, who got Alzheimer's right?
Speaker 2: It's about a forty-nine year old washed up singer who lives here in the D.C. area [Washington, D.C.], actually, who discovers that--who was diagnosed one day with early onset Alzheimer's disease, and resolves to fix two very broken relationships in his, in his life.  He's got a son who's nineteen years old who he's not been a good dad to.  He's been kind of a distant dad.  He's paid the bills, but he's never been present in his son's life.  And his son has just been arrested for his part in a failed robbery--or in a robbery actually, it didn't fail--in a robbery in which a man was killed.  And so, you know, he's got to go and sort of deal with that relationship, and with what role his absence from his son's life played in his son's decision to take part in that, in that ill fated robbery.  And then he also gets the word that his own father is dying of prostate cancer, and he hasn't spoken to his father in thirty years.  So, he embarks on a road trip with his son to drive across country to say goodbye to his father.  And it's basically fathers, fathers, sons, and regrets.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was the critical reception to it?
Speaker 2: Very good, very good.  Surprisingly, you know, surprisingly good.  I don't think I read too many bad--or any bad reviews.  If you look on Amazon, I think there's one guy--there's one guy who says--and it's funny, you can always remember the wording of the bad, and you can't remember the wording of the good.  But there's one guy on Amazon who calls it a good Ebonic novel (laughter).  This is one of my regular column readers who, who apparently didn't like the fact that it uses some black slang, so it becomes an Ebonics novel.  But that's like the only negative review I ever saw of that book, so I'll take it.  Given the source, if he had loved the book, I would have been a little worried.
Speaker 1: What's the highest praise you can remember for it?
Speaker 2: The highest praise for a book is you made me stay up, you know, reading this.  Or, I was--or also--and I've gotten this from book novels. I was angry with you for what happened to X character.  Because when someone's angry that something happened to a character, that means they've invested in that character, which means you've done your job as a writer.
Story_ID: 652409
Speaker 1: Now, I skipped over this incident that happened in 2007, around--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --death threats by neo-Nazis about a Knoxville [Tennessee] rape case, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what, what happened?  What was the column about and why did--
Speaker 2: There was a case in Knoxville in '07 [2007], in which two white kids were killed and apparently tortured. And four African Americans were arrested for this.  And this became a cause celebre in the, in white supremacy circles.  They said that evidence of genocide--you know, I'm just telling you what they said.  That black folk, you know, black folks are trying to commit genocide against whites, and that why wasn't this picked up as a national news story?  And that if, you know, if the shoe had been on the other foot, that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] would have come to town--this that and the other.  But that the news media did not pick this up because they are afraid to report white--black crime against whites, that they underreport black crime against white people.  And if you know anything about news and the studies thereof, you know that the exact opposite is true, that white on--that black on white crime is actually over reported, you know, as a, as a--based on how frequently it happens.  It's actually over reported.  And white on black crime is underreported.  And that interracial crime of any stripe is pretty much the most--the most rare kind of violent crime you're ever going to have.  We don't attack--you know, violent crime is not cross racial, it's interracial [sic. intraracial].  So, if you're black and you're going to be attacked or robbed or whatever, you know, look for somebody who looks like you--the same if you're white.  So anyway, I wrote a column, you know, pointing that out.  And I ridiculed this whole idea that this is--that this is genocide.  And I closed the column with probably the most tightly addressed line I think I've ever written.  It said, for the crazies, kooks and incendiaries, I believe it was, who have chosen this tragedy upon which to make this obscene and ludicrous stand, I have four words, the fateful words, cry me a river.  And what happens is people choose to, people choose to misunderstand or misstate what you've said.  And me telling these idiots, these, you know, the white supremacists to cry me a river because they think that black crime is underreported becomes, or they're reported as me telling the parents and the family of these murder victims, cry me a river.  And, you know, the night the column appears, we get a call from a gentleman--a gentleman?  Boy, am I being nice.  A guy--who identifies himself as the--you, know, president of the neo--American, the neo-Nazi, you know, group, the neo-Nazi party.  And, you know, I don't know how it is at your house.  But at my house, if you call and say you're the head Nazi, can I speak to the man of the house, you're probably not going to get very far.  And my wife [Marilyn Pickens Pitts], you know, tells him--she was actually pretty polite, much politer than I would have been.  She tells him, you know, please don't call again.  And, you know, goodbye, and hangs up.  The next day I go online, there's an email pointing me to his website where he has gotten hold of our, the home address, and one of the phone numbers into the house.  And he's posted them on his website with an invitation for all of his, you know, fellow neo-Nazis and white supremacists to look us up, to come by and chat about it.  And, you know, thereby begins an interesting couple of months of, of, you know, harassment phone calls, harassment mail, (cough) excuse me--people driving through the neighborhood.
Story_ID: 652410
Speaker 1: You know, two things happen out of that, that I find, you know, kind of telling.  One was--not telling--the first one was kind of sad.  I got all of these phone calls.  One of the calls that I got was from one of the relatives of one of these two people who had been tortured and killed.  And they want to know why I've said this about--and it- that's heartbreaking.  You know, it's one thing for some idiot to pretend that I've said something.  But for these people who are already suffering--just, you know, the worst thing that any of us can imagine--to believe that I've told them to cry me a river.  You know, that just, that was one of the first times I truly--I was just really infuriated.  And, you know, I had to talk to this man and explain to him, no, that's not what I said.  The other thing that happened which is--I've always cherished--I had interviewed--I'd gone down to Louisiana during Hurricane--or right after Hurricane Katrina, to do interviews.  And in Franklinton, Louisiana, I met a man named Barry Turner.  And if you look in the dictionary under good old boy, you'll probably find Barry Turner.  Big, bearish white guy.  You shake his hand, and you think you're not going to get yours back (gesture) (laughter) you know, that kind of thing--pumps your hand like he's looking for oil.  And I interviewed Barry about--you know, he's cleaning up in front of the store.  And I interviewed him about the hurricane--this, that and the other.  And you know, I kind of liked him, he was a good guy.  And in the middle of this, I get a call from Barry Turner.  And he doesn't know what's going on, but he's heard there's death threats and this, that and the other--and if I need to send my family somewhere, send them down to him and he'll take--he'll look after them.  And he'll make sure, you know. Now, (laughter) the interesting thing is he didn't say anything about me (laughter).  But, you know, my wife and kids are welcome to come, you know, and he'll look after them and he'll make sure that everything is all right. And I just thought that was the most wonderful thing.  Because on the one hand, you've got all of this crazy stuff going on and all this white supremacist garbage, you know going on and death threats and security and interviews on CNN and all this.  And then on the other hand, you've got this guy who is the poster child for the white good old boy saying, you know, this is garbage, you know.  And if you need help--me--and I've got a bunch of friends, we'll look out for you.  It's one of those--one of those moments that just remind you to have a little more faith in humanity.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, all right.  So, how long did it take this to die down?
Speaker 1: It took probably, probably until the end of the year.  I mean it died down, most of it was gone in two months.  But there were still little flare ups.  I did a speech at--I forget--the University of Puget Sound [Tacoma, Washington].  And they did, they interviewed me about this.  And I, you know, made the mistake of speaking candidly about it.  And they got like death threats there in advance of the speech (laughter).  And so, you know, it's kind of, it's funny in hindsight.  We have this, you know, thing where people are being searched as they come in and, you know, and purses and all this stuff.  And there's police and all--and this.  But then the place is crowded.  It's a standing room only audience, so they put people on the stage with me (laughter).  So, you know, I've got people behind--I'm under death threat, and I've got like twenty people that I can't quite see.  You know, so it was really kind of funny (laughter).  You know, on the one hand, they've done this great security.  But on the other hand, you know, what about these people back here.  You know, what are you going to do?
Story_ID: 652411
Speaker 1: Now you write ano- there's another--as I said I'm, I'm--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) going from what I have, and I don't want to miss out on anything.  If there's something I miss, we can go back and get it.  But I want to talk about 'Freeman' [Leonard Pitts].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's a novel, another novel, it's an historical novel.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Freeman' came out in 2012.  It came out last year.  And 'Freeman' was a book about a former slave at the end of the Civil War.  His name is Sam.  And he's living in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he's working at a library.  He's a literate slave.  And the end of the war comes, and he's seized by a compulsion to go find his wife whom he hasn't seen in fifteen years.  And when last he saw her, they were slaves together on a plantation a thousand miles south in Mississippi.  And he has no money, and he has no idea if she's still there.  He has no idea if she still wants to see him.  He has no idea if she's dead or alive.  And he has good reason to think that even if she's still there and alive and in good health that she will hate him, because when last he saw her, he had taken their son on an ill advised escape attempt against her wishes and their son was killed.  The son was fourteen years old.  And that's the last he saw her.  So he's seized, you know, at the end of the war, to go and find her, you know, for two reasons: one, because he's never stopped loving her and two, because you know, there's this sort of unresolved thing between them, you know, with their son being killed.  There's this sort of unresolved thing that he feels needs to be resolved, whether she needs to slap him or spit on him or curse him or hit him, or whatever.  You know, he carries the guilt from having, you know, having taken their son against her wishes and their son being, and their son being killed.  So, he embarks upon a walk from Philadelphia to Mississippi to find his wife.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the closing months of--
Speaker 2: This is--the book begins literally at the moment that the news reaches Philadelphia that the war is over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's the night of September 9th--not September--the night of April 9th, 1865.
Speaker 1: This is still a time of a lot of chaos down south. Not to (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know, that--yeah, I mean they're still fighting.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, General Lee [Robert E. Lee] has surrendered, but some of those, some of those boys are still fighting.  There's chaos and there's whatever.  And he's gonna--and he's walking through it to find his wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I don't want to spoil it by asking what happens.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I wouldn't tell you anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the--but what inspired you to write a his- an historical novel?
Speaker 2: I've always wanted to write African American historical fiction.  I think that there are so many stories there that just are not told.  Because as we were talking earlier, there's, you know, a lack of appreciation for history, and history's not taught very well.  I came across this story in reading Leon Litwack's book I told you about, 'Been in the Storm So Long' ['Been in the Storm So Long: The Aftermath of Slavery'].  There's about three pages where he talks about the things that the slaves went through at the end of slavery to reconstitute their families.  And I read that, and I said this is amazing.  You know, people walking across states to find people, and not, not even knowing if they're going to find them.  This is amazing.  This is a profound testament of, of what love means.  And nobody knows these tales.  So, it was always in the back of my mind that this would be a, you know, a great framework for some, for fiction.  And when I got the chance to do it, you know, 'Freeman' is what resulted.  It did that--that book is--has a longer gestation than anything I've ever written.  That book has almost a thirty year gestation.  Because I read Litwack's book back in the '80s [1980s] and then 'Freeman' came out in 2012.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you, you say you were inspired by that, those stories of Litwack?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did it take a lot of research to write this, or--
Speaker 2: In a sense, I've been researching it for thirty years because, you know, just as a person who's fascinated by the history.  I've been reading these stories.  The research that I had to do in actually writing this book was not so much about what the slaves did as it was about trying to recreate the physical world of back then.  You know, when you write historical fiction, it's not about, it's never about the real big questions.  It's about what did a woman's underwear look like (laughter)?  Because I have a scene where a woman takes off her clothes.  Okay, what did a woman wear under her clothes, particularly a slave woman in 1865?  I have a scene where two characters go into a store to buy some rice.  Okay, I know when I go buy rice I get a plastic bag that says Mahatma or Uncle Ben's.  What, you know, what did buying rice look like in 1865?  So, that's the kind of stuff that you end up doing a lot of research with and spending a lot of time at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's where, that's where you got your--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. I spent a lot of time at the Library of Congress.  I did a lot of interviews.  I did, I spent a few minutes on the telephone with the Mississippi Department of Agriculture [Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce] just trying to determine the character and quality of the soil in northern Mississippi for a line where I had him, you know, walking through Mississippi.  What's he walking across?  What does it look like?  You know, there's a train museum up in Pennsylvania [Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania, Ronks, Pennsylvania] that I found, and I spent a day there just to get a feel for what those old trains looked like, because I have two other characters that have taken a train down to the same location.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where did he have to go in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a town that I--you know, it's a fictional town.  But in my mind it's about a day's ride, which makes it about a hundred miles south of Memphis [Tennessee].  So whatever, on the river [Mississippi River].  So, whatever you find when you travel about a hundred miles south of Memphis, that's where my town is.
Speaker 1: There's a town in, you know, around Holly Springs [Mississippi] in the area that you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Holly Springs I think is a little bit more, a little bit more in away from the river.  This is right on--this town--my town is right on the river.
Speaker 1: Right off the river, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 652412
Speaker 1: What was the reaction, the critical reaction to the book?
Speaker 2: 'Freemen' [Leonard Pitts] has done exceptionally well.  You know, it's, it's--I judge a lot by the Amazon reviews.  And I think there are fifty--to date there are fifty reviews of--'Before I Forget' [Leonard Pitts]--on there.  And they are all, you know, pretty much mostly positive.  And there's two hundred and thirty some of 'Freemen,' which is probably nothing by Stephen King's standards, but I like it.  You know, there's two hundred and thirty reviews, and most of them are lauding the book.  It was praised by the, you know, my paper.  They hired a stringer to do a review, and she liked it.  As a matter of fact she told my book editor, "You have to read this."  And then the, the paper in Memphis [Tennessee].  And there was another paper in--wait a minute.  I want to say Charlotte [North Carolina], but I'm not sure--somewhere in the Carolinas that, you know, and we hadn't even pitched--where the guy just did a really nice piece on it.  So, there were a lot of, you know, really good reviews of that book.
Speaker 1: Have you gotten any feedback from historians and such?
Speaker 2: You mean did I get it right?  Yeah, I let a couple of historians that I know--I had a couple of historians that I know read it.  And they approved, which was really good.  I haven't had, I don't know where Litwack [Leon Litwack] is.  I don't know if he's read it.  I doubt--I'd love to hear what he thinks, since it was, you know, based on, or inspired by his book.  But the historians that have read it have approved.  And that's, that's, you know that's the scary part for me.  Because there's so much stuff that you can get wrong.  There was one--there was a scene of a steamboat that pulls up in Memphis.  And I think I had, I had the people disembarking walking down a plank, is what I called it.  And I sent this to a guy who wrote a book on steamboats, and he told me no, that's called the landing stage.  And I was just so glad that I--you know, it's a little thing, and most people probably wouldn't have gotten it.  But I was just glad that I'd shown it to him, because it helped me to get that little bit right.  There's a scene that takes place in Chicago [Illinois] which--and I didn't know this.  There were hardly any black people in Chicago at the time.  And I was ready to write Chicago--at least population wise--something like what I know Chicago to be now.  And I talked to a couple of Chicago experts and said, "Okay, I've got a black woman in Chicago and she's going to need a, she's going to need a place to stay overnight.  Where does she go?"  And they said, "Well, there's not a lot, and there's no hotel that would probably take her.  She'd have to go to a boarding house."  Okay, so I gave her a boarding house.  But that's the kind of research you end up doing for historical fiction.
Story_ID: 652413
Speaker 1: We were talking about the, a new movie that came out, based on the (unclear)--
Speaker 2: '12 Years a Slave' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Solomon Northup.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you were giving me kind of your review of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you wrote a column about it ['12 Years a Slave,' More Than a Masterpiece,' Leonard Pitts]--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that just appeared today.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What did you think about it?
Speaker 2: I think '12 Years a Slave' needs to be seen.  And I think that if you don't understand the crime that the movie depicts then at a fundamental level, you do not understand America then or now.  There is so much talk about, you know, what's going wrong or what's going right, or what's happening in the African American community, or who black folk are.  But there is--by the same time there is a tendency to want to just sort of glide over all this horrific stuff as--and readers tell me this all the time, "You're living in the past.  That stuff doesn't have any bearing--." African American history is the only history I've ever heard where people say it has no bearing on where we are now.  If I talk about World War II [WWII] as a way of understanding what the world is, the geopolitical situation of the world is, everybody gets a connection.  If I talk about slavery and Jim Crow as a way of understanding who and what African America is right now, people act as if I've just started spouting, you know, Greek poetry to them or something.  "I do not understand.  What is the connection?  It's been years.  What does this mean?"  And it gets very, very frustrating.  And I think we--you know, I think part of the reason it gets frustrating is because they are allowed to be ignorant.  They are allowed, and this--black and white--they are allowed to be the balm of ignorance.  They're allowed the luxury of not knowing what actually happened in this country.  And that movie takes it away.  You can't see that movie and come away still ignorant about what this so called peculiar institution really was.  So, I think that--you know, I'm thinking about sponsoring a group from my church, kids from my church, just to take them just to make sure that this movie is seen, because I think it needs to be seen.
Story_ID: 652414
Speaker 1: I think I was particularly interested in knowing your reaction to that movie, and calling attention to that column because of your recent research in your own book--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know--which kind of qualifies you to be a critic, you know, in ways that may not qualify other people.
Speaker 2: I think that once you really read the history, certain stuff is not such a mystery to you anymore.  You can sort of see how things fit together and where stuff comes from and what it relates to.  And you see how the pieces go together in a way that I don't think you really can if you haven't been, if you haven't made yourself conversant with the history.  I think a lot of people are trying to talk on subjects about which they really have no knowledge.  And we talked a moment ago about Ben Carson, Dr. Ben Carson [HistoryMaker Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.], saying that the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] was the worst thing since slavery.  And I had a lot of readers, you know, wondering why did you--because I really took off very hard on him.  I had a lot of readers saying, "Well okay, he made a stupid exaggeration."  In your eyes, it's a stupid exaggeration.  Because I understand what slavery was, and because I understand this is not some distant, dim memory--but that it actually haunts, you know--who and what we are today, I understand it was more than a stupid exaggeration.  It was an insult, and it was an affront, and it was a trivialization.  You know, I just think that we tend to be very--I think African Americans seem to be very poor stewards of their history.  And I think we as Americans tend to be very disrespectful of this particular history--of all history, frankly, but of African American history in general.  We just tend to be very disrespectful of it.
Speaker 1: And you can have this lack of understanding if you're a surgeon as well as if you're just a cat off the street.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, as I've been telling people, gifted minds does not necessarily--I mean gifted hands does not necessarily mean gifted mind.  And you know, he's a, he's a celebrated surgeon and he's got a great rags to riches resume, and he's done wonderful things.  But on this particular subject, he could not be more wrong.

Speaker 1: What projects are you working on now in terms of--you write all the time, but you are a writer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And you recognized that when you were five.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what projects are you working on now?
Speaker 2: Well, I've got a novel cooking.  It's based, it sort of jumps back and forth in time.  It's based--it has--it unfolds on Election Day in 2008, which is the Obama election [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], obviously.  And it also unfolds in Memphis [Tennessee] in the spring of 1968 during the King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination.  And it's the same character in both times and his interactions with Dr. King, and also his interactions in 2008 with the couple of white supremacists who are plotting to kill the president elect.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, have you been approached by any movie makers yourself, in terms of--
Speaker 2: No, everybody asks that.  No, don't I wish.  Not yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are you thinking about for your next column?
Speaker 2: For my next column, I am going to write about the rollout of the Affordable Care Act [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010] and what this says about, you know, where has competence gone in the American government?  You know, I look at this and I'm reminded of Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] in this sense.  You know, not that anybody died or was drowned because of the rollout of the Affordable Care Act.  But Katrina, like the Affordable Care Act, was something that was forecast; you could see this coming.  You knew it had to be done, and you blew it, you know.  And that does not give me confidence for what the government can do in the event of something that's unforeseen.  Katrina, they knew it was out there for what, four or five days?  And it strikes, and then oh my god, we got nothing in place, we don't know what to do.  The Affordable Care Act, the implementation has been coming for two years--more?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we got a website that doesn't work. (Laughter) It's like a little competence guys, that's all I ask for.  You know, so that, that'll be the column.
Story_ID: 652416
Speaker 1: Do you have a journalistic philosophy?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I try to get--try to, you know, try to get the details right.  You know, sweat the small stuff, because it's the small stuff that will indict the big stuff if you don't do it right.  And, you know, the old journalistic cliche, to comfort the afflicted, and to afflict the comfortable, I think is always, you know, is one of my favorite maxims.  I think it's always a good thing.
Story_ID: 652417
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major move that you've made that you wish you could undo?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Not really.  Because I think even the bad stuff, I think you learn from it.  You know, even the stuff that didn't come out as--didn't come out so well.  I left RadioScope and, you know, did not part on the happiest of terms there, but you learn.  You know, you become a better and a wiser and a more mature person, if you're lucky.  So, I don't really have a whole lot of regrets, no.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about RadioScope that you need, you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: RadioScope was a situation of friends, or at least I thought friends, who went into business with the understanding--and I have this on paper--of friends who went into business with the understanding that when this breaks, we will have certain percentages.  And what happened was the moment there was some money, a little money involved, then amnesia set in (laughter).  That's probably the short version.  That's the short version that I can give you.  Amnesia, you know, became a problem.  And, you know, everything went south from there.  And you know, for a time, there was a sense of anger and there was a sense of betrayal.  But frankly, if RadioScope had worked I would not be--I would likely not be doing what I am, you know, now.  I might still be in radio, which as I said before, I think radio was a career cul de sac, because radio is not a writer's medium.  So, you know, I tend to think, you know, all things work to the good.  So, I really don't have a whole lot of regrets.  You know, I don't have any regrets about that or about anything.

Speaker 1: Once again, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: Jeez, I would hope I'm too young for legacy, but (laughter).  You know, I don't really think in terms of legacies.  I think in terms of doing the best that I can every morning that I get up.  I think that when you do--when you are blessed to do--and I use that word advisedly.  When you are blessed to do something that you enjoy doing, and something that you feel you were put here to do--what happens I think is that there is a--for me at least--you wake up with a sense that I've got to prove that I deserve this.  I've got a great job.  You know, some people get up every day and go to jobs that they hate.  I get up every day and go do something that I've wanted to do professionally since I was five years old.  So, what that means is when I sit down at that computer to write, I want to prove to anybody who's reading, and to myself, to my own satisfaction--and I'm the final and toughest critic--that I deserve this, that I was good enough.  You know, so every day, you know, every day's not equal.  You know, some days you're a little bit better than you are on other days.  A lot of factors go into that.  But every day, whatever else is going on, I want to bring the very best that I had on that given day.  Do you see what I'm saying?  And what I had today may be better than what I had this other day.  But I want to make sure I'm not shortchanging. That whatever, whatever is the best that I have on that particular day, I want to make sure that I leave all of that on, on, on the page.  And if I do that then, you know, then I can sleep well.

Speaker 1: Tell us something about your, your, your family.  You've got five kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've got a wife, I've got two stepkids, one of whom is nearing forty now.  And I've got the three kids that I had with Marilyn [Marilyn Pickens Pitts], who are thirty-one, twenty-eight, and twenty-three.  And I've got grandchildren. The stepkids have kids.  So, I've got kids through them, and then I've got my first biological granddaughter who is now four years old.  And that's Miss Lena Camille Pitts [Lena Pitts].  And she'll look at this someday and see her name, or hear her name online.  And I'll be, (gesture), "Thank you grandpa," that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: And your--now, did your father [Leonard Pitts, Sr.] get a chance to really see you--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) become successful as a writer?
Speaker 2: Dad didn't see any--dad didn't see any of that.  He didn't see any grandkids.  He didn't see any career start.  Again, he died in '75 [1975].  I'm the oldest, and--
Speaker 1: You were eighteen when you started--
Speaker 2: I was eighteen.
Speaker 1: --writing for--
Speaker 2: I was, I was writing for Soul magazine.  By that--you know, but dad, he was sick for two years.  And for the last months, I don't think he was aware of too much of anything that was going on.  I was writing--and the stuff I was doing for Soul magazine, I was basically a stringer.  It's not like I had a full time job or anything. I was going to school.  And then, you know, I'd go wherever and interview The O'Jays or The Temptations and then write up a piece for Soul.  So, I guess he did see that much of it.  But I don't know how much he even knew that was going on, to tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: You were the first person in your family to go to college, right?
Speaker 2: In my immediate family.  I had an uncle, my uncle Richard [Richard Pitts], who went to college--and you know, from that branch.  But in terms of my immediate nuclear family, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And your mother [Agnes Rowan Pitts], she got a chance to see you have some success, right?
Speaker 2: She did.  You know, not to the--not to the degree that, you know, things are going now with the Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize] and everything.  But she did see some success.  She saw me, you know, have some success as a freelance writer, and she saw the RadioScope years.  And she was there when--when I self-syndicated 'Who We Are.'  So, you know, that was a good moment as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your children, do they have a sense that you're nationally syndicated, and people read you all over the country?
Speaker 2: They're not particularly impressed. I was stopped by--stopped by somebody for an autograph when I was out with the two older kids many years ago.  And they looked at me like, "Why does he want your--why does he want your," (laughter) "why does he want your?"  And that's good.  You know, you don't want your kids to be looking at you like, (makes sound), you know. You want your kids to be looking at you like dad.  So, you know, I'm not really--you know, I really actually like that.  I don't like when, you know, when people treat me--particularly people who know me and people who are members of the family--treat me like some porcelain doll or treat me like, you know, somebody they have to treat in some sort of special way.  So, the fact that my kids don't, don't see anything special, except just dad, is, is, is great by me.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed that we need to raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I think you've been pretty exhaustive.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good writer, as a good person, and as a good dad and husband.  I think if you, if you do, if you do, you know, do all that and dot all those I's and cross those Ts I don't think you can ask for anything else.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you, sir.
