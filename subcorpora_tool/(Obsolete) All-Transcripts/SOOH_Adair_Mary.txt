 Little Thunder  Adair  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is December 8, 2011, and  I   m interviewing Mary Adair for the Oklahoma Native Artist Project  sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re at Mary   s home here in the country in  Stilwell. Mary, you   re a descendant of Cherokee Beloved Woman, Nancy  Ward, an early Native woman leader. You   ve divided your efforts  between art and education and community service. Thank you for taking  the time to talk with me.  You   re welcome. Just one little correction, this is Sequoyah County.  (Laughter)  Okay, thank you  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born just up the hill from here in my grandparents    home and grew  up here, and really wasn   t anywhere else very much until I went to  school at Bacone College. That was my first time to be away from home.  Then I went to Northeastern  State University  after that, and later  married and had four children.  Growing up, did you have any brothers and sisters?  I have one full brother, and I have a half sister that   s older than I am.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad was a disabled World War I veteran. He didn   t marry until he  was almost forty, married my mother. She was a widow. She had a little  daughter. She had come here from Tennessee and met my dad. I think  they only knew each other a couple of months when they got married.  My dad was sick a lot because he had been injured in the war. He died  when I was seven years old and my brother was two.  5  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  You were born in your grandparents    house. You were close to your  grandparents on your dad   s side of the family?  Well, they had passed away, so it was just my parents and my brother  and sister and I that lived there, but I had aunts and uncles that lived all  around where we lived. My aunt and uncle lived here at this house, and I  had two other aunts that lived just up the road from us, and an uncle. We  had a lot of family around, cousins, so that was really good.  A lot of important family history, even in terms of the whole tribe. What  kinds of stories did you hear growing up?  Oh, I heard a lot about Cherokee history. (Laughter) We had one aunt  that lived about a mile up the road from us. She came often. She didn   t  have any children. She had gone to the  Cherokee Female  Seminary at  Tahlequah, and Cherokee history was on her mind all the time. Other  family members   her name was Winona. After a while they   d say,     Let   s talk about something else.    (Laughter) She had been a school  teacher, and so had two of my other aunts. That was part of it, I guess.  What is your first memory of doing art?  I went to school here at Badger Grade School for several years before  my dad died, and we moved into town for awhile. I did some little basic  art projects that I enjoyed doing down here. I remember my aunt that  lived here kept one of my little drawings for a long time. It was just a  thing that first or second graders would draw, but she kept it and made  me feel good. I had a first cousin that taught art at the high school in  Sallisaw. She encouraged me a lot with drawing. In fact, all of my  cousins enjoyed drawing and were good at it. They didn   t do it  professionally, but they just liked to draw every once in a while. I was  influenced, I guess, a lot by them.  So you didn   t have any art experiences in primary or secondary school  that stood out strongly?  I had some really good art teachers. I mean, they encouraged me a lot.  The curriculum wasn   t much at that point, but they were very  encouraging, very nice ladies. One of them was Dorotheene Pointer, and  Elizabeth Black, and my cousin, Loris Dickey. They influenced my  decision to go into art. However, Loris, being an art teacher, told me that  she thought it might be a good idea to have a minor in elementary  education, too, (Laughter) or something else, so I did minor in  elementary education.  6  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Were you doing any Indian subject matter, as a child?  Just basically drawing anything that came to mind.  When did you see your first piece of Indian art?  I guess when I went to Bacone. Dr.  Dick  West was there at that time,  and I had classes there. That   s when he had us do research and talk to  people and that kind of thing, and then do drawings and paintings. That  was my introduction, I guess. My first piece that I entered in an art show  was when I was in school at TU. In 1967, I decided I was going to get a  master   s degree in art, so I went to school over there for a year and took  some art classes. Alexander Hogue was my painting teacher there. He  encouraged me to enter the Philbrook show with one of my paintings I   d  done in class. I entered and won an honor mention. Turned out, he was  one of the judges, (Laughter) but it was encouraging. Then the Five  Tribes Museum started having competitive shows, and I entered some  things there. I was motivated primarily by money because I had, by that  time, four children. I wasn   t working full time, so that added to our  income.  At Bacone, you were there one year?  No, I was there two years.  What kinds of things did you learn in terms of an art foundation? Were  they under Dick West, or did you have different teachers?  Dick West was my only painting teacher. I also had silversmithing under  him. Mrs. Spinks, Alice Spinks, taught me a lot of traditional things like  moccasin making and weaving and things like that.  From there, you went on to Northeastern? Is that right?  Northeastern, yes.  Were you taking art classes there?  Yes, I took painting and art history and silkscreen making. I think I took  a watercolor class.  Were you doing any Indian subject matter there?  Primarily, I was a young person, and I did whatever was required for the  classes. (Laughs) Let   s see. Ms. Allison, Ruth Allison, was a teacher  there, and George Calvert. I learned quite a bit from them. I learned a lot  7  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  of basic things from Ruth Allison. George Calvert taught the art history  and the painting classes.  When you were studying under Alexander Hogue, he was teaching  watercolor. Is that right?  Oil. Oil painting.  Is that when things gelled for you in terms of entering this piece at the  Philbrook Annual?  I guess I probably wouldn   t have entered if he hadn   t encouraged me to  enter. It was a piece I   d done in class.  What was the image?  Actually, it was a cubist kind of thing, but it was of a group of dancers  entering the arena. A lot of the colors were blue in it, as I remember. I  think that painting belongs to TU, I believe.  I think Jimmie Carol Fife was one of the first women to win at  Philbrook, wasn   t she?  You know, I don   t know. I know Jimmie Carol.  I   m just thinking there probably hadn   t been a lot of Indian women  painters entering. Were there a number of them entering, the year you  did?  In 1967, well, I don   t remember. I had never, maybe, gone to an art  show before. I remember going to that show.  What was that like? (Laughter)  Well, when you take four kids with you, you know    (Laughter)  Keeping them out of the pool out in the back was very     You also took watercolors at TU from Woody Crumbo?  Yes, I enjoyed that a lot. I never did think of myself as being a good  watercolorist, but I can appreciate good watercolor.  And, of course, you two had interests in common, in terms of subject  matter.  Yes.  8  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  What was one of the good things that you got from those lessons?  I think just seeing him as a Cherokee person who was teaching there at  TU, that was rewarding, and getting acquainted with him. I hadn   t  known him before.  When you graduated from NSU, you had your bachelor   s degree and  you could teach.  I went to teach in Tucson, Arizona, my first year out of school. My  roommate and I, who is also Cherokee, Jean Christie, we decided we  wanted to go somewhere. We   d never been out of the Cherokee Nation,  basically. (Laughter) Very few times. We applied to teach at Tucson,  and we were accepted, so we went out there. As it turned out, my  younger brother went with us. He was still in high school. I don   t  remember how that happened, but he went out there, and he went to high  school in Tucson and stayed out there with me and was out there for a  year. Then my to-be husband, he   d been in the army at that time. I   d met  him at Bacone, but he had quit school and gone into the army, and he   d  come back from Germany. He came out there, so we got married in  Tucson.  Were you teaching at a government school?  No, I was teaching at a public school. It was primarily Mexican  American children. I think I had a couple of children that weren   t, but  most of them were. It was in a neighborhood where a lot of Mexican  American people lived. Brand new school, it was real nice, had a  wonderful principal. She was a really nice person. Then we came back  to Pawnee. My husband was Pawnee. We stayed there for about six  months, and then we went to Dallas on one of those relocation projects.  That was really a new experience. (Laughs)  I bet. So you two hadn   t started doing arts and crafts shows, necessarily,  yet?  No.  Not in Arizona.  No.  What was it like, plunging into big-city life in Dallas?  Oh, I didn   t like it. The first night we were there, I guess it was the  9  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Bureau of Indian Affairs telling us what to do and everything. They told  us to go to this hotel to spend the night. That was the awfullest place  I   ve ever seen. (Laughs) Then they took us to this apartment unit place  where they were putting everyone, and we lived there for two years. Our  first son was born there, and our daughter, too.  Was there another Indian family there, or two?  Oh, yes. Indian and Mexican were in that. They had it segregated at that  time. There were black people in one area, and Mexicans and Indians in  another area, and then white people in another area. They were new  apartments. They were nice, but it wasn   t really an enjoyable experience.  Your husband looked for work?  He looked for work. There was a lot of prejudice. He had had two years  of college, but he found a job making boxes. I didn   t work at that time.  Our son was born, and then I did get a job working for the health  department down there, and was working there when our daughter was  born. Then I came back and got a job teaching at Oklahoma City first,  then transferred to Tinker Air Force Base. I worked there for about a  year and a half, then went to teach at Lawton at Fort Sill Indian School.  Finished out a year there, then we went to Bacone. He went back to  school, and I was working in the office there.  During this period, are you painting on the weekends a little bit?  No, I didn   t paint at all during that time. I sewed, made most of our  clothing and everything else, (Laughs) but I didn   t do any painting or  anything.  I understand your husband passed away when your kids were fairly  young?  We were living in Muskogee.  So then you had to really focus on earning a living.  Actually, when my youngest son was born was a really hard time for us  financially. My husband was in the hospital at that time, and I wasn   t  working. I had worked before he was born. I started working at the  Murrow Indian Children   s Home, first as a tutor, then as a secretary, and  then as an assistant to the superintendent. When she left, they asked me  if I would take her place, so I did that for four years. I was there a total  of ten years.  10  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  You were aware that Nettie Wheeler was dealing art there     Yes, yes.     but you just didn   t have time to explore selling with her?  I didn   t do very much. About the only thing I did was some entries for  the Five Tribes Museum. I might   ve done some more entries for  Philbrook. I can   t remember for sure at this time.  It   s so interesting because here you are, an artist, and you   re working at  Murrow, and I don   t know if you were the one who brought Joan Brown  in. Did you bring     We had gotten acquainted somewhere, I think through a mutual  acquaintance or something, and she was looking for a job. She had  several children, so she came to work there as a secretary when I became  director of the children   s home.  She told me that you said,    Joan, you can still do your artwork while  you   re here.    (Laughter)  Well, I don   t know about that, but at night, we worked at night. I  remember I would paint nearly all night some nights, getting something  ready for a show.  I was wondering how you squeezed that in. I know she tried to do a lot of  art things with the children. Did you help with that, too?  Well, as she was there for a while, she came to work more with the  children, and we had another person that did secretarial work. We also  had a person that did some counseling with the children, too. She kind of  worked into a different position.  You were occasionally painting all night. Did you show with the  galleries at all during that time?  Not very much. When I got involved with the Daughters of the Earth  group     Which was in the mid-   80s? Is that about right?  I believe so. We showed with galleries in different states. I think the first  show we had was in Oklahoma City at a gallery.  Was it Doris Littrell   s gallery?  11  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Yes. I think so. I think we each were asked to have five or six paintings.  When you were in Muskogee, did you know the Tiger family?  I was acquainted with them. I didn   t know them really well. Peggy, at  that time, (this was after Jerome had passed away) she had some foster  children or some other children that lived with them. I think one of the  boys was acquainted with my children or something. Anyway, I  remember taking him home one time and going out by their house, and  seeing them at art shows, the children. I always tried to encourage them  to do their artwork. They always seemed to be glad to see me when I   d  see them, but I didn   t know them well. I don   t know Peggy really well at  all.  It must have been hard, having to work all these jobs and having to  squeeze your art in, in your spare time. I know that   s one thing that  brought together the Daughters of the Earth group.  I think most of us were doing pretty much the same thing. (Laughs)  Right. Do you remember how it started?  I believe Virginia Stroud was the one that got the idea for the group. She  was acquainted with all of the artists that were involved. Some of the  artists that were with the Daughters of the Earth group, I had known  before. Others I got acquainted with by being involved in that group. We  had a lot of fun, going out of state. Sometimes we went together as a  group, and sometimes we just would meet at a gallery somewhere,  wherever we were having a show.  And there weren   t nearly as many women painters during that period.  How did the public react to your work?  I guess it was pretty well received. Sales were good. The first show, I  sold everything I had, so that was encouraging. That was in Oklahoma  City. I don   t remember exactly the order of the shows, but we had one in  Atlanta and one in Colorado. Let   s see. Minneapolis, I believe, and  Nebraska at Omaha.  Did you find it fed your creativity? I guess you were painting in between,  and you had these shows going.  Oh, yes. We had a show once a month. We had to have five or six pieces  done to take. It kept us busy, and it was interesting. Going to the shows,  I think the group of us went together, either to Minneapolis or to Omaha.  12  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Might have been Omaha. We drove together there. Then my daughter  and I drove down to Atlanta together to that show. That was a nice trip  for my daughter and me to be together.  Did you get to go to any of the Cherokee homelands down there or  historic places?  Yes, we did. On our way back from Atlanta, (I believe it was on our way  back) we stopped at Adairsville. I had always heard about it and wanted  to see where my Adair family had come from. That was really exciting  because there was a Mrs. Adair that lived there. We stopped and asked if  there was anyone named Adair, and they said,    Well, yes. That old  house over there, there   s a lady, Mrs. Adair.    So we went over there.  She was sitting on the porch. She invited us in and showed us old  pictures. Her husband had died, but she said,    I   m sure he was related to  you.    That was really exciting.  Then we went out to look at another old house out there. A couple of  men drove up in a pickup, and they asked if we were interested in the  house. We said,    Well, it   s just an old house, and we were curious about  it, wondering if it dated back to the days of the Cherokee.    The man said  he owned the house but he didn   t know. He said,    My wife is Cherokee,  and she hasn   t been feeling well lately. Would you just go up to the  house and visit with her?    (Laughs) So we went up to the house and  visited with his wife and told her we were Cherokees from Oklahoma.  She was really glad to see us. She had been raised in Georgia, but she  identified as being Cherokee. It was an interesting experience.  We saw an old house right in Adairsville that I was just drawn to. It was  an old two-story house at the edge of town, the old Adairsville site. I  think the people that were living there were renters. They told us the  man that was in town  who  was the owner of the house might know  something about the history of it. We went to see him, and he was  curious about us and asked if we wanted to buy the house. We said no,  we didn   t want to buy the house. (Laughter) As it turned out, I found out  later, it had belonged to one of our Adair family that had built it back  before the Removal, but I didn   t find that out until years later. That was  an interesting experience.  How had your style and your palette evolved from that first oil that you  submitted at  Philbrook , which was sort of cubist, I think you said, to  these Daughter of the Earth Shows? How was it different? How were  you finding your     I think I experimented with a lot of different things and different styles  and so forth, depending on the media.  13  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Were you still painting in oils, or had you moved away from that?  I painted in oils some, but I kind of moved away for a while and worked  in gouache for some of the show entries. I went into painting in acrylic  later. Mr. Hogue was not familiar with acrylic. At the time, it was new,  and he was kind of suspicious of it. Everything we did in his painting  class was done in oil. Later on, I did some work in acrylic on canvas.  Then I did some work in fabric stitching and that kind of thing, too.  Women, both as a subject of traditional stories like Selu and also as  historical figures, have been an important vein in your work. How do  you approach that differently, perhaps, than a male artist might?  Well, I think male artists are primarily interested in male subject matter.  (Laughter) I think it   s because that   s closer to them. Of course, women  being women have an interest in what women and children are doing, so  a lot of my work has featured women and children doing things.  The style is so interesting because there   s a few elements of that flat  style. Sometimes you   ll do the outlining, or you   ll have some negative  space, in some of the pieces I   ve seen, but then you have these more  realistic elements and also some fanciful elements.  The flat style, I started doing that when I had classes with Dr. West. I  don   t know if he encouraged it, but that was the style that he primarily  did. So a lot of the work that we did in painting class, we did in that  style. He encouraged us to learn as much as we could about our own  tribes and to do work that reflected things from our own traditions and  background.  Your art is on several book covers. Did the author commission you to do  these illustrations, or did they see your work and decide that would look  nice on the book cover?  I think the first book that I did was the Selu book by Marilou Awiakta.  She was a friend of Wilma Mankiller   s, and I kind of think Wilma  suggested me to her. She called me and asked me if I would illustrate the  book for her, and we worked closely together. She made suggestions  about the illustrations. The illustrations were ink drawings, and the cover  piece was in color. We worked with Fulcrum Publishing Company on  that. I enjoyed doing that. It was good to get acquainted with her. I loved  her book and the things that she wrote in it. I feel that that was a real  pleasurable experience and an honor to have been asked to do that.  Later, Fulcrum called me and asked if I would like to do another piece,  14  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  and I told them that I would. They had a book by Joseph Bruchac. He  and another author did a book together, and they asked me if I would do  that. It   s interesting that I can   t remember the other author   s name. He  was the one that I mainly had contact with, and yet I can   t think of his  name right now.  Michael J. Caduto  It will come to me in a few  minutes. (Laughter)  Have you done a lot of commission work over the years?  Not a lot. I kind of prefer not to because it   s hard to do what   s in  someone else   s mind and vision. You feel like you might not please  them with what you   re doing, so I   ve kind of shied away from that.  Did you notice any changes in the gallery landscape from the    80s to the     90s?  Actually, I haven   t worked a whole lot with the galleries. I   ve primarily  worked with entering my work in shows. I   ve worked with the  Oklahoma City gallery some and the gallery in Tulsa a little bit but not  very much. Most of the time, I   ve had a full-time day job. I just didn   t  really have the time for the output that a gallery requires.  Your most important shows were Five Tribes, Philbrook, Trail of  Tears     Philbrook, Trail of Tears, the  Cherokee National  Heritage Center  shows.  What was one of the more important awards or honors you won for your  art?  I won some Heritage awards, and I felt like that was a special honor.  Can you explain about the Heritage award?  It   s kind of a recognition that your work speaks for your culture and  your background. I felt those were the ones I maybe most appreciated.  Can you tell us a little bit about one of the paintings that you did that  won the Heritage award?  (Laughs) I can   t remember.  Was it a historical subject?  I   m sure it probably was. (Laughter) I painted from 1967 until     15  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  actually, the last two or three years I haven   t painted very much, but  there was a long period that I did do work, and I don   t remember a lot of  it.  Yes, a lot of paintings go out, and it   s hard to keep up. Are you a Master  Artist of the Five Civilized Tribes?  No, I   m not. Actually, I haven   t entered that show in a long time. After I  started working for the Cherokee Nation, I mainly concentrated on  entering the shows here. I was busy with other things, and I didn   t enter  over there.  The show at the Annual? Is that what you were saying?  The Annual, and the Trail of Tears.  You   ve become a family of artists now. Your son Daniel is a pretty well-known  painter and sculptor, and your granddaughter has won a couple  of awards in art. Or is it your daughter?  My daughter and our oldest son.  Also my granddaughters Paige and  Sami.   What   s it like to see that family tradition of art being carried on?  Well, it   s kind of discouraging. (Laughs) You know, with parents, what  you should tell your children is the opposite of what you want them to  do. They always enjoyed painting from an early age and doing artwork,  drawing. My daughter, we always called her Sis. She went to school  sometimes at TU with me and she did a little pottery in pottery class and  things like that, and she enjoyed it. I told them, I said,    It   s not  something that   s easy to make a living in. When you go to college, look  into other things that you   d like to do.    Well, three of them majored in  art. (Laughter) I was disappointed in that. I was glad they went to  school, went to college, but they haven   t worked in art except for Daniel.  He has worked full-time in art.  I   m proud of my kids, and I   m proud of the things that they do that  aren   t art-related, as well as their artwork. I have some of Sam   s work  over here that I   ve been matting for him. For a long time, he didn   t have  time to do any work, and lately he   s been painting again and doing some  ink drawings. He   s enjoying that. He has a degree in art from Central  State University. He went to Haskell  Indian Nations University  first.  Mary has a degree in art from Northeastern. She went to OU and Bacone  first and then to Northeastern. Dan went to Bacone and the Institute in  Santa Fe and then to Northeastern. I   m very proud of the artwork that  16  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  they do, but it is a hard way to make a living full-time.  Former Chief Chad Smith referred to you as one of a key group of  people who helped preserve Cherokee culture through their art.  I was a member of the Cherokee Artists Association, helped get it re-established.  When was that?  It   s been three or four years ago that Chief Smith encouraged a group of  Cherokee artists to get together. They had had a group that had been  together for a while, several years ago, then it had fallen by the wayside.  Bill Glass was instrumental in that first group and also in the second  group, so we got involved with that. Really got some encouraging things  done for the artists, I think, with the help of the Council. I kind of  dropped out of it because I   m getting older and I felt like some of the  younger artists should be involved more. I   m not actively involved with  that group now.  Has your primary medium been acrylic the last ten years or so?  I think probably so. Most of what I   ve done in the last ten years has been  for the Cherokee Nation. The Council set aside one percent of building  costs to purchase artwork. They purchased artwork for the new buildings  that were being built. The clinics, the casinos, and so forth. Mainly, my  daughter has encouraged me to do things for those activities. She and I  worked together, and Dan and she and I worked together on some  things, too, collaborated. That was fun to do.  What are some buildings or casinos that you   ve got artwork in?  Just about all of them, I think. (Laughs) The one at Muskogee, my  daughter and I did two large   I think they   re seven-foot-long pieces on  canvas. She did two, and I did two. We worked together on a couple of  them, I think. Maybe she did one by herself, and we collaborated on the  others.  We also did one for the casino at Catoosa that I did some  beadwork in the painting.   So would that involve one of you doing the research and the conceptual  part, and the other one painting?  Both. We both painted on them, and we both     That must be fun.  17  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  It was fun.  You sign your paintings in Cherokee and English. I know the placement  of the signature, as well as the size, is sometimes a hard call to make.  Did you have to experiment a little bit to find your signature, or did you  come up with that pretty quickly?  Well, actually, when I first started painting, I signed my name    Mary  Adair HorseChief.    My husband was still living at that time. I signed my  name that way until my daughter started painting. She came to work for  the Cherokee Nation. I was working there, also, and there was some  confusion. Sometimes our mail would get misdirected to her or to me, so  later on I dropped the HorseChief and went back to my maiden name. I  think probably about that time I started adding in the Cherokee  syllabary, Mary, with my name.  What role does story play in your work, or narrative?  I don   t know. It   s hard to say. I guess it depends on what I   m working  on.  Because you sometimes do decorative pieces.  Yes. Sometimes decorative pieces, but some of the historical pieces,  narrative enters into that. I enjoy doing the historical pieces where you  do research and that kind of thing. I guess Aunt Nona had an effect  because I   ve always enjoyed learning about Cherokee history. In fact, I  was instrumental in helping some relatives get together, and we did a  family history book. I did a lot of research, genealogy, and that kind of  thing for that, just learning about people in Cherokee history and the  things that they were doing.  I   ve enjoyed going to archives in different states, in South Carolina,  North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Chicago, different places I happen  to have an opportunity to go, even Ireland. My brother and sister-in-law  took me with them to Ireland a few years ago, and so we went to Adare,  Ireland, and we spent a week driving around in Ireland, going to places  there. I have some Starr ancestry, and so we went to Cootehill and some   other  places where the Starr family had come from. That was a lot of  fun.  How important are titles in your work?  Well, sometimes they   re important. I like to try to give a title that will  somehow tell something about the work and relate to the work in some  way. I   ve encouraged, mainly, my son, because he   s been with me more,  18  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  to research and to work on narratives, to tell about his work, the titles. I  think he   s enjoyed doing a lot of that, too.  To have a little explanation that goes with the   did you pretty much do  that throughout your career, try to give a written explanation?  Quite a bit, depending on what it was.  And you cut mats, I guess. You cut mats for your own work and for your  son. Do you have one of the nicer, newer mat cutters?  I cut mats, yes. I have a mat cutter. (Laughter) When I was teaching art  at Sequoyah High School, I taught there for fifteen years before I retired.  When I first started teaching there, they asked me to teach six different  art classes a day. I had a basic drawing class, and I had a painting class,  and a traditional crafts class, a general crafts class, and an art history  class. Actually, I had two basic drawing classes for beginning artists. In  the state of Oklahoma, and I   m sure in a lot of other states with the  funding cuts, there   s not too much art taught in the elementary and even  in the junior highs in a lot of places. In Tahlequah, they had a good  junior high art program there. Mike Daniel was the art teacher there.  Dorothy Sullivan taught at the high school there when I was there. I  enjoyed having those classes where students could advance from one  class to another.  Then the state of Oklahoma started requiring that every student have an  art class. I thought,    Oh, boy, they   ll hire another art teacher, and we   ll  have all kinds of classes.    They told us,    Be prepared to teach more art  classes.    As it turned out, every student had to have art appreciation.  They cut all my painting, and we didn   t hire another art teacher, the  painting, the advanced art classes. I did keep the Native crafts class, and  the rest of it was the art appreciation.  Before that time, when I had the painting class and the art history class,  in the painting class we learned about Native artists, learned about their  lives, where they went to school, all those things, and we learned to  paint, entered shows, won awards. In the traditional crafts class, they  entered shows and won awards for their work in beadwork and basketry  and pottery. It got boring for me teaching just one class most of the time.  It was a little easier in one way: I only had to prepare for  one . (Laughs)  And at the same time, I can see how that   s very stimulating, both as a  teacher and as an artist.  I learned from my students.  19  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Did it enrich your own art?  It really did. That   s when I learned to cut mats and things. I ordered a  mat cutter. We learned to cut mats because to enter shows they needed  to be matted. We had a mat cutter and a shrink wrapper and a lot of  things that we were able to get. We were supported that way, which was  wonderful.  What   s your creative process from the time you get an idea? How does it  work?  I try to find out as much as I can, if it   s a historical piece, because I want  to be accurate in what I put out. I don   t know that I always have been,  but I   ve tried. I do research, and then I start doing sketches. Going back  to my early training, I do the sketch on tissue paper first and then  transfer it to whatever media I   m going to work on, with carbon or  something like that. Then I start painting.  Do you carry ideas around in your head, or do you write them down  sometimes?  I used to. (Laughs) The past few years, except for the pieces I work on  with my daughter   there   s some pieces up at the casino at Catoosa and  some other places around. There used to be some at the clinic here in  Sallisaw, and I don   t know what happened to them. They   re not there  anymore. I used to do a lot of preparation. In recent years, I   ve made  moccasins for Miss Cherokee. I did that for several years. I quit doing  that two years ago. I   ve made two pair for Miss Cherokee. I   ve made a  few tear dresses for people, mainly family or friends, and shawls and  things like that. Grandchildren, they always have to have things, you  know, (Laughter) and children, my daughters-in-law, my daughter. I  enjoy doing that. I   ve enjoyed making dolls and dressing dolls through  the years, so that   s one of the things that I   ve done. To me, sewing is  relaxing. Even if I   m ripping it out, it   s still relaxing. (Laughter)  Looking back on your career, what do you think was a kind of fork-in-the-  road moment when you could   ve gone one way and you decided to  head down another path?  I guess when I had my children. I was interested in art because I   d gone  back to school to continue my education in art. Actually, I   d thought  about the possibility of teaching at the college level. I thought,    Well,  I   ll go ahead and get my master   s,    but then my two younger sons were  born, and at that point I had opportunity to work at the children   s home  which was there in Muskogee. It was really rewarding working with the   people  there. Then the Cherokee Nation started expanding after I was  20  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  there for several years at the children   s home, and I got interested in  working for the Cherokee Nation. I   d been there for ten years and  thought it would be good to do something different.  I started to work for the Cherokee Nation, first at the job corps center,  and worked with students who were going into college. At that point, my  children were getting older. They were needing more things. My  husband had passed away, and so I   d pretty well given up on doing  anything with art at that point. I was just taking care of my children.  I  also earned a master   s degree from NSU in education while working at  job corps, and later worked in the Cherokee Nation Health Department  before going to work at Sequoyah . When the opening for an art teacher  came up at Sequoyah, that   s the first time I really had an opportunity to  apply for a teaching job in art. I applied and was accepted, and I really  enjoyed teaching art there.  It kind of spurred a resurgence of your own work.  Of my own creativity. Actually, though, I was so busy I didn   t really do  much. I   d illustrated some books, and I did a really large painting for a  university in North Carolina. They were wanting a piece similar to the  one that I   d done for the cover of the Selu book. I did that piece while I  was teaching, but I didn   t do a lot of work while I was teaching art.  It was so rewarding to see the students win awards. I had one girl, she  learned to do beadwork. She   d had some problems. She was kind of  down on herself, I think, at that point. She entered the show at the Heard  Museum in Arizona and won an award on her beaded barrette. Sold it.  Every once in a while, I   ll run into her. She married a Seminole from  Florida, eventually, but once in a while she comes back, and I see her.  She said she   s still doing her beadwork.  Then I had a student that won a national award. He had his work put on  a calendar. Actually, he was an exceptional ed student, so the  exceptional ed teacher and I and he went to Santa Fe for a show. Then  we went to Washington, DC. He had a little reception where he signed  his calendars there, and we met a lot of important people in Washington.  I ran into him at the casino show where Dan, my son, had an exhibit not  long ago. Robert came up to meet me. I hadn   t seen him in a long time.  Now he   s married, has children, and that kind of thing. He said he  finally got the painting back. (Laughter)  The calendar cover?  It was on the calendar cover. I thought that was neat. That was still a  high point of both of our lives, really.  21  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  You also had an image in the calendar, or you were just overseeing his  creating of this?  No, this was student work. His work was accepted for the cover, so it  was a special thing.  Very special. What do you think has been one of the low points in your  career?  You mean my art career? I don   t know that I   ve had any low points. I  can   t think of any. It   s all been rewarding, I think. Of course, the high  points were always when I would win an award or make a sale.  (Laughter)  Is there one of those moments that stands out?  No, not anything in particular. I guess probably the first one was  memorable.  At the Annual?  Yes, at Philbrook, because that was the first award I   d ever won, and I  never thought of winning an award.  Did it have a little bit of prize money with it?  Probably so. I don   t remember that. (Laughs)  Were you nervous, going up to     Oh, I   m sure I was. (Laughs)  Is there anything we forgot to talk about, or anything you   d like to add  before we look at your work?  Well, I also did some work in textiles, modern dress textiles. I entered a  show at Santa Fe and won an award, modeled it. (Laughs) Won an  award on that. It was a two-piece dress with appliqu   work on it, and it  was Cherokee subject matter in the appliqu  s.  What year was this?  I don   t remember. It   s been a number of years ago.  In the   90s, maybe?  22  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  Little Thunder  Adair  I think probably before that.  At Santa Fe Indian Market?  Yes. I wasn   t able to go to the Market when I was teaching. I started  teaching at Sequoyah in 1988, so it would have been before that time.  Had you exhibited paintings at the Market, too, prior to that?  Well, that year.  Oh, just that year, so you had both clothing and entered a painting.  I think that was the only year that I actually exhibited work out there.  Let   s take a look at some of your paintings. Can you talk about this  painting a little?  This is a painting I did for the cover of the book Selu: Seeking the Corn-  Mother   s Wisdom by Marilou Awiakta. This depicts Selu, the Corn  Mother. The two children down below are representing the Cherokee  Nation, and in the background you   ll see some things that were  referenced in the book about the atomic power plant. There   s some other  things that represent today   s people. The basket of corn is the gift of  Selu.  That   s really nice. How about this piece?  This was one of the illustrations for the inside of the Selu book. All the  illustrations in that book were in black and white, pen and ink. This is  another example of Selu with the gift of corn.  Yes, it   s got some really nice lines. How about this particular piece?  This piece is one of three that I did in fabric. I sort of had my uncle in  mind when I did this piece, and my little son, showing the geese going  north, and  them  walking along.  That   s so nice. It really translates as a landscape.  There was a lady that bought one of the pieces, sight unseen. She found  out I was doing those fabric pieces, and she did quilting. She liked  quilting. I had it in that gallery in Oklahoma City. She just bought it and  hadn   t seen it at all.  23  Little Thunder  Adair  That   s wonderful. Thank you so much for your time today, Mary.  Well, I enjoyed it, and I   m glad to have met you.  -------  -------
