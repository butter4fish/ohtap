And it was real hot, Denise [Denise Gines]. It was so hot. I was gone wait until it got cool. So when my father came in for supper, we always had supper together, every evening around six, between six and six thirty. My mother started.

She loved both of us and she did everything she could for us, which she did.
Speaker 1: Did they take you to church much?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. I was raised in church, raised in church. I used to, I tell people this story all the time that we'd go to Sunday school and church and go back to BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union of America].

Speaker 2: My first memory of my childhood, my sister [Susie Blair Cullors] started to school and I wasn't but five years old, my sister was six. She's fourteen months older than me. And I wanted to go to school so bad so my mother [Cora Ross Blair] some kind of way she got me in school, and she told me, she say, "Now you stay in school 'til mama come and get you." She was on the way to get me from school, I was in the kindergarten. I was on my way home when she met me coming from school. She never had to come and get me no more.

It's one thing that my mother [Cora Ross Blair] would say today if she was living, she'd tell you, say, "Brother never fooled with bad people." I never did. I always went around with the best of people and the best children. I had one boy named Charles Brown [ph.] who died out in California three years ago, was like a brother to me, and that's where I spent all my time. At the YMCA, and at home and at school.

Speaker 1: So how were holidays, Christmas and Easter (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was really Christmas. We looked forward to that. I was eleven years old before I found out it wasn't no Santa Claus. I saw my bicycle in my auntie's closet and I still didn't want to recognize it 'til I got it out that Christmas Day. Christmas have never been the same with me since.
Speaker 1: What about any other special holidays. Did y'all have Easter pageants?
Speaker 2: Had Easter pageants, was in Easter plays every year. 19th of June in Texas was a great day. They don't celebrate it now. I don't know why, but every Negro in the country should celebrate the 19th of June, because that was the day they freed the slaves. And that's called (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well that was called Juneteenth. Is that right?
Speaker 2: Called the Juneteenth, yeah. They don't, they don't celebrate it too much, and that what's bother (unclear) for me, but I think the world of it 'cause it set us all free.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it, tell me about--
Speaker 2: Well they used to have a, have a what you call a (unclear) reunions in the community, family reunions. They had plenty food, ballgames, everything on the 19th of June because it's a day of celebration. That's what it was.
Speaker 1: So, tell me a little history about Juneteenth.
Speaker 2: Well, Juneteenth, a man named Colonel Granger [Gordon Granger] came, landed at Galveston [Texas] on the 19th of June in 18- [1865], I can't get the year together now, but that's when it started. That's what started it because you know it was six months later getting here. Slaves was freed around January or February, but it didn't get to Texas 'til June, so that's the reason they celebrate the Juneteenth. Never shall forget I was in the [U.S.] Army up in North Carolina, up at Fort Bragg [North Carolina] and the 19th of June came. I thought they celebrate the 19th of June all over the South. I got up that morning, I was prepared to participate in something other than being a soldier that day. People never heard of that, no more than the most of us that come from Texas that was from the South down that way and knew about it--

Speaker 1: And they cared about you.
Speaker 2: They cared about you.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me, let me get into that. I was in a class with children, boy named Hershel White [ph.], W.S. Witherspoon [ph.] was a head of anthropology department at SMU [Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas]. All of these children was what they called when I was going to school, if you made eighty or above or something like that, they called that the (unclear) club. Well all the children in my class was (unclear). All, most of them, I don't say all of 'em. I was an 80s [percent] student. I've always had a good mind, could learn fast if I wanted to. I could learn anything if I wanted to learn, but they made sure that you learned when I went to school, because I never shall forget I had a lady named Miss Virgil Vision Sheppard who was my Latin teacher [at Booker T. Washington High School; Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Dallas, Texas]. I went to the back of the classroom because I didn't like Latin. I said I'm not gone play dumb in here. So one day I came in the class and I was sitting in the back of the room. She came up to me, she said, "William Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.]." I said, "Yes ma'am?" She said, "Get your books and come up here." I knew I wasn't doing anything, so I, I went on up there and sat down side the desk where she, desk, seat she had pointed me to. She said, "I went over to the office and got your transcript from that elementary school where you went." Said, "You made better marks than all them children in here, and you gone make 'em in here. Every day you come in this classroom," she said, "you gone start the recitation." I got that Latin too. And I remember her, she dead and gone, but I always thing of Miss Sheppard every day 'cause she made me learn. She made me study.
Speaker 1: So you were a pretty good student then?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And it sounds like you were, were you well-mannered also, huh?
Speaker 2: Had to be because Cora [Cora Ross Blair] didn't play. My mama didn't play.
Story_ID: 375873
Speaker 1: So what kind of mischief did you get into?
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Tell me about some of them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh well. I never shall forget I took a nickel off the dresser drawer. It wasn't nobody home but my sister [Susie Blair Cullors], my mother [Cora Ross Blair] and myself. I took that nickel and I lied, oh, I lied. Denise [Denise Gines] I lied about that nickel. So I finally had to admit that I got the nickel. My mother said, "I'm not gone whop you about that nickel," but listen, let me tell you what she did to me. What she did to me that day stopped me if I ever in my life thought about taking anything, I never would do it no mo. Everybody, like you would come over to my house? When we come places, before we start to playing, she said, "Denise, ask Brother what he done?" "I stole a nickel." That went on forever. That went on for about two or three weeks. I said if I ever get over this, I'll never do this no more.
Story_ID: 375874
Speaker 1: Now you said that you didn't like Latin.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.
Speaker 1: What subjects did you really like?
Speaker 2: I liked any of 'em, but I didn't like that Latin. I could get any of it. I like history. I love history, geography and that kind of stuff, but I didn't', I didn't like that Latin, you know. I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: What did you like about geography?
Speaker 2: Well they just told you about the world, some place that you never been, you get a chance to see about it. History give you a chance to learn about a lot of stuff.
Story_ID: 375875
Speaker 1: What church did your family go to?
Speaker 2: We went, we went to Munger Avenue Baptist Church [Dallas, Texas]. It was on Munger Avenue at that time. I had a lady who was a, who was the pianist and a school teacher in the city named Miss Leola King. Her father [Abraham Lincoln King] was the proud pastor of that church. She'd come and get us every Sunday morning and take us to church. Miss Leola King is the first lady in the history of this country, people don't tell you this what I'm fina tell you. She the first one to put uniforms on girls in pep squads in--that's a fact, that's a fact. At Booker Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School; Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Dallas, Texas] when she went there. And was a disciplinarian. Like you see the Texas bells [ph.] and all of that? They got all that from Miss King. Miss King did all this stuff. History was, that's why I'm glad to see you doing what you doing because it's a lot of things these people talk about people, black people started.
Story_ID: 375876
Speaker 1: Now you're in elementary school [Benjamin Franklin Darrell Elementary School; Barack Obama Male Leadership Academy, Dallas, Texas]. What are your dreams at that point?
Speaker 2: Nothing, just any, just, just getting by, but it's one thing I did the whole time I went to school. I see these children do it now and I don't understand it. Children going home without books. You couldn't go in Cora's [Cora Ross Blair] house without a book. You had to have a book. You had to bring your books home. I mean if you had seven books, you had to bring seven books home and take 'em back every day. You had to do that, and it was a ritual with me and my sister [Susie Blair Cullors] for us to take our books.
Speaker 1: So the young William Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.] was what? What would you say the young William Blair was?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was well-liked. All, all the old people in the community liked me 'cause I was well-mannered, because anybody could take care of you if you got out of line and I didn't do that. Didn't do that. But I started real early at eleven years old when I start throwing papers. I threw papers clean 'til I went to the [U.S.] Army. I threw papers twice a day and went to school because in the city at that particular time, they had what you call, we didn't have if you went to high school, they had two classes. They had a 8:00, from 8:00 to 12:20 if you was a junior or a senior. And from 12:20 to 5:00 if you was a freshman or sophomore. So I had chance to do that. I throw my papers in the morning and when I get out of school in the evening, I throw them in the evening. So I been fooling with papers all my life.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Did you ever think at that time that you would be a publisher of a newspaper?
Speaker 2: Never had a clue about it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what about, when did you even think about newspapers?
Speaker 2: I started to think about newspapers, you know when you riding you go all over, I was riding all over the country on the buses playing baseball, and you'd want to find out about what went on back home, different places, but you didn't have that. You didn't have it, so I, when I came back home in 1949, I started it then and, but I didn't have a clue about no newspaper, but I had sense enough to go to a lady that knew. A lady named Miss Jewel Price McKenzie. She gave me the insight and there was a white fellow named Mr. Riley [ph.] who has a print shop down on Howard [Avenue] now, if he still living, gave me, showed me everything to do about a newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's how I started in the newspaper business.

Speaker 1: Oh, I got you.
Speaker 2: And the others went from 8:00 to 12:20.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well tell me about your friends in high school? Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Oh, I had, I had some wonderful friends. The boys I played football with, Robert Quales [ph.], he's dead and gone, Ed Boyd [ph.], Ashton Reeves [ph.], and the best friends I ever had was a boy like a brother to me, the one I was telling you about just died out in California name was Charles Brown [ph.].

Everybody that was anybody that come to Dallas they came to the YMCA. I used to see those folks and I see the teachers and the things that taught me in school. I saw how they carried themselves and what they did. That's what inspired me to be what I am.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of them stayed there, some of them didn't. Some of them stayed at private homes or something, but they would come to the Y. It was a place for them to come there.
Speaker 1: So the Y held a lot of social and civic functions also?
Speaker 2: Wasn't no civic function there, but it was civic stuff for people that come to the city. Just like, I give you an example, like Benjamin O. Mays [sic. Benjamin Mays], who was the president of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]. They used to have what they call a Sunday forum at the YMCA. These the kind of people they get to come to speak. They didn't come, they didn't come in the town to bash folks, they came into town to tell people how to do better. Not like these people do now, you have to give them fifteen hundred dollars and ride 'em around in a limousine and they come in and tell you about what you're not doing, then they going back to the airport and leave. Those folks didn't do that. They, they came, Mordecai Johnson, president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.]. Those the kind of people that inspired folks to come on Sunday afternoon.

Speaker 2: On Sunday evening after I got big, you know, after I kind of hang out from churches a little bit I'd go play a bit. When I was fourteen years old, I was playing with grown men.

Speaker 1: So now you're in high school [Booker T. Washington High School; Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Dallas, Texas]. What are your aspirations now?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Didn't have no aspirations about nothing. You know if I see, just like my kids, I never sked 'em what they want to be because you never know. You, you want to be this one minute, you want be there for the next, but I always, I knew I had to school or I couldn't stay at 2103 North Washington [Avenue] without going to school. And so that's what I done. After I finished high school, I would put in a half of year down at Prairie View [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] and I didn't want to go back down there because it was in the country. It's like country to me, I never been in nothing, no atmosphere like that. So rather than go back down there, I volunteer for the [U.S.] Army which was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life. My mother [Cora Ross Blair] begged me not to do it and I went against her wishes and I got to the Army on a Saturday morning. I never shall forget it.
Story_ID: 375882
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit. You were talking about the neighborhood. So the neigh- tell me, describe the neighborhood that you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Right across the street from me lived a lots of Italian people. Right across the street, the Strainers [ph.], the (unclear), the Boscoes [ph.], Scotches [ph.]. All of those lived in the same neighborhood. Right next to door to me lived Mr. Erie Boomer [ph.] who owned the North Dallas Shoe Shop [ph.] was a fairly wealthy man. He came to this country from off the islands over there. Next door to him lived Mr. Richard Watson [ph.] who was graduate of Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] in Pennsylvania who spoke seven different language fluently, right next door to me lived Mr. Smith [ph.], the man I tell you that ran the show. Right next door to him, Miss Howard [ph.] lived there and right on the corner lived Miss Jackson [ph.]. Right between that was a grocery store and a (unclear) shop. Pop Smith [ph.] had a (unclear) shop in Lancer's Grocery Store [ph.], right next to that was Black and Clark Funeral Home [Dallas, Texas], which is over here on, over here on Illinois [Avenue] now. Next door to them was ole Lee Wright [ph.] of the Wright brothers. He worked for the post office. No, let me go back. Right next door was Mr. Larkin [ph.] who ran on the road, was a Pullman porter. Right next door to him was, was the Wrights and next door to them was Tom Farber [ph.] who had a business downtown, a barbecue business downtown, and right across the street lived Marilyn [ph.] and Louise Boyd [ph.]. And on the corner lived the principal. All the school teachers lived, it was a, it was a thriving, prosperous, well-respected neighborhood that I come up in.
Speaker 1: So it was a community of people who raised their children as a, a community.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And your neighbors looked out for you as a child.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Would tell your parents--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: It was a village raising the children.
Speaker 2: I hear 'em say that all the time, but they don't do that now, but they did it when I was coming along. You didn't act, you didn't act no show-out what they called it then, they called it showing out. You didn't show out down there because somebody would stop you, and they'd do something to you and go tell your mother and your mother would do it. The greatest sin that any kid could make during my time coming up was to say Denise [Denise Gines] was telling a story. I guess Miss Denise is lying then. You have to hush then 'cause she sure can't tell nobody, but these children now, people back their children up. They didn't do that when I was coming along, not at all.
Story_ID: 375883
Speaker 1: So, we were talking about your neighborhood and how it was really in the city and you said that you went down to college [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] and it was in the country.
Speaker 2: In the country-like, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you didn't like the country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was two miles off the highway. No I didn't like it. Never been in nothing like that in my life. You can't tell it now because they done built up around, but it was two miles off the highway and I just had never been in a setting like that so I, I wouldn't go back.
Speaker 1: What about when you visit your grandparents? Did they too live in the city?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother [Susie Walker Ross (ph.)] on my mother's [Cora Ross Blair] side lived in the city. She lived in Fort Worth [Texas], but my grandfather [Grant Blair] on my daddy's [William Blair, Sr.] side, he lived down in this little place called Powell, Texas, about fifty miles from here.
Speaker 1: Was that country too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's country.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So it was okay when you were a little kid, but you didn't wanna--
Speaker 2: No, I had a bad experience the first time I went there. I went there, I guess we got there that morning and was standing on the porch, my auntie name was Aunt Vaulty [ph.], I never shall forget it. A cat drug a snake up on the porch and that got it. They couldn't put me down, they couldn't put me down. I never did get down. I was scared.
Speaker 1: So you remembered that always?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So country wasn't for you.
Story_ID: 375884
Speaker 1: So what did you do, decide to do when you came back from that college [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] down in the country?
Speaker 2: Volunteered for the [U.S.] Army, the biggest mistake I ever made in my life. I told you, I was telling you about when I told my mother [Cora Ross Blair], she told me, "Brother," say, "go on back to school, if they have a war they gone get you anyhow." I had to go in there. I left Dallas [Texas] on a Friday night and arrived at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, about Saturday morning about six o'clock. I knew then I'd made a mistake.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, I had never slept on the ground in my life. I never, I ain't never stayed outdoors in my life. And the first place they give us, they throw some (unclear) on the ground for us to make a spot over there for what we needed to do.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: It's a wonderful experience for any person they should have. I don't know why in the world they stopped taking people in the Army or draft them in the Army, because the discipline that you get in the Army it'll carry you through the rest of your life. Now I never was a child that didn't mind because I was taught discipline, but it's a whole lot of these, a lot of boys coming along, they didn't have no discipline, and I never shall forget, I had a sergeant named Adonis Baldwin Bess [ph.]. He told me, say, "I'm a tell all of you right now," he was a sergeant of our company. He said, "I can't read and write, but I know every Army regulation that it is, and the first one that you gonna get is mine. When I blow that whistle, I want your foot to hit that floor." And that's what he did. And he kept that the whole thirteen weeks that we were there until I left and went to Camp Livingston, Louisiana. See when I went to Camp Livingston, Louisiana, I was the youngest first sergeant ever in the history of the Army, nineteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me more about the Army. It was segregated at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: It was segregated (laughter) that's what.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know but tell me some stories about--
Speaker 2: Well, on every camp that we went into, we was on the back side of everything. Everywhere we went, we was on the back side. The front side was for the, for the whites that they had, and the backs, like when we first went to Camp Livingston, Louisiana was, the camp was halfway complete down at Alexandria, Louisiana now, halfway completed. Where we stayed at, we walked in mud and everything else. We did because it was back over in the woods where we were. But we prevailed. We learned. We did things that we were supposed to do, and I guess that b- that being the trend of the times, people didn't pay too much attention to it, but we could do everything that they did.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think that because of your education, it helped you go further to be the first sergeant (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Education always help you to go further. You know, I had a company of, when I got to camp in Livingston, Louisiana, I had a company of 132 men, all of them, none, I don't think it was 3 or 4 that could read and write.
Speaker 1: How many?
Speaker 2: About 3 or 4 out of 132 could read and write.
Speaker 1: Was there any initiative to learn?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, they wanted to learn, they wanted to learn, and we started classes for 'em and they learned fast, but it's one thing that I always remember Denise [Denise Gines], about them, they couldn't read and write, but they could count money better than the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve System]. If they was supposed to get ten dollars, they know when ten dollars was there.
Speaker 1: So were most of the people young like you that were in the Army?
Speaker 2: No, I had some in twice, I had some in there thirty something years old, thirty-eight years old, yeah plenty of 'em.
Speaker 1: So tell me about somebody that might have influenced you while you were in the service.
Speaker 2: I had a captain named Hugh F. Buckner [ph.]. He was from Florida. He tried his level best to get me to go to OCS [Officer Candidate School] school because he knew I had leadership ability, but I didn't never like the Army. I never did like it from the day I got there but I wasn't gone go none against it because they had rules and regulations that you had to conform to and I did that, but I knew I wanted to get out. Took me five years to get out of it, but I got out of it.
Speaker 1: What year was this that you went into the Army?
Speaker 2: I went into the Army 16th day of August, 1940, got out the 30th day of September, 1945.
Speaker 1: So the war [World War II, WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in Europe during the war.
Speaker 1: Okay. What, where were you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to Europe in 1943, went from Casablanca [Morocco], Africa, from Casablanca, Africa to (unclear), nine hundred miles across the African dessert.
Speaker 1: Tell me what that was like.
Speaker 2: Riding in a forty by eight. You had to sleep in shifts it was so small, small box cars. But you see those kinds of things make a man out of you. Went from there to (unclear), Africa. From (unclear) Africa cross over, I can't thank of the name, Mediterranean Sea, into Sicily [Italy] and from Sicily all the way up to where they had the, one of the Olympics [2006 Winter Olympics] this year, up in Turana [sic. Turin, Italy]. I been all the way, I been all over Italy. I been all over it.
Speaker 1: How did you like the influences over there?
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was all right because I didn't do nothing but ride around in the Jeep and sightsee. I wasn't fighting in no war.
Speaker 1: Oh, you weren't?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. I didn't, I didn't do that and I didn't have, I was lucky enough I didn't have to participate in that. We were always following the fighters because of different things that my company did, we followed the fighters.
Speaker 1: What did your company do?
Speaker 2: Well, they clean up, get supplies up to where they were supposed to go.
Story_ID: 375885
Speaker 1: You came back and you came out of the service and then what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I came back out of the service, then I meandered around a little while but I, in the meantime when I was in the service, a man saw me play ball. His name was Taylor C.D. Hayes from Memphis, Tennessee. He asked me about would I like to play baseball? I didn't know nothing about it. I said, "Yeah," you know, he seen me play. I said, "Yeah, I'd like to play." So he took my address and my, everything and when I got back home I didn't think nothing about it. So that January, they sent me a letter for me to come down there and that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Where did he see you play ball?
Speaker 2: In the [U.S.] Army (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In the Army? So y'all had a league in the Army?
Speaker 2: No, didn't have no league, we just--
Speaker 1: I mean you know, a group, a team. I would say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, company teams and things like that.
Speaker 1: Company team. And y'all played each other?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Even while away out of the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during the war [World War II, WWII]. They had what they called recreational periods, that's what they called it, and we'd play, play different companies, different people. And you know, as time would allow. So I left, he sent me the letter so I found, I went down there and when I got down there, I often think of this and I tell people this all the time. People look at folks' size and they try to discern what they can be and what they can't do. So a fellow picked me up at the train station and was taking me back to the hotel. It was on a Sunday evening. So we riding along. So he said to me, "Sho nuff man," said, "your name William Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.]?" I said, "Yeah my name is Blair." I never seen him before and he never saw me before. So we rode up a little bit further and he stopped at the stop light, so he say, "Sho nuff man, are you, is your name really William Blair." I said, "Yeah my name is William," I say, "why you keep asking me that?" "Well you so small." I said, "Man they didn't ask for no size, they asked for a ball player." I said, "I can play with anybody down here." I say, "I tell you what you do," I say, "now you around them all the time, is that right?" I said, "I let you just sit, pick it out for yourself. Whenever you think that my, that I can play, you come back and tell me." That Thursday he came back to me, "Yeah, you can play with 'em." I said, "I knew that, I knew that."
Speaker 1: So when you got down there, tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, I started to playing.
Speaker 1: Who did you play for?
Speaker 2: Indianapolis Clowns.
Speaker 1: The Indianapolis Clowns? What position did you play?
Speaker 2: Pitcher, and a good one.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know that you talk about pitchers now and you pitched a whole game, right, sometimes.
Speaker 2: All the time. We had to do that all the time.
Speaker 1: They don't do that much.
Speaker 2: No, no, they got closers, set up men, all that kind of stuff. You was all of that yourself. You was all that in one when I was playing. Starter, set-up man, and closer. My manager used to say all the time, "You supposed to be strong in the ninth than you was in the first because you good and loose," and that's right.
Speaker 1: So, that started your career. Did you ever go back to school?
Speaker 2: No, no, I started, I had a family so I'd come home in the winter, stay home about two three months and then I'd be gone again.
Story_ID: 375886
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family. Where did you meet your wife [Mozelle Jordan Blair]?
Speaker 2: At high school [Booker T. Washington High School; Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, Dallas, Texas]. She was the queen of the school, two years in a row. She was a fine lady, sixty-four years we been married now, sixty-four.
Speaker 1: And how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: We had seven. Got six still living. I was telling you about my oldest boy [William Blair III] though, our oldest, our first born, he the one got drowned, him and his whole family. Other than that all the rest of 'em, that was the baby boy, the one just left here, Darryl [Darryl Blair], he's forty.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about your other?
Speaker 2: Michelle [Michelle Blair Gilstrap], Debra [Debra Blair Abron], Terri [Terri Blair Lynch], Terri she's got a big job with the health department in Houston [Texas]. I was down there last winter because they gave me an award down there. Debra, she runs my Hall of Fame [Elite News Religious Hall of Fame, Dallas, Texas] up here. And Michelle, she works with her mother.
Speaker 1: Okay. One thing we didn't talk about, I'd like to go back since we're talking about family right here, tell me about your, you just have one sister you said, right?
Speaker 2: One sister.

Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So you met your wife in high school and got married so when you went down to college [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] then and didn't like it, she went with you and came back?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, she stayed in high school. My wife, my wife is five years younger than me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so y'all got married after she got out of high school?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And then, so now you moved on and you're playing for the Clowns [Indianapolis Clowns], and you moved to where?
Speaker 2: To right here in Dallas [Texas]. I come back home.
Speaker 1: Ah, you came back here.
Speaker 2: No, no, I never did move, I ain't never moving.
Speaker 1: So you've always lived in Dallas?
Speaker 2: All my life.
Story_ID: 375887
Speaker 1: Tell me about your career with baseball.
Speaker 2: Well, I had a pretty good career for seven years in there. I played with some of the best, played against and with some of the best ball players.
Speaker 1: What was the year again that you started playing baseball, the year?
Speaker 2: Forty-six [1946], '46 [1946] to '51 [1951]. That's when the league folded in '51 [sic.]. That's what I was telling you before, it folded in '51 [1951], but I been all over this country, been all over this country. I was in a Class D league with [HistoryMaker] Charley Pride, you was talking about him. We was up at Wall Lake, Iowa, a town where Andy Williams, the singer, is from. That's where he's from. We was up there. Yeah, me, Charley Pride, I can't think of all them, (unclear), Pearson [Lennie Pearson], Foots Parker [Emery "Foots" Parker], most all them dead now.
Speaker 1: So tell me about some of the, tell me some stories about, I mean I know you have lots of stories about the league and traveling around. Tell me about your travels.
Speaker 2: Oh well, we ride, you know, ride, we had a bus. My team [Indianapolis Clowns] was the first team in the league to have a air conditioned bus.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had air condition bus, but prior to that you had to let the windows down and do the best you can. You hear ball players complain today about they, they are tired and they run down. What you think about black ball players? You play here tonight, you may not never come here no more. They know, they know where they gone play three months from now. We didn't. We know where we gone play, we gone play, we had our schedule two or three weeks in advance but we never was coming back to the same place. The only time we would come back to the same place is like when we go back to Indianapolis [Indiana], probably play there two or three Sundays a year, or two or three Sundays a month, but you'd be on the road the rest of the time, playing at places you never been before and won't never go again.
Speaker 1: Well why was that though?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't, didn't have no parks. You didn't have no parks so you had to use other folks' parks.
Speaker 1: Okay. So how many leagues were there?
Speaker 2: Negro Leagues?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Wasn't but two.
Speaker 1: Just two?
Speaker 2: That's all.
Speaker 1: I thought there were about six or something like that.
Speaker 2: No, no, wasn't no six.
Speaker 1: So what were the two leagues?
Speaker 2: One they called out east, Pittsburgh Steel, Pittsburgh Pir- Pittsburgh Gray of the Homestead Grays, the New York [New York], you remember the New York Black Yankees, Philadelphia Stars, the Newark Eagles and the Baltimore Elite Giants was in one segment. Over in another segment the Kansas City Monarchs, the Birmingham Black Barons, the Indianapolis Clowns, the Memphis Red Sox, I think one or two more, that was all.
Speaker 1: Okay. So were there different levels in the league?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have but one level. You was either gone play there or you had to go back home. They didn't have no place like they have farm systems and stuff now. Either you could play or you wasn't gone stay there. And all of 'em could play.
Speaker 1: Well, were some considered semi-pro, amateur, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. No, no, no. This was professional baseball. Wasn't no semi-pro or nothing then. You--when you play semi-pro or something like that, you went back home.
Story_ID: 375888
Speaker 1: Let's still talk about some of the people actually that played for you, or played with you, and we were talking about "Double Duty" Radcliffe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, [HistoryMaker] Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me something about him.
Speaker 2: Well, well the world didn't know nothing, Duty nothing when he died in August. He did everything. He was 103. I got a picture of me and him in there in Indiana somewhere in there now. Wonderful man, could tell you some great baseball, to start in baseball in 1920, stayed in it 'til he died.
Speaker 1: What about Buck O'Neil?
Speaker 2: Buck O'Neil? A wonderful man, he'll be here Friday. He's ninety-four years old, be ninety-five in November. Built, built a Negro museum [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum] up there.
Speaker 1: Up where?
Speaker 2: Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear), he's a wonderful man. He knows, know all about all the Negroes that participated in baseball from the '30s [1930s] on in. He knew 'em all. Wonderful history.
Speaker 1: Okay. What about Barney "Vacuum Cleaner" Robinson [sic. Brooks Robinson]? Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Barney "Vacuum Cleaner" Robinson. Don't know him? And we talked about [HistoryMaker] Charley Pride. Did you play with him or against him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we was on the same team.
Speaker 1: Which team was, which team?
Speaker 2: Wall Lake team of Wall Lake, Iowa. He'll tell you about it. I can't think of the name of the team was. He'll tell you about it. Charley Pride was a good pitcher. A good one.
Speaker 1: So you think he was, he's a better singer than a baseball player (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Unclear), without a doubt, you know that. I used to hear him, we'd be, we'd be up in, in Iowa, and he'd be singing and nobody paid no attention to him. He left there and next thing you know, he was singing and been making money ever since. He lives here in Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: You, we were talking about [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks off camera.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So tell me--
Speaker 2: Ah, I started Ernie. That's a known fact. If you standing right there now, he could refute that. I started him. Placed him where he started. I'm the one started Ernie Banks. Anybody can get on a wagon going downhill honey, but after he achieved fame, everybody in the world had something, I'm the one that started Ernie. If he standing here, mama, daddy, all of them was right there standing there now, they'd have to tell you that. Man, Buck O'Neil and Dizzy Dismukes who was the business manager, Kansas City Monarchs, came to my house. Said, "Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.]," said, "where is that boy?" He stay right down the street down there. So I took 'em down there. That was about, that was in April 1950, April, May, it's early because he fina finish high school. I took 'em down there and they, they talked to him and when he got ready to finish high school, he finished high school on a Friday night and left the next day. He haven't been here, lived in Dallas since. I used to take him as a kid, him, Finas Arbuck [ph.], Carl Williams, all of them, used to take him play round these boys all the time.
Story_ID: 375889
Speaker 1: Tell me some more stories. I mean, what do you want to tell me about the Negro League?
Speaker 2: Well, the Negro League should have been a viable league now, like I was telling you at first. You see any time you turn your, turn something over to other folks, people do what they want to with it. The Negro Leagues should be have been, should have been a good farm system for ball players. I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. They started Major League Baseball in 1976 [sic.], Negroes didn't get in it until 1947. Every major record that they had in there, it took them seventy-five years to achieve it. Negroes broke it in fifty. Every one of 'em. You name, they broke 'em. Like I was telling you, they never thought nobody never break Babe Ruth's record. It was four or five Negroes could hit that many home runs. If we had got a chance to plan. If Willie Mays had played in a park where, where, like some of these ball parks these 325 foot fences, he'd a hit a thousand home runs. Just that, and they wasn't looking for Willie Mays when they found him. They was looking for that big old boy name Alonzo Perry, a good friend of mine, boy name Alonzo Perry, but a man had sense enough to see, see what he looking at and tell 'em about it. That's how they got in. They wasn't looking for him. Whole lot of ball player. The greatest, the best ball player I played with though was an older man. He was forty-eight years old. Him and Satchel [Satchel Paige] 'em come along together. I know you heard 'em talk about Cool Papa Bell [James "Cool Papa" Bell]. He's, he's the best I ever seen. He could run, do everything, and a wonderful man. And the thing that sticks our more about me and more about Cool, I don't care where we were on Sunday, he was going to church before he come to the ball park. Did it religiously. Wonderful man. He died in 1991.
Speaker 1: What changes would you have made to the Negro League?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing they did, the first thing you needed to do with the Negro League is to control your own destiny. You see when people can come and take your folk from you for just a little bit of money, they should have money enough to keep 'em to do what they needed to do. Here's a ball player like [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks, you get twenty-five thousand dollars for him. Hall of Fame ball player, to give a little bit more money for, for Willie Mays. So a lot of ball players they got for nothing. And for what they got 'em for, they didn't, they didn't do nothing with 'em. They take people's word, I was reading in the paper this morning about Denzel Washington's son played football down at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]. They gone give him an opportunity play in the NFL [National Football League] now. Now you know good and well, he ain't never played in that type of competition. I said he ain't that kind of football player 'cause I don't, I never seen him, didn't know he had a son, but this is the kind of stuff that they do, they'll run and grab some Negro for name, but it's some boys that got ability, that they'll never give a chance. I know good and well he wasn't the best back over there. I know he wasn't 'cause I never heard of him. It's a whole lot of that. But that's what happened to us in a lot of ways. And then we do ourselves wrong, like I was telling you. It's so many great ball players I seen. I seen so many ball players, just like you hear 'em talk about Satchel, Satchel was a great pitcher, no doubt about it. Never heard him say about (unclear), did you? It wasn't no difference than Hilton and Satchel. One was promoted and the other wasn't. They didn't promote Hilton Smith. Ball players will tell you, "Well if you can get Satchel out of there, they get Hilton," say, "you might get some runs in there." I said man, "You ain't got none off Satchel, you ain't get none off of Hilton." That's the pitchers they had. They had pitchers over there like Connie Johnson who died a couple of years ago. Connie Johnson, Booker McDaniels, Shape Alexander [ph.], Jim LaMarque, Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith. These people pitched nine innings every day. (Unclear) these people got twenty-five ball players on their team. We didn't have but fifteen, and all of them could play different places, different places and if you got hurt, three or four could probably take your place and play that. That's the way they was. And they didn't have all this, like you hear 'em talking about people doing throwing (unclear), well that was known fact in the Negro League. You gone get throwed at just like you hit a home run in front of me, if I come up I knew I was gone have to lay down. They called it laying down. We could forget and the manager gone fine you. They want to fine the pitcher now hitting the ball, for throwing at 'em. They just, these people they take the game, they want to take it and make out of it what they want to. They never played it so what they want to do, they want to change it around. You can't do that.
Story_ID: 375890
Speaker 1: I think I read something about you talking about when they signed Jackie Robinson that, that really was the end of--
Speaker 2: Okay, that's the beginning of the end of Negro League. Just like I was telling you for you to put the money in the farm for Negro teams that they spent for these college boys and things like they did, they'd still have the league today. Trust me, Negros don't play baseball, there wasn't no money in it for 'em. Is a, I got a, there's two boys was here with me, one of, both of 'em dead now, one named Willie Cullerton [ph.] and the other named Martin Sorrell [ph.]. Now that's who they went to get when they, when they went to look at, when they found Jackie. He could play. Never heard of him. Died out in Palo Alto, California. Raised right there, north county with me. Willie Cullerton, better ball player and him. He couldn't, he retired, he worked on the parks here in the city. He's the kind of thing, he's the kind of opportunity that these people missed by not having the right type of promotion. I'm not talking promotion, I'm talking people that could play. If you got the abilities, you 'supposed to use it. Well, they never used it.
Speaker 1: They just didn't use it. Now the Negro League, brought together the community because they played as a community and the cost of a ticket was something, I mean it was entertainment for black people--
Speaker 2: Dollar and a half.
Speaker 1: --when they would come.
Speaker 2: Dollar and a half.
Speaker 1: Do you see that once Robinson was signed, also the cost became a factor where people, where black people could not afford to go to the baseball game?
Speaker 2: Oh, it done did that in everything. They priced us out of everything. You got 75 percent of the Negro playing in the NFL [National Football League] and you can't buy a ticket to a football game. Corporation got 'em. That's what happened to us. All these kind of things what happened to us. But, we prevail over that. 65 percent of the basketball players in the NBA [National Basketball Association], black. Look out on the floor at night when you see 'em play. You can't tell me we not supposed to have one team or team of that in that league. See affirmative action should have given us that, but we didn't take advantage of it. It's a lot of things happen we didn't take advantage of. It's like I was telling you, see when you get greedy, look out for ourselves, instead of looking out for the whole race, these people with these football teams, they got all kinds of money. They give, the television give 'em $30 million. They can't spend this kind of money. These teachers that teach football games cost you a hundred dollars. You take your family to a football game, now it cost you four or five hundred dollars. A cup of water at the stadium out here cost you three and a half [dollars], just a cup of ice, I didn't say water. Little ole bitty cup, three and a half, parking, all of this. They got all of this. We don't get none of that. We have to pay for it. Have to beg to do that, but I didn't never, I don't participate in that.
Story_ID: 375891
Speaker 1: Tell me your last thoughts about in your, what do you wanna have in history, your thoughts about being a participant in the Negro League and just your last thoughts on that.
Speaker 2: Oh, my last thoughts on it is that the thing that you're doing now is a wonderful thing, is bringing history, bringing history to people that people didn't know about because of, you see, some black people didn't know nothing about no Negro baseball until Jackie [Jackie Robinson] got in it and they been playing it since in the '20s [1920s]. They didn't never tell people that night baseball started in the Negro League. They don't tell people that, but that's where it started at. History will prevail for us in time, but what we have to do is what you're doing now, is to get this whole history our--to folks where people can understand and see. Because these young folks coming along now, twenty, twenty-five, they never heard of nothing like that. Hilton Smith come from Giddings, Texas. People in Giddings didn't know. I know a preacher here. I was talking to him about it. He know the family, but he didn't know him. That's where he from. Well you see you have to do that. Willie Williams, one of the pictures I showed you out there with the governor out there, when they put him in Cooperstown [New York] in the Hall of Fame [National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum], they put it all over town. They put billboards up in the city. [HistoryMaker] Ernie Banks is in the Hall of Fame. They never done that here. This is what I'm trying to get people to understand. What you doing, that's the reason I tell 'em all the time, I don't mind taking my time giving people the little knowledge that I have about things, because that's the only way we gonna get it. If we don't pass it along to each other, then we won't have it at all.
Story_ID: 375892
Speaker 1: Life after the Negro League. Tell me what happened next.
Speaker 2: Well, I came back home and I start the newspaper, what I was telling you about at first. That's how I got started in the newspaper. So I knew, you see in a city of Dallas' [Texas] size, they didn't have no paper that was made up here. The paper that we got in Dallas came from Houston [Texas]. A man named Carter Wesley [Carter Walker Wesley] is the one that had the Dallas Express and he would get the news, people would send the news back down, make it down there, and send it back here, which was a good paper. But I didn't know nothing about no newspaper, but I knew that it was something that was needed in this community for people to do, and that's how I got started in the newspaper business.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the newspaper?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: The name of the newspaper.
Speaker 2: The Dallas Express.
Speaker 1: No, your newspaper.
Speaker 2: Elite News [Highlight News; Elite News].
Speaker 1: Elite News? And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a paper before then, but that's when I actually, really got rolling with it, in 1960. I had Southwest Sporting News [sic. Southwest Sports News] in 1949 like I's telling you, but I was always gone, so when I come back home, I made my home, I made my journey back home to stay, that's when I started this generalization with this newspaper.
Speaker 1: Okay, so 1949 you had a paper, 'cause the Negro League ended in '51 [1951], okay, so in, but in '49 you started it in, when you came back home. You came back home in '51 [1951]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came back home in '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's when, but what happened between '51 [1951] and '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: I didn't do nothing.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't do nothing then. I worked, I didn't have no job, you know, I worked, my wife [Mozelle Jordan Blair] does catering work and I helped her with it for a while.
Speaker 1: Your wife did catering work?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you did--
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: I used to write a column for that Express that you talking about there. I used to write a sports column for them, every week. But other than that, I didn't, I had a little money so I didn't do too much.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then, the Elite was, was it a sports news or--
Speaker 1: General news.
Speaker 2: General news.
Speaker 1: I started off as a general news and the Lord blessed me enough after I got started, you know you run into snags sometime, but it's sometime you have to use a little ingenuity and thank about things. I went to the black church in this city here. A man who picture up there, I show you, the name is Dr. S.M. Wright [S.M. Wright, Sr.]. I started to church and I put all of my other news around there, but I never sold cigarette ads or liquor ads or nothing. I never done none of that, which was a whole lot of money to be made, but I wouldn't do it. And that's how I got started with that. In my paper, rather than use them, if you look at my paper, you'd see all the preachers' pictures in there. Well, that's how I, that's what financed my paper. That's what started me on the way.
Story_ID: 375893
Speaker 1: So to back up just a little bit. You said you didn't work a lot because you had a little money. Did you get your money from the Negro League 'cause we know that--
Speaker 2: I absolutely, let me explain, stop right there, let me tell you, I had money when I come out of the [U.S. military] service. I had fifteen thousand dollars and I never throw my money away. And then too when I come home, my wife [Mozelle Jordan Blair] had a good lucrative business so I didn't have to do too much, and money that I made playing ball, I kept that too. So I wanted, I knew something I was gonna have some money to do something with, and I often think about my father-in-law. I, I tell people this all the time because it's the truth. He used to tell me, I'd be spending my money, spending money he thought it was just out of character for spending money like that. He said, "Baby, why don't you do something with that money, buy you some property or something with it." I didn't think that away, I didn't think of it that away. When he be talking to me about my money, Denise [Denise Gines], I said to myself, I wouldn't talk back to him, you didn't tell me how to get it, don't tell me how to spend it. I saw that a many day after I got started with the paper [Highlight News; Elite News] because sometimes, in newspaper business you have to have your money every five days. And sometimes I run into a snag. The Lord tied me over until I really got rolling, and that's what I done. My kids come home, now my first boy that came in there with you, he made a hundred thousand dollars a year. He worked for McDonald's corporation. Oh he had a big job, he came over here, says, "Daddy, I got," I said you come over there, I said, "Let you run this paper. You see what you can do." You can't pull him away from here now. All my children, Darryl [Darryl Blair], Debra [Debra Blair Abron], all of 'em. All my children involved in what I do, but sometimes you have to save your money, you don't never know what you need it for. I didn't have a car and my oldest boy [William Blair III], the one I tell you, the one got killed, I had a old Ford, I had a Ford I was putting my papers around in, so he was down there at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] in school. He said, "Daddy," say, "if I had a car, say I could make a hundred dollars a week." I gave him the car. Instead of me sending him a hundred dollars a month, he made the money himself, sent himself own to school. So, you know, everything worked out for the better for me. It really did.
Story_ID: 375894
Speaker 1: So the newspaper [Highlight News; Elite News], once you got with the churches, you put in church news also. And it took off (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Claps) Been going ever since. Been going ever since.
Speaker 1: So every denomination?
Speaker 2: Anybody, everybody.
Speaker 1: And you just talk about their church? Tell me what a normal paper would--
Speaker 2: What I do, whatever they had, just like they have a, anything they have in their church, the things that worthy of news, they bring it to me. Just like they have their anniversary, they invite me, I go over to their anniversary, speak at their anniversary and this kind of stuff. I do all this then. I've done all this. I done it for years. I give to my kids now. I let them do it. That's the reason, most folks around here know me by what I did in the community, see I worked for politicians, I don't duck 'em. Politicians in this city here that elected in this city now, they elected on account of the work that I done for them, 'cause they couldn't get in places that I could take 'em. Just like, they don't let politicians go to no churches. William Jr. [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.] can take 'em. I started that. President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], before he ever was president, I was in a meeting right downtown at Jess Hay's office, the biggest, the biggest money-raising Democrat in the United States. I set up there and I told Reverend Raditz [ph.], there's five us in there, I told him, I say, he gone be the next president of the United States. You know how come I said that? 'Cause the man could talk. And you could understand exactly. He was right down to earth with what's he's doing and that's what he did. And all these local politicians, I don't have no trouble with none of 'em. I know all of 'em. One of the biggest mistakes we ever made in our life though, some of 'em, you put 'em in office, but you know, you have to live with it, so time will take care of that.
Speaker 1: So what other civic organizations do you work with?
Speaker 2: Oh, any of 'em. They come for all kinds of stuff here. Anything they want, they'll come here. They want me to help 'em with it. Especially when it comes to dealing with people. See I'm a people person. See all this stuff, talking about big shots, I don't believe in big shots. It's more average people than it is big shots, and that's what I deal with. I deal with average everyday people. I can go anywhere, I can take you right now, and I bet if it's fourteen people there, I bet ten of them there know me. And if I ever know your name, I don't never forget it. See I don't look down on nobody. It's one thing I guess I just learned that from people. I'm not no better than you, and you not no better than me. I don't care what your circumstances are. See, you may have all the money in the world, but we still a human being, and I don't look down on nobody that away. And that's the way I been all my life. Anybody that know me will tell you, say whatever he tell, say he ain't gone, ain't gone mince no words with 'em. I'll tell you exactly what it is. And I ain't trying to make no friends. Me and you can be friends, but I'm a tell you right. I said Denise [Denise Gines], that's wrong. Now you do whatever you want to about it, but I'm a sure tell you.
Story_ID: 375895
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, the pleasure you get from the newspaper [Highlight News; Elite News].
Speaker 2: Well, I just gave it to you. Meeting people.
Speaker 1: Meeting people That's the--
Speaker 2: You got a chance to meet people, you got a chance to meet people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there anything else you want to tell me about the newspaper?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, it's a community paper, you know, if we, we do a whole lot of things here. It's things you got a chance to teach people about things that they don't know. Just like that book I gave you, when I put that book out, I couldn't keep that book. Because it's things that people knew in that book that they heard about, but didn't get a chance to see. I knew all the people in that book just like I'm talking, I can take that book, page by page and tell you everything in it, because I was around those kind of people. I know, I knew them, and, and they know me.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what is the name of the book?
Speaker 2: 'The Dallas I Know' [William Blair, Jr.].
Speaker 1: 'The Dallas I Know.' I mean it is a wonderful book and it goes, starts way back in Dallas [Texas] history--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and tell me what prompted you to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, the same thing we just got through talking about, people don't know. It's just like, it's three hundred thousand Negroes in the history, in the City of Dallas right now. In 1930, wasn't but thirty thousand. See that show you how the city has grown. It has grown to that, and I tell people this a lot of times, you know, when you and your people talk about, "Well, I, so and so and so, word of mouth." You can't use the word of mouth no more because the city done grown too big. That's what a newspaper's for. That's what you have to do. And I tell people, everywhere I go Denise [Denise Gines] this, I know this the real fact. Black newspaper is about black people. It's about black people.
Speaker 1: So black, yeah. To be able to get the information out, and the history and knowledge, it has to be written down sometimes.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Well, most times, so that--
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: --the next generation will have that information also. So it's good that you took the time to sit down and do that because it, I can see why it's a book that you couldn't keep here because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no.
Speaker 1: --it just sold so fast.
Story_ID: 375896
Speaker 1: Your religious connections I guess, we will say, led you onto the next venture of a hall of fame for religious [Elite News Religious Hall of Fame, Dallas, Texas] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's exactly, now you don't have it nowhere in America.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: Most viable thing in the black community is a black church. You don't have no history or whatsoever of past pastors or things like what they got. That's what I got up there. I'm a, I'll get you some information on that, but anyway you take everything they been buying from black people in this country, where'd it start at? Started at the church. Well, what better place on earth to be remembered from, the church. Well, that's what I do. I'm working this year, I'm working now for August the 19th, I'll have it on the 19th of August this year. See I've gotten six of 'em already, I got already for this year. But I'm get me four more for ten. And that's what'll I do. Because that is important history. You go to any city in America. I don't care where it is, large, small or middle size, the oldest institution in the town is what?
Speaker 1: The church.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So you established a hall of fame for religious leaders.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me what are the qualifications to be inducted into this hall of fame (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of 'em is mine. I got to know something, I know most, what most of 'em done and just like those that passed on, I got the history of what they did, just like I got a man named Dr. R.L. Parish [Robert L. Parish, Sr.], who started church in the 1920, got four boys, all of 'em preachers here. People don't know that. They been born and raised right here in this church, True Lee Baptist Church [True Lee Missionary Baptist Church, Dallas, Texas] over there on Bertrand [Bertrand Avenue; Robert L. Parish Sr. Avenue]. Well, he's dead and gone but he left something here. See, if you do something people will remember you, if you don't they won't. And that's what I try to do.
Speaker 1: What are some of the other qualifications?
Speaker 2: Well, you got to be, be involved civically in the community. That's the biggest one. And, and that's my qualification.
Speaker 1: So right now, it's only for Dallas [Texas] or Texas?
Speaker 2: Oh, no. I got 'em, got 'em, W.A. Shaw out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] be here this year. President of the largest black organization in the United States, the largest black church organization in the United States.  I had Melvin Wade [Melvin Wade, Sr.] here last year. Oh, it ain't no little thing.
Speaker 1: And where is it held?
Speaker 2: It'll be held at the convention center [Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: So there's no physical building that holds information about them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, up there on, I got a place up here on, up here on Hampton [Road], 4347.
Speaker 1: 4347, what's the address?
Speaker 2: South Hampton.
Speaker 1: And tell me about the facility. What's in the facility?
Speaker 2: Lot of pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lot of pictures, lot of memorabilia, churches up there. My daughter's [Debra Blair Abron] up there now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right, you did say your daughter works there.
Speaker 2: Things that I do I want to be remembered for something when I leave here, you know. I don't wanna just leave. I put it in it, I put my kids in it. I got a whole lot of grandchildren. It can be carried on forever.
Speaker 1: How many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: I can't count 'em.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I got more great-grandchildren than I have grandchildren. I got, I got four in Houston [Texas], all of 'em college graduates. All of my children, I'm the first one in my, me and my sister [Susie Blair Cullors] the first one in our families graduated from high school. I got all kind of graduates. My children go to school, they go to school. That baby boy of mine, he, he's like less than half a year from finishing college. He just quit. He was the smartest kid I got. The one talking so loud in there. The last one in here, yeah, the smartest one I got.
Story_ID: 375897
Speaker 1: So you said you want to be remembered for something. What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: What I'm doing now. Say, "Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.] told me that and it's a fact." See people have to believe what you say. It's no good for you to be able to espouse on something and people don't believe you. People believe me, they'll believe what I tell 'em, 'cause they know I know what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: So your legacy?
Speaker 2: What I just got thou telling you.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I mean is there anything else you wanted to add (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I just wanna make sure that my children carry on what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's important to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, very important, that they carry on what I do, it'll mean something to your children and other folks' children. It's like I was telling you about, I got pictures and things. I just happened, when I bought this building here, I just haven't had time to really put it in chronological order like I want to. But I will. But I got pictures of everything.
Story_ID: 375898
Speaker 1: So, in your lifetime, what do you think, or what do you consider to be most valuable, what values I guess I'm trying to say.
Speaker 2: Friendship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Friendship. I believe in that. Friendship. Loyalty and friendship. You got to be loyal to something. If you ain't loyal to something, you'll go for anything, and I believe in that. See, a lot, I'll give you an example of what I'm talking about. A lot of people, you do things to make, I don't do nothing to make nobody like me. I don't care if they like me or not, respect me. You respect me two ways, speak to me or ignore me. Whichever one you chose is all right because I'm not gonna do nothing to you. I know that, I understand. I'm not gone do nothing to you. But you know sometimes people just assume something about you, "I don't like him." "Why?" "I just don't, I don't know, he ain't never done nothing, I just don't like 'em." I ain't never been that away.
Speaker 1: So when you look back over your life, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: Friendship. Friends I made along the way.
Speaker 1: And who are some of those friends that you remember the most as being valu- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. S.M. Wright [S.M. Wright, Sr.].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Dr. S.M. Wright.
Speaker 1: Un-hm. And that was your best friend?
Speaker 2: One of 'em.
Speaker 1: Who was the other one?
Speaker 2: Marvin Robertson [ph.], Billy Allen [ph.], I mean these people is friends, I'm not talking about no acquaintances. These friends.
Speaker 1: So, any last thoughts?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one more. I want to tell you this and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I really appreciate what you're doing and I appreciate you taking, you coming out here taking your time to come out for me to enunciate what I'm doing here. Because I know it's needed and I hope that any way that I can help you do further along the way, let me know, I'll be happy to do it.
Story_ID: 375899
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American Community?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a long question, now. My hopes is for us to not, like some people say, when we all gonna get together? No, we not all gonna get together. But some of us of like minds put our minds together and do some things this time, amount to success for the black community, instead of us, three over here and four over there and people divided. If you get yourself together and put things in perspective for people to do what they need to do, then you can do a whole lot of things. Know how to ask for things, know how to do what you need to do, and last but not least, if you got money, put your money where your mouth is. Don't always be somebody with your hand out. You can't fight folks and beg 'em. That's what I'm trying to say.
Speaker 1: Mr. Blair [HistoryMaker William Blair, Jr.] we really appreciate you taking the time--
Speaker 2: I appreciate you, I appreciate you.
Speaker 1: I just want to know, if there is anything else you want to say or talk about that you want the world to know and remember?
Speaker 2: No, I think I've covered it all baby. But I, I just wanna say again I appreciate you, you and the camera man there for taking the time to come here. Because when I first got this, I didn't pay too much attention to it, I really telling you, but I'm really proud, really glad that I did. Because, you know, some people call here all the time wanting me to do different things, which I don't mind doing 'em because if you know something, it's wrong for you to keep it and don't impart it to somebody else. But anyway I can help you, you let me know, you let me know, I'll be happy to. Let me go in here and try to find some of these pictures.
