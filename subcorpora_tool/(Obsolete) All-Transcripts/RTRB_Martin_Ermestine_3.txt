WILMOT: This one&#039;s on. Okay. Ermestine Martin, interview three, April 8, 2005,
with Nadine Wilmot, of the Regional Oral History Office. So, good morning.

MARTIN: Good morning.

WILMOT: We&#039;re continuing our interview. I think when we left off we were talking
about the different communities in Richmond, in the late 1940s, just after World
War II, where did people of different ethnicities live, as I recall. I wanted to
ask you a little bit about how, where your second property was. You told me you
bought a house in 1949 on Twenty-second, is that right?

MARTIN: That&#039;s correct, but I have to correct that, it was 1948. Because the
child was born in 1949 and we had been in the house during my pregnancy, so that
would have been 1948 we bought the house.

WILMOT: I&#039;m just getting adjusted here, excuse me. [phone rings] That&#039;s your
cell phone. Do you need to answer that?

MARTIN: I do. I got these guys--I&#039;ll catch it. [pause]

WILMOT: Again, here, we&#039;re recording again here. I want to ask you what your
second property was. You said your first one was in 1948.

MARTIN: 1948, yes. Then I worked for the government, and then after that two
years, I think that&#039;s when I bought the first property off the off-ramp of
MacDonald, in that area. It was all for--you know, the highway department was
selling these houses. I was still working, because I stayed off of work but I
asked my husband, who worked nights, swing shift, to buy a cashier&#039;s check and
he didn&#039;t buy it. I said to him, &quot;Where&#039;s the cashier&#039;s check?&quot; He said, &quot;I
didn&#039;t get it.&quot; I said, &quot;Okay, I&#039;m going on to the auction anyway.&quot;

WILMOT: This was an auction.

MARTIN: Yes, it was an auction.

WILMOT: They were auctioning off houses? The highway was auctioning off houses?

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: Is it because they were trying to move them so they could lay down the highway?

MARTIN: Yes, that&#039;s because they were doing highway improvement in Richmond,
different areas, freeway access, ingress, egress off the highways. And possibly
a new highway I think. But that&#039;s where--I don&#039;t know where I knew about it
exactly, but that&#039;s what I wanted to do. When he came home, I asked him where
was the check, because we were going to pay off that $2,000, so he was working
and I was working, but he was working swing shift and I was working days. So he
was to get the check for me, the cashier&#039;s check to bid, and he said to me he
didn&#039;t get it. I said, &quot;Why?&quot; He said, &quot;It cost a quarter.&quot; I was kind of
disenchanted, so I said, &quot;Well, I&#039;m going anyway.&quot; I started to dress to go,
because I had taken off work that day to see how this bidding, if I could bid on
this house. He scrambled out of bed and took a shower quickly and he was right
there by my side. I imagine he--I said, &quot;Just a quarter is all you would lose if
we bought the cashier&#039;s check?&quot; I don&#039;t know why he would have said that. We
went to the auction, and I stood up and bidded on the auction as if I had money
and when I was the successful bidder, he asked for the check, and I said, &quot;I
don&#039;t have it but I&#039;ll be right back with it,&quot; and they allowed us that chance.
They didn&#039;t open it up for bidding again.

WILMOT: Will you say that again? Will you tell me that story again? Because I
was moving this around a lot.MARTIN: I was saying, you asked me about the first
house we bought, as I said, I first thought I was not working for the
government, that was for--again, that was Benecia arsenal, where I was a sample
selector for commercial contractors and long-time storage. But I was still
working there and I decided I wanted to get into this house-moving business.

WILMOT: Did you know of someone else who was moving houses?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t really recall. I didn&#039;t seem to know, I knew that there was some
excess houses that were sold off. Then I spoke with R.H. Myers, the house-mover,
and he gave me some ideas and some things, if I wanted to bid. Because he had
competition with the {Trulls?} house-moving, there were two companies prominent
here for house movers, that was the {Trulls?} company and R.H. Myers. Myers&#039;
office was close to the first house we bought. I spoke with him, and he was
giving me some pointers about it, so I decided, &quot;I&#039;m going to try this.&quot; I
needed a cashier&#039;s check, possibly for $1,000 or something. He said, the next
morning, I wanted the check, they took the bid, and he said, &quot;I didn&#039;t get it.&quot;
I said, &quot;Why?&quot; He said, &quot;It cost a quarter.&quot; I thought--you know, I think he
didn&#039;t know what else to say, he just didn&#039;t get it. I got ready, and I said,
&quot;I&#039;m going anyway and see what I can do.&quot; He got dressed and he came too. I bid
as if I had the money, but I knew I didn&#039;t have on site at that moment, which is
the proper thing to do. I just took the nerve to bid, so--of course, for a
while, there was a little getting together, and maybe about ten minutes they
were ready for the check, cashier&#039;s check, but I didn&#039;t have it. I told him,
&quot;But it won&#039;t be but about five minutes, he&#039;ll be back, because the bank&#039;s right
there.&quot; So they said, &quot;Okay, run and get it, we&#039;ll be doing a few other things.&quot;
That was our first house. I think that&#039;s the one that I said I did some plumbing
on it. It had four-inch steel pipe I think and we used {okite?} and lead, hot
lead, you have to have a kettle and melt the lead to put the joints together. I
even built the fence, and the fence stayed there, I guess, for I don&#039;t know how
many years, I saw the same fence I built. Just me, because my husband worked the
night shift.WILMOT: You built a fence yourself?

MARTIN: Oh yeah!

WILMOT: Impossible! [laughter]

MARTIN: I came off a farm! [laughter] When you come off a farm you--I think I
forgot to insert here that this brother that I had was always kind of--Mama
said, &quot;puny.&quot; I was not puny, I was everything but. I wasn&#039;t necessarily fat,
but--yes I was, in one sense. Today&#039;s standards I was fat, but I was just big,
robust--everything he went to do, it was just proper, I was suggested to help
him. I don&#039;t even know that, but I could see that he wasn&#039;t a big, robust kid.
He had headaches a lot, so I don&#039;t know. Of course, you know, you know he died
early, at thirty-eight. It didn&#039;t--nothing--like I would take the truck and if I
needed lumber, I&#039;d go buy it with my truck, with my husband&#039;s truck. It was just
the way I was reared. I met some other women like that.

WILMOT: Really? Who?

MARTIN: I think it&#039;s--I&#039;ve forgotten her name, the woman that is the winningest
basketball coach? It was last week they were--

WILMOT: Rutgers? No.

MARTIN: She came off of a farm, and when she was explaining how she grew up and
she was challenging these girls and she doesn&#039;t take--they have to get the
power, the strength, to win. I thought they said that--I don&#039;t follow the games
that much and I just saw that and I thought, &quot;I understand, I can empathize with
her.&quot; There&#039;s another girl that was here, a supervisor, can&#039;t think of her name.
She had come off of a farm. When you&#039;re a farmer, you do things. That&#039;s why you
don&#039;t socialize. [laughter] You can&#039;t socialize and be real cute and sweet and
pretty, you have to maybe--you just do the farm things. Then, after you get into
it, it&#039;s the proper thing for you. You just think, &quot;Well, I do this.&quot;

WILMOT: &quot;And I can do it.&quot;

MARTIN: Well you don&#039;t even think, you just see this as a chore, this is the
garden, this is the orchard, we plant the trees, you just do it. That&#039;s
your--instead of thinking, &quot;I&#039;m going to this tea, in this little pretty dress,
and I&#039;m going to this big dance,&quot; you&#039;re thinking about other things. Sometimes,
like Four H club groups and the fairs, we&#039;d go to that and sometimes compete
with fruit, canned fruit. My brother ran the horse and ran the race. But not
just to be--that&#039;s a seasonal thing and then you&#039;re through. Of course in our
city, this little black town, it was only a one day affair. Maybe a day or two
preparation, but the event was just one day and you&#039;re finished. You&#039;re still
back on the farm. There&#039;s those things that need you, the horses and the cows
and the pigs and the plants need to be cultivated. There&#039;s so much need for your
services, there&#039;s no downtime.

WILMOT: Well I have a question for you. So you built the fence in front of your
first house, where did you move it to? Was this a one-story house, a two-story
house, a little house, old house?

MARTIN: It was a reasonably new house. It was just in the freeway.

WILMOT: In the way of the freeway.

MARTIN: The plan for the freeway.

WILMOT: This was 580? Where 580 is now?

MARTIN: This was sort of, I believe, near Barrett Avenue, maybe Barrett?
Somewhere in that area where that house came.

WILMOT: That&#039;s where that freeway 580 is?

MARTIN: It&#039;s probably where they had to make an access road to get to the
highway. They had to take those houses out in say a block or so.

WILMOT: Do you still own that house?

MARTIN: No, I sold the house.

WILMOT: So you moved it, did you have to buy new property to put it on?

MARTIN: I bought a lot.

WILMOT: You bought a lot. Where was the lot?

MARTIN: Sixth and Main.

WILMOT: Do you remember spending a lot on the lot?

MARTIN: No, the lots were cheap. I had gotten where I pretty much knew the
owner. It was a man called Milton Myers, owned a lot of the Richmond property,
and I knew--I searched the records so much till I knew pretty much who owns any
lot. It was kind of the part of the trade that you know how to get a lot or to
know what is available. Especially with buying a house and you&#039;ve got to move it
in say, thirty days. You have to be kind of ready with a lot that you know is
available or you already have control of. The house looks quite well still.

WILMOT: Mr. Myers, did you do business with him a lot over the years?

MARTIN: You know, he was a mysterious person. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever seen him.
He was in San Francisco, and he just owned--he was buying those Japs, the
Japanese, the same property that I was telling Dad about which, this was quite a
bit before when Dad, when I asked him why didn&#039;t he go to Martinez and check on
that land. There were a lot of vacant lots in Richmond. Richmond was, when the
shipyards work begun, Richmond was so--there just was a lot of vacant land. That
of course was subsidized into lots. I don&#039;t know why Milton Myers&#039; company had
bought all these lots.

WILMOT: Do you didn&#039;t negotiate with him directly for that land?

MARTIN: It was all kind of like on the phone or by mail. He was well known at
the local title company, he&#039;d throw his documents in, his demands into our
local, which was Title Insurance and Trust was the one we used. He would place
his documents there according to what we had agreed upon per lot. It might have
been $300 or something like that, it was not that much money.

WILMOT: You went ahead and you worked with him, Mr. Myers over the years with
other properties as well?

MARTIN: This is two Myers. Land acquisition was Milton Myers of San Francisco
and company. Then there was Bob Myers, Robert Myers on Fourteenth? It was about
Fourteenth Street, which was only about six blocks from our home.

WILMOT: You said Mr. Myers bought a lot of land from the Japanese who had been interned.

MARTIN: I&#039;m just assuming. I shouldn&#039;t have spoke that, but he owned a lot of
the vacant lots in Richmond, so it didn&#039;t take me much to know who owned most of
the lots, because he was pretty much in control of those that were vacant at
that time.

WILMOT: Interesting, so he was a real developer, he had an eye.

MARTIN: Well, there is someone doing that, has been doing that, in Richmond,
especially in the North Richmond area. There&#039;s a person, I happen to see that
person that buys up, was buying up all the lots. He came out smelling like a
rose because those properties in North Richmond, it was just an oversight for me
and every other person. I couldn&#039;t imagine them getting $350,000, $360,000 for a
lot, a little--a house on a small lot. Now people are buying them because
there&#039;s a government program that wraps around that, it says you can go up
to--actually it&#039;s kind of based on your income, because you can only pay so much
for a house if your income is kind of a moderate or low income. They tried to
tailor it, the government tried to tailor a house for everyone. Like, can we
afford a car for everyone? That&#039;s why they allow them to stack on a twenty-five
or hundred lot right now and people are glad to buy those because the programs
that the government brings is to accommodate everyone. They&#039;re willing ready and
able to go to work, and working.

WILMOT: It&#039;s that same kind of philosophy of a car in every garage.

MARTIN: Yes, I think Henry Ford started that when he started the Ford. He had
that vision.

WILMOT: The American dream.

MARTIN: Yes, instead of the Chrysler and--I&#039;ve forgotten the older cars.

WILMOT: I want to ask you, how many properties do you own currently?

MARTIN: You know what? I know people don&#039;t think I&#039;m telling the truth, but I
don&#039;t know. That has never been my thing. I don&#039;t know.

WILMOT: Do you think it&#039;s more than ten or more than twenty?

MARTIN: I really don&#039;t know. It&#039;s quite a few. If my life depended on it I could
guess but I don&#039;t know.

WILMOT: Can you guess?

MARTIN: [laughter] I don&#039;t really wish to guess. You know, most people think I&#039;m
joking, but that&#039;s not what I do. I&#039;m not--what I do is not for a count, it&#039;s
just something I like to do. It&#039;s something you want to do.

WILMOT: That&#039;s real estate for you. Are you owning a lot of rental properties?

MARTIN: Yes. Having problems right now.WILMOT: Do you own a lot of multi-unit housing?

MARTIN: Not that much, but I own some. I don&#039;t own that much property but I do
own control of some property.

WILMOT: Is it mostly single-family? Or is it multi-family units?

MARTIN: Some single family, others multi-family.

WILMOT: Which neighborhoods are most of your properties in?

MARTIN: In the South Richmond, the black community. Not any more though, of
course, you know the Spanish people are moving in so rapidly. They are coming in
and buying up everything right now. North Richmond has been taken over pretty
much--which was black community, the black churches are there. But the black
people, those that come to our church, most of them do not live in North Richmond.

WILMOT: Where do they live?

MARTIN: Oh, scattered. You know, when integration came, it actually, it took a
toll on the black unity in a sense because you&#039;re spread out through the whole
district or city or area. What was interesting though, black people are here and
so forth, but when you get in other communities, there is no black still--very
few. Not Richmond per se, but in adjoining cities and especially moving up the coast.

WILMOT: There are few black people or less unity?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t mean unity--I&#039;m thinking of Richmond and North Richmond and
Oakland. There&#039;s a lot of black people in the city itself. But when you leave
the city and you get out thirty miles, there&#039;s no black people, you don&#039;t find
them out there. Our population seems very--

WILMOT: Dispersed, but we&#039;re actually not, we&#039;re not out in the suburbs.

MARTIN: Yes, out in the suburbs. I don&#039;t think we really thought we liked it out there.

WILMOT: I know a lot of people are actually selling their homes in Oakland and
moving out to say, Pittsburgh.

MARTIN: Oh yes.

WILMOT: But I guess that&#039;s hardly even a suburb anymore.

MARTIN: No, well, Pittsburgh had a fairly large population of blacks but it
might not be as many as you think. What happens, I think, we usually get in, or
somehow it was guided that we were allowed to buy here, so we concentrate in a
certain area and it makes--say, for example, Richmond. It&#039;s heavily populated
but then you move to San Pablo or El Sobrante, and then you don&#039;t find that
many. You find quite a few but not as many. Where I live, I know at least five
homes in three blocks of me, and they were, my sister in law for one and my
husband&#039;s bridge-playing people and a police officer at the base of my street,
those houses are not black anymore either.

WILMOT: Your neighborhood&#039;s changing.

MARTIN: Yes. I don&#039;t know where they&#039;re going.

WILMOT: What&#039;s your neighborhood? Where do you live?

MARTIN: I live in El Cerrito.

WILMOT: In El Cerrito. I wanted to ask you more questions about this second
house that you bought. Were you able to rent it right away? Did you rent it or
did you flip it back on the market? Did you sell it or did you rent it?

MARTIN: Oh yes! No, I didn&#039;t sell it. I didn&#039;t sell either one for a while. I
didn&#039;t believe in selling.

WILMOT: Why not?

MARTIN: My mama didn&#039;t. [laughter]

WILMOT: Yes! So you were like, &quot;I&#039;m not selling.&quot; [laughter]

MARTIN: I don&#039;t know, but the more I talk to you, the more I come up to see
things that I didn&#039;t see before. It seems like it&#039;s a reality. So many of the
points that you&#039;ve pulled from me made me still think the other night why my dad
didn&#039;t take me up on the deal of, &quot;Let&#039;s go to Martinez and try to buy you a
piece of land to build your store, because you have this brilliant idea, it&#039;s
doing well. People lining up for what you have.&quot; My father, if you ever met him,
any person who ever came in contact with my father liked him a lot. He was just
such a--he had a charisma about him that was--he was always kind of happy. I
think people like happy people.

WILMOT: They have good jokes and stories.

MARTIN: Yes, and he used to say, he would work late in the field, in the bottom
where the long ears of corn grew. I could hear him coming in and he would tell
the Burke&#039;s kids, these were white kids, two girls that was probably skating on
the pond with us. I could hear him say, &quot;Hard scuffle!&quot; They&#039;d say, &quot;Hi Roy.&quot;
And he&#039;d say, &quot;Hard scuffle!&quot; He and the team, that&#039;s when he didn&#039;t have the
tractors. He would be coming in.

WILMOT: With the horses.

MARTIN: Mm-hmm. You know, he had something, not just to say, &quot;Hi,&quot; he says,
&quot;Hard scuffle.&quot; Which I guess it was. [laughter] It was probably just about dusk
dark. They were sitting on the porch, and then our house was sort of close
enough you could hear it. There was nothing else that would stop you from
hearing him say that. It was just like a religious thing with him, saying that.

WILMOT: I don&#039;t know what hard scuffle means, just hard work?

MARTIN: Hard scuffle. In his case all I could see that it means is that he&#039;d
been down there ploughing with those horses all day, following those horses
around in that area all day long. Maybe--of course anything you run into, any
obstruction gets in your way. Just anything, you might miss and plough up the
wrong plant. That&#039;s just the way he would cap the evening off. &quot;Hard scuffle.&quot;
It&#039;s like he loved to say it.

WILMOT: He said it with a certain--he said it in an interesting way. I wanted to
ask you a question, just to go back to this real estate. I know I&#039;m moving back
and forth. Regarding, so you didn&#039;t believe in selling your land, so you held
onto your two houses. When did you--were there a lot more single family homes
you bought, or did you start to think about getting into multi-unit housing? And
were you by yourself?

MARTIN: No my husband was there but as I said it wasn&#039;t his kind of project.

WILMOT: He&#039;s a little bit more--

MARTIN: Then he became very interested as things developed. Just to get kicked
off, it almost didn&#039;t happen because he didn&#039;t get the cashier&#039;s check. I stayed
off from work. That&#039;s one thing I didn&#039;t do is be absent from work, but I wanted
to be off work to buy this house, to try this relocating of houses.

WILMOT: And you were at that time, you were really--what year was that?

MARTIN: That&#039;s probably still in my twenties.

WILMOT: It was 1950 something.

MARTIN: Hmm?

WILMOT: Was it early fifties do you think?

MARTIN: Yes it had to be because my kid was born in &#039;49.

WILMOT: So early fifties.

MARTIN: And she was just like a four year-old walking behind me wherever I
worked. Or in front of me or along side me. Wherever I went. Especially after I
was not working at Benecia anymore.WILMOT: And you quit that in--

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t quit, they reduced. It was like the Benecia arsenal was kind
of, the same war that you&#039;re speaking of affected Benecia in the way of storage
supplies and probably some--I don&#039;t think it had ammunition. That was Port
Chicago I think had the ammunition. Where I worked, my first job was at Eufala
at the ammunition--McAllister, Oklahoma. I think your question was an age question.

WILMOT: It was more of a, what year were they moving houses out of the way of
the freeway.

MARTIN: She was born in &#039;49.

WILMOT: 1952 I think, &#039;52, &#039;53.

MARTIN: Yes, but this was--she was already walking and following me around to
auctions and she must have been four or five. She was born in &#039;49.

WILMOT: Okay, and then your next property after that?

MARTIN: It was just on the corner, we bought--a hundred feet from that one was
another corner, and that one I still own too. I don&#039;t still own the first one. I
just assume that I might have sold it to generate money some time, you know. I
still own the other one. It&#039;s a gracious house now, kind of. I&#039;m going to put a
roof on it and do some things, three bedrooms each, stucco, not far from here.

WILMOT: And you rent it out?

MARTIN: But you know what happens? I don&#039;t know I own it, that kind of thing. I
know I do, but it&#039;s not that I own the house, it&#039;s a part of something that you
do. It&#039;s hard work, you know, to manage and work on them. You have to keep it
going always, insurance and taxes and good tenants and bad tenants and--.

WILMOT: We were just talking and you have different things going.

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: I wanted to ask you also. That was your third property and that was in
the 1950s, and beyond that did you go--are there some properties beyond that
that you want to speak to? Can you just kind of tell me the growth of you as a
real estate person?

MARTIN: [chuckles] I think I removed Cadillac ambulance company, it was somewhere--

WILMOT: You told me about that one.

MARTIN: I did, yes. That was where I was when I--I was working on that property
when I was using newspaper on the floor to keep from getting spots on the floor
and I was working on some veneer wall, veneer in one wall and covering it so I
wouldn&#039;t drop it. I read about this other auction for right here, near this
downtown Richmond. I guess it was redevelopment, I don&#039;t know really what that
was--but anyway they were going to sell this. Now for some reason I had already
bought this other building that had a store underneath and apartments above. I
had no one that wanted to do anything with the commercial part underneath and I
saw this auction for store equipment to be auctioned off, like within an hour. I
remember rolling up my pants and I had a trench coat and I wrapped up in the
trench coat and I went out. I was kind of interested in how I looked when I got
out there on the street, so I went out and bought this stuff. Then there&#039;s me
and my dad moving it. We&#039;d take the meat cases and all that. We removed all that
to the store. I think there was one large case that I found a neighbor, Mr.
Harper, I believe he helped us with that one.

WILMOT: So I want to ask you about, during this time, where were you--to me, I&#039;m
thinking of this as your early real estate career, through the 1950s.

MARTIN: Oh yes, I was just probably only thirty.

WILMOT: Yes, and I just wanted to get a sense of, from whom were you learning
the lay of the land? Were there other black realtors at that time who were
really into development? Or white realtors or realtors of any color? Who were
you learning from?

MARTIN: You know what? When I first started out it was kind of like telling Dad,
&quot;Let&#039;s go down there to Martinez and work on that.&quot; I don&#039;t know where that came
from. I don&#039;t know anyone that told me that. But I knew that the business of
those lands was in Martinez, and that&#039;s where we should go, because Dad had this
beautiful, had this good thing going. The more he placed into the store--as I
said, the greens and he probably had some salt pork in there I guess, I imagine.
[laughter] Whatever the people would run over quickly and need. As they called
for it he would supply it in this little place. Then I could see when they would
come home and they would come home and they would talk about how much they had
to pay Thelma, Al and Thelma Penn was their name. [laughter] She may get this document!

WILMOT: Probably not.

MARTIN: But anyway, it would be nice, I would like to see her. Anyway, when they
would look at their profit it was cut so deep. All the woman had was this little
shack that would have rented for $50 or $60 a month in that time, less than $100
probably, at that time. She didn&#039;t have any imagination for it. If he had closed
the gap then with five years or something. Like some of the contracts I&#039;m
getting now from some big people like Sprint and some other people like that,
they really cut a contract on you now, I tell you. I think in New York they
really cut some tough contracts. Most of us don&#039;t know anything about a contract.

WILMOT: In this sense, what do you mean they cut a contract? They really, you
mean, when they buy your cell space?

MARTIN: I&#039;m just talking about people who design smart leases.

WILMOT: So it&#039;s smart in their favor.

MARTIN: Of course! But everybody tries to lead you to think that we&#039;re on an
equal basis so I&#039;m giving you this and taking this and doing this and doing
this. But when you search it down you have been hurt. You know? Most any--you
know, I told you about my granddaughter. She was trying to use all precautions,
if she make it with this company, where would she be? No one of us, we can&#039;t
help her. I don&#039;t know about theatrical contracts. I am kind of interested to
see how people--they&#039;ll sign someone up for millions of dollars, but I&#039;m not
sure if that person&#039;s, say, voice fails, or something, what happens to that?
They don&#039;t--I&#039;m certain it&#039;s on a cut as you go in some way. Because I&#039;m looking
at insurance companies now, and how if you have just a natural act of God and
maybe they have to pay money, they may drop you. You get just--like last year
there were several windstorms, last year, I think. The wind was so unique it
would go under the shingles, uproot the shingles. They dropped me on one because
of an act of God. Then I couldn&#039;t understand it why it did that, because I think
there was--they have some insurance people that--

WILMOT: Do insure against natural disasters.

MARTIN: Well, yes, but then they bring people--I don&#039;t think it hurt--those
natural disasters happened, I&#039;m not thinking that it really hurt the insurance company.

Anyway, a contract is a very serious document. It can harm you greatly and you
may not know it. It&#039;s usually on a smile and a handshake. The smiles are not
necessarily--I think I told you about my mom when all the people came down to
see them in Eufala, at the Fountain Head Lodge. She seemed to have a natural
instinct to know. My dad, he was just, &quot;Ha ha ha.&quot; And he was just really glad
to see them and I know he was, because George Stems was a banker there. I don&#039;t
know whether he came.

WILMOT: This was in Oklahoma?

MARTIN: Mm-hmm. When we&#039;d go there, he and Dad would have a chat because they
grew up together. Dad grew up, I think--well, he was in Checotah, I think with
his first marriage, his kids, the other two kids, lived at Checotah.

WILMOT: I&#039;m wondering, was there ever a time in this early part of your real
estate career that you and someone you knew both had your eye on the same property?

MARTIN: I had a person to do me, very unusually, asked me not to bid on a house,
and he wouldn&#039;t bid on the next. It was the same as the Dad and Thelma thing.
When the next house came up, he bid on it anyway. I said, &quot;Wow!&quot; And I didn&#039;t
like him. That was Mr. Myers, R.H. Myers, the house mover. He needed it or
wanted it and he probably went to get both of them. At that point I was pretty
strung out there, as far as being there and bidding and moving stuff around.

WILMOT: Being able to move money around.

MARTIN: Yes, because there was a store building I wanted to bid on. I found out
that it was still--like Dad and Thelma. The world is that way, and you can&#039;t do
it any other. That&#039;s why I&#039;m saying that being really popular, whatever you do,
you know it&#039;s just a kind of a--it&#039;s a common vernacular, dog eat dog world.

WILMOT: True.

MARTIN: And someone else said, &quot;It&#039;s a dog eat dog world and I don&#039;t want to be
left behind. That means that--you know. But it&#039;s real, that&#039;s just the way it
is. You just have to, as my father would say, watch as well as pray. I guess
that didn&#039;t mean much at first, but it means a lot now.

WILMOT: It sure does. I think we&#039;re so in that moment right now. What did your
financing look like in the early part of your real estate career?

MARTIN: What did my finance look like?

WILMOT: What did your financing look like? How did you finance, like, if you
wanted to, as you say, buy a multi-unit building with a store in front, a store
on the bottom floor--were you using at this point--I guess the first question I
should ask is when did you get to a point where basically, the rents that you
were getting was enough that you could actually become real estate full time and
not have another job?

MARTIN: I never did depend on that because my husband kept his work. He worked.
He provided if we needed it. Or he provided and other things were just things we
were doing.

WILMOT: Gotcha.

MARTIN: He was a very smart person, very--sort of different. He wasn&#039;t a typical
black person in a sense. His culture, even though he was six or seven when he
came here, was kind of embedded in him. [laughter] He probably didn&#039;t understand
me as much as--I was just a little bit different from he in a sense. Not that
much. Of course, after a year and a half, two years, three years, a child and
all of this, you kind of get together, I picked up some of his beliefs and
habits and things, and he picked up some of mine, and sort of blended them together.

WILMOT: How long were you married?

MARTIN: You know, I don&#039;t even know. Probably fifteen years, something like
that. I can&#039;t tell you exactly, maybe fifteen or more.

WILMOT: He was also enthusiastic about real estate? Or he became enthusiastic?
Did he ever have a problem?

MARTIN: Not as much as I was. Sometimes it got to be a bore to him. I would
still--I think maybe that--it was just something I was doing. Just other things,
I was just always into something. Like, I started running the grocery store
after I picked up all, bought that equipment on the spur of the moment. I had
the equipment, moved it in, opened up a store and put in the real estate office.
The site that I was working on was were my real estate office was going to be
and I was giving this paneled wall--

WILMOT: And you created a deli there too, and everything else.

MARTIN: Not there, but the store that I took the equipment to, which was vacant
because it couldn&#039;t--it was vacant. So I couldn&#039;t find anybody that wanted to
use that commercial space.

WILMOT: Where was it?

MARTIN: Seventh and Ohio.

WILMOT: Seventh and Ohio.

MARTIN: It&#039;s still going. It&#039;s called S and S Market. It was really interesting.
The S and S Market used to be a place called Steve Stevenson--it had ethnic food
import company from Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas. He&#039;d bring what foods they
used to here, not far from here. Somehow the sign was moved from there to over
here on Twelfth Street, right near here. That&#039;s when I bought it, they made me
take the sign. They said, &quot;After you have done that, you have to take the S and
S Market sign down.&quot; To get it down was quite high up in the air and I hired a
sign company to take it down. Then I thought, they wanted to know what they were
going to do with it. I thought, &quot;Well, just bring it on down here.&quot; That&#039;s how
come that same sign is down at S and S Market, and that was really historical in
a sense, from Steve Stevenson, Stevens, I think was his name, exporting of
ethnic food from the south lands.

WILMOT: What would that be like?

MARTIN: Oh, something like canned okra, the hot sauce, I remember that, and
cayenne collard greens and canned--just things that people were normally used to
eating in--you know. Actually that same product was used in my store. Some of
the products that Steve Stevens. You know, they had a united grocers association
for small grocers and I belonged to that.

WILMOT: Were you--sorry.

MARTIN: I would order later from that book, and they would have the same foods
in there, the collard greens. The same brands were then placed in the united grocers.

WILMOT: Were you part of a real estate association?

MARTIN: I was part of two. Now I&#039;m currently a real estate, Contra Costa County
Board of Realtors. That&#039;s the one my husband had to sue to be able to sell.

WILMOT: Was this Petgrave or Martin? Which husband?

MARTIN: It was Martin. He had to sue the county of Contra Costa. He was the
first black to be a member of the realtors. It was always necessary because he
moved the office in El Cerrito and he couldn&#039;t sell the houses in El Cerrito. I
mean, he couldn&#039;t sell--most of them were placed on multiple listings services
and he could not sell those. But then he could and he sold quite a few houses.

WILMOT: Mr. Martin, this was about in what year?

MARTIN: Sixty-six, &#039;68, something about in there. That&#039;s like from the forties,
way on up there.

WILMOT: I want to ask you a little bit more about that in a minute. I have a
couple more questions to ask you about your early real estate years. When was it
that you were working with Neetha Williams?

MARTIN: It was sort of like after the house-moving stopped. Yes, it was after
that period, then I went to real estate school. That&#039;s when I--when you become a
salesperson, then you need to work with a broker, and Neetha was a broker. I&#039;m
not sure that I started with Neetha or Tony, who was another insurance and real
estate man that had a business on Seventh Street.

WILMOT: Tony, what&#039;s his last name?

MARTIN: Cornelius Tony, first name was Cornelius and I think his last name was
Tony. He and his wife both ran an insurance and real estate office in Vallejo
and he had a branch office here. Seems like I worked there first and then Tony
went back to Vallejo completely because it was too expensive by the time he came
here with a secretary. In Vallejo he had a business at his home like and his
wife was a very good business lady. You know, I think he was just diversifying
himself so for the amount of the money that he was receiving out of it.

WILMOT: He got too thin.

MARTIN: He got too thin, and you can get thin when you--I can remember a
secretary he had when he would go to lunch, I&#039;d be working there--I always said
I didn&#039;t want that kind of big office. Because everybody&#039;s sitting back on the
phone, talking to their friends, talking to their children, and then when the
phone bill came in it was--

WILMOT: He had a high overhead?

MARTIN: Because one of the secretaries had friends in Oakland, and she would
hold the phone up--she was typing something for him, and she would hold this
phone up to her shoulder there, and just be typing, and then mess up the paper.
[laughter] She&#039;d throw that in the garbage. As I looked at it, I thought, &quot;This
is really expensive for him to even go to lunch.&quot; I kind of thought, I didn&#039;t
say anything, but, &quot;If that was me I think I&#039;d bring my lunch.&quot; Because see, as
long as he&#039;s there, things are moving.

WILMOT: This was the period you&#039;re working for Neetha Williams and Tony,
Cornelius Tony, why did you decide to go work with other people? Because this
was after, this was in the late fifties, I think.

MARTIN: Yes well, when I became a salesperson, it doesn&#039;t give you a right
too--I could do anything I wanted to by myself, but to get out into the field of
real estate, you need to be a broker. You know, like you have to be able to run contracts.

WILMOT: Which is different than kind of more small-time, I&#039;m going to have a
house, rent out a house.

MARTIN: Yes, that&#039;s one thing.

WILMOT: I see.

MARTIN: But then to do a lot of that, I think, the real estate commission kind
of looks at this, that you need to be governed, keeping it safe for people, citizens.

WILMOT: Where did you go for real estate school?

MARTIN: Anthony, in Oakland, on Grand Avenue.

WILMOT: What did you--how many people were in your class?

MARTIN: Oh, seems like about twenty-five, something like that.

WILMOT: Were mostly black, white, what color, did it matter?

MARTIN: Mostly black, I mean, mostly white.

WILMOT: Mostly white.

MARTIN: The teachers, the staff was white.

WILMOT: And you were, I guess you were around--what year do you think that was?

MARTIN: I really don&#039;t know. You know, I don&#039;t recall. Because, when I had the
store, I had my own real estate office. No, I didn&#039;t have a brokerage, but
someone had a brokerage. There was a man I was doing some business with, and he
said to me--I can&#039;t recall, but anyway, he had his brokerage at my office, and
got a percentage of whatever properties that I sold--or either bought. If I
bought a piece of property he would get a percentage.

WILMOT: I understand.

MARTIN: I can&#039;t even think of the name of it. But finally I got my own broker&#039;s license.

WILMOT: That&#039;s what happened once you went to real estate school, you came away,
were you a broker at that time?

MARTIN: No, you come out as a sales person.

WILMOT: That&#039;s when you worked for Williams and Cornelius, Tony.

MARTIN: Yes, as a sales person.

WILMOT: And how many years did you work with them again?

MARTIN: Yes, I don&#039;t recall. It doesn&#039;t seem like it was a long time. Because it
either went out of business or something like that. She had some struggles.

WILMOT: Okay, in terms of?

MARTIN: Oh, you know, business is hard, I&#039;ll say that.

WILMOT: Okay.

MARTIN: You&#039;re responsible for all your sales people. You&#039;re responsible for all
the rent, all the phone bills, all the everything. A business is just not easy.
Sometimes you have part time sales people and they&#039;re in and out, and it&#039;s quite
a responsibility. And then you have to go out on appointments or receive the
appointments with them in the office, and you have to--of course naturally,
you&#039;re going to cut, maybe a 60/40, or percentage that you get. You don&#039;t do any
production yourself because you have all these people coming to you that&#039;s on
your license or with you. Then all the responsibility, it takes a toll on you.
Sometimes people would rather just be a solo, and do all they can by themselves.
That&#039;s what finally happened to my husband. He had a big business in El Cerrito.
After he became a realtor.WILMOT: Mr. Martin.

MARTIN: Mr. Martin.

WILMOT: The other thing, so you were a salesperson with Williams, did you feel
like that was a real learning time for you or not? Did you learn a lot at that
point? Or did you already know everything you needed to know?

MARTIN: I didn&#039;t think I--I don&#039;t think I learned that much. I think that was
kind of chaos to me.

WILMOT: It was chaos.

MARTIN: To me. Because I&#039;m not a real--I thought it was [makes noise like tired
chaos]. It was good but--.

WILMOT: It was like an example of how not to do things, basically.

MARTIN: Yes, and then it&#039;s just a big load for a broker, for Neetha it was hard.
For my husband also, with the large office he had, it was difficult.

WILMOT: When you, for you and--when did you meet Vie Taylor Wims, or Vie Taylor,
at that time, and Ruby, when were you all three working together? Was this a
very long time, or a very short time?

MARTIN: I met Vie and Ruby, as I said, I think one Christmas morning, I was
doing dinner, and they came out to visit me--seems like that&#039;s how I first met
the two women. As I think I mentioned, that I was sort of embarrassed because I
was really doing all the things I was doing and then some of the things that I
would like to have done in my home wasn&#039;t quite up to par. It wouldn&#039;t matter,
because--but I remember them saying why they came. It wasn&#039;t for Christmas
dinner. [laughter] It was something about something that I was doing. That&#039;s how
I kind of met them. Then we became members of the realtors board, the black board.

WILMOT: And the realtists?

MARTIN: Realtists, yes, I&#039;m sorry, the realtists board, yes.

WILMOT: So this was all when you were all three in your twenties still? Was this
before you were working as a salesperson or after?

MARTIN: I was older then. What I was doing earlier was not with a real estate license.

WILMOT: I understand. It was as a property owner.

MARTIN: This question you just ask me, what did you ask me?

WILMOT: I really asked, when you were working with--when did you hook up with
Ruby and Vie Taylor Wims, and was it a long period of time you were together?

MARTIN: Oh, I know, we were at the realtors board meeting, I mean, the National
Association of Realtors board had a meeting and we met Jim Woods, and aviator
from the military. I think he was one of those Tuskegee boys, perhaps. Then he
still had his plane in Los Angeles and he would fly up here when we&#039;d have
meetings. As Vie says, Vie is quite a socialite--still is, she gives the most
elegant parties you&#039;ve ever seen, right now, at her age. They&#039;re just fabulous.
Did you see in the back yard of her home?

WILMOT: I saw it from the outside.

MARTIN: When the white tables are there, and everything put together, it&#039;s just
gorgeous. She has this way of having all kinds of food, and she makes a famous
peach cobbler. I like the brown crust part, but the inside white part of that I
don&#039;t like. It&#039;s the peach cobbler, the peachy part, I like that, she has it
nicely seasoned. Possibly cinnamon, some other spices. [laughter] Anyway, Jim
Woods--well, we were just the ladies that were working together and people
seemed to notice us. Taylor, Bimms, and Petgrave. [laughter] That was kind of
like a little power, because it was three people.

WILMOT: What kind of projects were you working on together?

MARTIN: We worked on moving a multi-family building that I had forgotten that we
did do, until I went to take a woman from church home and she said, &quot;You
remember that building?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I don&#039;t remember that building.&quot; She said,
&quot;You moved that building in there!&quot; [laughter] I said, &quot;Oh, I had forgotten it.&quot;
Then we sold that and split the money. Then I don&#039;t remember what else. What
happened, oh, we met Jim Woods, this aviator plus real estate developer. He came
up, we said, &quot;If you guys find some land, we will do some houses.&quot;

So he&#039;d fly his plane up, and Vie would usually have the meetings at her home,
lovely put together. I found the land, as I knew all the land, pretty much, in
Richmond. I just knew who owned it and what contact to make. It was sort of
interesting to me. See, that goes way back to my dad and Thelma, because this
was a school site, an abandoned school site on South Seventeenth and Potrero. I
found that, and we bought the land, and Jim Woods came up and saw the site,
measured the site, we got it surveyed. Then we were going to do three houses,
which I&#039;d like to show you, and it was interesting. They look quite nice still,
I&#039;m still proud of them. But anyway, Jim Woods placed work with us, of course he
flew up with these men than--so these were pre-fab houses, and to me they&#039;re
some of the nicest yet that I see around.

WILMOT: So this--what year was this, do you think?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t know, but I could probably ask the City of Richmond when we
pulled the permits. Anyway, we got those houses built, but they weren&#039;t that
lucrative, so we didn&#039;t build the rest of the land, we split it off, the
remaining parts of those lots. It was like sort of, we didn&#039;t make the profit
that we thought was--

WILMOT: Going to happen?

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: Where did your financing come from for that project?

MARTIN: You know, I don&#039;t remember the financing part. It seems like we just put
money together and bought the land equally.

WILMOT: And for the pre-fab houses too?

MARTIN: I&#039;m not sure where--whether Jim Woods had--the owner of the pre-fab-- I
remember first we put down the foundation, and then the big truck would come.
That&#039;s when Jim flew up again. It was like a big, big, interesting project.
Everyone was enthused and happy, and kind of excited about it. The truck came
with the houses in the pre-fab stage. I think one of the houses didn&#039;t fit too
well, there was a little problem. Or the house didn&#039;t--we had to redo something
which cost us I think a little bit toward our profit.

WILMOT: Okay, let&#039;s stop for a minute.

[interview interruption while recording media are exchanged; begin disk 5]

WILMOT: So in those early years, who were your renters? Who were you renting to?

MARTIN: All black.

WILMOT: Where were they from?

MARTIN: Let&#039;s see, they were--where were they from?

WILMOT: Mm-hmm. Were they Richmond?

MARTIN: Just basically Richmond.

WILMOT: Did you have a sense that they were from, like, Oklahoma, Louisiana?

MARTIN: Oh, all over.

WILMOT: Were they newly arrived? Or they&#039;d been there little while?

MARTIN: I don&#039;t really know. Most of them I guess--sometimes offspring of people
here were the ones that were moving out of their parents&#039; houses.

WILMOT: Young people.

MARTIN: Yes, that&#039;s basically I think most of them. You know, younger people.
Some older people that never had a home and they would need a house, a place to live.

WILMOT: After--I just wanted to return, you were telling me about the property
that you and Vie Taylor Wims and Ruby had together. You worked together
sometimes, not very frequently, but you didn&#039;t work together for a long period
of time, the three of you?

MARTIN: We actually didn&#039;t work together in the sense of--we did special
projects together. Sort of like, we heard Jim Wood speak about the pre-fab homes
he was doing in Los Angeles and we jumped right on it and decided to find out
more about it. He flew up and said, &quot;Get the land.&quot; I found the land, I probably
already knew about where it was. Then we got site control, well, not maybe
then--yes, we got site control after he looked at it and thought it would be
suitable and started work on that, had it surveyed.

WILMOT: So you did special projects together. Vie Taylor Wims told me this story
about how you went to see some lenders to get some loans, the three of you. She
told me that in some ways there was beautiful Ruby, so you put Ruby at a certain
place where all the lenders could see her and then the lenders just signed
anything you put in front of them.

MARTIN: [laughter] I can&#039;t quite remember that! I remember I used a banker at
Mechanic&#039;s Bank here for most of the things that I was dealing with. Because I
could remember, he gained great confidence in me, in my ability. If I was going
to move a house and the time frame was not--if I couldn&#039;t attain the time frame
I was supposed to pay this money back--and I was going to refinance it out on an
FHA if I could. But I needed the money to construct the unit, you know, to do
the acquisition of land and to put the house back together and get it ready for
market. Then I&#039;d refinance it out. I didn&#039;t remember Ruby and Vie being there
for those things.

WILMOT: This was your own relationship.

MARTIN: Yes.

WILMOT: Your own financial lending relationship.

MARTIN: Yes. I don&#039;t remember that too much, because see, they weren&#039;t together.
They probably--I may not have been in all of these situations where they were
refinancing. All we had was those three houses. We sold the four-plex. You know,
she&#039;s probably correct. You know what happened? Vie and Ruby had children the
same age and they kind of, they went to Asilomar down there, and places like
that. They were always going, the children and Vie--Vie was always down there to
NAACP or some organizations had meetings there. Their children would--see, my
child was young and no part of that because she was younger and don&#039;t even know
them. She doesn&#039;t know their children. Probably don&#039;t really know--she knows
them now. She knew Vie. Because she ran for Queen of the Realtists Board and
won. And Ruby supported her, helped her to win as the Queen of the Realtists
Board. They know my child, but some of the things that Vie knows--Vie has so
many good stories, because I&#039;ve heard her tell a lot of them. Vie was--in my way
of looking at it--they both was beautiful in different ways. I don&#039;t buy dumping
on Ruby all of that because Vie has always been elegant, beautiful, lovely
things, nice people, and smart, with two children. She had two children, and a
single parent. Ruby was also. But I had a family, you know, and my child was
younger, so I don&#039;t think she knows-- I think she now is a teacher and an
educator. They had a seminar or something at that same place at one time.

WILMOT: Who was this, Vie?

MARTIN: Vie and Ruby. They would annually go down there for something, maybe it
was NAACP, or some organization. The children would go.

WILMOT: You know, the way that Vie told this story, she told me later, off tape,
she said that the way, the emphasis they were putting on Ruby being beautiful
was that she was dark, and the lenders were white, and they had an appreciation
for dark skin back then.

MARTIN: See, Vie is--I didn&#039;t really see that. I saw Vie--both of them were
pretty in their different ways. I thought both of them were beautiful and that
Vie would probably have the best--in my way of thinking--Vie had--I&#039;m thinking
of people like when we went to the national convention.

WILMOT: Of realtors?

MARTIN: Yes, I knew all of the people, possibly she was the one who introduced
us to Jim Woods. Or maybe we all met him together. Most people would see us all
together. It got where people would kind of respect us as strength.

WILMOT: As a trio.

MARTIN: Of women and strength. It didn&#039;t take long to find out that they could
trust us. There was no way--we were solid enough that we weren&#039;t playing. Ruby
had real estate going and a daily job.

WILMOT: In addition to her daily job?

MARTIN: Oh yes, and she would always be there. And Vie had all of her work
going, you know. It doesn&#039;t take long for a lender or anyone to figure that out.
If you don&#039;t figure that out, you&#039;re not going to hardly get the money. I don&#039;t
think. It might look like that. Just think of Ruby. Ruby worked very hard on her
job. I doubt she ever missed a day. Plus she was up in the morning working. Once
you get that--although she would--those two were just like Mutt and Jeff, one
dark, one light, but both very attractive, very smart, both of them.

WILMOT: I think the way she&#039;d tell that story, she was really speaking to the
discrimination within the, racial discrimination of the lenders. She was talking
about the fact that they basically wouldn&#039;t loan to black people unless there
was something special happening.

MARTIN: Yes. I think she&#039;s correct. I think that if Ruby didn&#039;t have that job
and worked doing like she did, we wouldn&#039;t have gotten the loan either. And if I
hadn&#039;t been wherever I am.WILMOT: If you weren&#039;t as solid as you were.

MARTIN: Hmm?

WILMOT: If you weren&#039;t as solid as you were in terms of your--

MARTIN: We wouldn&#039;t have gotten that loan. It just sort of seems like that to
Vie maybe. But to me, it was the solidarity of being out there on the firing
line. Because Ruby was on the job. But she was cute. She had--you know what, she
inherited that because her mother--I knew her mother, I was at her mother&#039;s--

WILMOT: What&#039;s Ruby&#039;s last name?

MARTIN: Bimms.

WILMOT: Ruby Bimms, that&#039;s her last name. Where&#039;s she from? Where was she from?

MARTIN: Arkansas. And she loved my husband. She just, &quot;Oh where is Martin?&quot;
There was just something about--he was from Arkansas as well. We were all good
friends. I didn&#039;t think Ruby was any--I think it was like a team between the
two, Ruby could--well, first you would kind of look at Ruby because of her
mannerism. [laughter] Vie was always nicely put together too.

WILMOT: Mm-hmm, I saw pictures.

MARTIN: They were just opposites in a sense. Of course Ruby would--I think when
one needed to come in, they would come in and kind of help put it together. But
I think that&#039;s true, from her standpoint. But in my standpoint of looking at it,
it was because Ruby was on that job and she would manage her money very
carefully and yet be so elegant. [laughs] She did all of these things. Some
people are very very elegant but they have no money. Ruby was going to have this
money and--. I see that as--you get the attention, but in anything you have to
get the attention.

WILMOT: You get the attention and you also--

MARTIN: Yes, but you can&#039;t hold it if you don&#039;t have some solidarity somewhere.

WILMOT: Some solid substance behind you.

MARTIN: Yes. You can switch all day long [laughs] and look pretty--I think this
is what I like to tell the young girls. You might be pretty as two or three
speckled pups, or ten speckled pups, but when it comes down to some business,
you&#039;re going to have to get down some reality and if it&#039;s not there you&#039;re not
going to be there long. You&#039;ll come towards someone and they&#039;ll turn and go the
other way.

WILMOT: But you know, our culture has such a--what happens for young women
around being beautiful, it can be very confusing for a young woman.

MARTIN: It&#039;s disastrous to be beautiful. That&#039;s why when you asked me, do I have
a social calendar--and I&#039;m not beautiful--but I feel it&#039;s a full waste of time,
trying to be beautiful, and then realize that you overspent yourself to get all
pretty and fine and everything and then most times you&#039;re out there with people
who don&#039;t have a dime and you&#039;re wasting money and time on something. [laughter]
You may as well wear jeans or whatever you want. I think women are getting that
way now, that they might as well be practical and wear, not necessarily
keen-toed shoes, where your foot is hurting and disforming your foot, and just
be real, have broad-toed shoes and flat shoes and go where you got to go.
[laughter] Because you&#039;ve got to move, and you can&#039;t move trying to look cute.
You know when I was in New York, the last time I went to the Women&#039;s Economic
Development convention in New York City, as I think I told you, Ivana Trump was
one of our speakers. She said, &quot;I think you probably want to know what do I do
every day.&quot; She was up at--I&#039;ve forgotten--she would be going to the airport,
meeting dignitaries--because she had the hotel, the popular hotel right at the
park. Then how she&#039;d be at the PTA meetings and all the things she did. I read
her book and they said she was very cautious about making sure those hotels are
clean and neat. She&#039;s on that job, she&#039;s seeing to that, although she looked
very lovely at that, I was at the VIP little social before dinner. She was well
put together in her attire, she looked great. Although, I think that most young
girls, people, old women and all, miss the point, because if Ivana Trump did it
that way--and at that same meeting was the girl who was just in jail.

WILMOT: Martha Stewart?

MARTIN: Martha Stewart told us how she functions, that she&#039;s up and she goes to
her garden. She works the garden and she goes and she rushes down to make sure
she gets to the auction to make sure she gets the first--not auction, antique,
some famous antique place that she goes and checks and sees what they have. She
gets back from one thing to another, just busy. And in her kitchen and all of
this. That would tell everyone, &quot;You really have to move.&quot; There, when dinner
was over, before we finished--it was a mid-day luncheon, she came across the
stage, she and her entourage, all in black, stepping like they&#039;re going to put
out a fire, to get the first position out there on the book-selling tables.

WILMOT: This was Martha Stewart?

MARTIN: Yes! Have you ever heard of Carol&#039;s Jewelry? Carol? She had the first
position in Bloomingdales.

WILMOT: Hm-mm.

MARTIN: She does a lot with pearls, they look so real. Carol, Carol--

WILMOT: I don&#039;t know her.

MARTIN: Anyway, she was an architect but then she decided that she liked jewelry
and she was doing jewelry and she told us how--and then I started noticing how
she places her--she designs a beautiful case, display case, and she always skip
the first position.

WILMOT: So my question to you is, when you say that women young and old miss the
point, what do you mean, we miss the point? We miss the point that it&#039;s really
important to be able to move? To work hard?MARTIN: Well, if you are successful
at getting a rich person--that&#039;s one thing, but if you don&#039;t have that money and
there&#039;s not that many guys can really do things for you, so what are you going
to do? Are you going to think that you can--then you can be lucky, and get a
person who is an extremely great provider--depends what you want. Sometimes
people just want a lovely little family and a cozy little home that Wards,
Penney&#039;s and Macy&#039;s would do. Some Macy&#039;s stores are way out there too in cost
and so forth. If that&#039;s okay, that&#039;s beautiful, if you can settle down in that.
But if you think you want greater things, you have to be careful how you throw
yourself out there thinking you&#039;re going to--and you may be lucky, I don&#039;t know.
[laughter] I think that the women have to be careful. It&#039;s nothing wrong with
just being a nice housewife or two people working together and having a
comfortable living together, it&#039;s beautiful. That&#039;s what we were thinking about
when we were bringing the boys home again. We just wanted a little home.

WILMOT: After the war?

MARTIN: Yes. We didn&#039;t care. Then there&#039;s this other thing that people go after.
An example, say, my granddaughter and her ventures in what she&#039;s trying to do. I
think it&#039;s--I try to tell her, but she can&#039;t do that like I tell her to do that,
because I don&#039;t know how to do that, what she does, what she&#039;s trying to do. But
I did see her when I was in New York, and the girls that she has been close to,
six years now--pretty much six years that she&#039;s been in New York. She&#039;s known
these girls from Los Angeles. They are continuing to--from Columbia University
to New York University in theatre. They have attorneys for the industry.

WILMOT: Entertainment?

MARTIN: Yes, entertainment.

WILMOT: Entertainment lawyers.

MARTIN: Yes, and they have--I think one of the girls--they&#039;re working in that
school for things that is necessary to be successful in the entertainment world.
I have forgotten what her major is. She&#039;s working with her too. I know very
little to tell them. I wrote her a letter the other day and I tell her to, &quot;Keep
your work clean.&quot; [laughter] I wrote her a letter the other day, this week, and
then I tore it up because I was directing right in on what I wanted to tell her.
I thought, &quot;That&#039;s a bit harsh.&quot; Then I redid it.

WILMOT: So you decided to be more subtle.

MARTIN: Well, I told her to start with her health. &quot;Start with your health.&quot; And
I started a little picture of her that I thought was cute. Then I called
her--you know there&#039;s a song that says, [sings] &quot;Sweet little Jesus boy,&quot; have
you heard that? &quot;Born in a manger, but they didn&#039;t know who you were.&quot; They
didn&#039;t know it was Jesus in the manger. So I wrote her, I took this little
picture, and I called her sweet little Jesus girl, and there were other little
pretty things I put on there. I ended it up, I chopped in, &quot;Now, take care of
your health, I&#039;m sending you this little token, I want you to buy the best food
that you can buy, because the talent that you are undertaking is going to take
good health.&quot; Then I sent her a picture of Blythe, or somebody, some girl who
was on the Academy Awards. It was really cute, it was a black girl that looked
kind of like her. I said, &quot;To get here, you must make sure you drink basically
water and juice.&quot;

WILMOT: I understand what you&#039;re saying.

MARTIN: But I&#039;m cutting it in a different way, because at first it would
probably turn her off. Anyway, the little song. Then I looked up the work angel.
I called her &quot;little angel.&quot; I looked up the word angel, and I wrote that,
&quot;angel&quot; like they do in the dictionary and then what it meant. Then I had the
person angel, what that meant. I think she is all of that, loving, kind. I
forgot how that was put together, it&#039;s upstairs. I sent her that. This morning,
I was saying, &quot;When does she get it?&quot; When she gets these little packages,
she&#039;ll call me. The last one, she said it brought her to tears. I think I was
telling her about--what was that I was doing to her and she said--I don&#039;t know,
it was just stuff that I do.

I don&#039;t know what to do, because she doesn&#039;t want my input in general, so I
thought, &quot;Don&#039;t be so direct with where I&#039;m trying to go with this.&quot; I don&#039;t
know, I&#039;ll hear from her as soon as she--I think I mailed it on Thursday night.

WILMOT: I wanted to--now, of course, I&#039;m going to turn around and--actually, do
you want to just say how many grandchildren you have?

MARTIN: I have one daughter, two granddaughters, and the oldest granddaughter
has five children.

WILMOT: So you have five great-grands.

MARTIN: Yes, five great-grands, three girls and two boys.

WILMOT: Okay, so I wanted to ask you something. Of course you know me, I have to
move back into real estate. Your second husband was also very much involved in
real estate. Did he become involved while you were with him, or did you meet him
and he was already a real estate person?

MARTIN: No, I met him--I was in real estate long before he was. I used to buy
lumber from Channel Lumber over here on the--great lumber company--over here on
the freeway. He kept asking me, did I know Martin, and I said, no I didn&#039;t know
Martin. He kept saying, &quot;Well Ermestine, don&#039;t you know Martin?&quot; I said, &quot;No, I
don&#039;t know Martin.&quot; I said, &quot;No, I don&#039;t know a lot of people.&quot;

WILMOT: You want to take a break?

[interview interruption for conversation with Mr. Bynum]

WILMOT: Okay, so he said you need to meet Mr. Martin, and eventually you met and
you became married. Mr. Martin, was he in real estate at that point or no?

MARTIN: Yes. When we met, you know, Martin was just a friend. Just a friend, a
very hard hitting real estate broker who loved to be with people, loved to do
that. He used to come in my store and buy candy bars. [laughter] He&#039;d drive up
and get these candy bars. He was always on a run, he was just trotting. Anybody
in any kind of business is tough, and you&#039;ve got to pick them up and let them
down fast or something, or you just will be out of it. Like in my business right
now there&#039;s a transition and I really have to--I used to call, get another gear.
In a farm area you get into a situation--that&#039;s where I got that from, I&#039;ve got
to reach and got me another gear, because when we go through the land, the roads
that I lived on were not paved, but they were hard surfaced. Sometimes during
the wintertime, like this about, you might get some weakness there where the
extra water was there. If you want to make it through that you know, you have to
kind of stop, in some instances get a low gear and just ease through it. Because
if you try to speed through it, you&#039;ll dig down, you&#039;ve just got to move on
through it. And usually you get through it. You kind of learn the different ways
of looking at a piece of roadway in the country too, because you have to know
when this ice--everywhere--even on the freeways here, it&#039;s the same, going up.

WILMOT: When you say the market is changed and you need a new gear, what do you mean?

MARTIN: I mean, I&#039;ve got to revamp right quickly now.

WILMOT: What&#039;s changed?

MARTIN: Oh God, there&#039;s a lot of vacancies.

WILMOT: I know, it&#039;s a renter&#039;s market.

MARTIN: There&#039;s a lot of vacancies, for rent signs everywhere, because you&#039;ve
got to take it serious, because this is history and I&#039;ve lived a long time in
this industry. I told my brother--little nephew the other day, beginning of--mid
of last year, that it&#039;s coming, it&#039;s coming fast. Because he had some land, he
was deciding whether to sell it or build on it. I said, &quot;I don&#039;t know whether
you&#039;ll get caught, which way, because somebody&#039;s going to get caught with all
this inventory.&quot; And all these people here, one of the kids renting from me,
he&#039;s constantly hustling me for a job because he bought a house. He was renting
from me for $1000 a month, he went into a $1,700 a month and then with the
hospital tax for this area and other things, his bill has gone up to about
$2,300. That&#039;s within two years. He&#039;s really hustling at me for work all the
time. He&#039;s a roofer. He&#039;s a good roofer.

WILMOT: When you say it&#039;s coming, what do you mean?

MARTIN: What?

WILMOT: You said, people are going to get caught with that inventory, it&#039;s coming.

MARTIN: Well, they&#039;re caught with it now. I have a big inventory. Other people,
you see &quot;for rent&quot; signs everywhere, that&#039;s inventory. It&#039;s coming, it&#039;s here.
It&#039;s a quick time, I think--I don&#039;t know, I think I need to sell everything. But
then you&#039;ve got to buy, and you don&#039;t have that long a time to wait. I think
you&#039;re going to find a lot of foreclosures.

WILMOT: I found that to be the case.

MARTIN: They&#039;re tired. You start, just like this kid here, if I can ever get
caught up he wouldn&#039;t have the kind of play he has into my company now, where
you can&#039;t get out there you can come here and there&#039;s always something you can
do. And others. All of my good tenants are more or less buying because there&#039;s a
good sign--in one of the papers saying, &quot;Don&#039;t let the landlord take advantage
of you, go buy your own place, the rents are low, go buy.&quot; I thought I was going
to put a picture in the paper and tell them, &quot;foreclosure will soon be coming
in, you better get one of my nicer rentals.&quot; [laughter] I thought I&#039;d fire back.

WILMOT: When you say--

MARTIN: I do think I will do that, that we have plenty of rentals and you can
save maybe $1000 a month, and when these houses, bottom turns up again, you&#039;ll
be able to pick one up. It&#039;s hitting me, so I might as well hit back. [laughter]

WILMOT: I want to ask you a question then, you say it&#039;s time to pick up a new
gear, as you said.

MARTIN: I meant a lower gear, like when you&#039;re driving, and you clutch the car.

WILMOT: So you catch a lower gear right now. You&#039;re not saying a new approach to
this market.

MARTIN: All of that&#039;s in the lower gear. You have to slow back. Like you get
into that muddy place and I have to realize whether to hit it fast and scoot
through it--you have to realize how much of it there is--or if you--that&#039;s kind
of an old trick that you do on the farm, the country roads. But you do it in
realty sort of, it&#039;s just a common way of saying something.

WILMOT: Which I of course dissect. That&#039;s my way. But you know, I want to ask
you a question also. We don&#039;t have very much more time together today.

MARTIN: That&#039;s right, I have these guys.

WILMOT: You&#039;ve got these appointments. One thing I wanted to ask you is about
your church. Then I think I&#039;d love to ask you about your second husband&#039;s--you
know, actually that&#039;s really where I was. We were talking about Mr. Martin and
meeting and becoming partners. The thing I was trying to figure out was what was
his involvement with this--you two together, you were together by the 1960s.

MARTIN: Which one, William Martin?

WILMOT: The second one, yes, Mr. Martin.

MARTIN: We were friends, real close friends, during the 1960s.

WILMOT: Together you actually had an eye on this whole desegregation of the real
estate market?

MARTIN: No, I didn&#039;t even--when he started that in &#039;66, he just did that--you
mean like for him to try to--

WILMOT: Be part of the Contra Costa Real Estate Board.

MARTIN: It didn&#039;t matter to me whether I belonged to that or not because the
stuff I was doing, I wasn&#039;t doing a lot of selling like he was. I&#039;m more
investing. He was selling and had the charisma. He sold his first wife a bunch
of property--just different people.

WILMOT: On your end, you didn&#039;t really encounter issues with discrimination in
the market?

MARTIN: Oh yes, of course I did. For example, if you know where you&#039;re going,
it&#039;s like my early history about--it didn&#039;t seem to matter to me because we
skated on the ice, but you knew where the boundaries--you knew where you go, you
didn&#039;t go to that school up there, you went to this one, and it was fine. We had
a good time at my little school, and my dad, in the winter time, would cook
gingerbread and take it.

WILMOT: [laughter]

MARTIN: And get on this horse and ride over to the school, and I&#039;d look up and
there&#039;d come my dad. We&#039;d be out playing, he&#039;d come right at recess time and
bring this bucket of gingerbread cookies that he would make.

WILMOT: That&#039;s just sweet.

MARTIN: And bring it to the school. All the kids, we&#039;d all run to the horse and
meet Dad to eat these gingerbread--he was just that kind of guy.

WILMOT: I understand.

MARTIN: Because right where he lived then, the police officers, the black ones,
would run in for coffee. You&#039;d see a police car at my dad&#039;s house all the time.
They&#039;d run over and then Daddy would dig bait and the police--

WILMOT: Here in Richmond?

MARTIN: Yes, right over on Twenty-second Street. I&#039;ll show you the house. He had
a big garden full of vegetables, and Mom said he put some insecticides on it and
she wouldn&#039;t eat them. [laughs] But they would be beautiful, people would just
eat them. You&#039;d see an officer there having maybe mostly coffee, with Dad.

WILMOT: What I was trying to ask you when you started talking about the ways in
which it was like your childhood in that discrimination had boundaries, but you
kind of knew what the boundaries were, so they didn&#039;t impact you very much.

MARTIN: You know something, I thought I was just as great as the Cox girl, the
one Daddy would pass their house before he got to our house and say, &quot;Hard
scuffle.&quot; I didn&#039;t think she was any better than me or anything. I didn&#039;t think
she knew any more. She couldn&#039;t skate as--my smart brother could out-skate us
all. Just that&#039;s the way he would come in. I was probably the worst skater. But
we&#039;d be there and we&#039;d all go home and everything was just perfect, no
problems.WILMOT: So when you say when you were here and in the work you did you
encountered discrimination, and you said it just--you started saying it was the
same as when you were young in that when you were a young person in Oklahoma in
that you knew where the boundaries were, and as long as you could see it coming,
it wasn&#039;t that big a deal. Did that make sense?

MARTIN: Discrimination--

WILMOT: In the real estate investing.

MARTIN: Okay, real estate investment. I think about the Oklahoma discrimination
didn&#039;t bother me when I was young and little, I just looked to my home and we
had the same things that they had, we had a tractor--that&#039;s not the ordinary,
where I lived. I&#039;m with the black people and all their struggle, get more angry
than anybody else. I&#039;m just saying, there are certain things in life you don&#039;t
know who you are. It&#039;s like the song &quot;Sweet Little Jesus Boy,&quot; they didn&#039;t know
who you were. But you don&#039;t know, you find out who you are when you get in
masses of people. For example, an entertainer, it&#039;s the same thing. When you&#039;re
an entertainer you think you&#039;re someone. But then somewhere you&#039;ll get the slap,
and say, &quot;Wow, I&#039;m black too.&quot; Somehow you get white or something. Not really
white, but you get to feel like you&#039;re special. That could be me in some of my
situations maybe. Maybe I didn&#039;t think about it, because there it was. It was
just like, there&#039;s a pond, we all go skate there, they go there, I got to school
there, our teachers there, daddies with the ginger bread, little things like
that, and we&#039;re happy. Just as happy as you could be.WILMOT: I understand. Okay,
well let&#039;s talk another time because you have to go.

MARTIN: Yes, I&#039;m sorry too.

WILMOT: I know. I&#039;ll ask you more real estate questions then. The question I was
trying to ask you about has to do with, in the work that you did in Richmond in
the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s, did you deal with racial discrimination in real
estate in that time?

MARTIN: Of course. There is a piece in the newspaper I want to find, even this
property here was a great battle. Some days I wish I never bought it, even to
buy this building I was denied buying it. I had to go around to get the building
and there was a lot of hurt between white and black. In this building I can show
you a door there I had to fight--it&#039;s not long ago, now, twenty-something years
ago--to go through to that big parking lot that government funds were used--they
said I couldn&#039;t buy this because it used to be Elks&#039; building and they didn&#039;t
like blacks. It was written, it was an article just like about my husband,
written in the newspaper because--that lot with the flowers, they denied us that
one where Popeye&#039;s is. We needed parking for this building, no one cared whether
you made it or not. I fought till they let me cut a door. I had to cut this
brick wall and then get ingress egress. The next door owner said we couldn&#039;t
walk the--we couldn&#039;t leave the door open for people to circulate from this
building, four floors high, to go through that building. That door, I&#039;ll let you
touch it so you&#039;ll understand. It ain&#039;t half over. You know what I&#039;m saying?
It&#039;s still there. Although this is sort of changing in a sense, because here you
have all kinds of people in a melting pot of people where it will just be a
selfishness in the heart of some self-survival or something is coming right now.
It&#039;s not whether you&#039;re black white, there&#039;s so many other races that are
feeling the same pinch and I don&#039;t know what is going to happen with the black
and the Spanish trying to melt together here. It&#039;s kind of hard to make gold and
silver go together anyway. Whether you&#039;re Spanish and black, or Spanish and
white, or you&#039;re whatever and then you start your own projects for the Spanish
or white or whatever races. It&#039;s just a rough world. And you know what, I think
it is to be. I think it&#039;s to be that we fight. Well, it&#039;s been since--everything
that I&#039;ve read in the Bible, they&#039;re fighting. Haven&#039;t you found that? David and
his suffering and all these wars and rumors of wars has been laid out.
Fights--like the police and I had a fight this morning.

WILMOT: I remember, you told me.

[Mr. Bynum returns to retrieve Mrs. Martin]

MARTIN: You weren&#039;t in here, you had gone to get the doughnuts.

WILMOT: Okay, I guess you&#039;d better go. Let&#039;s close for today.

MARTIN: Okay, it was interesting because you bring things out of me that I
didn&#039;t really know was there. Start me to thinking, you know? That I hadn&#039;t
thought about too deeply, at all really.

WILMOT: Well, you have a lot to say.
