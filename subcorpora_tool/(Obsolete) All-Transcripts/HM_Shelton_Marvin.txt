Story_ID: 178851
Speaker 1: Sir, I'd like to start out by asking you about your mother.  If you could give her name and talk about what you know about her background and growing up.
Speaker 2: Her name was Mable Butler Lloyd [ph.].  She was born and grew up in Darlington, South Carolina and probably in high school days moved to Wilmington, North Carolina and remained there you know for the rest of her life.  She went to public schools there and went on to attend college at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] and got a teaching certificate, came back to Wilmington, started teaching and met my father, got married, then went to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where I was born and my two older brothers were born.
Speaker 1: What--how--what--how would you describe her as a person?
Speaker 2: Well she was a very dashing, progressive female. She had, well, the first T-model Ford cars that any woman in town had.  She taught school, she played the organ and was a very energetic, on--forward looking person.
Story_ID: 178852
Speaker 1: And your father, can you talk about him?
Speaker 2: Well he grew up in a family of four boys in Terra Haute, Indiana for the most part although he was born in Cleveland, Mississippi and lived for a while in Paducah, Kentucky.  But most of his upbringing was in Terra Haute, Indiana by his mother because his father died relatively young and she raised these three boys and sent them all to college and got them you know, bachelor degrees pretty much by herself.  And he left to teach in Wilmington, North Carolina where he met my mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] and they joined forces at that point.
Speaker 1: Do you--can you describe him as a person also?
Speaker 2: Well he was a very quiet and proper person who had this fine education.  Most of his teachers were white Germans and he loved languages.  He was French major and he loved music.  He sang very well and he always did choir work.  He was a very--well educated and knew the value of education and he and my mother taught us just a tremendous amount of material before we ever went to school.  And he helped us do our homework and you know stressed the importance of taking care of things that were important.  He was a church man, deacon in the Episcopal church, senior warden that is.  My mother played an organ in the church and we grew up as acolytes in the church.  And to help us get well rounded he started a Boy Scout troop and so I came up through the boy scouts as did my other brothers also.  So he was just the consummate family man, always provided us with everything we needed, the car, comfortable home but never made more than probably ten thousand dollars in his life but managed his money through a point where we always had everything we needed.
Story_ID: 178853
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met, I mean at the moment of meeting?  I know where they met but do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: No I don't know the exact circumstances but they were both in the public school system there in Wilmington [North Carolina] so I imagine it was some meeting at the, at a school.
Speaker 1: Now what did--was there a difference of what they taught?  Did your father teach one thing and your mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] another or--?
Speaker 2: No my mother was basically an elementary school teacher but my father was a French and history in high school.
Story_ID: 178854
Speaker 1: And do you--on either side of the family was there a lot known about the history of you know either side, you know beyond your, you know, mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] or father or their grandparents?
Speaker 2: No, not a great deal.  My grandmother lived to be a hundred and we got to know her quite well but unfortunately her husband died, that would be my maternal grandfather, died relatively early.  And they had another tragedy of the house burning down so that when my mother was probably a senior in high school they lost everything in terms of pictures and documents and lot of the history you know, of the family.  So I really don't have any information about my grandmother's parents.  She was not born in slavery but you know she came out of Darlington, South Carolina.  My mother--my grandmother on my father's side was half Cherokee Indian and apparently her family was driven out of North Carolina and found the Trail of Tears in the Mississippi where she married my father or my grandfather who was a Shelton and apparently a successful planter, farmer, had substantial property and water and everything in Mississippi, a little town called Cleveland, and things were going well there.  They had three children including my brother [sic, father] at that point but there was a dispute with the neighbor about the rights to the creek and it ended up in some shots being fired across the creek between my grandfather and this white neighbor, after which he had to leave Mississippi.  And it sort of ended the relative prosperity that they were enjoying at that point.  Then my mother [sic, paternal grandmother] went on to Paducah, Kentucky and he tried to get a job in Chicago [Illinois] and apparently he did work for a while in the steel mill but became ill and died shortly thereafter.  I don't know anything about my grand--paternal grandmother's relatives.  She was a Roberts and the family members now are trying to go back and see what we can dig up in the history recorded around Cleveland, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 178855
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I remember playing with my two older brothers [Lee Raymond Shelton and Thomas Gerard Shelton], the--we lived in a house next door to a Baptist church.  And there was only about six feet between my bedroom window and the walls of the church so I got a lot of early singing and preaching from the Baptist ministry.  I remember you know, the lessons that--and games that I used to play with my mother [Mable Butler Lloyd], tiddlywinks and all of those things that we did, the bicycling and you know going to the first grade.  I went to school quite young.  I was only five I think when I started school in the first grade.  There was no pre-kindergarten or kindergarten in those days.  And I advanced rapidly through school and skipped the eighth grade and ended up finishing high school [at Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] after ten years of education at the age of fifteen.  But it was a nice childhood you know, I had bicycle, roller skates.  The weather in North Carolina was very good since places--the beaches nearby, was a lake nearby, people were very nice and--
Speaker 1: Now, your siblings, can you give their names and your birth order--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --including where you fit?
Speaker 2: The oldest of them is my brother Lee Raymond Shelton who is three years my senior and the second is Thomas Gerard Shelton who is a year and a half older than myself, we all grew up together you know, in the same house and went to the same high schools and actually went to the same colleges also.  They preceded me at--in going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and majoring in pre-med.  But they had to interrupt their education because they literally ran out of money.  We really didn't have--my family didn't have finances to pay outright for the tuition, but in those days it was almost possible to educate yourself if you work part time during the school year and very hard during the summer.  But after a couple of years the, their money ran out basically and in order to continue their education they had to go into the marine corps and spend three years and then come out under the GI Bill and go back to college under the GI Bill.  I came up a little different than them.  I was able to work on a beach which is like ten miles from Wilmington [North Carolina] waiting tables and bell hopping and my mother was working as an insurance salesman, salesperson at that time, got me a job cleaning up the insurance office, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in North Carolina.  So I had a job cleaning up the insurance office, I had a job cleaning up the church, I was shining shoes in the barber shop downtown and on the main street, even when I was twelve and thirteen years old.  And then when I was fifteen I would tell people I was eighteen and I'd get a job doing construction work or trying to do construction work and working on the beach so that when I finished high school, I had two thousand dollars and that was enough money to get me started at Howard with tuition and room and board which was, in those days with little more than five or six hundred dollars a year.  So I never had to go in the service at that time to get through school.
Speaker 1: Your brothers who went into the service did they end up coming back?  I mean--and they were both pre-med but--
Speaker 2: They were both pre-med and they both came back and they finished medical school.  They ended up--they started out ahead of me by three years but we ended up finishing one, two, three in 1955 which is my older brother's year of graduation medical school, I finished in '56 [1956].  And my middle brother who actually had to do two tours, he was in for three years as a volunteer and then there was a call up during the Bay of Pigs [Invasion, 1961], I think it was and he had to go back on active duty for a year so he was out four years and that threw him another year behind but we all finished Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] medicine.
Speaker 1: It's impressive.
Story_ID: 178856
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your you know, the early years and sort of your, you know family life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering if you could sort of describe you know family life.  You were born in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: In Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: And you lived in Pittsburgh how long?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was two or three when the family left Pittsburg because my father waited trying to get a job in the school system which never happened and he decided to return to Wilmington [North Carolina].  Then it was just a matter of getting, you know going to school trying to make good grades.  We all were honor students and spent a lot of time you know preparing for the classes that we were taking.  Let's see, church was a regular activity.  Saturday we helped keep the house you know, looking well and doing whatever odd jobs we could find to you know, to supplement the family income.  We all had training in music to varying degrees of success.  My older brother [Lee Raymond Shelton] was a top notch trumpet player who was good enough to be offered the job with Jimmie Lunceford's band when the band came through Wilmington and he sat in you know just as a side man for a couple of numbers, and went on to pursue his music.  When he went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] he had a band, a jazz band called the Swing Masters during his time at Howard, and continued to play you know, not professionally because my mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] said, you know, "You're not going to be a professional musician, you're going to go to medical school."  So he never, he never did go full time into music but always loved it and would always travel with a mouth piece in his pocket and go up to a band stand at intermission and talk one of the guys into letting him sit in for a couple of numbers.  My little [sic, middle] brother [Thomas Gerard Shelton] played the trumpet also but not to the degree of proficiency that my older brother did.  I played the clarinet and saxophone but it was easy to see that there are some people who have gifts and others who can struggle with it but are never going to be at the same level.  And I was one of those people, I could read music, I could play but adlibbing and soloing which is, which is a sort of an innate talent, I just did not have that so I don't--no longer continue to do anything with music other than listen to it, which is very nice.
Speaker 1: Now, what other stories--well first of all--and you don't really have much memory of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's where you were born.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so two years old and you move to Wilmington [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you--where, did you live on a certain block or street that--what's the--
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in an area, black neighborhood on the north side of town and as I said it was next to a Baptist church but you know, Wilmington is a small town.  You could walk ten blocks and you're in school pretty much and you could walk fifteen blocks and you're in the middle of downtown.  So that's what life was about until I think five years later we found a house, a larger house, a more substantial house you know made out of the gold standard in those days which is brick and it was located right in the heart of Wilmington.  And it was a great house because we had a lot of fun keeping it looking good.  It was probably the best looking house on the block.  It was across from a black doctor who also had a very nice house.  It was a nice neighborhood and that's where we lived and that's--cause we kept the house until my parents died.  My father died at eighty-nine in 1991 and my mother died at eighty--at seventy-six.  She lived in the house until he died and then we kept the house in shape and actually remodeled it and sold it to a niece two years ago who's going to stay there and sort of keep it in the family.
Speaker 1: That's sort of nice keeping in the family--
Story_ID: 178857
Speaker 1: I wanna know, Wilmington [North Carolina], if you take yourself back to possibly that house--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and I want to--what was the address, what is--?
Speaker 2: 810 Rankin Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'd like to have you tell me what sights, smells and/or sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a quiet neighborhood.  It's a--there were not too many children in my block to play with but there were children in blocks within five or six miles that we could go and visit and play in the street or whatever we wanted to do.  The church was not far away.  That's always been a big part of life in Wilmington for our family.  My pastor tried very hard to make a priest out of me but I was fortunate enough to convince him that I didn't really have a calling (laughter) and I went on to do what I wanted to do in medicine.  So the church was large.  We weren't great into athletics because I was so young I really hadn't grown up enough to be large enough to play varsity sports.  I tried out for football but the coach who was a friend of my mother's [Mable Butler Lloyd] made sure that I got a job as the mascot (laughter) rather than on the team because as you know the size of football players out of the south that they're quite large and I was no physical match for that type of competition.  But I managed to play a good bit of tennis which was available in Wilmington although in not a lot of places because there was a private court that we could play on.  We didn't have to play on the public courts which were not open at that point.  But there was a Dr. [Hubert A.] Eaton who is a black history maker.  I don't know whether you've come across his name but he was a prominent civil rights advocate in North Carolina.  But he had a private court and we had access to play there and it was interesting because that was the time that Althea Gibson who was a young girl growing up in Harlem [New York, New York] was discovered by Dr. Eaton and Dr. [Robert Walter] Whirlwind Johnson out of Lynchburg [Virginia].  And they sort of adopted her and brought her to Dr. Eaton's house where she lived and finished school.  So it was the tennis court and then there was this future Wimbledon champion tennis player there as well as several other good tennis players so we had a chance to really get to understand and love the game at that facility.
Story_ID: 178858
Speaker 1: Let me ask you with the Baptist church were you, I mean were you--what were you?  What was your--?
Speaker 2: Episcopal.
Speaker 1: Episcopal, so you were Episcopal, so that's why when you said, you know someone wanted you to be a priest.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me, so you're living in Wilmington [North Carolina].  What is the community like there in Wilmington?  What is the black community like?
Speaker 2: The black community was centered around--the members that I interacted with were mostly in the educational system you know, the other teachers, the principals, the other ministers and the members of my particular church were the major people in that community that I would interact with on a regular basis.  When I became older and I started working on the beach, you would meet the people who were in the service industry you know, who did that kind of work.  But as I say life basically was a matter of school and school related activities during the week, Boy Scouts and games on Saturday and church related activities on Sunday, just on a regular ongoing basis.
Speaker 1: So with your three brothers were you the youngest in sort--
Speaker 2: I was the youngest.
Speaker 1: I know.  But were you treated as the baby of the family?
Speaker 2: Well my mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] always said that even if I was old and bent over on a stick, I was always going to be her baby, but I--it--I really didn't encourage any favoritism and generally would not accept any special treatment from them.  And we were close enough so that it really wasn't that much of a disparity where they would be in a position to be too you know, too much in charge of what I was doing or--cause there was only like three years between us so the--being the baby boy you have a chance to see what happens when you do something wrong and avoid that.  There are some you know natural advantages.  Some people have accused my mother of favoring me over the rest of them but I really don't think she did.  I think they all treated us equally.
Story_ID: 178859
Speaker 1: With schools, where did you go to school?  What about elementary school?
Speaker 2: Okay, there's a school called Peabody Elementary School [Wilmington, North Carolina] which was just five or ten blocks from home where we attended for the first six years I guess.  And then the Williston Industrial High School [Wilmington, North Carolina] included junior high and that was on the other side of town in the other direction and that's where you would go to after finishing Peabody.  As I said, that was an eleventh grade school, did not offer a twelfth year and--but they had an excellent faculty and I must say that the education that I received I thought was more than adequate and better than most particularly in the south.  It didn't quite compare with some of the northern cities like [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High [School] in Washington, D.C. and a few other schools in larger cities but I thought that the teachers there did you know, an excellent job of trying to prepare us to go out into the world and compete.
Speaker 1: So both schools were primarily black schools with--
Speaker 2: They were a hundred percent black.
Speaker 1: All--hundred, and a hundred percent black teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just in counter-distinction of my father's education which was in Terra Haute, Indiana where the faculty was predominantly white.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, he talked about it.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And he showed us the books that he studied from but he didn't make any comparisons between those teachers versus you know the teachers that we were experiencing.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Mable Butler Lloyd], was she teaching in the same school, in your elementary school or not?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: She wasn't?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At that time she decided that she would be better off not teaching so she ran a WPA [Works progress Administration] sewing school.  I don't know whether you're familiar but there was time when they had a sewing center where young black women would go and learn how to sew and she was an excellent seamstress so she operated that for a number of years.  And then she sold insurance for North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company and then she went back into the school system later on in her career and she finished up in the school system.  At that point she was teaching primarily special education.
Story_ID: 178821
Speaker 1: So when you're in elementary school [at Peabody Elementary School, Wilmington, North Carolina] are there any teachers that you particularly take to or that take to you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was--I liked all my teachers.  I can't think of anybody that I really disliked and I think they, I think my teachers liked me because I was trying to do what they wanted me to do.  And there was an English teacher who was very good that I, you know, can still remember.  I can still remember my first, second, third grade teachers, they all were really very nice to me and, and many of them went to the same church that I went to.  They were friends of my mother's [Mable Butler Lloyd] and it--you know, the   educational experience there was very, very positive.  And the people were working very hard to try to educate us to the best of their ability you know, using all of the resources that they had.
Speaker 1: Do you remember studying or you know, Negro history week or day?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I remember certain aspects of Negro history but the curriculum didn't really favor Negro history in those days, not nearly to the extent that it might today.  And my father who was a history major was not really into you know, Black history but rather the broad European you know, early American history point of view.
Speaker 1: Now, when you are in school, are you showing any particular interest in math and science versus you know, the language arts, English and reading, or are all they all the same?
Speaker 2: Well I was an honors student and then I finished the second in my class [at Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] and had pretty much a straight A average in everything.  So I had clearly, I think personally I probably always favored science in terms of preference and I think that my grades always were better, a little better in that than say math.  My brother, my middle brother [Thomas Gerard Shelton] on the other hand was a terrific math person who would actually tutor me when I got ready to take a test because he knew all of the answers and I didn't.   And still you know, was probably--could easily have been a very successful physicist had he not chosen to go into medicine.  But all the subjects were relatively easy to master and, but I thought--I did find that I did better with a little less effort in science than in any other field and I always advise people who were trying to figure out what they want to do to take that into consideration.  You want to not necessarily end up trying to do what you dream would be nice or what someone else is doing but rather what you really like and most important what you like is relatively easy for you to do so you can accomplish something without too much work.  At least when you do work you're going to get some results versus a field where you, you can struggle and never really quite become competitive you know, in the market place.
Story_ID: 178822
Speaker 1: Now, with--what is the young [HM] Dr. [Marvin] Shelton like?  What are you--are you quiet and shy?  Is that--cause you said your father was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --more of a quiet person.  Are you introspective?  Do you--?
Speaker 2: No I'm, when I'm fin--when I finished high school [at Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] I was fifteen going on sixteen years old and I was transported from Wilmington, North Carolina to Washington, D.C., and was really very excited about campus life and meeting girls and joining fraternities and doing all the things that people are still doing you know, to enjoy college life.   And I was very active in you know intramural sports.  I was still a little undersized to do anything varsity wise in sports but I enjoyed sports and fraternity life and was Omega [Psi Phi chapter of the Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, or the Boule] because my father was an Omega and that always opens up a lot of activities.  We did a lot of singing in those days and studying, probably a little too much partying but that was all part of Washington, D.C. and Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So you--did you know 'cause your--first of all with your brothers [Lee Raymond Shelton and Thomas Gerard Shelton]--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --did the teachers in high school make any comparison between you and your brothers?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I had to be very careful otherwise I would be accused falling short of the Shelton standard which they had set because they too were very bright students who could score you know, in the highest percentile on any type of exam.  So I always had to meet that standard and they would be quick to let me know if they thought I wasn't quite living up to what they would expect of me.
Speaker 1: And you didn't feel undue pressure with that?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  I mean it's--I think that that's something that you can turn to your advantage if someone points out your short comings, maybe to a degree which isn't called for but it's you know, no one is perfect and you can always point out things that you know, could have been done better.  I think you can turn that into your advantage because if you--if they don't do that then you can continue to make the same mistakes without even knowing that you're at--that it's happening to you.  So I think I used that to make myself better and didn't become intimidated you know, because of it.
Story_ID: 178823
Speaker 1: And when you graduate [from Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina], when it's time for you to graduate, do you know where you're going to college and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I dreamed of going to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] but Duke was not available to blacks in 1947, so I also knew that my brothers were already at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] so that was the school that I really pointed to realistically.
Speaker 1: Now, why--what did you know about Duke at that point?  Had you--because of the campus?  I mean what made you wanting, want, wanting to go to Duke?
Speaker 2: Well that was the top school in my state, it was close to home.  You know, I could have come home on the weekends which you know was not possible in Washington [D.C.] which was three hundred and sixty five miles away.
Speaker 1: And so you--your brothers [Lee Raymond Shelton and Thomas Gerard Shelton] are they at Howard when you arrive?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or, they, they've had to go into the--
Speaker 2: They--(shaking head yes).
Speaker 1: --into the service--but did they start actually Howard or did they--?
Speaker 2: Yes, they started Howard.  But--
Speaker 1: And they were each there what period of time?
Speaker 2: Well, they were a year apart so they were there--see, my oldest brother [Lee Raymond Shelton] finished in '44 [1944] and my oldest--my second brother [Thomas Gerard Shelton] finished in '45 [1945], and I finished in '47 [1947].  This is in high school [Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina] so they were there until '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: And, so that's basically two--one was two, two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, two years okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And one was one year.
Speaker 1: And one was one year.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you on the other hand with your mother's [Mable Butler Lloyd] help or whatever, your parents' help, you were working and working and working--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to save money?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: To stockpile it to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --to make sure that you can go on?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you have a goal of two thousand dollars in mind when you start?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I just made what was available you know, whatever job that I could find I would take it and I didn't have to spend it on anything.  I could put it all in the bank and that's what the stockpile was you know when I, in 1947 when I left Wilmington [North Carolina].
Story_ID: 178824
Speaker 1: And, and so when you left and you're going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], you're going to, not to unfamiliar territory--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because your brothers [Lee Raymond Shelton and Thomas Gerard Shelton] are there.
Speaker 2: And a lot of the students who were there with them remembered me and there are people now who were there that were in my older brother's class who like adopted me as the, as the mascot so to speak and you know, helped and made sure that everything I needed to know and do, they would get me through.
Speaker 1: So, but in many ways Howard, whether you know, you knew it through your brothers is opening up a world?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: It's fun.  You know, it's not small like the environment you've been in, in Wilmington, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so are--you declare pre-med immediately?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so can you talk about your experience in Howard and you know, some of the, you know the teachers and some of the other you know, people who were in your class?
Speaker 2: Well it was an exciting experience because for the first time I'm meeting and interacting with people from literally all over the world.  There was a large number of students from the Caribbean and from Africa as well as many other countries and all of the states in the union.  My freshman roommate was [HM the Honorable] Andrew Young from Atlanta [Georgia].  Classmates like [HM the Honorable] David [N.] Dinkins were there.  And we lived in the dorm and did all the things that boys do in the dorm.  The teachers were interesting because there were so many students that they literally had more students than they had classrooms or seats.  So they--the mood of the faculty was to consider students as pretty dispensable so that if they set an exam and 30 percent of the students didn't pass it they would just flunk them.  And it used to be a standard and indoctrination when you go in a class they would tell you to look to the left and to the right because at the end of the second semester, half of you know, one of them wouldn't be there.  And so it was a big joke when they would punch people out of college, say you'll, you look around and the bags would be--folks would be coming out of the dormitory you know in March at the end of the second semester.  It's sort of a joke.  You know, you didn't get to see the grass grow green.  So I really wasn't thrilled with the teaching approach and attitude at Howard at that time on the part of most of the faculty.  I thought they were rather indifferent.  Very little tutoring went on or counseling about you know, what the children ought to be doing because there were just so many students and so little organization.  But there were a lot of bright children, a lot of bright students there who you know could master any system (laughter) and that, that basically was what--is what was happening at Howard at that time.   They just had this tremendous number of bright students from all over the country and most of us you know, could find a way to get through.

Speaker 1: And [HM] Dr. [Marvin] Shelton, you were also saying that there were people--I think this is correct, that there were people from the war [World War II, WWII], you know veterans?
Speaker 2: The veterans.  The veterans came back in '47 [1947].  Yeah, this is when the onslaught, '46 [1946], '47 [1947].  And that they would--they were very interesting because they were all getting money for tuition and they would also get a check so, it was some merry times when the veteran's checks came in at the end of the month and lot of opportunities to do some enjoyable things, most of which didn't contribute to our academic progress but it was a part of life.
Speaker 1: Well it's also the, you know college is a growing process--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --too, and a time to sort of be on your own.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now the--you said [HM the Honorable Andrew] Andy Young was your--
Speaker 2: Roommate.
Speaker 1: --roommate.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And so, did you spend--did you get to know him much--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --during that year?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the young, Andy Young?
Speaker 2: Well he was a very quiet and almost as young as I was because as I mentioned, I was only fifteen.  He may have been a few months older than I was but not very much.  He was out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and he was athletic and he ran track and he was very, very religious.  I didn't know it at that time but as you know he ended up going to divinity school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he would not participate in a lot of the antics that the rest of us were doing but he was a nice well rounded guy.  I had him for a roommate for a year.
Speaker 1: And would you, the two of you talk about what you were interested in doing and your career?  You know would you share that type of thing or--'cause both of you are quiet?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well I, I think that at one time Andy was pre-med as I was and many of the other students were, but I think he went to a camp and literally was converted to go into the ministry, you know as a result of the experience that he had over the summer at a camp.  So our interests sort of diverted at that point 'cause I continued you know, to try to get into medical school [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 178826
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the professors that were there [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] you know, during your undergraduate years that taught you?  And were you--did you clear pre-med immediately when you came on campus or was that--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I declared pre-med and took you know, the required science courses.  There was a very good chemistry teacher named Ferguson [ph.] that everyone had to go to his class.  There was like over a hundred people trying to get this organic chemistry under our belt.  It was a struggle to get through and a lot of people are not doctors today because they couldn't pass that particular course.  Yeah, but there were some highlights there.  Sterling Brown was an English professor there.  There was a great philosopher there.  Alain [LeRoy] Locke was there.  The Howard Players were there.  They're--that's the theatrical company that Dr. [Anne] Cook founded and so they were quite important and I tried to do something with them in the theatrical line.  Those are the ones that I most remember but obviously there were a lot of other teachers.  But I, as I said my experience early on was that if you're going to make it, you're going to have to learn how to find out the book that the teacher is using and get it and read it with understanding because you're not going to be able to depend on your notes from any lecture to really get you through totally.  That most of the coursework is just not that well covered and if you don't know how to get into the book and read it and come out with the answer, you sort of--you need to go to class and you need to get the way the teacher is thinking and what they think is important so you can pick out because you can't memorize a whole book.  But you really have to depend on the library and your ability to read and sort out the material so that you can--so that's more related to, it's not teacher related in terms of what you're trying to do and what you expect.
Story_ID: 178827
Speaker 1: Well, do you think it was that philosophy that helped you be successful because you're saying that it was not enough to just be taught, that you were also an active part in teaching yourself or in the learning process?
Speaker 2: Well I think that was the approach that my parents gave me, that don't expect to be spoon fed.  You want to be taught how to learn yourself and that's what you know the teachers I think best can do for a student and that's what they did for me I think.
Speaker 1: Do you--did--with that philosophy, did you ever run into any conflicts with any teachers who, you know might--that you may--you know, cause in some cases a student could know a little bit more than their teacher if they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had a lazy teacher.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's why you don't do a lot of talking in class.  You listen, try to find out what they are trying to teach you, the way they think and then come up with the answer that they're looking for on the test but not get into any debates about philosophy and who's right and that sort of thing cause I'm working in a field of mathematics which--field of science which is more exact than some of the other fields which I think could be a problem if we were talking about English and you know, we're dealing with an essay or a subject that you know I have to be creative about how I interpret as you know, a certain thing.  But in science that doesn't really come up.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any teachers that were your favorite teachers during that--you know I know you mentioned you know, people that were sort of well, Sterling, you know Sterling Brown and Alain Locke and--but were there any people that, or any courses that you particularly enjoyed or found challenging or--?
Speaker 2: There was a teacher, Handsbury [ph.], he was a Ph.D. in embryology and he was quite, quite good.  He was not only well educated but he could draw beautifully and illustrate you know the embryo and all the aspects of the course that he was trying to teach with the chalk in his hand which was a talent that I greatly admired and I, you know, I'll always remember him.  In medical school there were some outstanding teachers.  [Dr. William] Montague Cobb was a terrific anatomist and I enjoyed his course a great deal.  There was a newer surgeon there name [Dr.] Moses [Wharton] Young who also was a brilliant guy.  A physiologist who sort of adopted me in a way and took me into his laboratory and got me started in, really in the basic science part of medicine named Hawthorne, Edward Hawthorne.  He also got me into golf because in the summer after a day of work in the lab he would say, "Well let's relax and go out and have you know, some sport."  So we'd go to the golf course and the--in Washington [D.C.] there's a course that's still open called Langston. It was nine holes at that time but we would go out there and I had an opportunity to learn how to play the game which I still enjoy today.  There was also a pharmacologist named Walter Booker who gave me the opportunity to work on research in his lab several summers and who had a tremendous understanding of how the body reacts to drugs and allowed me to really get a basic science background which has always been invaluable in medicine knowing the chemistry behind how the body works and health and disease and how it reacts to medications.
Story_ID: 178828
Speaker 1: So, you found that you really had sort of a natural proclivity, a natural ability in this area?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay and, but just a little bit on undergraduate.  So you graduate [from Howard University, Washington, D.C.] as a chemistry major--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?  And were you--did you choose--did you declare that major, in what year?  In your--?
Speaker 2: I declared that in my, at the end of my second year.  I declared chemistry major but my undergraduate education was average at best.  I think I had a B minus average and my older brother who was in the class with me at that time was an honor student, like Cum Laude, okay?  So we both applied in medical school and the dean looked at these applications apparently and says, "We're not going to take the one Shelton this year," and so I didn't get into medical school my first year, you know.  I got this sad letter about, sorry but there's no spot for you, okay.   So I was very hurt but I knew that I had not really tried that hard to you know, to compete and so I had two problems to face.  One was the Korean War was in full bloom at that point and I was a 1A [ph.] and not getting into medical school.  I'm looking at going into the Army because that was the only valid deferment that one could look forward to.  But I had joined ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] during my senior year and I was fortunate that I was allowed to do that because ordinarily you start at the end of, at the beginning of the third year so that you can get a second lieutenant commission at the end of your fourth year.  But the commander, PMS and T [Professor of Military Science and Tactics], named Smith [ph.], Colonel Smith heard my story and he says, "Okay we're going to allow you to enter the program."  So when I finished school and I didn't have an appointment in the medical school, I was in ROTC.  So that summer I went to Fort Meade, Maryland and trained as an infantry lieutenant and continued the ROTC in graduate school in chemistry for that following year and I reapplied to Howard that year and was accepted.  And I also received my commission as a second lieutenant in the infantry.  So during medical school I'm a reservist in this, in the infantry and would have been in Korea with a number of my fellow students, some of whom didn't come out of Korea except for the fact that I was in medical school. So when they offered this program during my last year of medical school where you would join the army and they would put you on active duty I, I wanted to do that.  I said to, it was to my advantage because up until that point I had to work to pay my tuition.  I would--we had an opportunity to come up to a guest house in Massachusetts with a number of medical students.  We would staff the place called Blantyre and it's still a very well known castle near--in--near Tanglewood, in a little town called Lenox, Mass [Massachusetts] in the Berkshires.  We would run the place for the owner, you know doing the bartending and bell hopping and waiting.  And we could make two thousand dollars in about six weeks and the tuition was eight hundred and fifty dollars, so there was money for tuition and a little shopping for clothes in New York [New York] on the way back to Washington [D.C.] from Massachusetts.  And you could work at the post office during Christmas and sort mail, could make three, four hundred dollars during the Christmas holidays.  You could work and wait tables at the [U.S.] Army and [U.S.] Navy Club on Saturday, so that was the way I was financing my, you know, my education in medical school.  But there was a price to pay because to go to medical school and try to get good grades and work means you don't get a lot of sleep.  So when I got this [U.S.] Army commission situation, it gave me an opportunity to quit my job as a bartender (laughter)--

Speaker 1: [HM Dr.] Charles [H.] Epps [Jr.] and [HM Dr.] Roselyn [Payne] Epps.  Charles is an orthopedic surgeon like myself.  Roselyn is a pediatrician, Clarence [McClane] Pendleton [Jr.] who is a prominent Republican in the, I think its Nixon administration [sic, President Ronald Reagan administration], [HM] Vernon Jordan.  And I think I mentioned [HM] David [N.] Dinkins, Morris--Toni Morrison was there, the authoress.  There are probably a lot of other people that I should remember but I don't right at this moment.
Speaker 2: But what is clear is that Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] had a classy faculty.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And they were all, they were as you said a little strict given the times and you had a lot of people there and it was whether you make it or not it's up to you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you know we're going to take a hard line approach.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: And you said that was a little unsettling because really you had sort of come out of a nurturing environment, right, at school, I mean in--?
Speaker 1: Well it, it didn't really bother me particularly.  I thought it was cruel.  I thought it was a waste of talent to have people struggle you know like myself, get--go on campus you know, looking forward to really a chance to get ahead in life and get turned around you know, on a system which was imperfect to say the least.
Story_ID: 177329
Speaker 1: Now the one thing I didn't ask you about with high school [at Williston Industrial High School, Wilmington, North Carolina], you graduated salu--
Speaker 2: Salutatorian.
Speaker 1: Salutatorian.  And can you--was there a competition or were you clearly the, sort of the top of your class?
Speaker 2: Well there was a, I think, a bit of a divide between you know the top people and the rest of the class although not a huge difference.  But the fellow who ended up valedictorian was really a remarkable case because he had polio as a child and he basically you know had lonely braces on and had a lot of difficulty getting around.  And unfortunately, didn't live too many years after high school because of health reasons you know.  But you know I had the advant--had just the, a lot of advantages that the other children did not have.  And that I had two parents who were teachers and who were, you know devoted to giving their boys a good chance in life to do, you know as much as they could with the talent that they had.  And that's an unusual situation even today, you don't find too many families where both parents are there and devoted to you know a single goal, having given up basically anything that they may have aspired to do personally just to give us the best shot that we can get.
Speaker 1: That's true.  That is true.  So that's why I'm saying part of, you know you had a nurturing environment.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know not, I'm not saying babying--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know 'cause your parents had high expectations and I would assume the teachers--
Story_ID: 177330
Speaker 1: Now back--so you go into the service.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you said you were in the service for--
Speaker 2: Nine years.
Speaker 1: --nine years which is a long time--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you think about it.  Now when you went in, you, did, had you intended to be gone that long?
Speaker 2: No.  Actually I had--I knew that I was obligated to be in for at least two years and I went in as an intern.  And since I had the benefit of a year on salary as a lieutenant and they paid my tuition, I owed them a year of active duty for that year which would have given me a two year stint in the [U.S.] military, understand, the understanding that the internship would not be counted as a duty year because basically you're in training.  At that time the internship was very, very prized because there were only two or three places you could go for an internship out of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in 1956.  You could go to Freedman's Hospital [later Howard University Hospital] in Washington [D.C.], you could go to Harlem Hospital [Center] in New York [New York], you could go to Philadelphia General [Hospital] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], could go to Homer G. Phillips [Hospital] in St. Louis [Missouri] and you could go to Kate Bitting [Reynolds Memorial Hospital] in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] which is no longer open.  The highest salary you would get would be fifty dollars a month and you worked literally all day every day, okay.  The military, you're a second lieutenant, so you're getting several hundred dollars a month, plus if you have a dependent you have quarters, you have, you know all kind of--so it's a tremendous difference between you know the life of an intern in the military versus the life of an intern in civilian life and that was true not only for blacks but for whites.  But when I got in the internship I had to spend another year and I wanted to be a specialist.  Actually I wanted to be a neurosurgeon and so I interviewed and applied for neurosurgery and I was accepted at Walter Reed [national Military Medical Center, later Walter Reed General Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland] to start neurosurgery after my internship which would have been 1957.  But part of the process is you have to go before a board of regular [U.S.] Army officers because at that time, I'm in the reserve.  But in order to be in a residency program you have to be in the regular Army.  In order to be in the regular Army you have to go before a board of regular Army officers who interview you.  This turned out to be a barrier that I could not overcome because I was asked some questions which had obvious racial overtones about how I would feel about being called upon to take care of a white woman who was pregnant and she refused to let me deliver her because I was black.  And I think the answer that I had given was not what he was looking for.  So I ended up being turned down for regular Army which meant that at the end of my internship I couldn't go to Washington which was my original plan and start my neurosurgery but I had to wait.  I was reassured by other people on the post that this was an aberration, that this is a racist incident that they apologized for enormously and it wouldn't happen again.  All I had to do was reapply--
Story_ID: 177331
Speaker 1: But in the meantime I had no job for you know, for that year so I started working in orthopedics as a duty officer because while I was interning I had an opportunity to scrub on an orthopedic case.  I thought I was very interesting to deal with the kinds of injuries that this fella had.  And they also found out that I had probably some talent because I recall a surgeon who was in charge of the case who happened to be a lieutenant colonel and he was trying to figure out how to apply a plate to a bone that was broken and place some screws in such a fashion that the ends of the bone could slide together rather than be held apart.  And he was consistently trying to put the screw at the wrong end of the slot (laughter) and I was, you know, finally able to convince that you if this is going to work the way the author has designed it then we had to put the screw at the other end.  So I figured that maybe orthopedics would be a field that I could enjoy and have some success in.  So when they offered me a residency in orthopedics I decided that I was just going to forego that foray into neurosurgery and I stayed on at that same hospital for another four years as a resident in orthopedics.  It also allowed me to--they gave me credit for that year in between the internship and when the program was approved toward my residency.  I worked--see, if I had not done that then I--that would have been a lost year and I would have had to start again in neurosurgery without the benefit of that year.  Whereas going into orthopedics, I didn't lose any time and you know ended up finishing my residency after five years and five years out of medical school.  And all that happened in Hawaii.  I got married the--a few days after graduating from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and traveled to Hawaii with my new wife [Arden Buckner].  And while there we found that the weather and everything was just perfect so we had three children and enjoyed you know the beauty and the environment of Hawaii which was multi-racial, not many black people but a lot of people from the islands and Japan and Saipan.  The hospital was a general hospital that served the entire Far East so we actually took care of all the casualties, the--everywhere from Japan down through the Philippines and then on to the Vietnam area.  And it afforded me just a tremendous opportunity to become expert in the management of injuries of all sorts and taking care of all the things that happen to young people either in the course of [U.S.] military life or the activities that they participate in, you know, off duty.
Story_ID: 177332
Speaker 1: Now I want to ask a question and I think what has to do with maybe the change of medical educate--I mean education of doctors.  Because you were pre-med and then you went into the service but you were interning and doing things as if you had gone through this, you know the time in medical school.
Speaker 2: Well I did.  Maybe I skipped that in my description of the activities but when I went to Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] initially in 1947, I'm pre-med.  And I graduated in 1951, which is four years later.  Then I went to medical school [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in 1952, finished in '56 [1956].  I'm an M.D. and I'm--in senior year in medical school I enter the [U.S.] Army and then continue on as an Army officer as an intern at Tripler [Army Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii] and four more years as a resident.
Speaker 1: Okay, that makes sense.  Okay, cause you went--okay.  Now let me, can I ask about just who--you've talked some about medical school but was there any hesitation on your part in terms of whether this was the career for you when you got there?
Speaker 2: No, actually I was reassured early on that the dean's decision not to take me the year before was his mistake and I proceeded to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --be the number one student from the first year all the way through medical school.
Speaker 1: Now was your brother there that year, the one who had gotten--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was there?  So you both were there together, he as a second year and you as a first year?
Speaker 2: (Shaking head yes).
Speaker 1: But then--
Speaker 2: Right, and then my--my youngest, my middle brother [Thomas Gerard Shelton] joined me the following year so we--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: After the, the--okay.  Okay, that's what I want.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now--I knew that, so that--okay.  So when you--just describe you had started to mention some of the teachers and things like that, you mentioned your anatomy--you know you were talking about some people who were you know quite brilliant.  But your class, you know just talk about the education you got there and why you even chose you know to--had you chosen at this point to do orthopedics?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no the orthope--
Speaker 1: No.  That wasn't until the service?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  I just want--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 177333
Speaker 1: No actually in medical school [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] everything was great.  You know I received first prizes in surgery and medicine and OBGYN [Obstetrics and Gynecology] and pediatrics.  The only subject I really didn't like was psychiatry.  But I really didn't have any--I guess I favored surgery because the most outstanding factually in the clinical side were surgeons.  They were people like Burke [Mickey] Syphax and Jack [E.] White and Clarence Henry [sic, Clarence Sumner Greene, Sr.] who was a neurosurgeon there.  Those were the, you know some of the giants so to speak in medical school.  But I really hadn't decided exactly what I wanted to do.  I said neurosurgery primarily because they weren't--there was maybe one black neurosurgeon in the world at that point.  That was Henry--Clarence Henry, yeah, who had been trained at McGill [University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada].  So you know the idea of going into a field that was relatively unavailable before had a lot of attraction.  Well it so happened that orthopedics was attractive for the same reason because it was only--there were only five orthopedic surgeons, black orthopedic surgeons in the country in the time, you know at the time that I finished and took my board examinations along with [HM] Dr. [Charles H.] Epps [Jr.].  So it was a chance to do something that really needed to be done but hadn't been done before.
Story_ID: 177334
Speaker 1: And you were there, like, when you first saw your first cadaver, no effect on you, no--?
Speaker 2: I did not have any queams [ph.] in my stomach as I've heard described by a lot of people.  I--you know you go through the rabbit dissection and the frog dissection in undergraduate school [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I was fascinated by the human body and you know the smell or formaldehyde or whatever.  It was never a problem that I had to deal with.  Anatomy was my best subject.
Speaker 1: And why did you like that subject so much?  Was it the professor or was it just the--?
Speaker 2: Well it--the professor [Dr. William Montague Cobb] was a great lecturer.  He was an anthropologist and he just really--he was a great speaker and would relate the anatomy to history as anthropologists can really do and made it very interesting above what was in the book that you had to memorize.  It was interesting where he could really get you enthusiastic about the subject talking about something related but not what they were going to ask you on the exam like which is the nerve that goes to this part.  But it, you know he got you to the point where you enjoy studying and you have to do this on your own anyhow.  Anatomy is a field that you have to learn it almost three times before you can say you really know it and you can call upon it at any time of day or night to help you out.
Speaker 1: And how--there seems that you learned in medical school or in you know your anatomy class--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that stood, have helped you from this you know from that time in medical school to this--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --cause there are a lot of things besides the technical knowledge about being a good you know doctor and I would assume then you know, I would assume a proficiency in anatomy would help though there are other things that you know play a role, right--?
Speaker 2: Well for a surgeon the, you know not only does it help but it's absolutely essential.  You just cannot repair something that you don't know what it's supposed to be like you know in pristine condition.  So for a surgeon you know it's really important that you really love anatomy and understand it and use it appropriately.  There are other fields where it really doesn't matter that much and it's interesting today that the anatomy is really not taught the way it was in those, in the days that I came along which it was a year long course.  And now they've shortened the time by at least almost 75 percent.  And that you know, that's--creates a different type of doctor who, you know is going to rely on laboratory tests, images of various sorts and x-rays and MRIs [Magnetic Resonance Imaging] and doesn't really work at it from the way that we were taught to work with based on anatomy.
Speaker 1: But when you said he had you know a background in history and anthropology, what was the connection between anthropology and anatomy that you know some things that he would bring out?  'Cause it, 'cause you know anthropologists would say all, you know all men are sort of the same.  I mean that wasn't always the prevailing sort of belief--
Speaker 2: Well he would talk about the skull and the meaning of the various ridges of the skull and how they related to society.  And you know I can't think of too many exact--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --references that he would make but you know I don't even know whether there's anyone around today you know lecturing from the--from his perspective as a--have a Ph.D. in anthropology from University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] plus--and you know an M.D. with an interest in anatomy.
Speaker 1: And his name again was--?
Speaker 2: [Dr. William] Montague Cobb.
Speaker 1: That's right, Montague Cobb, that's a--
Speaker 2: He's a very--
Speaker 1: He was a legend, right?
Speaker 2: In his own time, yes.
Speaker 1: Did he nurture you separate and apart from--did he see something in you to want to sort of nurture you along?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: He was a reserve man, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, he was quiet and he knew who I was but I got more nurturing from his assistant who was a female Ph.D. named Ruth Lloyd who really didn't do the major lecturing but sort of supervised the dissection of the cadaver on a daily basis.  You know she would be the person that walked through the lab and answered any questions that you might have about the dissection.  I got a lot of nurturing from her.  She was very fond of me, so--but the man who you know would stand up in front of all the classes at least once or twice a week would be Cobb with his very fascinating lectures.
Story_ID: 177335
Speaker 1: And how did you do in medical school [at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] academic--you know because--how did you do then?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Well I was the number one medical student in my--
Speaker 1: In the class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the president of the honor society.
Speaker 1: So you--that's why you said you had proven them wrong?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: They almost lost you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had--well, I wasn't going--
Speaker 1: No, I--
Speaker 2: Where can I go?  You can say that you know, where are you going to go, you know?  In these days they wouldn't do that because if--one who says no to a good candidate, they know they're going to go down the street to this other competing program and show up him.  But in those days they knew that it's either Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or you're not going to be a doctor.  So--
Speaker 1: That's right.  Had you ever thought of Meharry? No.
Speaker 2: I did and I, I'm not sure that I completed my application to Meharry or not.  But I think I was ready to use Meharry as a backup.  But--and I would have gone in a heartbeat to Meharry but you know that's another thousand miles from home.  So--
Story_ID: 177336
Speaker 1: Now in the service, okay, 'cause you joined the [U.S.] Army right?  And you, you know you were talking about this whole thing of being in the reserve and then you know being lieutenant.  You made the rank of major.
Speaker 2: Major, yeah.
Speaker 1: That, that's a pretty high rank.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you find any resistance besides, you said there were a couple of times that you were tested and that one instance, what was the question they wanted you to answer and what was the question that you answered?
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: They asked me how I would feel if I refuse--if a white lady--
Speaker 2: Okay, can we start again?  Okay.
Speaker 1: I was asked how would I react to a white patient who refused to allow me to deliver her because I was black?  And I said that you know it basically would not bother me.  I mean I would understand that this is her prerogative to choose whatever or whoever doctor she wanted to you know in society today.  But you know deep down inside I would think that it would be her loss rather than mine if she didn't let me serve her.  And that was apparently not the right answer.
Speaker 2: So do you think they answer they wanted you to say was what?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: That you would have abided by her request?
Speaker 1: No, I think they didn't want me to be--to have the job and they knew that you know, it was up to them to approve me you know otherwise my career would literally be halted.  And those kinds of people, there is no right answer, okay, because they're going to, you know they're going to say, "Ah, that's not what he should have said," you know.  If he says something else they say oh, still--you know, "There is no right answer."
Story_ID: 177337
Speaker 1: But Dr. Shelton the way I under--I hear you is that the service actually being in the [U.S.] Army, actually worked to your benefit because of the types of cases that you, you know you saw and maybe being--is--am I correct or I'm--?
Speaker 2: Well it's two ways (unclear).  One is I'm in an environment with a very elite group of doctors.  The intern group were all like myself, we were top medical students and enlisted into this program which is a competitive thing from all over the country.  The staff was hundred percent white, nurses and doctors.  So your training was superb in terms of good medicine.  There were no constraints about who could pay and who couldn't pay and you know ward service and private service.  It was all just a perfectly neutral kind of environment.  And basically the Army was better than most places because they integrated you know due to [President Harry S.] Truman relatively early.  And there weren't any orthopedic residencies available for black medical students in those days. Nowhere, in an approved program.  The five people who managed to get certified before me were just lucky in that some program, some liberal adopted them and put them into the program and got them through.  But it would not be a competitive thing where you could fill out an application and send it around to, you know schools.  So just to be able to get into a program was because I was in the military which was integrated, which tried to be fair in their evaluation of Africans.  And would have proceeded without a hitch except that this regular Army procedure requirement is outside of the general, really almost outside the surgeon general in terms of who's running it.  These are regular Army guys who don't even have to be doctors but they're the ones that have to certify that you "are a good regular Army person", whatever that means and that's where the system went badly for me.  But other than that the system worked very much to my advantage in that I got the residency which was almost impossible to get anywhere else.  It was a top residency.  I was assigned the chief of orthopedic surgery immediately after finishing the residency at Fort Jackson, [Columbia] South Carolina which was a very nice post.  It happened to be near Wilmington [North Carolina] where I really needed to be at that time.  I had three children and a family that I hadn't seen for five years.  So all in all it was a good experience in the military you know for me.
Story_ID: 177571
Speaker 1: They were deploying a lot of troops to Korea but in actually they were like overnight in Korea and then go down to Vietnam.  He said that if I re-upped because my natural tour of duty was coming to an end, that if I would re-up and accept these orders that he would take my family and, send them anywhere I wanted them to be to wait for me to come back from Korea.  And he said, you know, your--
Speaker 2: Korea or Vietnam?
Speaker 1: Coming back from--
Speaker 2: From--
Speaker 1: --Korea.
Speaker 2: --Korea, okay.
Speaker 1: That was where the orders were but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but in actuality--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you would end up in Korea--in Vietnam.  And he said that they would put them anywhere you might like to serve next and give them housing and everything.  And, "We think you have great potential.  You're probably going to be the first black surgeon general.  All you have to do is stay in."  But I mean despite the slight temptation, the idea of leaving a wife and three children and going off to a combat zone had literally no appeal at that time.  And I respectfully declined his offer to continue.  And also I remember something the nurse told me at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] when I graduated and she found out that I was going into the [U.S.] military.  She said, "Well we'll see you in about twenty years.  You will be old and dumb." (Laughter)  And I thought about that because although the military is nice, there is a level of practice and expertise which is higher than most places but it's not the most elite group of medical people in the country.  They're not on par an academic major institution you know in terms of the quality of the faculty and the type of procedures that you get a chance to do.  So you know it's sort of a dead end street.  Also, the problem is that you can have a great tour of duty as I did after my training as chief at Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina], but I could have gone to Korea and Germany and some other places and then at eighteen years in, end up at the same hospital with the same job.  You know unless you get on the old buddy trail and you drink with the right guys and you get all the promotions and advancements that are possible but by no means guaranteed.
Speaker 2: Now Hawaii though, you said that was a nice--
Speaker 1: That was a great tour.
Speaker 2: It was a great tour for you and your family.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And how old were your children at that point?
Speaker 1: Well three were born there.
Speaker 2: Oh three, oh they--
Speaker 1: They were.
Speaker 2: Okay, they were all, okay.
Speaker 1: Well I have four but only the first three were born in Hawaii.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so how long were you there then?
Speaker 1: I was there for five years.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were only, you were in Fort, in what's the other--Fort--
Speaker 1: Jackson.
Speaker 2: --Fort Jackson for what a year or two--
Speaker 1: No, three and a half.
Speaker 2: --three, three and a half, okay.  I'm sorry, nine okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so okay, you are--you end up your tour of duty where?
Speaker 1: At Fort Jackson.
Speaker 2: At Fort Jackson.  Okay.
Speaker 1: in 1964.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So that's when he--so you went from--let me just understand, you went from--you were at Fort Meade [Maryland], right?  No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I had the training in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --leading up to the infantry commission at Fort Meade.  Then I went to medical school [at Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and I went to Tripler U.S. Army Hospital in Honolulu, Hawaii and then ended up at Ford Jackson, U.S. Army Hospital in Columbia, South Carolina.
Story_ID: 177572
Speaker 1: And then now it's time to get out [of the U.S. Army] and so what are your thoughts?  What are you going to do and--?
Speaker 2: Well I'm looking for a good teaching job.  I always wanted to teach I guess because my parents were teachers so I wanted a chance to practice and I wanted to be connected to an academic institution.  And I had an insurance man who found me at Fort Jackson [Columbia, South Carolina] and made sure I had plenty of life insurance, but he lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and he really recruited me to try to get me to live in Philadelphia which he said really was a nice place for a black surgeon.  And they had no orthopedic surgeon there and no one else did either.  So I went to Fort Jackson to interview with a hospital that was setting up an orthopedic service and they said, "Fine, we'll give you the job."  I don't remember what the salary was but I had been to a meeting and the chief of orthopedics at Columbia [University, New York, New York] had looked me up because he was looking for a black orthopedic surgeon to head a program at Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York].  That was the year that they had established an affiliation between Colombia and Harlem where the staff at Harlem would be recruited--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by Columbia and given a Columbia appointment and upgrade the staff at Harlem which basically were unpaid visiting doctors with varying degrees and credentials.  And he needed a black orthopedic surgeon to head that program and he looked me up and asked me was I interested.  And I said, "Well not really but give me your card and, you know, I'll think about it."  So when I came up to interview at Philadelphia I called my wife [Arden Buckner] and I said there's a situation here that looks pretty good but I think I'd like to go to New York and just talk to the people at Columbia and look at Harlem Hospital and see what's going on there.  And I did, and they treated me very well and I went to Harlem and I was impressed by the magnitude of the job in orthopedics which was in great demand because of the nature of the community and the type of violence that was going on there. It was just loaded with people with major injuries from gunshot wounds and other street violence as well as falling off of roofs and just--they had patients in the hall so it was just a tremendous group of people with the kinds of injuries that I had really worked on in the service.  And the people were very nice.  Columbia was a prestigious hospital and although I had to take sort of a salary cut in order to come to New York, I decided that I'd try New York rather than Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: And so your, is your wife on board at this point too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She would have gone either place.  She told me she didn't want to go to Atlanta [Georgia] where my brothers were but she would come to either Philadelphia or New York.
Story_ID: 177573
Speaker 1: And so talk about what you found there [at Harlem Hospital Center in New York, New York] and what you built because they didn't--did they have at that point--you're saying that they had loaner doctors for Harlem Hospital.  They had--
Speaker 2: (Shaking head yes).
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: They had non-university people who were all on staff and performing the work at the hospital and they were trying to convert that to a university type situation where everyone has an appointment at the medical school and the standards are raised as far as board certification and all that.  And also there was an effort to incorporate the patients at Harlem into the teaching program at Columbia [University, New York, New York].  Columbia was--is interesting because they had a mandate to affiliate but also the large number of trauma cases at Harlem were attractive because they didn't have a trauma, they didn't have the volume of trauma at Columbia [University Hospital, New York, New York] because no--they didn't have a--they had a small emergency room and the ambulance didn't go there.  So they had difficulty getting experience with what we call level 1 trauma.  And so they were interested in having the residents come over to Harlem to get experience in trauma.
Speaker 1: Now with that type of arrangement, were you--did you split your time between both or were you mainly really at Harlem and then--I'm--
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting.  I have an appointment at Columbia but really my time is supposed to be spent at Harlem.  In fact, it was sort of dogmatic in those days that in order to have this type of job you had to be 100 percent effort at Harlem.  And that if you were caught working anywhere else other than at Harlem regardless of what time of day or night it was, you could be fired.  In fact, one of my colleagues who was an orthopedic surgeon had a family, had a job at Harlem, was not making nearly enough money to support his family, agreed to see some patients for an HIP, which is a Health Insurance program [in New York, New York].  And when the professor of surgery found out about it, he took--pulled him in one day and said you're fired without any discussion about why he was doing it or why it was wrong.  And so that restricted the duality of the appointment in that you know I have a university appointment but I'm not working at Columbia [University] Hospital which is a [New York] Presbyterian Hospital, I'm working at Harlem.  That went on for a while, for the first two years I would take their residents and I would train them in the management of the trauma at Harlem on a rotating basis like every six weeks or three months there would be a new group of residents that would come down and would come--they would go back and then they would send in another group down there.  And although I had some help, it was a--that was just an impossible situation to live with because you just can't have any continuity of care if you know the doctor just came to the service yesterday and he hadn't had the chance to get oriented and you end up trying to teach everything in three months to a new group of people.  And it became apparent that that was not a good way for me to spend my effort and it wasn't doing the hospital that much good and that the best thing to do was to try to get an independent residency program approved at Harlem.  And that was a major thrust of my professional career was to convince the university to support the effort to continue to have the residents from Columbia come down but to have as a nucleus or backbone an independent program that, where I have the opportunity to select the candidates and they would stay with me for three years and there would be continuity of teaching and you could teach one, you could teach the other one next year rather than have to go back through every drill, every routine, over and over again you know on a three month basis.  So that was what I had to spend a major energy in convincing the approving bodies which is the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery and the JCMA [ph.] which is a hospital group that approves these programs to allow us to have an independent program.  We were able to get that approved in 1966.  It took two years.
Story_ID: 177574
Speaker 1: So it [getting an independent residency program approved at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] didn't take a huge amount of time.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Not the way you were talking.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I thought that it was longer than that.  What were the steps that they made you go through to do that?  What did they--what did you have to put in place?
Speaker 2: Well you have to document the types of cases that you have done and the volume of different types of fractures.  You know, where you're seeing fractures of all the major bones and the spine.  The fractures are open or closed and how are you treating them.  Whether you have adequate support from radiology and laboratories, that type of thing.  It's just the evaluation of the experience that you're going to offer the candidates who come through the program and an evaluation of you as the chief.  Actually I was almost a one man show.  I had two people in and out who would help but you know they have to say that the experience that they're going to get in terms of who's guiding them and what they have to work with is equal to you know any other place as far as complete training.
Speaker 1: Now so you get the program set up there [at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] which means that you're doing your own training of people and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --people are coming through and learning?
Speaker 2: Well first you know the major thing is you have an opportunity to select people into the program where they're not going to get into any other program because they are either black or African or Indian or Korean or some you know minority group.
Speaker 1: And then in that process are you, you're building--are you using this as an opportunity to build the department itself or to you know sort of take the cream of the crop and build with it?  I mean there was no staff there in the beginning, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: There was no trained staff.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: There was a general surgeon there who did trauma on the side so to speak but didn't have, you know he wasn't board certified or gone through a qualified residency program as was the case across the country.  Most of the fracture and trauma were--was done by general surgeons who just took an interest in it in addition to their work on the bowel and other things.
Speaker 1: So in many ways we're in, you know in the mid-1960s.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And this is like one of the largest black communities--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in an area of you know orthopedic needs, this is--it's really not being met?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, essentially?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And that's probably mirrored throughout the United States?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 177575
Speaker 1: And it was--would you say what, it was the result of the Civil Rights Movement that sort of brought this whole thing together or what--because you said Columbia [University, New York, New York] was sort of you know they were not brought as a willing participant but they had to do the program.
Speaker 2: You know the problem with the Columbia is that there are two factors that were in play that would have to agree because the Columbia University [New York, New York] which is basically downtown you know, all the Ph.D.s and people associated with the Columbia University that everyone has heard about, they're the ones that agreed with the city to staff Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York].  But the medical end of it is really [New York-] Presbyterian Hospital [or, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York] okay.  Now the College of Physicians and Surgeons is a part of Columbia University so there is no real argument about philosophy between College of Physicians and Surgeons and Columbia.  If Columbia says we want to affiliate, they go forward.  The problem is that the hospital had no interest basically in affiliating with Columbia, I mean with Harlem.  They were perfectly happy to treat a few black patients in the ward service and--but go no further.  And the staff at Presbyterian Hospital had zero interest in coming over to Harlem to do anything, okay.  So the participation on the clinical side at Harlem was very spotty.  Some of the departments made a fairly substantial effort to do what the affiliation called for, that is recruit and you know get people appointed and come over to do whatever lecturing they needed to do in terms of filling in the academic background and some of them did nothing you know.  Some of them had zero participation because they were people with the affiliation and allegiance to the hospital and not to the medical school.  And the medical school had no way of forcing them to participate.  Dr. [Frank E.] Stinchfield who was the orthopedic chief at Presbyterian was the best in terms of Columbia people who endorsed the philosophy of affiliating in a meaningful way and providing you know whatever needed to be done to upgrade the work being done at Harlem Hospital.  And that's why I got recruited and why he helped me get the independent program because I explained it to him and he understood that I needed to--if I was going to stay there that I'm going to have to have a program that allows some continuity of care and that would give me some chance to relax every now and then and not have to go watch everybody do everything you know on a twenty-four hour a day basis.  So he supported that and although he's dead, he deserves a lot of credit because there are very few people went along with that idea.  But he had the stature.  He was the president of the academy and president of the American College of Surgeons so he had enough name and clout to do what was right even though a lot of people probably didn't really appreciate the fact that he did it.
Story_ID: 177576
Speaker 1: Now here you are--who is the rest of the team at Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York] at this point?  We've been talking about the orthopedic section but who are your other sort of cohorts?  And there--this affiliation with Columbia I would assume extends beyond--?
Speaker 2: It goes on.
Speaker 1: It goes on, but I'm saying it was in other areas--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --beside--okay.
Speaker 2: Right, because--
Speaker 1: So who are the other--?
Speaker 2: I was a part of the surgical team that affiliated along with [Dr.] Aubre [de Lambert] Maynard which is a name that you know you may have come across who was a general surgeon at Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] who was very instrumental in getting the surgery department which orthopedics used to be a part of but no longer as I was able to separate orthopedics from general surgery.  But there was a Fred Randle [ph.] who was a general surgeon who was quite important in the affiliation and helped get general surgery residency program approved and maintained.  [HM Dr.] Harold Freeman who took the--Randle's position and continued until recently as chief of general surgery.  The--those are the major black players except for pathology.  There was a Theophilus [W.] Roberts who was chief of pathology at Harlem and had a residency program which is still going on.  The pediatrician, never had a black pediatric chief at Harlem, it's interesting, there've been several chiefs you know there but no black chiefs.  OBGYN [Obstetrics and Gynecology], they had a similar fate where they had a, they were not able to recruit a black chief for many years.  It was one there for a short period of time but did not last too long.
Speaker 1: And didn't Harold Freeman, didn't his work exist around breast cancer in women?
Speaker 2: Well he made quite a name for himself not only as chief of surgery in Harlem but for establishing a breast cancer detection center in Harlem and he's also been recently appointed to a commission down in Washington [D.C.], the NIH [National Institutes of Health], to study you know breast cancer in black women.
Story_ID: 177577
Speaker 1: And you, so you get this [independent residency] program set up [at Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] within two years so--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what are the other things that are important in this whole sort of span because you have this position as director of residency training until 1984?  That's what it--
Speaker 2: Ninety-Four [1994] I think it was.
Speaker 1: Oh '94 [1994], okay.  Sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: That lasted for like, what, sixteen years and then there is a climate to shrink the number of residencies across the country and the first ones they want to knock out are the ones who were "independent", non-affiliated.  So we came under attack by, these are mostly conservative views as to what constitutes an adequate experience and what kind of programs ought to persist and which ones should not persist.
Speaker 1: And who is the--is this from the federal government?
Speaker 2: No, this is from the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's the certifying board?
Speaker 2: It's the certifying board.  You know they look at all the programs throughout the country and they, you know they said that although the trauma experience there is great, there wasn't enough pediatrics.  So we said okay we'll send them to Helen Hayes [Hospital, West Haverstraw, New York] which is a pediatric hospital nearby, you know it's in New York.  And that satisfied them for a while and then they said it's not enough--what was the next thing they said?  Oh, they felt we need more basic science.  So we set up lectures at the university that the residents went through and then they finally came back and said you know we're just not going to approve a free-standing program anymore.  So they really gave us a deadline to stop taking residents.  And things were pretty gloomy at least from my standpoint because it--we had about thirty-six young guys come in and get into orthopedics who would not have otherwise had a chance but the only salvation was that I was able to negotiate with the city [New York, New York] and Columbia University [New York, New York] to have them expand the program at New York-Presbyterian Hospital [or, Columbia University Medical Center] by two residents and that these two slots would be earmarked for Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] and I'd have a chance to pick the guys and the slots.  So they agreed after some reluctance.  And then--but the people I must say downtown at the university level were very clear that this was the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 177578
Speaker 1: And for--and just to give perspective on this, the board certification with doctors, that's very critical you know--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --especially when you are talking about you know surgery and things like that--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but board, you know board, being board certified.  How many at the time that you started in, you know at Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York], how many board certified you know orthopedic surgeons were there?
Speaker 2: Five.
Speaker 1: And how many were there at the time that--and you said it was--excuse me--at the time that they wanted to dismantle the program?
Speaker 2: Well we had been taking two each year from nineteen--
Speaker 1: Sixty-Six [1966]?
Speaker 2: --sixty-six [1966] to nineteen eighty--
Speaker 1: It's '84 [1984] it says here.
Speaker 2: Eighty-Four [1984], okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's six--that would be sixteen years.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you had been taking you said, so you had fourteen--so twenty--so there are about--
Speaker 2: Thirty-Two.
Speaker 1: Thirty-Two, yeah.
Speaker 2: Plus or minus.
Speaker 1: The--in the whole country or period or--?
Speaker 2: Well you know these are--
Speaker 1: Or in New York?  No.
Speaker 2: See, right.  At this, in this period from '64 [1964] to '84 [1984] okay--no, '66 [1966] to '84 [1984], you're talking about three places that you could do a residency that would allow you to eventually be board certified.  So you have to go to an approved program for four years, then you have to sit in an exam, a two point exam and pass that, then you can say you're board certified okay.  If you just do training but don't take the exam, you'll be--they call that board qualified but not certified.   You can get that training at Harlem.  You can get it in Dr. [Roselyn Payne] Epps' program in Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 1: At Freedmen's?
Speaker 2: At Freedmen's Hospital [later, Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Freedmen's Hospital.
Speaker 2: And you could get it in [Los Angeles] California at King [Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital].  And, I'm sorry and also for--I don't think you could ever get it in Nashville [Tennessee], no.  You had to go to those, one of those three programs, black programs.
Speaker 1: So this was going to cut out sort of a major source.  So even--so you're saying thirty--so there were three places in the country so maybe--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All doing about two a year but maybe not?
Speaker 2: Well the Epps program was more like four or five a year. It was always larger.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you managed to salvage this but this is in, what year is this?  Is this nineteen seventy--eighty--?
Speaker 2: No, '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Eighty-Five [1985] is when--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, then--yeah, I--we gave up the freestanding program and became a part of the big program at PNS [ph.], okay it was called New York Orthopedic Hospital.
Speaker 1: So did that program, what is the status of that program today?  Has it, I mean did that program--was there resistance at the beginning and then it sort of became, you became sort of mainstreamed within the--?
Speaker 2: Well everything was fine until the city [of New York, New York] started cutting back on funding of the hospital okay.  And we had to drop the money Harlem was able to give to Columbia [University, New York, New York] to pay the residents to come there, okay?  That had never been a problem in the earlier years of affiliation but as the city budget became tighter and they started reducing costs, one of the things that it affected was that there were no more residents that they could appoint to come over to Harlem--
Story_ID: 177709
Speaker 1: Was that sort of part of the course in a lot of the things in terms of innovations?  Were they coming out of places like your institution [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] or were you--was that information filtering over into you know Columbia [University, New York, New York]?  Presbyterian, I'm sorry, [New York-] Presbyterian Hospital [or, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Was the affiliation cross pollinating is what I guess I'm trying to say?
Speaker 2: Yes.  No that doesn't happen very often because the people who were at an affiliated institution generally are not viewed in the same way as the people at the so-called mother institution.  And I use to chuckle because you know literally I could go on the road as a visiting lecturer somewhere and be a hero and widely quoted and respected about my views which were different because I was ahead of my time in a way, in a lot of ways, whereas my colleagues would tend to try to ignore you know what I had done.  And that some of the inventions that I had that I would use, they wouldn't even stock them at Columbia but you know the residents were happy to come to Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] and use them because they were the best equipment that you could get.  So it wasn't a lot of cross pollination between you know doing, across--at Columbia and--at Harlem and at Columbia.  It's gotten a little better now, now that you know I spent all--I spent all my time at Columbia.  And Harlem is there but they no longer have the residents at all.  It's all again being run by attending doctors and with the help of general surgical residents who are still rotating through orthopedics.  But it really, it's almost gone full cycle from what it was like in the '60s [1960s] till today because it's the importance and the funding at Harlem has just shrunk enormously and it's shifted a lot of patients to Lincoln Hospital [Bronx, New York, New York].  In the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], the Medicaid patient was not welcome at Columbia or Presbyter--or St. Luke's or Mount Sinai [St. Luke's, Harlem, New York, New York] or any of the other "private hospitals".  They were almost always if they appeared there invited under some pretense that they would be better off to go to Harlem.  So we had an enormous patient population.  But gradually you know with the change in the patient mix and other factors, these Medicaid patients are now courted by the teaching hospitals and so they no longer are forced into Harlem, they can choose to go pretty much anywhere in the city and they are welcome even though they are "Medicaid".
Speaker 1: Because of the subjects of study, is that--?
Speaker 2: No, because of the reimbursement.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  I see.
Speaker 2: It's actually very good--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --for the hospital these days.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Medicaid reimbur--?
Speaker 2: Medicaid.
Speaker 1: All hospitals?
Speaker 2: Yes, in New York--
Story_ID: 177710
Speaker 1: Now I want to you know touch upon--and you had said that, "I was ahead of my time."  And you've--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --done a fair number of you know inventing and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know creating devices.  And I'd like you to talk about where that even--you know one, what was your first device and how that came about and why, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, first device was a plate and bolt system for difficult ankle fractures.  It came about because of the one major accidents in the Harlem [New York, New York] community is a fall from a tenement and they're a maximum five stories high so the mortality rate is relatively low.  Most of them survive but most of them land on their feet so they do enormous damage to their feet and ankles and on up to the spine also but there's major, major lower extremity trauma.  And also the phenomena that is really not well explained but it appears that if you fall and twist your ankle that if you're black you're more likely to have a serious ankle injury than if you are non-black.  I don't know whether it's due to--exactly what the difference is in terms of results you get from the injury but it resulted in my exposure to a large number of very serious ankle fractures which probably no one else in the country was seeing.  And as a result of that experience, it enabled me to find the things that were difficult to handle and to work on something to make the treatment better.  And that's how the plate and the bolt evolved for ankle injuries.  We also--
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Well it started in the '70s [1970s] and I started talking about it you know in the early '70s [1970s] you know with a lot of lectures and the device itself.  Then the other interest was again because of the patient population, the pedestrian vehicular collisions, people cross the street, they're a little bit tipsy, the drivers are speeding, they hit the patient, then they break the lower end of their femur and it's called a supracondylar fracture.  And they are relatively common there than probably more than many other or any other place that I can think of.  Just because of the heavy population and the street traffic and the degree of alertness that occurs you know in that community at that time.  And the devices that they had for use were totally inadequate and were too flimsy and difficult to apply.  And I collaborated with a couple of other people at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and we developed a nice plate that was contoured which is much improved over what they had that allowed me to treat these people and get the bone to heal with relative ease.  And--but it's interesting although I had two colleagues from Columbia that collaborated, they never used the plate at Columbia except one time.  And one of the residents who had been to Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] said you ought to put on this, what they call the NSG plate and the surgeon who collaborated with me was there.  He said, "Okay."  But in putting it on they thought the funny shape was wrong and that it should be like straight and it had a bend in it because it was contoured to fit the shape of a normal femur.  And they--it was difficult to manage to bend the plate and they put it on and when they showed the x-ray at a conference it was crooked because they didn't let the plate help keep the bone lined up.
Speaker 1: Well then you, did you--were you there when they showed that?
Speaker 2: What--no, I heard about it though.
Speaker 1: I bet you were furious.
Speaker 2: I was, but I--I was furious but I wasn't surprised because people are difficult and new ideas don't come easy.  And I think it's particularly true at a stayed institution where they talk about the way they did it twenty years ago and if somebody appeared to be getting good results then they want to do it the same way year after year.  You don't hear that philosophy so much today as you did back in the '60s [1960s] when you know I came into medicine.
Story_ID: 177711
Speaker 1: Now when you devised the first plate you said it was 1974?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is the process of you know devising something that, I mean that is a device, I'm sorry, developing something that is a device?  What do you, what are the steps that you have to go through and--?
Speaker 2: You basically have to draw the design of the appliance that you want to use and maybe make a wax model and take it to an orthopedic manufacturer you know to these companies that makes the type of implant that you want to use and they have an engineering department and a unit which will--if they like the idea they will tool the product and give you a trial to see if it does what you want it to do and then submit it to the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] for approval.  And once you get that, then they can manufacture and you can use the product legally.
Speaker 1: So how long usually is that year--I mean it's a several year period right or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then cost, what are the costs of development and who's supporting those costs?  Do they come out of the teaching institution?
Speaker 2: Well--no, that all is paid for by the orthopedic equipment company who is going to sell the product.
Speaker 1: So you really have to sell the orthopedic--?
Speaker 2: You have to convince them that this is something that is not only good but they're going to make money on.
Speaker 1: So you convinced them?  You did that far but then--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you got resistance on the use, you know the--?
Speaker 2: Well it was marketed and--to a certain extent.  It didn't get nationwide publicity that some other devices might have had.  But fortunately it was used by all the residents that trained in Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] and most of the residents that trained at Columbia [University Medical Center/ New York-Presbyterian Hospital, New York].  So the use, you know tended to spread out particularly as the years went on even though there wasn't a major marketing effort.  And I had no interest in getting a patent or trying to get any royalties off of it.  As long as it served the purposes you know in my institution, that was the basic requirement.  Now what somebody else wanted to use in Boston [Massachusetts] or someplace is really an issue that we have not found a way to address even though today there are people using equipment with you know far superior in design, some of the design features have been copied by other companies because it's not patented so many of the features of that plate that I described from the femur have been incorporated in newer devices that are being marketed today.
Story_ID: 177712
Speaker 1: What of the articles or the research that you did were you most proud of sort--?
Speaker 2: I'm most proud of the work I did on the trimalleolar fracture of the ankle.  That's the most complex injury involving the ankle.  It's very common in middle aged women who wear high heels and trip on the heel and end up sitting on their feet and there are three different areas of the ankle that are broken.  And up till the time that I started my interest in that injury, the results were almost always very bad with disabling arthritis and the only salvage was if arthrodesis which is a fusion of the ankle bone to the leg bone which leaves one with a stiff ankle.  And that was presented with cases like that on a regular basis and was able to devise a technique that will allow a surgeon to expose all the areas of injury and put the bones back in an anatomical position and fix them internally so you could put the foot in a cast for a short period of time and start motion and you end up with a functional ankle that did not require a fusion.  And many of them were relatively normal in terms of function rather than faced with a permanent disability.  So that--I was able to use the plate that I had described originally but it was the operative approach which had never been described before that I probably am most proud of.
Speaker 1: And when you say the operative approach, the approach to the, to--?
Speaker 2: To the injury.
Speaker 1: To the injury.
Speaker 2: How to make the incision in the order that you would use to repair all the pieces.
Speaker 1: At that point what are, what were you know women actually injuring as part of that injury?  They were--?
Speaker 2: Well there are two little knobs on each side, one is the medial malleolus and the outside is the lateral malleolus and then there's one in the back which you don't see.  And they're all three knocked off in this trimalleolar fracture.
Story_ID: 177713
Speaker 1: And you also had several visiting professorships.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were saying earlier you know a lot of times it was the lecture circuit and being invited to places that you were sort of being given the credibility--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that--so which ones did you enjoy the most of the ones that you did?
Speaker 2: Well that's--
Speaker 1: Cause these really occurred in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] was large because it was a, one of my earlier ones.  And there was a prominent surgeon who was interested in trauma, who actually was a general surgeon but one of those people that I mentioned did a lot of trauma before the orthopedic surgeon sort of took it over and I went out to his place to speak.  I'm most proud of that.  It also coincided with the time that I developed recurrent laryngeal neuritis and could hardly talk.  But that was the one that I liked the most.  Also I enjoyed University of Oregon [Eugene, Oregon].  I enjoyed Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Why did you enjoy University of Oregon?
Speaker 2: Well they did a lot of trauma out there and I had never been to Oregon and they were very receptive of the ideas that I was presenting.  But one of the things that I was able to sort of justify was the treatment of open fractures with internal fixation.  Up until that time people seemed to have the idea that if you put metal or internal fixation in an open fracture that you were inviting infection.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know in turns out that that--it's the other way around.  That it--if you don't put metal in there then you're inviting infection because the motion will almost assuredly cause the infection to, if not develop, it's certainly going to be worse than if the pieces are not moving.  So that, that's a concept which you know I was able to prove based on experience with the open fractures at Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] which were very, very common.
Speaker 1: Well what got that--I mean how did you come to that assessment about the, you know the using metal in that way?
Speaker 2: Well because that was what I was taught.  And again I had an opportunity to be trained by a first rate trauma surgeon who got his experience during the war who was really an expert on open fractures of all degrees and severity.  And I met the man who developed the concept of internally fixating fractures of the tibia who had the experience of being in St. Louis [Missouri] with a population much like Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York] in terms of indigent, Homer G. Phillips [Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri].  And there were a lot of people that had open fractures of the tibia which is a large leg bone that had not healed in a cast.  And they were getting ready to amputate them and he just said, well before we amputate, why don't we just put a rod in the tibia and see if that won't help?  And everyone was surprised when you put the rod in and the bones stopped moving, the fracture healed and the infection cleared up.  So its that kind of information that I had access to before I came to Harlem which encouraged me to go ahead and do it you know despite what was the prevailing opinion.
Story_ID: 177714
Speaker 1: And in this process, 'cause you're still affiliated with Presby, I mean [New York-] Presbyterian Hospital [or, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm a professor, full professor.  I have the emeritus status because I'm seventy-two, but I still maintain my office and I do the fracture round teaching on a weekly basis.
Speaker 1: So that whole affiliation worked out ultimately, it wasn't you know it wasn't a--I mean it's been your home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Except for the service, this has been--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --you know your home like Freedman's Hospital [later, Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] has been [HM] Dr. [Roselyn Payne] Epps'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --home?  And I'm wondering when you look at you know your career which has spanned--
Speaker 2: Forty-seven years.
Speaker 1: --Forty, forty-seven years, how has this, how has the orthopedic industry changed and--?
Speaker 2: Well you know it's grown larger.  There was a time when there were maybe less than a thousand orthopedic surgeons in the country and now there are probably thirty thousand.  And though--when I came in there were like six black orthopedic surgeons and I think now the number is closer to three hundred.  So the work that orthopedists do has increased because many of the things that the general surgeons used to do for injuries to the musculoskeletal system they no longer are qualified to do because of the experience.  And the types of problems that orthopedics surgeons are solving has increased phenomenally particularly with sports injuries and the advent of certain cosmetic procedures like leg lengthening and correction of spinal deformities all of which were not possible you know pre-1950.  But with antibiotics, good anesthesia and all the equipment that we have, radiology enables us to tackle a number of difficult cases that were no longer--that were previously not amenable to, certainly to orthopedic surgery and to medicine in general.
Story_ID: 177715
Speaker 1: And do you, if you were a young person coming along now would you, what would you advise someone to you know going to medical school, would you advise them because of the growth of the area to go into this field?
Speaker 2: Oh I think orthopedics is the most exciting field in medicine still because of the various types of conditions that we encounter and deal with, literally every part of the body except the contents of the skull and the organs in the body are a part of orthopedics succinctly with you know vascular considerations, your tendons, muscles, bones, nerves.  And then we treat all ages, pediatrics to geriatrics, tumors, metabolic diseases.  It's just an enormous array of conditions that affect the body and allow people who like orthopedics to work.  I have a daughter who liked medicine and went to medical school and chose orthopedics as a profession and does pediatric orthopedics, is chief of the University of the Massachusetts Hospital in Worcester.  And I regularly counsel anyone who thinks they might like orthopedics to--I encourage them to really look seriously at it.  It still is a vigorous profession.  You have to be physically very active.  You don't have to be--I used to think you ought to be experienced in the--
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: They actually used to say--
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  There was a time that the advice to people who finished in the bottom third of their class and could press two hundred pounds would be the ideal candidate for an orthopedic surgery job because of the anticipation that you would be struggling trying to pull on a bone to set it and it would require a lot of strength and actually it turns out that if you was using too much force you probably aren't using enough brain power to figure out how to do it.  And the orthopedic residency is actually the most sought after residency in medicine in terms of desirability among medical school graduates in this country, with perhaps the exception of neurosurgery.  But that's a small field.  But the orthopedic profession is a very, very desirable profession because of the types of work that we do.  We don't lose many patients and we can find a niche in almost any area that you have an interest in.
Story_ID: 177716
Speaker 1: Now are there other appointments or professional organizations that you've been involved in that you're particularly proud of?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The National Medical Association was an important organization for me and I participated in their activities on a regular basis and held national office for a number of years.  It gave me an opportunity to meet a lot of aspiring orthopedic surgeons and could network with those of us who are already out there.  The American Society for Surgery of Trauma [sic, The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma] which was an organization that I was invited to join early on allowed me to present some of my earlier works on open fractures and trimalleolar fractures to a national audience.  The--there is also American Trauma--I mean sorry, The Orthopedic Trauma Association which again deals with the type of patient injury that I had most experience with at Harlem [Hospital Center, New York, New York].  Recently I've been very active with the American Society for Foot and Ankle Surgery because my work on the trimalleolar fracture is really a part of the foot and ankle team so to speak and so I've become very, very interested in that organization and know most of the people who are active in it.
Speaker 1: Sir, can you tell a little bit about you know the National Medical Association, its origin and the development of you know the orthopedic section?  Can you do a little bit of that?
Speaker 2: The orthopedic section was established basically by people of my generation, including [HM Dr.] Charles [H.] Epps [Jr.], a fellow named Yume [ph.] from Alabama and a few other people and we were a part of a--the orthopedic section at least was a part of the big section.  But that really was a--I guess I'm really describing more the beginning of the nucleus in the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery.  The NMA [National Medical Association] as you know is an old organization who always had sections in general surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics and psychiatry, but it really wasn't until the '70s [1970s] when there was a substantial number of orthopedic surgeons in America that a section in orthopedics could be established.  And it was a small group of us and we brought the papers that we were giving around the country and gave them at the meeting.  The attendance was never very large because there weren't very many people but you know we persevered and fortunately the section still meets and I think the attendance has grown and now it enables not only the practicing orthopedic surgeons but the residents in programs around the country to have a place to come and meet other people and present the work that they are doing.  So it's, I think it's an important organization that should persist.
Story_ID: 177587
Speaker 1: You know speaking of your brother since we're there--you made history at Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you just--why was that you made history?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know, I guess--well a lot of people think that maybe we were the only family of brothers that come through, one, two, three, you know, in the graduating classes.  My average, I don't know whether--I never compared my average with anybody else who was you know, leading their class.  I don't think it was any better than [HM Dr.] LaSalle [D.] Leffall [Jr.]'s who--I don't know if you ever heard that name but he was four years ahead of me.
Speaker 1: And what was he known--
Speaker 2: He's a general surgeon.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: President of the American Cancer Society.  If he's not on your list, he should--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: LaSalle Leffall.
Story_ID: 177588
Speaker 1: So, but your parents, can you--when--are your parent--when did your parents pass--?
Speaker 2: In '76 [1976] and eighty--I'm sorry, '81 [1981] and '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: So you had some very happy parents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, we always tried to do them proud 'cause they did so much for us and it was nothing that they thought we needed that they wouldn't give us and you know all the support in the world.  And they were just great people.
Speaker 1: So they attended three graduations in a row at Howard [University] Medical School [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So they were there every year?
Speaker 2: They were there every year.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's interesting that when I--when my mother [Mable Butler Lloyd] heard all the awards I was getting she said, you know, "I'm the most surprised person in the audience you know that you got all these awards."  She was being--she was teasing me a little bit.
Speaker 1: So you--the tradition of--that tradition is really carrying on in your family too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about--you talked about your one daughter but your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my oldest daughter went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and then George Washington med school [George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, D.C.] and residency at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and teaches at U-Mass [University of Massachusetts].  And my second daughter went to Amherst [College, Amherst Massachusetts] and law school at Columbia [University, New York, New York] and practiced, didn't like it, now went back to architecture school and is a practicing architect in New York.  My third child is an accounting major out of Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] who is working as a one of the assistant directors at NYPIRG [New York Public Interest Research Group] which is a New York public research interest group that Ralph Nader started, and lives in New York.  And my baby girl is a film producer, aspiring film producer.  She has a Ph.D. out of USC [University of Southern California] in [Los Angeles] California who worked for Merchant Ivory in film for a number of years and now has her own company in New York.  So they all have done us proud in terms of what they've done with their lives and we just enjoy watching them develop further.
Speaker 1: Well isn't that wonderful, this whole generational succession of excellence?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And can you talk a little bit about why--what the ingredient is for that?
Speaker 2: Well you have to have two parents who are devoted to family and passing on and giving direction and a positive image to follow.  And I certainly had on my side and my wife [Arden Buckner] is fortunate enough to have a similar background.  Her parents were teachers.  Her father was a principal, her mother taught.  And they devoted their lives to helping her in her career.  She went to Bennett [College, Greensboro, North Carolina] and then Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], and taught at Northfield [ph.] and started teaching at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] where we met.  And she's continued to encourage the children to not only do the right thing but do everything right because in a way these parents were might--what some people might call perfectionists in terms of what they expected us to do.  And that image I think carries over subconsciously to the children and helps them decide on what's the right thing to do in life and the things not to do.
Story_ID: 177589
Speaker 1: Let's just talk a little bit about the role of the black doctor and you know in society because you know we--this was, the black community, there were always doctors--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --because no one else would treat us, you know, it was one of the professions that were you know possible.  But at the same time in you know hearing your story you think about how you know a large part, you hear about our community not being serviced but you know a world without blacks in the medical profession.
Speaker 2: Well I don't think it would be very pleasant because even though there's a lot of fairness in terms of a lot of things in life including medicine, I still think that the, the best care comes from people with the same background that you have, who speak the same language that they're the same, same history so to speak, same taboos and the nuances that make up a personality.  They all need to be understood because that's important in establishing a relationship and understanding what the patient is trying to tell you and encouraging the patient to be forthright and give you the information you need about you know what is causing all the problems.  You don't get that in interviews between doctors and patients of different backgrounds.  Also I think there may be a difference in the degree of effort that they go to, to try to solve a problem.  I know I spent a lot of my nights trying to figure out the answer to a patient's problems when I had other things that I could have been doing but I felt that they had a big problem and I didn't have a good answer for it I could probably do better if I just thought about it more.  I don't think every doctor does that for every patient and he's more likely to do it for somebody in his own race and less likely if it's a white doctor treating a black patient.
Story_ID: 177590
Speaker 1: And sir, when did you learn or, I mean I don't know what your bedside manner was or is but it would seem that you do have at least bedside manner (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And I'm wondering you know the whole thing of really treating patients it's the technical knowledge.  But what is the other part, the other parts that you think are sort of integral and that you try to--other traits, traits--?
Speaker 2: You want to get to know your patient.  You want them to trust you and you want to try to see what you can tell them that they can do with their own lives and make things better, either to stay healthy or to conquer their disease.  And an actual factor of participation as a doctor even as a surgeon is relatively limited.  In other words, I can operate on your back and the procedure may take two hours.  But in order for you to be well again you know I'm going to have to spend many more hours telling you how to rehab yourself and what you can and can't do so this doesn't happen again.  And those are the nontechnical aspects of medicine which are I think even more important than the technical aspects that we all have to keep in mind as being paramount in terms of a good relationship.
Story_ID: 177591
Speaker 1: And in terms of the care of African Americans in this country, what do you see as the number one sort of menace or problem facing--?
Speaker 2: Well the main problem is to find a doctor who will listen to them (laughter) and do his level best to give them the best possible advice.  Everything today is speeded up because the payment system has stressed the time that the doctor can really spend with the patient in order to make ends meet with the overhead from his malpractice insurance and his staff and the combining of a profession with family life which is more important to doctors today than it was in my generation and that we were allowed pretty much to leave the rearing of the children to the wife, but that doesn't happen.  Today the husband is expected to participate in the early you know childhood development like regular guys, even though they are doctors.  So everything is speeded up and we don't have much time to devote to people.  And the first people that are going to get shortchanged are the black patients who you know are not in the same community as the doctor who is treating them.  So finding somebody who is going to give them an even deal on time and effort is going to be a major problem, not only for patients in general but particularly for black patients.
Story_ID: 177592
Speaker 1: And [HM] Dr. [Marvin] Shelton, what things do you still want to do that you haven't done in your life?
Speaker 2: Well I would like to continue to teach.  I really, I have ideas about inventions that I know will never come to fruition because again the economics is such that unless your idea is appealing to a company who sees income potential, it's not going to get made.  So spending a lot of time and that is not--you know it's sort of counterproductive and I no longer--but I basically want to seriously enjoy the fruits of my labor.  I want to see my children continue to grow and be successful in their professions.  And my wife's [Arden Buckner] enjoying my company when she didn't get a chance to when I was working hard.
Story_ID: 177593
Speaker 1: And your legacy, what do you want your legacy to be Dr. Shelton?
Speaker 2: A guy who really did things because he thought they were right, who didn't think for a minute about being paid for something but just did it because maybe there was no one else around or it just needed to be done.  And who put his family above himself in terms of what he was going to--how he was going to spend his time.
