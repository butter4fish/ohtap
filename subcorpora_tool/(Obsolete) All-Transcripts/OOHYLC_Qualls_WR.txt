 Finchum Today is October 23, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we are  in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to speak with W.R. Qualls and this is part of  our Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life. So thank you for having us.  Qualls Okay.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Qualls Well, I was born in Wister, Oklahoma. Not in the town. We were  country folks, had a farm out of Wister, Oklahoma. I believe it was Le  Flore County.  Finchum So southeast?  Qualls Yeah. In 1915, I believe. I believe it was that. Anyway, they say I   m a  hundred years old. I don   t feel like it, but I   m sure I look like it.  Finchum What month?  Qualls September 11.  Finchum So just recently turned one hundred?  Qualls Yes.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Qualls We didn   t do much. Some of the families came in. Kicked me around a  little. (Laughter)  5  Finchum What did you parents do for a living?  Qualls Farmed. Farmers. Grew cotton and corn. No tractors. My dad had  horses. He kept, I don   t    know whether you know what a mare is, but  it   s a female horse. They   d have a mule colt each year. He raised  several mule colts. We   d break them to work as a two year old, and in  my teens he thought that I should learn that trade, too. I broke a few  young mules to work myself.  Finchum So you had to work in cotton, too?  Qualls Oh yeah, I picked cotton. Hardest job in the world I guess.  Finchum Well, did you have brothers and sisters?  Qualls I had two brothers older than I, two sisters older than I, and two  brothers younger than I. One was, our birthday, I was two years the  oldest, but our birthday was the same date. As we grew up, people  thought we were twins. I had a wonderful mother and dad. Oh, they  were sent from God.  Finchum Well, can you describe the house that you grew up in?  Qualls Well I can, but up to how old?  Finchum Well, as early as you can remember?  Qualls I can remember that my dad and my neighbors built a house. I don   t  know how many rooms, but it was plenty for the family. When we   d  have company, if we didn   t have enough chairs to seat everybody, it  didn   t make any difference whether we were young or old, if we   d sit  down on the bed, mother would move us like quickly. We   d say,     Where do we sit?       Sit on the floor.    (Laughs) The house was good,  wasn   t fancy like some today. Also, I believe they built a big barn. That  was when I was in my teens.  Finchum Did it have running water?  Qualls Oh no. Had a big porch all the way across the front. The well was on  the south end of the porch. We could stand on the porch and draw water  from the well.  Finchum Didn   t have to go too far.  Qualls No. No.  6  Finchum Would you have to share a bedroom?  Qualls Oh yeah. Well, how did we do that? I know my younger, my brother  that was my age, we had a room to sleep. We had rooms for everybody  to sleep comfortably.  Finchum How was it heated?  Qualls Had a big fireplace with wood chunks.  Finchum Kind of get cool in the winter?  Qualls Well, we thought we were in good shape. (Laughs)  Finchum Did your mother quilt?  Qualls Yes, she did. She drew her work up to the ceiling in the front room.  There was a quilt up there most of time that she was making.  Finchum Do you still have any?  Qualls I   m sure we do, some of the family.  Finchum Good. Well, where did you go to school? Like first grade, where did you  go?  Qualls It was called Liberty School. The one-room, one big room from the  primer through the eighth grade and had one teacher.  Finchum How would you get there?  Qualls Walk, it was about a mile. A little over a mile.  Finchum What would you take for lunch?  Qualls Well, Mother would fix our lunch. Sausage biscuits,  sausage  in a  biscuit and cookies. Such as that.  Finchum How would you take it?  Qualls We   d call it a paper poke. (Laughs)  Finchum What kind of games might you play at recess?  Qualls Hide-and-go-seek, and races, run races. The boys would kind of  aggravate the girls, run from them. Anyway, we had our own library.  7  Bishop What was your favorite subject in school?  Qualls I guess spelling. There was some I didn   t like much. Arithmetic, I was  slow about learning arithmetic. I had a teacher in my third or fourth  grade, she wasn   t very patient with me. That didn   t do me any good  about learning. I was learning about arithmetic then, and I had a good  friend, the oldest sister, maybe she had married into a family. One of  the boys was older than I quite a bit, and he spent the night with us and  in one night he taught me how to do arithmetic enough to really learn.  Finchum He had more patience than she did.  Qualls Yeah. I didn   t get very far. I think I might have been part of a season in  eighth grade, but didn   t go any further than that.  Finchum Okay. What did you do then? Help on the farm?  Qualls Sure did. Yeah, oh yeah. My brother, just younger than I that I  mentioned, we   d milk, oh, sometimes as many as five or six cows  before breakfast, just like that. Yeah. For a lot of years     Finchum What would your mother fix for breakfast?  Qualls (Laughs) Scrambled eggs and always have some kind of meat. Biscuits  and gravy for breakfast, a lot of times. Jellies of different kinds.  Finchum You could smell it cooking I bet?  Qualls Oh yeah. She   d make beans and cake for dinner and supper, we called  it. Fried chicken, milk and butter.  Finchum Raise your own chickens?  Qualls Oh yeah.  Finchum Who would do the killing when it was time?  Qualls Mother.  Finchum She did?  Qualls She   d just wring their neck. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s what you had to do.  8  Qualls Yeah. Yeah  I doubt if you know what I   m talking about.  Finchum I wouldn   t want to do it, but    Did she have a big garden?  Qualls Oh yes. I would help her in the garden. I loved to help her. I really  loved my mother. A little bit cautious of my dad. We never were very  close. I loved him, but he was a strict guy. Yeah, he was.  Finchum When you got in trouble, who would punish you? That   s assuming you  got in trouble.  Qualls He would. I don   t think he ever whipped us, but he   d make us think he  was going to. Yeah, it didn   t help too much. Well, my older brothers,  they left home in their late teens. I didn   t get to be around them very  much. They didn   t get along with my dad very much. He was pretty  strict and they didn   t like it. They left home. I can remember that. Came  back occasionally and visit.  Finchum Well did he get along with the sisters?  Qualls Yeah, quite well. My dad was a good singer. He had learned music  when he was a youngster. He was a real good singer. He taught my  brother and I to sing, in church.  Finchum Do you have a favorite song?  Qualls Well, I have several.  Finchum Would you sing one a little bit?  Qualls I thought I had my French harp in there. (Singing)    Men strive for the  wealth of this wide wicked world. They seek after honor and fame. So  lavishly sporting their diamonds and pearls. They put the poor savior to  shame. I   d rather be a  beggar  and live in a shack by the road than live  all my troubles      I   d about forgotten that.  Finchum That   s pretty good. You still can carry a tune  I thought you might sing     Amazing Grace.     Qualls (Singing)    Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch  like me. I once was lost but now I   m found, was blind but now I see.     How   s that?  Finchum Very good  Did you learn to play an instrument too or just sing?  Qualls I play the guitar.  9  Finchum Did he teach you how to do that?  Qualls Not really. He was a violinist. After I was grown, I got a guitar and  learned to pick. I picked and I   d sing in church, and later I was a church  song director for several years. Well, a lot of years.  Finchum Music has been a big part of your life?  Qualls Yes.  Finchum Well, where had he learned, your father?  Qualls In Arkansas, he was a   he liked to tell about being in a quartet, and he  sang the tenor part in the quartet. He said,    We   d win the banner.    I  don   t know what he was talking about. He   d say,    We   d win the banner  singing.    (Laughs)  Finchum So he was from Arkansas?  Qualls Yes.  Finchum Moved to Oklahoma?  Qualls Yes.  Finchum Was your mother from Oklahoma?  Qualls Arkansas.  Finchum So they were married when they came?  Qualls Yes.  Finchum When they moved over?  Qualls Yeah. They were gracious people, pretty strict. Dad was. Mother was,  oh, more than gracious to us.  Finchum Well, was church an important part of growing up?  Qualls Oh yeah, yeah. We   d go to church in, until we finally got a car, in a  hack.  Finchum I don   t know what that is?  10  Qualls A real nice wagon with two mules pulling it. A few years, now that  didn   t happen too long to me, but I remember a few times going to  church in a hack. (Laughs)  Finchum That is a wagon and mules?  Qualls Oh yeah. (Laughs)  Finchum What kind of church?  Qualls Nazarene, they were called Nazarenes. Pretty strict. Yeah.  Finchum Would they have revivals?  Qualls Oh yeah.  Finchum Good gospel music?  Qualls Uh-huh. Later, after I grew up, I made a trip or two, and went to  Washington. I had my twenty-first birthday in the state of Washington.  Three more guys and I, neighbors, run together. We went to Yakima  Valley in Washington to pick apples, (laughs) and I had my twenty-first  birthday.  Finchum To pick apples? That was a long way  How did you get there?  Qualls We rode in the back of a pickup with a neighbor that had friends there.  They were going to Yakima, Washington. We paid them gas money to  let us ride out there.  Finchum Where would you stay at night?  Qualls All four of us rented a little one-room building in the back of a people   s  house, and they had it equipped with what we could bach with. We  picked apples all that season. I can   t recall just how long that was now,  several weeks we picked apples, when I was twenty-one.  Finchum That would   ve been    38. Kind of during the Depression time.  Qualls Yeah. Yeah.  Finchum Have any memories from the Depression?  Qualls Well, we always seemed to have plenty. I can   t recall it effecting me all  that much.  11  Finchum Being on the farm helped?   Doorbell rings   Bishop You want me to get that? That way you don   t have to step over it. Oh  it   s Meals  on Wheels . I   ll take it to him.  Qualls Just put it there for now.  Bishop Right here?  Qualls Yeah, thank you. That is a God send right there. I get that every day, a  meal.  Finchum That helps doesn   t it?  Qualls Yes it does.  Finchum Well, do you like apples after having picked so many?  Qualls Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (Laughs)  Finchum So when did you get married? If you were doing that at twenty-one, you  weren   t married yet?  Qualls No. I was   my memory is not as good as it should be.  Finchum Did you serve in the military?  Qualls No. I don   t know why not. I can tell that the last month, my memory is  fading more than it has.  Bishop One question is how did you meet your wife?  Qualls I was in my twenties, still at the farm, still at home, and we   d have little  parties, and I was there by myself and this pretty girl was there by  herself. Then playing games we kind of hooked up. I wasn   t the most  bashful guy then in the world so I asked her for a date. Maybe I took her  home that night. I think I did. I didn   t mess around very long till I asked  her to marry me. Hazel McCarter was her name.  Finchum Hazel.  Qualls Beautiful girl.  Finchum Did you get married in a church or the Justice of the Peace or at home?  12  Qualls I   m ashamed that I can   t think of that right now.  Finchum That   s okay.  Qualls We raised a nice daughter and a son.  Finchum Well, did you stay in Oklahoma?  Qualls We went to California.  Finchum Why California?  Qualls I was farming here and kind of starving at the same time. (Laughter) I  had a good friend that I knew here. He lived in California. A couple of  years he had come back in a nice car and we visited. I said,    If you   ll  get me a job with your         Well, he worked for a big rancher that  hired him and two more guys, driving tractors, and I   d never seen a  tractor much less drive one. I   ll shorten this, as much as I can remember  about it. I told him if he   d get me a job, we   d move out there. We did. I  was a little slow about learning how to operate those tractors. I worked  for them about a year. The boss, owner, of the ranch, I could understand  he wasn   t exactly pleased with me, because I wasn   t as good as the  other men with the equipment and stuff even though I was a good hard  worker. So, he never did fire me, but I quit.  I took a job for the school system. There was a big school system. Three  or four districts had gone together. It   s still known as the biggest school  district anywhere, I think. It had a district superintendent and an  assistant superintendent and I talked to him about a job. I said,    I   m  looking for a job. I have a job right now, but I   m going to quit.    We had  quite a conversation. He said,    I   ve been hoping to meet a man just like  you say.    I had told him that I wouldn   t quit my job until I had given  him a chance to get somebody in my place, if he wanted to, but I was  going to quit. He said,    We have this little school, Bolsa School, four  rooms and four teachers, and the secretary.    One of the teachers is  principal of the school. And said,    There   s about sixty children that they  can   t go to the regular schools. They can   t learn. They   re all ages, and  we can   t hardly keep anybody to work as a custodian at the school. I   ve  been hoping to meet a man like you.    He said,    Would you be  interested?    I said,    I   m more than interested. I   ll take the job.     Did you ever hear of anything like this? There were about sixty-five, all  ages and some nearly as big as I was. They weren   t bad enough to put  away or kept home. They were trying to learn. The teachers, I worked  there for a lot of years as custodian, in California.  13  Finchum Roughly what years? Do you remember?  Qualls I   m sorry. I couldn   t     Finchum That   s okay. Did you retire from there?  Qualls Yeah.  Finchum So a long time?  Qualls A long time  Yeah. No, I   m not telling it right. I worked at that school  about four years. They built a new school. The superintendent wanted  me to take the new school as custodian, and they did away   I don   t  know what happened. I can   t remember, if I ever knew, what happened  to that little school of sixty-some kids that couldn   t learn to read hardly.  That   s where I spent the rest of my time. At the new big school. Three  districts had gone together and made one district, Garden Grove  District. I got a new school to open up as custodian. I spent the rest of  my time there, till I retired.  Finchum What town was that?  Qualls Santa Ana, California.  Finchum Not been there, but it sounds pretty though. What would you do for fun?  Qualls Well, I was quite a ball player, baseball. I started umpiring. I made a  pretty good umpire. I umpired ten or twelve years.  Finchum Behind the plate     Qualls Baseball, yeah.  Finchum Behind the plate.  Qualls I always wanted to be an umpire. I don   t know why. I read and heard of  an umpire school in Florida. I never could get enough money to go. I  started this umpiring. Maybe got some books and so forth. I made a  pretty good umpire. Worked a lot of years, at night. I   d work at the  school as custodian in the day time.  One night, a dressed up guy, after the ballgame, and he said,    Ump,  could I speak with you a minute?    He introduced himself. He said, I  have this school, I call it, to prepare guys. I want to make Major League  umpires.    He said,    We prepare them for the Minor Leagues. They   ll  14  work there until they   re good enough and the Majors will call them up.     I said,    I   ve always wanted to be a Major League umpire.    We talked  and boy we were getting on. He said,    By the way, what is your age?        I   m forty-eight. I   m forty-eight.    He just kind of,    Oh my.    I said,     What   s the matter?    He said,    They have a silly rule that Major  League umpires have to retire at fifty-two.    He said,    We   re fighting  that rule and we   re going to win, but now you might only work two  years.    That was kind of the end of my story. (Laughs)  Finchum You didn   t do it?  Qualls No.  Finchum What league were you working for then?  Qualls Just the Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, all ages and baseball.  Finchum Is that what they call the Pony League?  Qualls I worked that, and I also worked fast-pitch, any of them. This guy that  had been watching me that night he said,    I   ve been to all the parks  around for about a week. You   re the only one that I   d be interested in. I  like your way of working. You   d be a Major League before you know  it.    But my age     Finchum Made you feel good, though, didn   t it?  Qualls Yeah. Yeah. I could brag about it. (Laughs)  Bishop Did you ever play baseball as a kid?  Qualls Oh yeah.  Finchum For a town or just in school? Did the town have a baseball team?  Qualls I never did get paid to play ball.  Finchum Well, did you get paid to ump?  Qualls Oh yeah.  Finchum They paid you?  Qualls Oh yeah  I didn   t make a lot of money being a custodian, but I did some  good.  15  Finchum Well, did you teach your son how to play baseball?  Qualls He never did like it though. He liked to play golf. He made a golf  teacher. He teaches it now. He lives just out of Denver. He calls me  once in a while. Well, I have his picture over there. I got his picture.  Finchum Okay. What brought you back to Oklahoma? Retirement?  Qualls Yeah.  Finchum Came back home?  Qualls That   s it.  Finchum Well, are you the first in your family to make it to one hundred?  Qualls My oldest sister, I think, was ninety-eight.  Bishop What is your secret to living so long?  Qualls I don   t have any secret. I just live. (Laughs)  Finchum I think it   s exercise, since you were doing that when we came in.  Bishop Did you ever think you would make it to a hundred?  Qualls Never gave it a thought. No.  Finchum Not when you reached ninety-nine and say,    One more year.     Qualls No.  Finchum How old were your parents?  Qualls I don   t know their exact age, but they were quite elderly.  Finchum In their eighties or so?  Qualls Yeah. They stayed active. I never did see them put away. They died at  home.  Finchum Still on the farm?  Qualls Yeah.  Finchum They had to stay busy then.  16  Qualls I   m slowly but surely getting a little more forgetful than I   d like to be.  What I tell you it happened or didn   t happen.  Bishop What   s a typical day like for you at a hundred?  Qualls Huh?  Bishop What time did you get up, and what do you do during the day, and what  time do you go to bed?  Qualls I get up about seven. Fix my own breakfast. I try to keep my house  livable, enough for me anyway. I got a card. It   s that one right there.  Bishop Right here?  Qualls What does it say?  Bishop That   s just a piece of paper.  Qualls I   ll be right back.  Bishop Oh, it   s your     Qualls They   ll come by in a car or truck.  Bishop The Senior Transit System?  Qualls Yeah. Yeah, I go out and see Marjorie about two o   clock every day.  Bishop Who is Marjorie?  Qualls My wife. We are not married, but we   re just the same as married. I love  her to pieces. I wish you could see her.  Finchum How did you meet her?  Qualls I   ll have to think.  Finchum How long have you known her?  Qualls About twenty years.  Finchum Wow.  Bishop So you go and see her every day?  17  Qualls Every day.  Bishop You have lunch or just visit?  Qualls I have lunch here and I catch this between one and two o   clock. My  daughter comes and gets me eight thirty to nine.  Finchum That   s a pretty good long visit.  Qualls She   s a jewel of a lady.  Finchum I   d say she   d say the same about you.  Qualls Well, when I go in, she thinks Santa Claus has come. When I leave, she  almost cries. I   m the same way. (Laughs) She   s always beautiful.     Thank you Lord for Marjorie.     Bishop You come home at eight o   clock and then   .  Qualls Eight thirty.  Bishop Eight thirty? What time do you usually go to bed?  Qualls Pretty soon after I get here.  Bishop That   s a long day   Finchum No naps in between   Qualls No.  Bishop Oh, my gosh   Finchum When did you give up driving? Or have you?  Qualls Yeah. I had a good little car. I had two minor     Finchum Fender benders?  Qualls Yep. One of them was my fault. The other one was the woman   s fault,  but I got blamed. They took my driver   s license.  Bishop Speaking of driving, do you remember your first car?  Qualls I   m sorry, I don   t.  18  Finchum Or your dad   s?  Qualls I don   t.  Finchum Probably a Model T or a Model A?  Qualls I remember one he had. I believe it was a Chevrolet. He had to crank it.  Seemed like that was a Ford. He called   it kick backed and broke his  wrist. He did have a car when I was just a kid.  Finchum He was probably happier with a horse?  Qualls Yeah, yeah.  Finchum Was it pretty hard to break a horse? You said when you were younger,  he had you do it?  Qualls Well, I liked horses. We   d break the mules to work at a two-year old. I  don   t know if you know anything about mules, but I   d first let them  know that I wasn   t going to hurt them. I   d put the harness on them and  put them with an older horse, fasten it to their hames it   s called. Just a  matter of having patience and working with and realize they   re an  animal. I didn   t have much trouble.  Bishop Are mules as stubborn as they say?  Qualls No, no. I don   t know where that came from.  Finchum Well, what were holidays like back in your youth?  Qualls Well, we just wouldn   t have to work, which was the greatest thing.  (Laughs)  Finchum Would you have a Christmas tree?  Qualls Oh yeah  Oh yeah.  Finchum Maybe one present?  Qualls Yeah.  Finchum How often would you get new shoes?  Qualls Well, my dad learned how to even repair shoes pretty good. (Laughs)  19  Finchum Necessity has us learn a lot of things. Well, did your mother make your  clothes?  Qualls No. Uh, I have this thing about shoes. That   s a pretty good pair of shoes  right there. I gave a hundred and forty-four dollars for them. My son  was here a couple of years ago I guess. I have six pair of boots. I have  about twelve pair of shoes. (Laughs) My son saw these shoes,    Dad,  where did you get those shoes?    I took him out to the store. He got all  fit up in a pair of these shoes, and I paid the lady for them.    No Dad,  I   m going to pay for them.       Oh yeah, I   ll pay for them.    They sold  these things to him.    Dad, that   s the best pair of shoes I ever had.     (Laughs) They are a good shoe. I   m getting silly now.  Finchum Oh you are doing fine. Your daughter will be saying where is hers?  (Laughter) Where is her new pair of shoes?  Qualls I made a deal with my daughter. I was talking about losing my driver   s  license. I had a good crackerjack little car. Took the driver   s test. Did  all right, but I missed too many road signs. They   ve got them that I   ve  never seen. Took it again, got a book and read up on it, still missed  three too many. Couldn   t get my driver   s license. I don   t guess I could  drive now, but even a year ago I could have. Missed too many of those  road signs. A lot of them I had never seen. Anyway     Finchum And they have changed the color of some of them.  Qualls Yeah  Yeah     Finchum They have.  Qualls (Laughs) Made a deal with my daughter that I   m going to see Marjorie  one way or another as long as I can.  Finchum The deal was that she would come get you at eight and bring you home  every day from seeing Marjorie?  Qualls Yeah.  Finchum Pretty good deal.  Qualls She said,    I   ll come and get you.     Finchum That works for the moment, doesn   t it.  Qualls It costs me a dollar a day  for the van ride to Marjorie   s .  20  Bishop Is there anything on your bucket list that you   d like to do that you have  never done before?  Qualls My what?  Bishop Anything on your bucket list, something you always wanted to do?  Qualls I can   t think of anything. I think of places that I wish Marjorie and I had  gone before she fell. She fell one night. She was running on a hard  floor. I   ve known her, I guess, twenty years, and we should   ve gotten  married, but she never could come up with her   what is it you have to  have?  Bishop The license?  Qualls Yeah. Now, we don   t really think about it.  Bishop Well, when history is written, what would you like it to say about you?  How do you want to be remembered?  Qualls The guy was truthful and honest. How   s that?  Bishop Pretty good   Finchum And he could carry a good tune   Qualls  Singing     When all your friends forsake you and all alone you trod.  Don   t yield to sin or worry but still have faith in God. He   s far the truest  helper that you have ever met. He  your   soul remembers when other  friends forget.     Finchum Very good. I haven   t heard that one either. My favorite is    I   ll Fly  Away.     Qualls That   s a good one.  Finchum I can   t sing, but I love to hear it.  Qualls I can   t sing anymore either.  Finchum It sounds pretty good to me. Well, anything else you want to add before  we cut the camera off?  Qualls No, you can cut that thing off now.  Finchum You   ve been great. Thank you for sharing.  21  Qualls You can blame Cory for me letting you in. (Laughs) I told him I wasn   t  going to.  Bishop You did great.  Finchum You were great, thank you.  -------  -------
