Speaker 1: I want you to start out by stating your name and spelling it and your position.
Speaker 2: "My name Jose Jimenez."  Stop, stop, Graves.  Are you--no, you're not old enough.
Speaker 1: And you have to look at me.
Speaker 2: You're not old enough to remember when that guy used to do that on TV all the time, the comedian?  He would come on and say "my name Jose Jimenez," right?  My name is Earl Graves.  What do you want me - what else do you want?
Speaker 1: Earl Graves and your--spell it for us and state your title.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the date and where we're located.

Speaker 2: (Pause).  When I refer to the issues that confront black people, I always say that "easy has never been a part of our vocabulary, but that has never stopped us from accomplishing what we had to accomplish," and therefore that's my favorite saying.  "Easy is not a part of our vocabulary."

Speaker 1: We should start, you know, with having you talk about your parents and growing up, and I'd like to--your parents, you know, were from Barbados.
Speaker 2: My grandparents.
Speaker 1: Your grandparents. Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I'd like you to sort of talk about--well, I'd first like you to talk about your father, you know, give his name and tell us, you know, about him.
Speaker 2: First of all, my father passed at an early age.  He was forty-seven, almost forty-eight when he passed.  He was Earl Godwin Graves so it's E-G-G.  Egg is still there, but my mother, I think, didn't like Godwin, and so she decided to make me Gilbert, and so I'm Earl Gilbert Graves Senior, and then there's an Earl Gilbert Graves, Junior, and now there's an Earl Gilbert Graves the third, which is our grandson which he's very proud of saying he's the third.  My dad was a very strict disciplinarian.  Democracy in our house was with a very small "D," but he had worked hard.  He had been an orphan at sixteen and had helped raise his brother who was younger than he.  He and his brothers all finished high school.  I think three of the--or four of the five of them actually went to college.  My dad did not.  He went to Erasmus Hall High School [Brooklyn, New York] which I also went to, but the hard time that he had seen growing up made him want the best for us.  What he didn't have an ability to do was to espouse love, all right, which I regret deeply because I think I loved him but not in a way that the relationship that I have with my sons and my sons have with their sons and daughters, and if I had--if I could do something over, probably I--you know, I've often said to myself I wish I could sit around and smoke a cigar with him, all right, and just say "what do you think about so-and-so?"  "What's your opinion?"  And to tell a joke, you know.  My friends said he was quite humorous.  I didn't--I mean I used to enjoy seeing him laugh, but again it was always when I--he wasn't angry about something as I said, and my friends also said that he was pretty good at telling jokes that were a little bit on the colorful side, and it would have been much fun to have him say, you know, tell a joke that I can now share with my sons who are adult men, nothing that would get my wife terribly upset but enough that I don't have to necessarily say the joke in front of her, and I never had the privilege or opportunity to do that with my dad.
Story_ID: 7721
Speaker 1: What do you know about his background, I mean, besides, you know, that his father died when he was young?  What?
Speaker 2: I think I covered that he was a high school graduate. (Pause in interview).
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I'm not talking about that.  What about his family and how he came here?
Speaker 2: He was born in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  You know, I - my father passed when I was.
Speaker 1: Forty, you said
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was forty-seven, almost forty-eight.
Speaker 1: You were in college [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He was working still.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We never had a relationship where he sat down and told me long stories about his family, all right.  It was always--I remember when my sister [June Jones] who's nine months, ten months my junior and then my brother, my next sister [Sandra Graves] who's about, I guess, five years my junior, and then I have a brother [Robert Graves] who is twelve years my junior.  We really never--it was not a matter where my father sat around and said "this is what Dad did," and "this is what Mom did," and "this is what we did," and "we had a picnic" or "this is what Christmas was like," and so I really didn't know that much about him unfortunately, and I would like to have known.  I would like to have--my sons can regale stories about when they were in college and how they'd come home with their friends, and I would say to their friends "how strong are you?  I need firewood from outside for the fireplace," and "let's go play wash the car," and so they'd tell--they'd regale and tell stories about what it was like growing up in our household with a lot of love involved.  That was not the case for me or my sister or my brother and my other sister.  What I know about my father is he had five brothers.  One was deceased in childhood, and so he had four others who I did know and four others who, as I said, were well educated.  They were all industrious in terms of there was no thing about not having a job.  My father, when he passed away, was working three jobs.  On the weekend he would work as a bartender at parties for his boss.  In addition to working as a stock clerk at--the best way to describe it is one of those guys who pushed one of those hand trucks, and here he was with an academic training and background and diploma from one of the finest high schools in the country, but at his age he--there was no openings, if you will, so--and there certainly--when he became an orphan at sixteen and finished high school at--I think he finished at eighteen.  That meant he was getting himself up every day, figuring out a way to take care of his brother, Uncle Joe who became a pharmacist, and probably--and there was another brother, Uncle Jason, who finished college also and was a teacher in New York City, and Uncle Sam who was self-taught, but he also had started college and did not finish, and an Uncle John who I don't think ever went to college but then again was a high school graduate so knowing my father was really--some things that you heard, other things you thought, and today if you ask him, I'm not sure what is truth from fancy, fantasy rather, in terms of what I remember about my dad or what I remember hearing about my dad.
Story_ID: 7722
Speaker 1: What about your mother?  Give us her name and--
Speaker 2: Her name was Winifred Colette Sealy, and her last name was her parents' name.  Her last name was Sealy.  She was a diminutive person.  She didn't think so.  When she looked in the mirror, I think she saw five [feet] ten [inches], five eleven, but I don't think she ever reached five three.  I think she was really more like five two, and yet as I said in the book that I wrote, she helped at least integrate the swimming pool at the Central YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Brooklyn [New York] because when I came home one day and told her I had been politely asked not to come back to that pool because that was a pool assigned to the white boys, you know, all of a sudden after I said it, I looked up and there was this woman six foot three standing there with flames coming out of her eyes and nose and ears, and she said "we're going back to that Y and straighten this place out," and the next day we went back down there, and about two or three days later I was swimming in that Y, and so that was the kind of woman she was.  She was president of the P.T.A. [Parents and Teachers Association] at the school we went to.  She was always involved for us, and she always wanted the best for us, and she was a very thrifty woman, a very loving mother.  She loved to cook.  She had finished school.  She was good enough to be a chef at Schrafft's Restaurant where she was the head chef in Brooklyn, and so she worked very hard, and in later years, fortuitously, I was able to give back something, if you will, in terms of the trips that she could go on and go into the White House with me to meet President [Jimmy] Carter and have dinner and then still the next day call me up and say she hadn't heard from me, and I said "Mom, we were just at the White House last night," and she said to me, "that was last night.  I just wanted to be sure you were thinking about me today," and she wasn't the type of mother, though, who wanted to impose her will and try to tell us how to raise our children.  She just was a mother who wanted to be involved, and I think my wife [Barbara Graves] and I are those kind of grandparents today.  We just want to surround ourselves with them.  Some days we're happy when nine o'clock comes and their parents are picking them up, but for the most part we are thrilled to have them all around and have them all understand how much we love them and how much they are loved, and my mother, I think, passed that on to us.  She passed on cleanliness to the extent that my brother and my sister and my other sister, all of us, any time you see us--I mean, you know, the story was when we were growing up, and I remember having this conversation with [author and former TransAfrica president] Randall Robinson.  You never went out into the street without clean underwear on and definitely no holes in it in case you got hit by a car, and if you ask some African American today growing up, you say "did your mother ever tell you you could get hit by a car?" and say "you have to have on clean underwear?" and they would go "yeah, they did."  It's always amazing.  Randall Robinson was fasting a few years ago.  It was after the apartheid time, but it was still an issue that he very much felt strongly about.  I think it had something to do with Haiti, and I went to visit him in Washington [D.C.], and he had been not eating for about fourteen days, and so there was a reporter from 'Time' Magazine interviewing him at the time, and I saw all his underwear.  He had his clothes all piled up in this room that he was--positioned himself in, and I said "is that your underwear that's clean so that if you have to go to the hospital" I said, and "there's no holes in it, right?" and we both laughed for about five minutes because he knew the story also.
Story_ID: 7723
Speaker 1: So tell me about growing up because you grew up in Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Brooklyn, New York], right?
Speaker 2: (Nods).
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about, you know, growing up in that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, you shouldn't--you're saying Bedford-Stuyvesant like it's "Tombstone Territory" or something like out of the "Wild West," and so I--.
Speaker 1: I said it like it was what?
Speaker 2: No, I want to explain that it wasn't the "Wild West," all right.
Speaker 1: I didn't say it was the "Wild West."  I didn't even act like that!  I was just calling it shorthand Bed-Stuy.  Now that was your interpretation.
Speaker 2: No, no, no. Well, maybe I just--when people say tell me about Bed-Stuy like it's--you know.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Like a frontier town and, you know, going across the street.
Speaker 1: No, that's not what I was referring.
Speaker 2: You're lucky to get home. (Laughs).
Speaker 1: No, I didn't even--really I don't know--I'm not from New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, Bedford-Stuyvesant had at the time--you know, it's interesting.  I grew up there from age two in what was Bedford-Stuyvesant.  It was both a black and white community, predominantly black, but I remember growing up with Lennie, the guy's name was.  He was a white kid that lived on the block, and one day he just wasn't there.  I don't remember whether he picked up and moved.  He lived--I can remember the house and the address where he actually lived.  There were probably three or four other white families on the block out of--let's see--on one side of the street there had to have been at least forty, fifty houses, on the other side forty rowhouses, brownstones, and I tell people now that was--we're talking, you know, fifty years ago, but those houses today would be worth in Manhattan [New York] three million dollars, five million dollars in terms of the quality of the houses.  Some that have been cut up a little bit to make rooms out of them and so forth, but the facades are all there, and the block and the brownstone and all that is there, and so what makes it not worth that money is the demise that has happened to the community because it lost the public and services one would expect, the amenities that go along with a complete neighborhood.  The grocery stores are at a minimum, the vegetable stores, and these are all the things that I remember growing up in Bedford-Stuyvesant.  My mother [Winifred Collette Sealy] would say "go to the corner store and get me two quarts of milk and bring it back," and if it was early in the morning, I tell people all the time, the milk would be piled up outside with ice on it in cases, and the bags of rolls would still be there until the shopkeeper got there, the owner of the store got there.  Well, God forbid today in the same Bedford-Stuyvesant if that milk was piled up outside and the bread was sitting there.  I mean, that would be gone very, very quickly.  Now that doesn't mean that the people are hardened criminals.  It's just that we're living in a different time where a kid would think of taking something, maybe a lock.  Well, it never even crossed their minds to do that [when I was growing up there].  I mean I, I passed that bread and and milk every morning and hundreds of people passing it, some going to work, others going to school, others going to do business and--but it was never in your mind that--you know, and the vegetable store which is--probably I'd walk maybe a hundred yards, one hundred fifty yards to the corner, passing several other homes, and make a left turn, and there were--that was a busy street where you went and you shopped.  There was a meat store with no grate over the front door, and there was a bar and grill, and then there was a huge vegetable store where--owned by an Italian family, and all the vegetables were put outside as we often see in midtown Manhattan today but well presented, if you will.  There was a TV electronics store, again with no grate in front of the door.  When the man closed, there was just a plate glass window.  Today I dare say he probably could not do that.  Now the scourge of drugs has really gotten to not only our community but to many communities that were very healthy communities years ago, and therefore when you have a person who is desperate for drugs, he or she would do anything, and so therefore that's a part of the demise, but also as people have started to do better financially in terms of what they find--the circumstances in which they find themselves in economically, they tend to want to move up in life and move out, and therefore I remember right after we got married I said to my wife "why don't we put a stake in the ground and say 'we're gonna change Bedford Stuyvesant.'"
Story_ID: 7724
Speaker 1: I've been married forty years so if you just peel back forty years to 1960, I had been working for [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy, and it was '65 [1965] to '68 [1968] so actually when I started having these conversations [about improving Bedford-Stuyvesant], it was more like about the time that I was working for Kennedy, '65 [1965], '68 [1968], and I said "look, you know,we can do it.  I can find other middle class people.  We can get together.  We can pick one school.  We're gonna make that a better school.  It's not going to be a charter school.  It's not going to be a voucher system.  It's going to be a good public school because the principal is going to know that the parents care.  The teachers are gonna know they're gonna be held accountable, and I think we can do this," and she said--and my wife [Barbara Graves] who had been a teacher, because this was before--this is before, if you will, is before 'B-E,' 'Black Enterprise' Magazine, and so the enterprise feeling I had had to do with saving the community.  I thought that with the solidness of the homes and all that.  Well, in that time frame in 1968, Robert Kennedy tragically was assassinated so then I was out of work, although I had no concerns about finding another job or doing something else.  In that same environment [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed, and so you were living in that, and then my uncle, Uncle Joe who was the pharmacist, '68 [1968], I guess about three or four months after [Robert] Kennedy was assassinated, he was shot and killed in his drugstore by three youngsters.  This again was Bedford-Stuyvesant, and the youngster that killed him was thirteen years old so imagine some thirteen-year-old having a handgun with another kid who was fourteen or fifteen and the two of them came in.  They just got nervous, and he had his hands in the air doing nothing, and they still shot him so the Bedford-Stuyvesant that I knew growing up and the Bedford-Stuyvesant after I had been an army officer and had come back to the community living there 'cause when my wife and I married, she had grown up in another part of Bedford-Stuyvesant, and we came back to that brownstone house that my parents owned.  My father [Earl Godwin Graves] by that time, obviously, was deceased, and we rented an apartment from my mother [Winifred Collette Sealy], sixty dollars a month.  We had the first floor apartment.  It was a four-story brownstone by this time rather than just a two-family house, because she had created separate units, and we had the first floor.  And the amenities of what one would expect in our neighborhood--there was enough there in terms of the positiveness of the community, that when Robert Kennedy decided to do his Bedford-Stuyvesant Project, there was no question that the housing stock was--I remember I. M. Pei, the architect, and [philanthropist] Mrs. Vincent Astor and a host of other people who had an interest in trying to turn the community around and which Kennedy thought could be done.  I spent time there.  I remember visiting, entertaining, taking him on trips walking up and down the streets that I grew up in, you know, and there was no mean streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant at that time, and I was out there no later than last week, and you know, I had to remember to be sure to say to my driver "make sure you stay with the car.  If there's anything in the back of the car, make sure it's locked up," and because it's not that the people generally are bad.  It is just an element of people who are struggling to survive with whatever habits they have, and therefore they strike out to take things they think they want to make their own, irrespective of who it belongs to.
Story_ID: 7725
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I wanted to go--to just talk about your West Indian heritage because--but I want to talk about your West Indian heritage because both parents were from Barbados, right?
Speaker 2: Both grandparents were.
Speaker 1: Both grandparents.  Do you think that influenced your growing up because there is this whole discussion, you know, in the black community between--you know, some people really believe that people of West Indian heritage actually do better, achieve more, and are more focused, and I was just wondering if there was ever any discussion or, you know, in the household or anything that you were sort of told that.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, let me--for the record, my grandparents on my mother's side and my grandparents on my father's side both were born in Barbados in the West Indies. You know that's a coincidence, if you will, but I do think that people of West Indian background did seek each other out.  In other words, they--you kind of--they were the ones who were buying the homes in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York] at the time.  If you ask me how many kids were from the West Indies or their parents or their grandparents and how many were from the South, I think there was clearly a profusion of people who came from West Indian heritage, background, and quite frankly it wasn't anything where somebody said, you know, "you come from--you're different from somebody else."  It wasn't that at all.  My father never made it an option for us to be doing anything other than doing well in school.  That's what he said, and he didn't make it an option that you had school clothes, play clothes and church clothes, and God help you if you got those clothes confused in terms of what you were doing.  You came home from school, you put on your play clothes, and you decided well, I think I'll wear the things that I wear to church, you know, and he might have never known, but just the thought of what it was that could happen if he had found out made you understand you weren't to do it, and discipline was very much a part of it.  There were cultural things you did that was--you know, peas and rice.  You had that on Sunday, and you learned in calypso music and hearing that in the background and religion being a part of your life there.  Religion was a part of most of the growing up of people in Brooklyn [New York] where I grew up anyway, irrespective of whether or not those families came from the South or whether they came from the West Indies.  We were all a part--we were all "people of the sun," if you will.  Right?  And I didn't really know a difference.  I had friends who were friends.  I didn't know whether or not their parents came from the West Indies or their grandparents came from the West Indies.  I did know that there was a discipline about things we were gonna do.  I did know there were family gatherings that were important, and we carried that same tradition on in our own family.  Literally last night we had fifty relatives, some who flew in from Barbados.  We changed the date of the annual gathering of our Christmas party of the family so that they could get in to come together, and they came in, and they were greeted, you know, as another generation of children, and we started comparing pictures, and we had some old pictures on the wall, and so you had a sense of where you came from.  I have heard it said--I don't hold necessarily any validity to it--that what makes the difference between a West Indian household growing up or family, and what makes the difference of people, again--and I believe they're all people of the sun, we just got here a different way--is that people who come from the West Indies have a place that they consider home that has an anchor to it, and they therefore see it as that place, and if you come from Jamaica, Barbados, or the Bahamas or Trinidad, you know that you came from the place where freedom is a little bit more than what it is or was then back in the United States.  And therefore you not only thought of it [life in the West Indies] as better, but you actually romanticized it in your mind that "when I go home," right, "I own property.  I'm a man or a woman, and nobody tells me 'take a back seat' and I don't have--."  Now again, as I said to you, when I went to Barbados for the first time right after [Senator Robert F.] Kennedy's assassination in '68 [1968], and the country club of Barbados had black members but no more than one or two, and that had only recently happened, and so segregation, if you will, or not total integration clearly was not a fact of life in Barbados, but the government was run by people of color.  The hospital was run by people of color.  There was no question and you're talking--in the case of Barbados, you're talking where--a place where there was an over 90 percent literacy rate--if you just didn't go to school, and my father use to just just drive that home.  "You have to be educated.  You have to own something.  You have to be someone."  Now I cannot believe that whether it was [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s parents or someone else who comes from the South, and maybe Martin Luther King is too great because he'd have been great in any sphere that you would want to describe, but I can't think of any friends that I have who come from the South whose parents didn't want them to do well.  I mean, I think historically black parents really do have a sense that they want something more for their kids, and there's a sense of discipline within the black community.  Now where has that gotten lost?  It's gotten lost when you have babies having babies. They don't know any rules themselves, and all of a sudden they're sixteen.  They're thrust in--or younger--to being parents of youngsters, and therefore it's not a very happy life, and then there is what is missing.  It seemed to me there was always there was always a male figure in the black community growing up, and now when you have over almost a million African American and Hispanic men in jail, you have communities that are devoid of male dominance and male figure.  Dominance is the wrong word but certainly a male figure.  We had that growing up, and in church we had it.  Again, I went to an Episcopal Church where it turned out that many of the people--the Anglican Church is a very predominant religion within the West Indian community in the West Indies that was carried over, and so Saint Philip's Church in Brooklyn where we still go back on a regular basis have created and put up a large celestial stained-glass window in honor of our parents, both my wife's [Barbara Graves] parents who come from Anguilla and Beckway, again in the West Indies, and my parents.  There--you just had something that you held onto and knew about, and again, I'm no expert in this schism that ostensibly exists.  All I know is that there was a tradition.  There was a culture that you were expected to live by.
Story_ID: 7726
Speaker 1: The young Earl Graves dreamed of breaking out from his father's dominance and dreamed of being a superhero that he was not growing up because, one, of the dominance of my father, two, of the lack of resources that would have allowed that to happen, and three--my parents were not into Jack and Jill, and first of all, I don't think--I know we didn't have the resources, but they were not into Hansel and Gretel.  Both of these are not very African-American-sounding organizations, but they're organizations that middle class black parents put their kids into to have them meet other kids of equal stature, if you will, and so growing up, I--you know, I went to high school with X dollars in my hand for the week and had by this time--in many instances, I had a job, whether it was delivering telegrams or working at the library or working as a lifeguard at the beach, but I remember looking back, and I think of so many people that were my heroes, all right, that I wanted to be like.  You know, my father had this thing that "you gotta clean your room.  You gotta clean your house. You got a sidewalk to sweep," and therefore athletics or things that would've--Boy Scouting and all of that.  My mother really fought the fight to allow me to be in those things because in my father's mind all you had to do was study, and you know, maybe you'd be all right, and so there was very little love that went along with anything, and so I was--I lived in fear of my father so to say to you that I was rambunctious, that would be an overstatement, right?  To say he was a violent person, again we're back on my father, but let's just say that his rage or his demeanor in terms of wanting me to be a certain person caused me not to challenge it because of what I thought the consequences could be.  Yet I went out and I did run track, but I wasn't a star and I wanted to be, but I needed to practice more, and he didn't understand that, and I needed track shoes, and "no you don't need track shoes," and so therefore--and the school wasn't giving them to us at the time so the things I wanted to do--I mean, and then in terms of social activities, if we went to a party, you had to be home at a certain time whereas it seemed to me that all my friends were coming and going when they wanted to, and so therefore I considered that shackles on me, if you will, that made me a very unhappy youngster, from the point of view of wanting to do those things.  It was a great frustration.  That's the best way to put it.  Now, when I look back at it now, and I often say to my wife, I said, "you know, there was a lot of things I wanted growing up," you know, and now that I have it this way, I'm much happier that I got it at the end rather than having it in the beginning because the people who were my heroes, I am now their hero, and I said that may sound immodest, but I get letters all the time from people that said "we were in the fourth grade together" or "I'm so proud of you," and I look at the letter and say wait, this was the person that I thought was, you know, my hero, and now they're writing and saying to me, can I--would I write a letter for their kids to get into college or would I speak at their church or they went to a certain college and would I consider being a graduation speaker at their school, and I must say the people who were heroes to me, and I guess there were some "she-roes" [heroines], people that you know, people, you know, that I admired and what they did, those same people today are--I'm their hero, which is very--let's see what word I want to use is almost embarrassing in a way, you know.  They're saying--you know, you don't understand.  "You were my hero."  [Dr.] John Hope Franklin [historian], right, who I got to know in later life.  I knew who he was.  I mean, there he was, and he calls me up and says "would I be bothering you if I talk," and I said "you're John Hope Franklin.  How could you be bothering me," you know?
Story_ID: 7727
Speaker 1: The names wouldn't mean anything.  There were--you know, I wanted to be a track star, and I went to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] where everybody was a world-class athlete.  When I was in high school, I wanted to be a track star, but I didn't have the time.  My parents were not about to let me.  Every afternoon my father [Earl Godwin Graves] wanted to know if I was coming home to study or I had a job, much less talking about going to track practice every day, and so--and yet I did.  I mean, I went to Erasmus Hall [High School, Brooklyn, New York], and then I was--I just didn't get challenged to be--or I didn't challenge myself enough, but I wanted to be the hero of some of the people that I saw who were star athletes, all right.  I wanted--you know, I wanted to be the "big man on campus," if you will, all right, and first of all, going to a school where I did not grow up, where I didn't live in that neighborhood, I went to Erasmus Hall High School, and I was an hour away from--the high school was an hour away from where I lived [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn], and therefore--and it was the same high school my dad had gone to.  He wanted me to go to that school because in New York City at that time there was segregation in terms of where black and Hispanic kids could go to school.  You were zoned based on where you lived, and therefore it was a nice way of keeping blacks and Hispanics within their own community and not have them coming over into those nice white, lily white schools, which was what was going on at the time.  Again we're talking the '50s [1950s], and so while we were still saying this segregation is a terrible thing happening in the South, it was a terrible thing happening in the North.  They just were a little bit more subtle and in some instances not so subtle, and so having friends who could be my heroes--most kids lived within if you were walking distance or a short bus ride to get to high school.  I lived two trains to get and then a long walk to get to high school, and so therefore the opportunity to have close friends--I had friends, and some of who, both black and white, are still close friends today.  We didn't run in the same neighborhood, all right?  Even my good friend who is now godfather of one of our oldest boy and who is a friend of mine, I'm his hero today, but he at least played on the basketball team and got to be outstanding, and when I went to Morgan, I would've picked the school to run track where everybody's a world-class athlete, and so even though I was average and another place might have been a little bit better because average at Morgan State just didn't get it in terms of what you needed to be, and so again it was a matter of heroes, whether or not those people were people who were doing well academically or whether they were doing--whether or not they were doing well in sports, that wasn't me, and I got out of the army and ended up playing football and being a part of a semi-pro team.  We came out on the weekends and beat ourselves up, and then meanwhile during the week, we were doing anything else from teaching school to being lawyers to whatever else you might have done, and yet we came together and played this sandlot football where there was no insurance, and you went out - this finger to this day is not straight from somebody - me slugging somebody when, you know, when I wasn't supposed to and looking down and seeing a broken finger.

Speaker 1: At the time that I was coming into my senior year or junior year, I really didn't know what I was gonna do.  I just knew that I wanted to do something, an education, and wasn't too realistic about it.  I mean, I wasn't going--knew I wasn't going to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and so that was not even on the screen, and I met a gentleman by the name of Sam Young who worked at the Brooklyn Public Library [New York].  He was a--had a master's degree in library science and was a--whatever one is with that kind of educational background back then.  I think it was pretty important, but he had gone to Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland], and he talked about Morgan State, it seemed to me, every day, how Morgan State had done this and how Morgan State had done that, and I kept saying--and he said "you ought to come on and go to Morgan State."  He said "I think we can take you down, you know, to see the place," and I said "look, I don't even know if I have the resources to go."  I knew I wasn't gonna get any help from my parents, and yet the thrill of the idea of being away and finally breaking away from this guy who was, you know, still this tyrant and not getting better, I think, as he got older  In fact, I did feel sorry for my sister [June Jones] because she didn't have a chance to get away nor did my other brother [Robert Graves] and sister [Sandra Graves].  The sister I keep referencing is the one who's closest to me in terms of age, and so we went down.  He said to me finally "we've arranged this thing, and I can--"I'm still trying to remember if we went by bus or we went by car.  I don't remember if he had a car or if we went by bus.  I often thought, I said, what--my first trip down to Morgan.  How did we get there?  Well, the point is we got there.  We got there on Baccalaureal Sunday which meant that that was the time that we had the religious service on the campus, and it was a rainy day but not so rainy that there were not a bunch of guys walking around with very sharp-looking second lieutenant uniforms on.  They were graduating as officers in the United States Army, and that was their day to put on their uniform.  Well, I had not seen anything like that before ever.  Here was this campus where you walked around in green lawns and dormitories and all that, and I said "wow.  This would be awesome," and I went back home and said to my parents "I want to go away to school," and my mother [Winifred Collette Sealy] said "fine."  My father [Earl Godwin Graves] always asked the prudent question--"how?"  I said "I'll save money."  He said "well, remember you still have to put money into the household" because he felt that if you worked, part of what you earned, you should put back into the family, and at that point I see my reasoning.  Here I was trying to save money for school, gonna get myself to college and on top of it, and it wasn't that he wasn't working.  His work ethic just said "if you're working, you should put something back into the home."  Well, I saved money in order to go off to Morgan in the class of 50, class of 1957, meaning we went off to school in '53 [1953], and I left to go to school, knowing I needed $619, which is what the total tuition, room, and board was at the time.  It was literally less than $700.  I think I left with about four or $500 that I had saved up and I think two suits and one sport jacket or two sport jackets and one suit.  Maybe there was a second suit.  I just can't remember, but it certainly was not anything extensive in terms of packing myself up to go away to college and went there, got on the campus, knew I had limited resources, knew I was gonna joint the ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps], which I did. That paid me $29 a month.  I knew I was gonna start and try to find jobs as quickly as I could on the campus, and I did, and I was into an experience that, as I said to you, was a long journey from struggling in my first year and second year.  By the time I got into my second year, I was well into the stride of having jobs on campus.  I paid my own way through school with the exception of some modest assistance I got from Uncle Joe, who was a pharmacist who I would go to see just before I went back to school, and he might give me a couple hundred dollars, three or $400, depending.  It was never more than that that I would ask for in terms of monies I would hope to get, and today that journey has taken me to get an honorary degree--not the first one, although there are those who would say my undergraduate degree was an honorary degree also, but to get an honorary degree, a doctorate from Morgan State back in 1973, I think it was, so twenty years after I graduated that was happening, and now I have almost fifty honorary degrees from--you name the school, whether or not it's Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or whether or not it is Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] or just a myriad of schools across this country, and so when I say it's been a long journey, it's been a long rewarding journey, and those same people who are now at Morgan are giving me honorary degrees and all the other accolades that go--naming the school,  business school after me [Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management]--the same people in many instances who are--they were my heroes, and yet today I am theirs, and so as I said, it's a long journey, but it has its rewards.
Story_ID: 7729
Speaker 1: This is my last Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] question, but when you went there, that opened up a whole different world for you.  Didn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: And what was that world that you saw?
Speaker 2: When I went off to Morgan, you know, as much--as learned as I thought I was, I really had really never been very much further than Long Island [New York].  I know I had not gotten--I hadn't gone to New Jersey.  I really hadn't gone anywhere, and so to arrive in Baltimore [Maryland] and show up on a campus where these kids--and I thought that I was coming to be reasonably sharp, you know, and growing up in the high school that I went to [Erasmus Hall High School, Brooklyn, New York], most of those white kids put on a pair of chinos and a shirt and came on to school, and they really didn't much care how they dressed, and when I got down there to Morgan, these kids had been dressing like they came right out of Brooks Brothers which did impress me.  I mean, they looked collegiate.  They looked like they were part of the campus, and it is not the dress down that you see today. These kids dressed up and looked very much a part of what I envisioned a college campus should look like.  They indeed looked that way, and that was the part which was striking to me about the campus.  Give me the background of the question you were asking me again.  I apologize.
Speaker 1: I was just asking what world did it open up for you because, you know, you lived here n New York and.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Got it.
Speaker 1: And college is an acculturation process anyway.
Speaker 2: That's a big word.  The reason I mentioned the dressing part is because I thought Baltimore opened up another whole community.  I had really not seen a suburban community like Baltimore before where kids had gone to public school together, high school together, and segregated schools again, but they achieved great things.  I mean, one kid--if you went to Dunbar High School, that was one part of the city of Baltimore you lived in, and if you went to another high school, that was another part of the high school, of the city of Baltimore, and they were outstanding athletes, and so the idea of having the whole culture that went with going to high school.  Those kids did their college environment, if you will, in high school, and I was first finding out about a college environment when I got there on that campus.  That made a difference for me in terms of what I saw and what I thought and what I wanted for myself.  I made up my mind I was gonna have money when I was on the campus, and I started thinking about having businesses where I could hire my fraternity brothers [Alpha Phi Alpha], and I did.  I made up my mind if there were any jobs available on the campus, irrespective we were talking about a security guard and you were talking about waiting tables, which I did regularly, I was not gonna say "no" to any of those things because it enabled me to have monies to do whatever it is I wanted to do within reason.
Story_ID: 7730
Speaker 1: And you were also probably responsible for yourself so that kept you then thinking entrepreneurial in a way.
Speaker 2: Well, no, first of all, because there was nobody else to be responsible for me, I really never gave it much thought.  I mean, I didn't think there was some kind of reaching back and saying "can you send me some money?"  I think my father [Earl Godwin Graves] sent me once thirty or forty dollars, and I realized I accepted it almost with a guilt because I realize for them to send me forty, fifty dollars back then was a pile of money that they strained and gave me because I said they wanted to do something, and so I tried to keep that to a minimum so that they didn't have to feel that strain, and I remember the tragedy of getting the call in my junior year at night from my Uncle Sam saying to me my father had had--at first I think he said "an accident."  I said "what kind of accident?"  He said "well, he had a heart attack."  I said "that's not an accident.  That's a medical problem."  I said "how bad is it?" and he said "he's gone."  I said "where'd he go," and he meant he was deceased, you know, and so--but I--the Dean of Men came to preach at the school, at the funeral, from Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].  There were members of the choir who came, and today when I recently had--my wife and I had a dedication of a stained-glass window in the name of our parents, I paid for the choir to come up from Morgan State to be there and put 'em all up in a Marriott Hotel, and so that again--it was--it's a long journey, but it has a happy ending.
Story_ID: 7731
Speaker 1: Now so you are--you're set to graduate, and what are your thoughts at this point?  You've joined--you're part of ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps] at that point, but what are your thoughts then?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew I was getting out, and I was gonna go into the Army, and I was gonna be making less than two hundred--I think it was somewhere between $237 a month.  That was what they paid a young second lieutenant at the time.  I knew I wanted to go to schools that were gonna sit clearly as a--I was gonna be an infantry officer so I wanted to go to airborne school, I wanted to go to ranger school because those would give you an advantage, if you will, in terms of how sharp a soldier you were supposed to be and because the service was then at that point had only been integrated for about four years.  There were people still getting over that, and then in addition to that, there were so few things.  There was no corporations on campus offering jobs, and so there were so few ways that you could show that you were equal to your white counterpart that the ROTC by virtue of its "integration" enabled you to be equal to the person standing next to you, whether or not that person was a tall white person or a short white person.
Speaker 1: And how long were you in the army?
Speaker 2: Full time.  Just two years.  Now I was in the reserve for several years and end up being a captain in the special forces.
Speaker 1: Was it during that time that you became a Green Beret [U.S. Army Special Forces]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  Aren't Green Berets chosen specially or?
Speaker 2: Well it was by--I mean, please.  I could have been chosen, but first you have to volunteer. That's number one, right, and having had airborne and ranger training, both you know because again that was one more time that you were trying to prove to the world how good you really were, that enabled me to--when they formed the Special Forces unit in the United States and then specifically in my geographic area, which is the eastern part of the United States, I volunteered to join.  I was probably one of the most qualified coming into that unit 'cause they were forming the unit to send people off to get training and do much of the training I already had.  It did make an enormous difference, and I found that the training for the special forces was clearly much more demanding than it was for the regular reserve infantry unit that I was in, but I relished that.  I mean, I always wanted to be the best, and so if you look around my office, you see it still looks very much like the military.  There's no papers all over the desk.  Now it may look that way in the middle of the day.  By the time I'm going home at night, it won't, because I think things have to be done in a certain discipline and done in a certain way, and the military teaches that well, and I often find myself referencing my experiences in the military and the difference that it made in terms of where I am today.
Story_ID: 7732
Speaker 1: You know, you spent your two years in there [US Armed Forces] and then you got out, and I was asking about what was next.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: You said you got married.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, but maybe first of all, I was fortunate to have met my wife [Barbara Graves] back in--it must have been '58 [1958], and I knew in the beginning, I mean, she was just a special lady, and we were married forty years.  Last night we fell asleep holding each other and holding hands, and I think that's a part of what it means and how important she is.  She has some knee problems, and I tell her she's getting old.  She says "no," and she got up this morning at a quarter to six and went out the door to exercise to the gym that she goes to, but I knew meeting her that she was the lady that I probably wanted to spend the rest of my life with, all right, and I also thought that, you know, I didn't quite have the rules straight in my mind so in my thinking, when I--and I do want to come back to getting out and how I got a job because that was part of what I need to do obviously--but you know being a second lieutenant and a first lieutenant in the army, I mean, you were the "cat's meow," and so therefore--I mean, when I met her, she was like one of a lot of ladies that I knew and--what made her special is she didn't hold me in awe which disturbed me, you know, because I said "you realize I'm, you know, a lieutenant in the army?  I jump out of airplanes.  I eat snakes, you know.  I'm a fraternity guy, and you know.  I mean, for me to even call you is, you know, you're blessed."  That's part of the frivolous, being frivolous and being of youth, if you will, because I look back on it and the arrogance.
Story_ID: 7733
Speaker 1: I had taken a real estate course at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] and had been intrigued by it because of the monies that it was explained that you could earn, and I remember it very, very well.  There was a professor by the name of Sporgan, a visiting professor, and he laid out what a commission salesman made and what a broker made and what kind of monies they could realize, and he was talking about monies that you could make almost in the sale of two houses that would be equal to what teachers were getting paid or what people working in the government were getting paid at that time and in that area where I thought I could make a mark for myself, and so I said "I think I want to be in real estate," and I didn't know what to do so I looked and went to the Yellow Pages.  I believed the ad, which then was not very often on television but looked up where were the real estate offices in Brooklyn [New York] close to my house, and then I somehow met someone who told me about one office, and I went to talk to the owner who was white, and he said he really didn't need a retail sales staff, that they could handle their--the influx of people coming in without having to have a regular staff, but he said he did know of an office that had a large staff of salesman, and maybe I'd be interested in it.  Well, the rest is history.  It was called Ajax Real Estate, A-J-A-X.  I went over to see the owner who was at 1:00 in the day a little bit smashed out of his mind from having consumed more alcohol than he needed to at that time of the day, but he saw me come to the door with my Green Beret [U.S. Army Special Forces] and my commendation ribbons, and he looked at me and said "wow, will you look at that green Christmas tree coming in here," and--but we hit it off right away.  They used to call him "Three Martini Jackson."  His name was Jackaman actually, but we called him that because most days by 12:00 he'd had three martinis, and three kinds of any kind of liquor drinks will get you messed up--three martinis and you don't really know which way is up, but when I got involved in real estate, did very, very well in my first three months.  I sold nine houses which is kind of unheard of, but again I--we were talking about salesmanship and selling, and there is nothing I consider myself much better than or much better at than being a salesperson.
Story_ID: 7734
Speaker 1: So how long were you involved in selling real estate then?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I was involved in selling real estate from--let me get my dates straight--'60 [1960] to somewhere in the early '60s [1960s], '61 [1961], something like that, all right, working at that office [Ajax Real Estate], and then I was able to--I took a government examination to work as a federal agent for the government, passed that, and went to work doing that, and that's the time that [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy--that would have been--Robert Kennedy--that's the time [President] John [F.] Kennedy was President, and Robert Kennedy was Attorney General.  I'm trying to get my dates here together, and then we had the tragedy of John Kennedy's assassination [1963] and Robert Kennedy coming to New York to run for the Senate, my volunteering and meeting him in a very tangential way, and then being challenged to really see if I would want to work for him full-time which was again mind-blowing, but it was the activities I'd been involved in as volunteer for him that made him recognize that I probably would be a good full-time employee, and that's when he offered me a job.
Speaker 1: Why did you get involved in politics?  What was the interest?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well.
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, 'cause a lot of people don't necessarily.
Speaker 2: Let me explain to you what happened to me when I got out of, was getting ready to get out of the service [U.S. Armed Forces, Green Berets].  An officer friend of mine said to me "let me give you some advice."  I think this guy was a captain or major.  He said "you ought to do three things when you get back to New York--one, join the [U.S.] National Guard, two, get involved in politics, and three, stay involved with the Boy Scouts [of America]."  I did all three.  Now we could spend another hour talking about how I did all three, but I had been involved in Scouting while I was in the service.  I was actually running the Boy Scout troop at Fort Dix, New Jersey.  We had a hundred kids in the troop, but I had all kinds of assistance, but I was the Scoutmaster, and I received as much respect as some of the generals on campus because I was taking care of all of these kids on weekends and camp-outs and the like, which turned out to be terrific.  As far as the political thing is concerned, I wrote a letter to the Democratic National Committee, said that I was involved--interested in being involved in politics, and they wrote back and said "yeah, yeah, yeah."  It was the Democratic National Committee of New York State, and so they told me to come into New York and meet with someone which I did, and I started doing some advance work, not knowing what advancing was, and then [Robert] Kennedy came to town, and the rest is kind of history. I mean, I started working for him full-time in 1965, and the third thing was to be involved in the Boy Scouts.  I had been--I covered the Boy Scout one, I think.  Then the third one--the second one was be involved politically, and I gave you that one, and the third one was stay in the reserves, and that's--so when I got out, I had gone to airborne school and ranger school and the like, but I really was not in a unit, and somebody said "join the National Guard."  I went down and signed up, and they started--I went to three different armories in New York City that had units--they were infantry units--before I could find one of them that would at least entertain the idea of having a black officer in the unit.
Story_ID: 7735
Speaker 1: So it was a big deal when you went to work for him [Senator Robert F. Kennedy].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yes, it was.  Going to work for Robert--going to work for a Congress, for a Senator is a big deal.  Going to work for Senator Robert Kennedy, that is a big--that was a big deal at the time.
Speaker 1: So what was that whole experience--I mean, what--this is a new experience like Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] was, and you know, I mean, we all have transitions and.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, working in Kennedy's office there was the following motto.  We used to kid around.  "The unbelievable we do immediately, and the impossible just takes a little longer," all right?  I mean, working for Robert Kennedy was like every day was Monday high noon, and you were running full pace all the time so I look and I see this transitioning happening with the new president-elect coming in [President George W. Bush], and he's leisurely doing this or doing that and going off to watch a football game or whatever else he does.  That was not the case as far as Robert Kennedy was concerned.  I mean, literally we had a staff of about sixty-five people if you added up all three offices, and we were hustling all the time to project "that's our senator" and to have him have the position of senior United States Senator, which he was not.  It was [Senator] Jacob Javits was ahead of him, but you'd have thought it was the other way around.
Speaker 1: Can you just say things that you may have learned during that experience, just real quickly?
Speaker 2: Well, I--in Kennedy's office everything got done well.  It got done efficiently, and there was none of this "oh gosh, what do I do now?"  I mean, I can give you a perfect example.  I hadn't worked in Robert Kennedy's office.  Last night I looked up, and here were eight relatives coming through the door we had not expected for our Christmas party.  I said "what am I gonna do?"  It's Sunday, and I said "wait a minute.  You're on the Board of Directors of a major department store."  Calmly pick up the phone and call somebody, dialed into Bloomingdale's [department store] in Westchester County [New York] and said "look, here's Mr. Graves from the Board.  Are you the store manager on duty?"  "Yes, I am."  "Okay, look, I need nine gifts over here, twelve if you will, at my house, and it's four o'clock now, and I don't need them before seven, and please wrap them, and here's the price and what I want to spend" and hang up the phone, but that's how you knew to execute things.  Now that may not seem like a big deal, but you got to look at all your resources all the time and say what are those resources gonna do for me?  How can I--I mean, and that's what I do to leverage things.  You know, I'm not using and abusing people.  What I'm doing is building on the relationships that I have built on over the years and so therefore as people will do with me.  "I'm gonna ask Earl Graves to make a call for me to X school about something.  I'm gonna ask Mr. Graves to make a call about business for me," and that's what we're about.
Speaker 1: Now he died.  He got killed so what happened there?  You had to--you had--that was.
Speaker 2: First of all, it was devastating that he could be dead, and the other thing is is that when you're working for the United States Senate, it's not like working at Macy's [department store] where, you know, when the store manager dies, I mean, they don't close the store and go out of business.  The new manager comes in, and you keep right on going.  When a senator of the United States is killed or dies, the party is over right then.  There is no turning back and saying "well, you know, he intended to do X or he intended to do Y."  It's just over for that person, and so therefore the advent of Kennedy's assassination is a matter of "what am I gonna do?"  I thought I was going to Washington [D.C.] and work in what would have been a Kennedy [presidential] administration, the second Kennedy administration, and now I really don't have anything going on.  Now I had seen or been aware that Kennedy had several consultants that worked for him, all right, consultants in health care, consultants in real estate development, and consultants in education, and so I said to myself, "that's what I ought to be."  I ought to become a consultant because seems to me that there sphere of influence and their sphere of knowledge can be everywhere, and therefore that's what I'd want to do.
Story_ID: 7736
Speaker 1: You were saying that you--that was sort of devastating, the whole thing when he [Senator Robert F. Kennedy] died because the--you know, it's not like you can just go and--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Work someplace else, but you basically went--there was a--you got a Ford Foundation grant.
Speaker 2: A work-study grant from the Ford Foundation, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  To study entrepreneurship?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, yes.  That's true.  With the advent of the tragedy of Robert Kennedy's death [1968], the Ford Foundation and [Ford Foundation head] McGeorge Bundy obviously had been very close and wanted to do something for some of the staff members, and so there were a half a dozen of us who were offered work-study grants which meant for six months they would keep you at the same salary level you had been at working for Kennedy, which gave you a little lease on life, if you will, so of the sixty-five people working in his office, I think there were a half a dozen of us who received these stipends.  Now you had to do something for it.  It wasn't just somebody who was just going to hand you some money, and so I said that I wanted to find out how entrepreneurship worked and why it was working in the Caribbean and why we were not doing as well here in the United States, and they granted me this work-study grant for six months, and I went off to Barbados, which is the land of my grandparents and ancestors.  I remember as we were flying in, looking down at the beaches and looking down at the land and saying "wow! this is where my grandfather walked around, and I'm coming back here now, and it's too bad he's not here to show me around and say 'this is what it was all about' and 'here's where I am,'" but that was wishful thinking, but it also--but that grant did enable me to take a look at entrepreneurship.  It also told me that although the country--government was black-run, that the businesses were not necessarily in the first instance owned or controlled by people of color, and that--unfortunately that's still true today to a great extent.  If you go to the Caribbean, the major businesses are really not controlled by people of color.  Now that's not an indictment of them.  That's an indictment of the system which has made that happen over the years and continues to happen, but I did come back with an idea for a germ of a thing called a newsletter.  When I came back from the Caribbean, I knew enough about where I thought I wanted to go and what I wanted to do that I wanted to do it on my own, that I didn't want to work for IBM [Corporation] which had been an option offered to many of the staff people who worked for Kennedy, including myself.  I came back with a sense of "I want to do something to own my own business.  I want to be able to control my own destiny, and if that destiny says that I'm gonna do well, then I will do well," and I never considered doing anything other than doing well, and the reason I'm such a good marketer or salesman, if you will, is because I really believe in myself and what it is I think I can achieve, and I make other people believe it, and there's a credibility about it because I think you do have to have credibility in terms of if you say you're gonna do something, you gotta do it, and it worked for me.
Story_ID: 7737
Speaker 1: And so you came back and what do you--what's the first thing that you do now?
Speaker 2: Back from Barbados?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I came back [from a Ford Foundation work-study grant] and made up my mind.  I said to Barbara [Graves], my wife, I said you know, I want to have a consulting firm because consulting meant--you know, I'm sure I said--all the time people say they're consulting, and I said "I wonder if that person knows what they're doing," and we tell the joke that when we told my in-laws, they said "well, what kind of work is Earl gonna do now?  What kind of a job is he gonna have now that [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy has been assassinated?" [1968]  And my wife said to my father-in-law "oh, he's gonna be a consultant."  My father-in-law shook his head and thought for a second.  He said "oh, yeah, that's good," he said, "but what kind of work is he gonna do?"  Because consultancy was this amorphous thing that had no meaning at all to my father-in-law and not that much to me, but I started a consulting firm in 1968 and really have not looked back.  The magazine's ['Black Enterprise'] first issue came out August of 1970, and it's received every award you possibly can receive today.  It is the bible, if you will, in the black community of those in business and those in the professions, and it's something which is very thrilling to me, and still when I see an issue come out, looking down at that cover and knowing what it is we accomplished and how we accomplished it.
Speaker 1: You had heightened access during the Kennedy years.  I mean, you were--you became a player even, and so how do you think--what did that experience open up for you, I guess, is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: Working for Robert Kennedy put my life on fast-forward because I--again, I was giving you an example of getting things done.  "The unbelievable we did immediately; the impossible took a little longer," but you learned if he said "I'm coming to town" and you were the advance man, you got there and you made sure there was a crowd if you had to pull a fire alarm, but you were gonna get a crowd.  It made you disciplined in the point of view of time.  It made you disciplined in terms of leaving nothing to chance, and so it was an extraordinary thing working for Robert Kennedy, and he was a compassionate person.
Speaker 1: Now so you started consulting.  What were you consulting in those few years before--?
Speaker 2: Well, the--I started--when I started consulting, I started consulting in the areas that I had been involved in in his office, health care delivery services, which meant that you were going back to the same hospitals where you were beating their brains in because they weren't doing what they were supposed to and saying to them "look, I'm available now to help you, consulting-wise, put together the kind of program you need to have as far as your hospital is concerned or your health agency."  I worked on a thing called physical development, but it really was real estate development and taking a look a that.  Of course, I was involved in real estate after his assassination for--must have been five or six years, and I was very good at that so I could say look at those options.
Story_ID: 7738
Speaker 1: Now when you were getting ready to start 'Black Enterprise,' did you start actually as a newsletter or what did you?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't.
Speaker 1: Did it start as--you were gonna start as a newsletter?
Speaker 2: I was thinking about a newsletter, and what happened was the person who I was talking to said "you're gonna do a newsletter?  Why don't you do a magazine?"  Well, since I didn't know much about newsletters, magazine was a good idea also.  Now I did know something about advertising because in the political campaigns you used advertising agents.  I also knew that they usually didn't get paid.  Maybe they got twenty cents on the dollar if they got lucky.  In the case of [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy, I think his person did get paid, and of course, he won so that made a big difference.  When you win, things are much more upbeat than when you lose, and then you're walking around town figuring out "where can you get the money" because nobody really wants to bankroll a losing candidate.
Story_ID: 7739
Speaker 1: So you decide to start this.  Do you consult anyone in the in the publishing arena at all?  Do you.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You don't.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You just say "I'm gonna go do this."
Speaker 2: No, no.  I consulted people in the advertising to see whether or not they thought a book like--I use the word book and magazine interchangeably--whether a magazine like ours could fare well, and they said "yes, they did think so," all right, and I made it a point of talking to those people whether or not you were talking about somebody at an ad agency or somebody in the company that I knew I could come back to once I had my entity up and running to see whether or not they'd give us some business.
Speaker 1: What were your visions for this?  Was it as grandiose?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I mean, my vision for the magazine was to literally be a how-to magazine for the black community that talked about how you do business, how you make it in your profession, management skills and the like, and I think we've cut--I think we've made that happen with an "A plus."
Speaker 1: You know what I find very curious about this, Mr. Graves, is that that was not a lot of the discussion that was happening around that time.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't, but fortuitously I could see the advent of African Americans going to work at corporations, being on boards of directors, and starting to get some loans from government that allowed us to get into business, and all of that started to come together as a result of the Civil Rights Movement, and so by 1970, you know, the opportunities were starting to crack ever so slightly, and I was able to ride that crest in terms of 'Black Enterprise' magazine.
Story_ID: 7740
Speaker 1: I wanted you to pinpoint watershed points or years in the magazine's ['Black Enterprise'] existence.
Speaker 2: Well, if we look back on watershed years for what happened with the magazine, the first thing is just getting the first issue out in itself.  Giving birth to a new magazine is an adventure.  Nine out of ten magazines fail.  I really never considered that.  I just knew that I was gonna get on with what I had to do, and so failure was not an option. (Pause). Still not focused on the question, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: What about your first publication?  How many people were actually working with you?  I mean, who was?
Speaker 2: We had a staff--in our very first issue of the magazine we had a staff at that time of about maybe fifteen people, all right, maybe ten.  I mean, when I stop and look back on it, we had an editor.  We had an assistant editor.  We had a production manager so maybe we had more like ten, and we got it out, and to say it was an "instant success" would be a little bit of exaggeration, but it was clearly something people responded to very quickly because there was nothing else like it out there, and I was talking about business.
Story_ID: 7741
Speaker 1: But you had some people who were real naysayers at the beginning.
Speaker 2: (Nods for yes).
Speaker 1: Who said that this, you know--.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, if you look at it, at the time I started the magazine ['Black Enterprise'], it was gonna be a magazine skewed to upscale African Americans both in the professions and their own entrepreneurs, and so to have a magazine that was gonna speak to that when we still were just getting out of the Civil Rights Movement, there were no African Americans to speak of working at major corporations, and clearly there were not thousands and thousands of us owning our own businesses so in that environment, one could not be overly optimistic of what we could hope to see come out of it, and yet because things fell in line right, there was an interest.  I was speaking to those things which were key to success in America, and that is economic stability, and it just worked.
Story_ID: 7742
Speaker 1: There were people who said the magazine wouldn't make it because where were these executives gonna come from?  We were just--we were not yet in the halcyon days of people deciding they needed--everyone needed to have a black working at their corporation.  We were not in the days yet where clearly the things had opened up and people said "African Americans ought be in business," which came along in the [President Richard] Nixon era, if you remember when he became President of the United States, and here I am saying "I'm gonna have a magazine that's gonna speak to those people," and the advertisers would say "who are they?  Where are they?"  Now I vindicated myself by being at the right cutting edge at the time that indeed these people did come along.  They were starting to work in service in major corporations.  They were starting to work in agencies where historically, African Americans had not been, and they were starting to look at owning their own businesses, whether or not it was Dick Gidron and Al Johnson owning the first Cadillac [automobile] dealerships, one in Chicago [Illinois] and one in New York [New York], and whether or not it was 'Essence' magazine starting, which started the same time we ['Black Enterprise' magazine, 1970] did, whether or not it was BET [Black Entertainment Television] that started somewhat after us [1980] but still in that same whole era, and so those were the business types, and then in addition Chase Manhattan Bank was putting its first African American on the board, and so was Citibank, and so was Ford [Motor Company], and so was General Motors [Corporation], and many of those same people were also working within those companies so I had hit upon some halcyon days, didn't realize it, and thirty years later we're still very much a key factor in what happens to--in the black community.
Story_ID: 7743
Speaker 1: Can you just give me some anecdotes, some things you would like to share--that's all--you know, about things that happened because they were humorous or they were real rallying points or they were real--give me three of them.
Speaker 2: There were so many things in the last thirty year history of 'Black Enterprise' [magazine] that have been humorous at some points, poignant at others, made you angry at others.  A lot of times you were angry.  I think that one of the breakthroughs for us came when we decided to start doing the listing of the 'Black Enterprise' 100 in 1973.  We sat around, and we said "where's the list of the leading black people and what they're doing," and they said "there is no list like that," and we said "well, how would we do one?"  I mean, that's got to be fairly challenging.  How would you identify advertising agencies which were in the first instance never really put on the list because they work off of commissions, if you will.  They get paid a net amount for the business they place, and therefore it's very hard to measure them. But now we list them in a different way in a different category in terms of what they do.
Story_ID: 7744
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the "'BE' ['Black Enterprise'] 100" [list of prominent African Americans in business] was clearly a high-water mark for us in terms of what we were doing.  Also, doing the list of the best places to work for African Americans, the best places to do business, and the best places to live for African Americans--those were important lists that we've done.  In our March [2001] issue coming up, we'll do a list of the top people, technology people in the country in terms of who's who on the Internet and the like and what they're doing and how.  Now I mean, each point and step along the way, I think we broke new ground.  We broke new ground because we had to convince advertisers that African Americans were achieving, that African Americans were positioned in business, and that African Americans were gonna be able to accomplish the kinds of things, say, that a [Secretary of State] Colin Powell has in terms of what it is that he is recognized for today.  That was a long journey again.  Racism is alive and well in the advertising community.  There are very few young people today who are coming along try as--now in the advertising community does to bring African Americans along to getting them to go from an entry level job to twenty-five years out where they have a senior position.  That's tricky.  Now you say well, "there'd have to be an African American before that time," and there were.  There were Caroline Jones and Frank Mingo [founders of Mingo-Jones Advertising firm].  They're the people who've made their mark, and one would assume that they're retired, and that's not, in fact, the case.  Frank Mingo is, of course, expired in terms of his demise [d. 1989], and Miss Jones is just a great lady.
Story_ID: 7745
Speaker 1: Was a lot--they talk about ['Ebony' magazine founder] John [H.] Johnson and how he still to this--well, I don't know if he's a--I was out as well as he used to be--they talked about how he would go and meet with CEOs [Chief Executive Officer] directly.  Is that the same way that you go?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Yep, and that's the way most publishers do it.  I mean, now you don't just go and meet with a CEO.  I mean, I remember about a year after the magazine ['Black Enterprise' magazine] was formed we still didn't have General Motors as an entity, and I wrote a letter to then Jim Roche who was the Chairman of the Board and said "I wanted to meet with him," and he, to my amazement, said "yes," you know, he would meet me along with my associate, and so we went marching to his office.  They had told us we had exactly twenty minutes, and I took my flip-card presentation and started putting it together in a big hurry 'cause he had a little table there for me, and he said to me "would you like a cup of coffee," and I looked at the person who had arranged the meeting to see if I could get any sense--is the coffee on me or is the coffee on Mr. Roche in terms of the time--and he was just looking straight ahead.  In fact, I think the guy's name was Tony DeLorenzo who, if you remember, was involved with [author and politician] Ralph Nader and the [safety] issues at General Motors, and so I went back to the same coffee thing, and he brings the coffee, and I started sipping it quickly, and he looked up--this is the Chairman--and he said "Mr. Graves, can I ask you a question?"  I said "yes, sir."  "Are you in a hurry?" I said "well, I know you're busy."  He said "I'm not busy at all.  Why don't you relax?  Why don't we talk," and I came out of there with something like a twenty-four-page schedule, twelve insertions, two pages each.  That was an important era in our--where we are today.  The thirtieth anniversary is important, but I think the twenty-fifth was more exciting from the point of view of twenty-five years and the like.  We've had some great moments.  We've had a great run in terms of where we are today and where I think we will go in the future, in terms of those things we're doing.  'Black Enterprise' is more needed today as an entity than it was twenty-five years ago.
Story_ID: 7746
Speaker 1: It is the rewards and the accolades that come back to me.  I mean, around this office there are over four hundred awards every place you look.  There's a plaque right at your feet.  There are some plaques which you--I don't want you to focus on them because there are people wondering why I haven't hung up their awards yet, but one, it's not a matter of running out of wall space.  It's a matter of finding the time to get it done and put them up the way you want it done, and I'm very fastidious about how I want something to be, all right, but it is the satisfaction of [historian] John Hope Franklin telling you how important you are.  It is the satisfaction of having the President of the United States tell you and the Vice President tell you.  It is the satisfaction of the four honorary degrees I got this year, five actually, and hearing what those people think, both from an academic point of view as well as from a point of view of the difference we're making in terms of the world.  It is the satisfaction of knowing that if there's any mantra that I will carry now until I--and I'm not sure I'll ever retire from 'Black Enterprise' [magazine].  It has to do with our "black wealth initiative" which we launched this year, saying to people that "you need to save money.  It is not an option.  You need to pass money on to future generations, and here's how you do it."  I get a great sense of satisfaction from that.  I get a great sense of satisfaction for the hundreds of people who have worked for me and continue to work for us who enjoy doing what it is they do, and they come to work every day inspired to do more, and so I can get uplifted any day when I walk out of Hartford and walk ten feet into my son's office [Earl Graves, Jr.] and see him there, doing the things I used to do, and I'll walk and turn the corner and talk to another son [John C. Graves].  I pick up the phone and call the third one [Michael Graves], and each one of them is zeroing in on those things which can be good for our business.
Story_ID: 7747
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about black business and the fact that--let's see.  Look at the hair care industry where, you know, there's--they're being sold off or the advertising industry that seems--what are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Black business is going through evolutions as all business do, and now we've reached a level of sophistication where 'Essence' magazine--let's take them, for instance, or BET [Black Entertainment Television network].  Neither one of them had an option in terms of their kids wanting to come into their business or being prepared to come into their business at the time that--in the foreseeable future, and therefore at this year there were several major entities that sold to the majority community, meaning that Essence sold to Time-Life.  BET sold--to another major cable company.  That's Black Entertainment Television now.  That happened.  I don't see that as a tragedy at all.  I see that as the healthiness of the evolution of black business because I would hope that something else would come along and take the place of that particular entity that's moved on to do something else.  Is there limited opportunity?  No.  Does the opportunity have to come from places outside the United States?  Probably, to an extent, all right, and I see the glass as very much half-filled rather than half empty when I look and I see the what's happening and what can happen.
Story_ID: 7748
Speaker 1: You've been active.  Why have you been so active?
Speaker 2: Okay, got it.  Sorry.  My wife [Barbara Graves] and I have felt for as long as we've been married you give back something to your community.  You give back in terms of those who are less fortunate and for those who--you know, the American Museum of Natural History is not about those who are less fortunate or anything.  It's about those who have, but It is a museum that's open to the world, and it's open to the citizens of this country, and it's something that I've been involved in for over twenty years and then became an emeritus person, which says that I'm getting older when the people start giving you emeritus titles.  The--go back.  Give me the focus again.
Speaker 1: It's you being active politically, your need to be active politically.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean let's take the Amadu Diallo tragedy [African American killed by New York Police Department officers in February1999].  I looked at it and said--Ed Lewis and I said to each other--Ed is the publisher of 'Essence' magazine.  "I think it's time for us to make a statement."  Because the people who had been--were being arrested down there were teachers.  They were important people but not descriptive in any way in terms of making a difference, and when I got arrested on the Thursday, on the Friday, there were hundreds of people the next day, five, seven hundred people, many of them lawyers and other people who knew how to handle it, the issues of ending up and finding themselves behind a desk on the other side looking at some stern captain in the police department. And so therefore--did that hang together, the thing about stern captain and the police department?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure (laughs)--I didn't know where you were going.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure--okay--I was--
Speaker 1: You were saying there were five hundred and then seven hundred--.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened, my going out and as the first businessperson, an African American businessman, and being arrested made a difference so therefore there were hundreds the next day, and those hundreds became enough to get [Mayor Rudolph] Giuliani's attention, and he capitulated by saying that he was gonna--you know, he was gonna examine what the police department, and their actions where of how you could shoot at somebody as many times as they did [forty-one shots], hitting him the number of times they did.  The man was dead before he hit the ground so I found a need to be active because I'm concerned about the new administration, and whether or not [President] George [W.] Bush will have the opportunity and and appoint people who will be diametrically opposed to those things which I think will make this a better country and the likes of an [Supreme Court Justice] Antonin Scalia or [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence [Thomas] Tom in terms of what--that wasn't an accident that I said "Clarence Tom", by the way--whether or not people like that were gonna be replicated in terms of this administration so that's a concern.  When I look at the social ills of the country, I look at the unemployment.  I was out in Bedford-Stuyvesant [Brooklyn, New York], and we talked about it in the beginning of this interview, and I see people standing around unemployed and not involved, if you will, in making a difference in their communities in some way and the kinds of things I talked about.  Then I have to be disturbed about what it is that I see coming, and I'm disturbed for my grandchildren because I'd like to believe that the racism--they thought it would diminish.  Now when you see gated communities more and more being built by people, the only way you get into somebody's--there's not a street that you kind of ride through. It is a place where you're gonna have to be stopped and be questioned by somebody who says "where are you going and what are you doing."  I don't think that's a healthy thing for our environment.
Story_ID: 7749
Speaker 1: Some people would say, you know, if you look at, you know, [historian] John Hope Franklin or, you know, or some of the people that we've been interviewing who are, you know, twenty years your senior, they would say you're still young, and so I ask this question in the sense what hasn't the world seen or heard from Earl Graves that will be, you know, they will see in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I still do consider myself young.  I didn't work out this morning.  I got up with all good intentions of doing it, and then I got sidetracked doing three or four other things.  I looked up and it was time to come see you [interviewer Julieanna Richardson], but I will work out this evening if I have the energy, and I intend to find the energy because I think it's important so therefore I don't think sixty-five is old.  I'll be sixty-six in January [2001], and I enjoy what I'm doing.  There's no reason to retire now and my sons--I see them as my partners so there's really not a conflict where they're saying "when is Dad ever gonna get out of here because we really want to take over," and so I see myself--I see us doing one or two big deals, if you will, before--I would come in less, and then at one point somewhere along the way it's gonna--I'll just have an office, but I'll still come in.  I'll still be a part of what it is which is the growth, and I think that 'Black Enterprise' [magazine] and the other things we do--we have a private equity fund.  We've owned radio stations.  We've owned a Pepsi franchise.  I'm still very much involved in the Pepsi-Cola Company so I think the history of this company is much more in front of us than behind us.
Story_ID: 7750
Speaker 1: What are your views about family and the importance of family as you know it?
Speaker 2: If I look at anything that I can say I would like to believe that I've been successful that I--hopefully it's family, all right.  As I said to you in the early part of this interview, we had just had fifty family members over at the house, some of them coming from as far away as Barbados for a celebration of Christmas and our love for each other, but I think if you just talk about my immediate family first, my wife [Barbara Graves] and I have been very fortunate to have raised three sons [Earl Graves, Jr., John C. Graves, Michael Graves], all of who finished their education, went to what I think were pretty good schools, and now are very much involved in the business.  Now when I look at their wives who are lovely ladies and then we look at the glorious seven grandchildren we have, in my mind I say "you know, it can't get much better than this" in terms of them calling me Papa and asking me for things and asking me "why," you know.  I mean these kids say "why," and you answer the question, and they say "why" again, and you answer the question, and they say "why" again, and that almost pumps me up because, you know, it seems to me it was just the other day that my sons were doing that, and now I'm talking to their sons and daughters, and it is exciting.  I think the love that Barbara and I share is a unique love, and we're looking forward to doing the trip around the world next year as part of our fortieth wedding anniversary, and if we had it to do over, I think I'd want to do it the same way.  Could I do it with less aggravation?  Absolutely.  Could I do it by taking and removing some of the racism that would follow the history of 'Black Enterprise' [magazine]?  There were people that told us "no" about advertising only because they didn't want to identify their product with black people. I mean, now those are Neanderthals, if you will, but they still existed, and that was still the flak that we got, and so no matter how you look at it, the glass to me in terms of family, in terms of what it is I've accomplished, the glass is really more than half filled in terms of how I feel about where we are today.
Story_ID: 7751
Speaker 1: What do you want to be your legacy, Mr. Graves?
Speaker 2: When the time comes--first of all, I think that my family--I would hope that my grandchildren speak at what would be my funeral, and I would hope it's a happy occasion, happy from the point of view I like to laugh, and therefore I'd like to believe that people are not sitting there banging their heads against the pews saying "it's terrible what happened to Graves," but the legacy I would want to leave is family.  The second legacy is that I've made a difference in the economic well being of the [African] diaspora from one end of this world to the other because I've been in business since South Africa so therefore that's not new to me.  I've been in businesses in a good many parts of this country, and I recognize the challenges that still face us, and I would hope that people would look at it and say "Graves took some of the tension out of that situation and made a difference in that other situation, and he will be sorely missed."
Story_ID: 7752
Speaker 1: You can answer this for either one of them or both, or whatever, but if they [your parents] could see you now, what do you think they would say [about your success]?
Speaker 2: My mother [Winifred Collette Sealy] had a chance to see it, and she was just very proud, all right.  My father [Earl Godwin Graves] did not, all right, and--because first of all, my mother at her age, she just realized that I could do more things, if you will, but in terms of the financial assets of what we had, you know, there's only so many shirts you can wear and how many pairs of shoes you can buy and how many houses can you live in and how many airplanes you can fly on, and so I've been fortunate, in that way, that, you know, what I want to do, I've been able to do, and if my mom came back, she would expect that that's the way it's supposed to be.  I don't know if my dad would feel the same way because I didn't really get to know him as a person that well.  I can't image he would not be proud of what it is he had hoped I would have achieved and if he saw his grandsons and then his great-grandchildren, it would just be awesome.
