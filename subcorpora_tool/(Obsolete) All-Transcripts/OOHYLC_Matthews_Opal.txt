 Finchum Today is July 24, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in Broken  Arrow, Oklahoma, to speak with Opal Matthews. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for having us today.  Matthews Thank you for coming.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Matthews I was born on January 15, 1913, in Cisco, Texas.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Matthews Yeah, I   m afraid so. (Laughter)  Finchum How many of each?  Matthews Well now, that   s a whole story. I have half brothers and sisters, whole  brothers and sisters, stepbrothers   stepsisters, not no stepbrothers. I   m  from a family of eighteen kids.  Finchum Wow.  Matthews (Laughs) That   s what I said, my kids, and your kids, and our kids.  Finchum How did that come to be?  Matthews My mother died when I was about three or four years old. My father  remarried, so he married   he had five children. I was one of five of his  children. Okay, he married a woman that had two children. That made  5  seven children. Him and her had enough to make it up to eighteen  children. I growed up in that. Now that   s     Finchum That   s a houseful.  Matthews Yeah. (Laughter)  Finchum What did he do for a living? Your father?  Matthews He was a rancher.  Finchum So you had chores to do?  Matthews (Laughs) I   m afraid so. When the sun come up you be in the field, when  the sun went down you be in the field. You stay there until the sun goes  down. (Laughs)  Finchum A field of     Matthews I picked cotton. I cut broomcorn, I tabled broomcorn. (Laughs) You  name it, I was there.  Finchum I   m not sure I know what broomcorn is.  Matthews Oh you   re not?  Finchum No.  Matthews You know what brooms is made out of don   t you? Broomcorn.  Broomcorn   s like a   I don   t know how to describe it to you. Let me see  if I can think of a way. You know what Kaffir corn is?  Finchum Yes.  Matthews Okay, it grows on the stalk like Kaffir corn except it has long   it has a  long head this long. You table that, them heads you table. You throw  this one back, and then this, and this one. (Gestures) That   s table like  this. Then somebody else comes along here and they cut that by hand  and put it on a stack and then they sell it. They   d make brooms out of it.  I cut a whole lot of broomcorn helping my dad.  Finchum Would you have to miss school in order to do that?  Matthews No, I didn   t miss no school, but I had plenty work to do. I worked when  I wasn   t at school. It was just the way life was.  6  Finchum With that many people in the house, where would you sleep?  Matthews (Laughs) Wherever I got a bed. We had a Baptist pallet.  Finchum A Baptist pallet? On the floor?  Matthews (Laughs) Yeah   Finchum With all that work, did you have time for fun?  Matthews Yeah  Time to throw my dad in the creek. I   ll tell you this little story.  Papa never made us work on Sunday. He wouldn   t let us. You didn   t  sew a button on, you didn   t do nothing on Sunday. Sunday belonged to  God. So on Saturday Papa   we just had a little bit of cotton to finish,  plowing and hoeing. So he told us to do that, but we didn   t do it. We  played. When he come back he was going to get us, but there was  enough of us we could over handle him so we just throwed him in the  creek. He didn   t whoop us either. We thought we was going to get a  whooping, but he didn   t whoop us that time  (Laughs)  Finchum When he did whip you, what would he use?  Matthews What would he use? He   d use a switch and make you cut it  (Laughs)  Finchum You didn   t have to do that too much, though, did you?  Matthews If I didn   t do what he said   I did, but I done what he said, most of the  time.  Finchum Most? (Laughs) Then you went to church on Sundays?  Matthews Yes.  Finchum How would you get there?  Matthews In the wagon. We didn   t have nothing else but wagons and buggies.  Finchum Could you all fit in one or did you have to have two?  Matthews No, we all got in one. They just sat down on   we just sat down on the  bed of the wagon, in a row on each side.  Finchum And how far was church from your house?  7  Matthews I don   t know, it was a long ways. That   s the way we went to town and  everywhere else, in the wagon. There wasn   t nothing else, until cars  got   my daddy bought a car when they got cars.  Finchum And a tractor I guess.  Matthews He didn   t have no tractor then. There wasn   t a thing.  Finchum Where did you go to school?  Matthews Tuttle, Oklahoma.  Finchum Tuttle?  Matthews Tuttle, Oklahoma.  Finchum Then let   s back up. How did you get from Texas to Tuttle?  Matthews I don   t know, you know where Chickasha, Oklahoma, is? Okay,  Tuttle   s just about fifteen or twenty miles apart.  Finchum Why did you move from Texas to Oklahoma?  Matthews Because Momma, my stepmother, was sick and they told her   doctors  told him to travel with her. So we moved to Oklahoma. He didn   t have  all them kids then. She just had one of hers and his, their first one.  That   s when she couldn   t walk or nothing. I don   t know what was a  matter with her. I was too little to know that stuff.  Finchum About how old were you when you moved to Oklahoma?  Matthews I was about six or seven.  Finchum So you came in a wagon, too, I guess.  Matthews Yeah, covered wagon.  Finchum Did you bring your milk cow with you?  Matthews No. (Laughs) That was the good old days, but we didn   t know it. We  know it now.  Finchum So you went to school in Tuttle. How far did you go to school?  Matthews About four or five miles?  8  Finchum And in what grade did you finish?  Matthews The eighth grade.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Matthews No. I had to study all of them and best be doing it or my dad would be  on my case, but it was good. Us kids, wherever you saw one of us, you  saw all of us. We   d go to the creek and go everywhere, but it was like a  pack of dogs. (Laughs)  Ketcher I can   t even imagine seeing a mother and dad and eighteen kids.  Finchum Yeah, I can   t either. How would you clothe that many? Did she sew?  Did someone in the house sew?  Matthews You mean when we was little? I wasn   t very big when I learned to sew.  (Laughs) You had to learn all this stuff when you was little.  Finchum So you   d make some of your own clothes?  Matthews I   m afraid so. I made her clothes when she went to school. I made her a  coat one time and the teacher asked her where she got it and she said,     My momma made it.    She made her turn it, pull it off and turn it  wrong side out and show her that I had made it.  Finchum It must   ve looked pretty good on the outside  Would they have a big  garden?  Matthews Yeah, I canned lots of stuff.  Finchum Even when you were younger?  Matthews Yeah     Finchum Especially.  Matthews    when I was just a teenage girl.  Finchum With that many you had to can a lot.  Matthews Yeah.  Bishop Do you still garden today?  Matthews Yeah, full of tomato plants. Is that a garden?  9  Finchum In my book, yes. Nothing beats a homegrown tomato. So after the eighth  grade what did you do?  Matthews I worked.  Finchum Doing what?  Matthews On the farm. There was work on the farm every day. You don   t have no  free day. Every day you work on the farm. If there was cotton to chop,  you chopped the cotton. If it   s to plow, you plow it. There   s always  something there to do.  Finchum Milk the cows and feed the chickens?  Matthews Now Momma sold chickens, so she set the incubators and sold the baby  chicks. Them eggs had to be turned every day. She   d sell an incubator  full, like 250 eggs in an incubator, and she had more than one incubator.  Would you like to help turn the eggs? (Laughs) You had to turn them  every day  Then the chickens hatched and then she sold the chickens.  Finchum And that was her money to do with what she wanted?  Matthews Yeah. (Laughs) That was her money.  Finchum Now was that your mother or your stepmother?  Matthews My stepmother, but she wasn   t stepmother to me. She was just my  mother, the only mother I knew. I knew I had a different mother, but I  mean that   s the mother I called    Mother    and she   s the one I looked to  for a mother, because I didn   t know my mother.  Finchum What was the favorite dish that she would cook that you liked?  Matthews What was the favorite     Finchum Dish that she fixed that you liked?  Matthews I liked everything she cooked, she cooked good. She could make really  good biscuits and gravy. She (Cotton) can make good biscuits and  gravy too.  Finchum And can you?  Matthews Can I make biscuits and gravy?  10  Ketcher Yeah, I think you taught us how.  Finchum So you   re a good cook, a good seamstress, a good farmer     Matthews Yeah, I crochet, embroidery, knit     Finchum Quilt?  Matthews Quilt. Can you go get one of my quilts and show it to her?  Ketcher Oh my gosh Momma, I   d have to go out in that garage.  Matthews All of them?  Ketcher Yeah, they   re packed up in them boxes.  Matthews You ain   t got one in the house?  Ketcher I don   t think so. We don   t use your quilts, we save them.  Finchum It   s too hot. (Laughs)  Ketcher We wouldn   t use them if we did. We got to save those things.  Finchum When did you get married?  Matthews (Laughs) I got married when I was nineteen years old. My daddy made  me sit up all night. We got married at his cousin   s house and we went to  my house to stay all night. Papa didn   t believe we was married. You  didn   t stay all night in his house if you wasn   t married. So he made us  sit up all night, he sat up with us too, so he could see what we was  doing. (Laughs)  Finchum You had to show him the marriage certificate?  Matthews We didn   t have it. We just got married so they took it to     Ketcher Now this is just a novelty quilt. It   s nothing like what is in the garage.  She hand quilted it and everything. In fact, all of those in the garage are  hand quilted.  Finchum That   s really cute.  Ketcher I   ve made several of these, but not big ones. I make them for baby gifts.  Finchum Hobos, cool  That   s cool.  11  Matthews I   ve got one that   s embroidery, has the state, the capital, the year it  became a state, the flower, and something else, all embroidered on it.  Finchum That took a little bit of time.  Ketcher She has a gorgeous one I wish you could see. It   s beautiful. There   s a  quilt like it in a museum somewhere in Missouri.  Finchum How did you learn how to do that?  Matthews I don   t know how I learned. I taught myself.  Finchum Would you get your patterns from the newspaper?  Matthews I drawed my patterns. I drawed my patterns. (Laughs)  Finchum So creative, too.  Ketcher I have to tell you about this and I don   t know if I   ll cry or not, but we  used this quilt for Momma   s   it   s my first great-grandbaby. My  husband passed away fourteen years ago and I never dated anyone,  never kissed anyone except him. I married my childhood sweetheart. I  took   he was an executive at AMACO, but he did everything. He was  so talented. He worked on cars. We have a farm and he never hired a  tractor fixed, he fixed everything. One time I had   I always drove a  Ford LTD and he bought it brand new, but I loved it. He put three  motors in it and after the third motor he said,    Cotton, I   m not putting  another motor on it, I   m buying you a new car.    I said,    I don   t want  one.    He said,    I   m not putting another motor in that car.    But he did  everything.  He wasn   t in a suit, for the grandkids, he wasn   t in a suit. Most of the  time he was just in regular clothes, because we changed clothes as soon  as we got home from work into just comfortable clothes. I took the  jeans that he had worn around here working on cars and down at the  farm and everything and we made this little boy and I made the hat out  of his jeans, and the pants out of his jeans. I couldn   t get the oil out, but  I went ahead and did it anyway. Then I took Daddy   s shirt, the last shirt  he wore, and I made the shirt out of Daddy   s shirt, and I made the shoes  out of Daddy   s pants. We just used a bandana for this and it was  wonderful. At the shower there wasn   t a dry eye in there. It was  wonderful.  So then   I have two great-grandchildren. So when the second one came  along of course they had to have one of those, but they wanted theirs   I  12  made a hobo on the first one. I never thought about making anything  different out of it. On the second one, Charissa   s theme, and I   ve got it  on Facebook, Charissa   s theme was hunting. So I changed him into a  hunter. Let   s see, I   ve got my Facebook. I   ve got a picture of it.  Matthews You change the pattern around to fit the occasion.  Bishop How long does it take to make a quilt?  Matthews (Laughs) I can quilt a quilt in two days.  Bishop Two days?  Finchum Did you have a hoop for your lap or was it one from the     Matthews Right over there my quilting frame   s laying in the floor. (Laughs)  Ketcher Those things are older than I am. I don   t have any place else to put them  because you can   t hang them up, and you can   t lean them up because  then they   ll get warped.  Matthews I made them   Bishop You made those? You made your own quilting frame?  Ketcher Yeah, she did.  Bishop So if you can get a quilt done in two days, you spend day and night  making them.  Matthews (Laughs) Yeah, two days.  Finchum Could you rock your needle? You have the knack if you can do that,  yeah.  Matthews I don   t know how to answer that.  Finchum Yeah, you rocked. Where would you get your fabric?  Matthews Where do I get my fabric? I got it at the store if I didn   t have any  scraps. If I had scraps, I just made it out of whatever I had. If I didn   t  have no scraps, I   d buy me some material at the store or use a feed sack.  I used to make my kids    clothes out of feed sacks.  Finchum You use what you have. During the Depression?  13  Matthews Yeah.  Finchum You got married pretty much when the Depression was on.  Matthews Yeah, but they looked cute. I   d wash them, and starch them, and iron  them, and send them to school. They looked good enough that the  teacher would want me to do theirs. (Laughs)  Ketcher Here   s the one that we changed into a little hunter.  Finchum That is cute.  Bishop You got a gift.  Matthews I always had something to do. Always had something to do.  Finchum When you got married at nineteen, what did your husband do for work?  Matthews He was a salesman.  Finchum Selling what?  Matthews Selling the Kansas City Star.  Finchum Newspaper.  Ketcher Here   s what her flowers look like when they   re in bloom some of them.  She does these flowers. That   s those Naked Ladies out there around  that pecan tree. They   re not up yet, they haven   t bloomed yet. But she  works in these flowers.  Matthews I still work in the flowers.  Finchum You still get out there, huh?  Ketcher This rose bush is absolutely gorgeous. This picture doesn   t do much for  it, but this rose comes out yellow and then it turns pink, and then it turns  hot pink. We have more people stopping to see that rose and wanting a  cutting off of it, and also those hibiscus that are in bloom. I guess  they   re blooming, are they? Big old blooms out there. We have people  wanting those all the time. But she works in those flower beds. She lays  down out here. When she   s working on the side, she lays down out  there and people stop to see if she   s dead or alive. I tell her,    Don   t lay  down on that side of the house, Mother.    (Laughter)  Bishop She   s taking a break.  14  Matthews I work till my back gets tired and I lay down and rest, get up and do it  again. That   s why I   m still here, because I keep on.  Ketcher That quilt that   s in the museum at Missouri like she made during the  Depression, it   s a star. It   s absolutely gorgeous. The colors   my sister-in-  law has that quilt. It has this beautiful   she   s always been great with  colors. That   s why I have this quilt. I go by it to help me with colors,  but it   s a star. It   s a great big star, the one in the museum, some Indian  lady has taken and in the middle of that star she   s put an Indian chief   s  head in it. I saw it on Facebook   or I googled it, I didn   t see it on  Facebook, googled it. It   s beautiful, but it   s that same quilt, that star  quilt. Beautiful.  Bishop When you got married did you go on a honeymoon?  Matthews (Laughs) When I got married the honeymoon I went on I hopped on a  freight train.  Finchum Hopped a freight train.  Matthews I hopped a freight train.  Ketcher Tell them that story, Mom.  Matthews I don   t want to tell that story.  Ketcher Tell that story   Finchum That   s a good one it sounds like, tell us   Matthews Well, we got married. I   ve already told you that my daddy made us sit  up. He was working in Eastern Oklahoma and we was at Tuttle. He  went to get our marriage license and they almost put him in jail because  they was closed. He thought they was going to put him jail, not for real.  (Laughs) Just a joke on him, because he was getting married. We went  through that, all that. When we got ready to leave, he bought me a ticket  and I said,    Now I don   t want no ticket. I   m going wherever you go.     He was going to put me on as a passenger and he was going to hop the  freight train with a bunch of other men I guess.  Ketcher Hobos.  Matthews So I said,    No, I   m going with you.    So I took his cap, his shirt, and a  pair of his britches and I put them on. He hopped that train, and I  hopped it just like he did. I got in the car and made him sit down on the  15  floor. There was just a bunch of men in there. Not no girls in there, just  this girl. (Gestures to self) Men are pretty quiet and after while they  kind of got rowdy and using ugly words. Some other boy in there sitting  close to us, he knew I was a girl. He got up and stood up on the floor  and said,    Hey  We won   t have none of that in here. We have a lady in  here.    That was my story and my honeymoon.  Bishop Where were you headed?  Matthews Where was we headed? We was heading to Eastern Oklahoma.  Ketcher What was the name of the town where he was working? Stilwell or  Westville?  Matthews Yeah.  Finchum How did you get off the train?  Matthews At Westville? Jumped off just like them boys did  (Laughter)  Finchum Would you do it again?  Matthews Yeah  If he was here to do it with me.  Finchum Once you got married and moved, did you go to work yourself?  Matthews No, I didn   t go to work until I had   I guess I had all my kids when I  went to work.  Finchum How many children did you have?  Matthews Three girls and two boys.  Finchum A houseful too. And did you use a hickory on them? A stick?  Matthews Ask her if I did.  Ketcher Yeah.  Finchum Did she have to go get it herself?  Ketcher Yeah.(Laughter)  Finchum Didn   t have to use it much though, did you?  16  Matthews But she didn   t just cut hers, she had to get three switches. One for her,  one for her sister, and one for me. If they started playing      I won   t hit  you hard if you don   t hit me hard.    If they didn   t hit each other hard  enough, I hit them.  Ketcher We   d be in a fight and she made us whip each other. Well, it wasn   t any  fun then.  Matthews I wasn   t mean to my kids, though. I had a restaurant too.  Finchum You had a restaurant?  Matthews Yeah I had a restaurant. I had my kids to help me. I had a sick husband  then.  Bishop When did you open your restaurant?  Matthews Oh, I don   t know. I really don   t know.  Bishop I should ask, where was it?  Matthews My baby wasn   t very big. She wasn   t big enough to go to school.  Ketcher He asked you where that restaurant was.  Bishop What town?  Matthews Westville, Oklahoma. Right on Main Street.  Bishop Did it have a name?  Matthews Yeah, Maxwell   s Caf  .  Ketcher She just left the name on the   what was printed on the window when  she bought it.  Matthews I don   t know what I was telling now.  Finchum Your kids helped you in the caf  .  Matthews I had to go up to the schoolhouse and get it to where I had one kid  coming home and one going to school, because my husband was sick  then. He couldn   t work, so I had to do something. Even if it was wrong,  I had to do something so that   s what I done. He got better, but he was  always sick. He always had a bad heart. Had that when I married him  17  and I knew he had a bad heart. I still married him anyway. I loved him,  he loved me.  Finchum How long did you have the caf  ?  Matthews I don   t know how many years I had it. I had it a long time.  Ketcher I was in grade school. She still had it when I graduated from high  school.  Finchum So ten or fifteen years?  Matthews Yeah, probably.  Bishop What was your specialty?  Matthews I don   t know if I had a specialty. I cooked everything, but now pies,  that   s what we had most. That was our main thing   pies.  Finchum So you made them from scratch?  Matthews Yes.  Ketcher All of her doctors asked her to bring them a pie. You   re not from here.  You probably don   t know Dr. Higgins, but if you went to Dr. Higgins     office, you wouldn   t believe his office. His picture has been taken with  every president, every kind of a sports person: wrestling, football,  basketball, doesn   t matter. Any important person, he   s got a picture  with them. Mayors, everybody, presidents, vice presidents, you name it.  So he wanted her   he said,    I bet you can make me a butterscotch pie.     Dr. Higgins    favorite is butterscotch pie. She has to make him  butterscotch pies. He   s her heart doctor. Then her medical doctor, his  favorite is coconut pie. She   ll make him coconut pies, and then she  had     Matthews I can whip up a pie like that.  Ketcher She has a kidney specialist and that   s   her favorite   s coconut pie. She  knows her medical doctor so they   re always   when Mom brings them  anything   like she made divinity last year for Christmas for Connie,  that   s her medical doctor   s wife. Oh my gosh  They told Dr. Martin that  they got divinity for Christmas. Well, oh Dr. Martin,    Well, they got  divinity and I didn   t get any divinity      Bishop What   s your favorite kind of pie?  18  Matthews What   s my favorite kind of pie to eat? I don   t think I have a favorite. I  eat one just as good as I eat the other one. They   re all good.  Bishop Is there a secret to a good pie crust?  Matthews To a good pie crust? Ask her how I make pie crusts.  Ketcher How about pineapple? I thought that was your favorite.  Matthews How do I make pie crusts?  Ketcher Five pound sack of flour at a time, add a gallon of Crisco     Finchum And how many pie crusts does that make? A lot I would think.  Matthews It makes a gallon of crust.  Ketcher It makes more than a gallon of crust.  Matthews It makes one of them big jars.  Ketcher One of them big old pickle jars like we had in the restaurant. She makes  it full.  Finchum And you freeze it? Or     Matthews Then when I needed to bake a pie I could just pull that out and make it.  Roll it out and cook it, by that time I can make a pie. I worked at the  bowling alley in Del City. People would tell me, would call me, and tell  me what kind of pie they wanted. When they got there I had it made.  Finchum How much would you charge?  Matthews I didn   t sell a whole pie. They just     Finchum Wanted a piece.  Ketcher It makes this jar full of pie crust.  Matthews Whatever the price was, you know.  Ketcher And you don   t have to freeze it. You just put it down in the bottom of  the cabinet where it   s cool and just take out whatever you want.  Finchum Cool.  19  Matthews It won   t spoil. You put it up in the cabinet.  Finchum And just add water when it   s time?  Matthews That   s all.  Finchum Doesn   t take egg?  Matthews Got everything else in it. My own recipe, I make it up my own self.  Finchum A five pound of flour and a     Matthews Three pounds of Crisco.  Finchum And just cut it in?  Matthews (Rubs hands together)  Ketcher Now that   s the secret to it right there, what she   s doing.  Matthews Until it   s     Ketcher If you don   t do that enough it   s not going to turn out.  Matthews If you don   t do that it won   t make.  Finchum I   ve never made one, I   m going to have to try.  Matthews You have to (rubbing hands together). It won   t look like pie though, it   ll  look like course.  Bishop You got to give it a little elbow grease and a little love.  Ketcher When us girls got married, we didn   t know how to cook anything in  small amounts. (Laughter) I mean, you know we make hot rolls we  make five pound sack of flour with hot rolls. I mean I had hot rolls  everywhere. I was making hot rolls and the insurance man came by. I  didn   t think a thing about it, I had hot rolls all over the place you know,  taking them out of the oven. He said,    Man, I could get in trouble for  this.    He said,    Man, I just got to have one of those hot rolls. Can I have  one of them hot rolls?    I said,    Sure.    Got him some butter and jelly.  He must   ve eaten about five of them.  Matthews When them girls were old enough to go with the boys   when it was  that girl   s weekend to work, her boyfriend better be able to work with  her because she   s going to have to work whether he   s there or whether  20  he ain   t there. All my sons-in-law could work in that caf   just the same  as my daughters could. I have one son-in-law that was my favorite, her  husband. He was my favorite.  Ketcher He was everybody   s favorite.  Matthews He thought I was the toughest woman he ever seen. (Laughs) Isn   t that  what he   d tell me?    You   re the toughest woman I ever seen.     Ketcher We have a farm and so Momma had a favorite tractor and Daddy had a  favorite tractor. Now Daddy   s like in his eighties, Momma   s right  behind him. She   s seven years younger than him. Anyway, they   d go  down to that farm. We didn   t necessarily want them out there plowing  you know, but they had their tractors and they had to do that. They was  out there plowing, and what was you doing when you broke the thing?  Whatever it was.  Matthews When I broke the planter? I was planting   Ketcher Whatever you broke, I didn   t remember what it was. She was really  upset because she broke whatever it was. Running into the fence, I  guess, or something.  Finchum So you knew how to work a tractor.  Matthews Yeah, I just do just like the men. I was scared when I broke that,  though. I broke the turning plow, I think   s what it was. I   m pretty sure it  was. I hit a tree too big to cut down.  Ketcher I used to worry about them being out there on those tractors and Whitey  said, my husband, he said,    Quit worrying about them. If that   s what  they want to do, just let them do it.     Matthews I had a garden then. I lived in Oklahoma City, but I had a garden down  at Checotah. I canned everything.  Ketcher That   s where our farm is.  Matthews As long as we raised a garden I canned stuff. I made my own soap.  Finchum Your own soap?  Matthews I made my own soap, my own lard, and my own   I done everything  girl. (Laughter)  21  Ketcher I   d like to have some of that sausage they made back then. Have you  ever seen that canned sausage like they made in the olden days?  Finchum I   ve seen pictures of it..  Ketcher They would make it. Momma can   t remember the recipe. I sure wish  she could. They mixed it up and put all the hog parts in it.  Matthews My dad taught me how to make sausage.  Ketcher Then they fried it in little balls, put it in a quart jar and just turned it  upside down. Sealed it and turned it upside down. We had that sausage.  That was really good all winter long.  Finchum Raised your own pigs? Hogs?  Matthews Yeah.  Ketcher We had a saltbox and a smokehouse. I don   t know if you know what a  saltbox is.  Matthews But my kids, I played with my kids too.  Finchum They didn   t have to work all the time?  Matthews They had to work, but I had to work too. They had to learn so they all  learned.  Bishop What would you do when you played with them?  Matthews We   d play Annie Over and baseball, and     Bishop What   s Annie Over?  Ketcher You don   t know what that is?  Matthews We had a paddle and hoop. You know what a paddle and hoop is don   t  you?  Bishop Is that where you go like that? (Gestures)  Ketcher No. (Laughter) Tell him what Annie Over is and then you can tell him  what a paddle and hoop...  Matthews You don   t know what Annie Over is?  22  Finchum He doesn   t. I think I do, but you go ahead.  Matthews You have two sides of the house. You have one team over here on this  side and one team over here on this side. You throw that ball over and  say,    Annie Over     If they catch you before you get around on their  side, if they touch you with that ball, then you have to go to their side.  That means the one that   s left over here, the one that is last is the one  that loses. The one that loses all their people over to this side. That   s  what you done. You had to guess which way they was going because  you didn   t want them to touch you with that ball or you   d be out. You   d  have to go over on their side and that   d make their side win. That   s  what Annie Over is. Now you want to know what a hoop is?  Bishop A hoop and paddle?  Matthews You know what a Prince Albert tobacco can looks like?  Bishop Yes.  Matthews Okay, you take that tobacco can and you flatten it out just as flat as you  can get it. Then you make it into a kind of a curve. You take a hub off  of a wagon. Know what a hub off of the wagon is? You take that, it   s a  round circle. You roll it down this thing, and it   d roll out, and you   d  run, and roll that hoop and paddle.  Ketcher You nail that Prince Albert can down on the end of a stick. Turn the  sides up. Then you roll it down the   we had old dried up ruts, you  know. See which one could roll your hoop and paddle the farthest  without it wobbling and turning over.  Bishop So you entertained the kids then?  Matthews Yeah.  Bishop Had time to do that?  Matthews Yeah.  Ketcher It was hard for me to ever realize that my parents were old. My parents  never seemed like everybody else   s parents my age, because they did  everything we did. They played football, they did   they were game to  do anything we did  Both of them  They never said,    I don   t feel like  it.    Momma learned how to waterski when she was fifty-seven.  Matthews I didn   t live for my kids. I lived with my kids.  23  Bishop And you learned to waterski at fifty-seven. That   s amazing. Have you  ever jumped out of airplane? Skydived?  Matthews (Laughs) No. I guess if one of my kids had, I   d a done it too.  Ketcher I tell you what, she had some friends in Oklahoma City. I wouldn   t go  up in those little old planes, but every time I turned around she was out  buzzing around the country with her friends in them little bitty planes.  Finchum You have no fear.  Ketcher I wouldn   t ever go up in one of them. I went up one time and my  husband said these kids at his office were taking these lessons, learning  how to fly. He said,    Cotton, we   re going to go fly over the farm, to see  what it looks like from the air, this weekend.    I said,    Well, who   s  flying us?    He told me and he said,    They   ve got their license and  stuff.    Man alive, that day we went down there, the wind was blowing  and when they got ready to land   I mean they went down to land and  they went back up. I was frightened to death. I never got in another one  of those little planes, and never will.  Matthews She   s a scaredy-cat anyway. I wasn   t no scaredy-cat. (Laughter)  Finchum Doesn   t sound like it.  Matthews I   ll tell you what we done. We learned how to ride horses, work horses,  when Ma and Papa was gone we saw   you know what a crosstie is? On  a railroad?  Bishop Yeah.  Matthews We   d saw us off a crosstie, a chunk about that long, tie a rope on this  end of it, take it around the horse and tie it on that side. If that horse  didn   t buck, we got on it. (Laughs) We rode the calves, we rode the  hogs     Ketcher I bet Papa   d been skinning you up if he knowed it.  Finchum Never broke a bone?  Matthews We wouldn   t ride them   if they bucked with that stick on them, then  we knew they   d buck us off. If they didn   t buck we could hold to their  mane. (Laughs)  Finchum You had a system.  24  Matthews Yeah. If there wasn   t nobody there but us kids, us girls would, we got  ready to go to bed, we   d go climb up on top of the barn. We slept on top  of the barn, old tin-top barn. When we   d go to bed sometimes the whip-poor-  wills would start hollering. We didn   t like to hear the whip-poor-wills  hollering so O.C. was   he was a brother and he was little and in-between  all the girls. Usually he played with the girls. When we   d get  up on the barn and the whip-poor-wills was hollering   he didn   t like  for his pockets to be turned out. We   d hold him down, two of us would  hold him down while the other one turned his pockets wrong-side out so  the whip-poor-wills would quit hollering. (Laughs)  Ketcher Tell them why you were sleeping on top of the barn.  Matthews (Laughs) You tell them.  Ketcher So they wouldn   t get the house messed up and they wouldn   t have to  clean it up again.  Matthews We cleaned the house up and we didn   t want to get it dirty.  Ketcher Can you imagine?  Matthews There was always a little baby, you know. We   d get up on there, baby  and all. I   d get that baby and put her like this (gestures) so she couldn   t  fall. I   d scoot down to where my feet   d come off the edge of the barn.  Then I   d scoot back up  I knew a baby   d fall. We done everything.  Finchum What if it started raining?  Matthews Heck, I can   t remember it ever raining on us when we got on the barn. I  don   t guess Momma and Papa ever went anywhere if it were raining.  We had to do all these things, that we knew we wasn   t supposed to do,  when they wasn   t there. (Laughs)  Bishop What were holidays like?  Matthews What was holidays like?  Bishop Christmas and     Matthews They was wild. (Laughs)  Ketcher There was food, I can tell you. I know from Momma and Papa when  we   d go up to their house there was food everywhere.  Finchum Would you have a Christmas tree?  25  Ketcher Yeah. When Momma went to the store and bought stuff Papa would  always buy a whole stalk of bananas. You know they come on a big  stalk. He   d just hang it up. We wasn   t allowed to eat but one a day.  (Laughs) They didn   t last very many days because there was eighteen  kids.  Finchum Where all have you lived? You moved into Oklahoma, when you  married you moved to     Matthews That   s where we was at. We lived in Adair County for all them years.  Ketcher She was asking you where   d you move after that.  Finchum Yeah, where did you move after you were in Adair County?  Matthews When we left Adair County, we moved to Oklahoma City, but we still  owned the farm down there in the fork of the creek.  Finchum Did you work in Oklahoma City? Did you have a job?  Matthews I   m afraid I did. I   m afraid I worked in a restaurant in Oklahoma City.  Finchum Anybody famous come through?  Matthews I must not heard you right.  Finchum Did any famous come through where you worked?  Matthews Oh yeah. I waited on Minnie Pearl, and Roy Acuff. I can   t tell you how  many people.  Finchum That   s pretty cool.  Ketcher And she knew Barry Switzer very well.  Finchum The OU     Bishop Coach.  Ketcher Yeah.  Matthews People used to ask me how many dishes I could carry. I said,    You see  that booth? I can carry enough dishes to feed them people in that  booth.    How many people can you get in that booth? That   s how many  dishes I can carry. You have to learn how.  26  Ketcher Tell them about Barry calling you on your birthday.  Matthews (Laughs) That was way down here when I was   which birthday was it?  I forgot.  Ketcher It was your 100th birthday where you had that sit-down dinner and  three-hundred and some odd people were there. That big birthday party.  He called you right in the middle of it and talked to you forever, put  him on speaker. It was quite interesting.  Matthews It was my own birthday and he called before I got in the building   (Laughter)  Bishop How did you meet him?  Matthews How   d I meet him? I fed him many, many, many, many, meals. You  meet people when you   re in the restaurant business.  Bishop Some people order the same thing too. I bet you knew what he wanted,  too, before he even got there.  Matthews I   ll tell you a story about that now, but it   s not him, it   s another man  that I knew and I waited on a lot. He would   when he turned in the  driveway at the caf   I was supposed to know what he wanted. I was  supposed to set up on the table, put a glass of water and a cup of coffee.  I   m not supposed to say good morning, hello, kiss my foot, or nothing  else until I bring his breakfast and set it in front of him and tell him  good morning. (Laughs) One time he come on Friday. I did all this  stuff, just like I was supposed to, until I started to get his breakfast. I  had ordered ham for his breakfast. He eat it, but he was on his way to  Tulsa, so he stopped and called me. He was mad at me. He said,    You  fed me ham this morning     I said,    Well you didn   t have to eat it      (Laughter) He was Catholic and he wasn   t supposed have no meat on  Fridays.  Bishop Right, during lent. (Laughs)  Matthews And I had accidently served it to him. Boy, he was mad at me because I  fed him that ham. He blamed me because he eat it  He knew it was  Friday, why   d he eat it? (Laughter)  Finchum Was he a big tipper since he wanted things     Matthews Yeah   27  Finchum Was he?  Matthews Yeah, but he was just what he was, and you done just what you   just  like he wanted you to. He wouldn   t sit on nobody else   s station but  mine. If I wasn   t there, he wouldn   t eat. He   d just leave. That   s how bad  he was. Nobody else wanted to wait on him anyway.  Bishop He must   ve trusted you.  Matthews I don   t know   I don   t even know what he done, but he come to Tulsa  all the time.  Finchum Did you have to cook there or just serve?  Matthews I just had to serve him. I was waiting tables then, I wasn   t cooking.  Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  Matthews No. I didn   t know. I was just taking it day by day. I never thought  nothing about it. I don   t like to be treated like I   m 100 years old. I   m  just me.  Finchum Did any of your brothers and sisters live to be 100?  Matthews No.  Finchum Your parents?  Matthews There   s just three of us left. My grandma lived to be 102 though.  Finchum On your mother   s side or your dad   s side.  Matthews On my dad   s side.  Finchum What do you think the secret might be?  Matthews Just keep a doing. I didn   t miss nothing, I don   t think. (Laughs)  Finchum Playing with your kids.  Matthews (Laughs) Right. See, I had a big room in the back at my caf  . That   s  where the kids   instead of the kids going out and prowling around  town, that   s where they went, to that room.  Bishop I bet you fed a lot of their friends, too.  28  Matthews Yeah.  Bishop And put them to work.  Matthews My kids    boyfriends or girlfriends, whichever it might be, if it was their  weekend to work   I worked every day. I never did miss a day, I was  there. Them kids had to work. I had to have a kid on the weekend to  wait tables. I couldn   t cook and wait tables, too, all day long. So they  had a boyfriend, the girls did. He   d cook, and they   d wait tables, on her  weekend to work.  Finchum Did you pay them?  Matthews No  I didn   t pay them.  Bishop They got a piece of pie, if they did a good job, at least.  Matthews They got their pay, I didn   t pay them. (Laughs)  Ketcher Tell them about your honor system.  Matthews I started to tell you a while ago, when I had my caf   I had a cup that sat  on the shelf under my cash register. If you paid for your meal and you  had a dime in that change that you   re paying with, every dime that went  through that cash register went in that cup. That cup belonged to my  kids. That was their money. They could do whatever they wanted to  with it, whenever they wanted it. If they wanted to buy something they  didn   t have to ask nobody. That was their money in that cup. They   d  buy it. That   s the pay they got. That   s all the pay they got.  Ketcher Tell them about leaving the keys out for all the kids, whoever wanted to  go in there and fix them something to eat.  Matthews Yeah, I had a place on Friday nights where the football team would  come in and cook whatever they wanted, clean up their mess, put their  money in the cash register, put the key back in the hiding place. I didn   t  have to worry about it. They knew they had to pay. (Laughs)  Finchum And they had to clean up?  Matthews Yeah  They cleaned their mess up. They knew to clean that mess up.  Finchum What did they call you?  Matthews I don   t know what they called me.  29  Ketcher Mom   everybody called you Mom. They still do. They had a party for  her one time. At our class reunions, of course she knows every class,  you know, forever, so they were having an all-class   s class reunion, and  they honored her at one of those class reunions. It was really neat. They  got up and told her about stuff you now. Really neat.  Finchum A special lady.  Matthews That   s just the kind of life I lived. I   m still living it except they put me  in the corner now. (Laughter)  Bishop You have this picture here. Can you tell us about this picture? You told  me a story about this last time I came to visit you   about that catfish.  Matthews (Laughs) Yeah, that   s my husband.  Finchum That   s a big fish   Bishop Big catfish.  Matthews Yeah, that fish   he couldn   t get it out of the water. He had to go get  Bob, that   s our youngest son, to come and help him. He was just like a  man in a wild place, walking the floor. Bob had the dairy then, and he  had to take care of them cows, and Dad wanted him to go get that fish,  to help him land that fish. He couldn   t land it by himself. He said,     He   ll be gone by the time you get ready     (Laughter)  Bishop But he got it.  Matthews He wasn   t gone by the time he got ready, he got the fish.  Bishop I assume you went fishing, too?  Matthews I wasn   t fishing   I did fish. He did and I had to do everything he did.  Finchum You just had to.  Matthews Yeah. (Laughter)  Ketcher She has her own fishing pole and stuff. They fished all the time.  Matthews We just did whatever we wanted to do.  Ketcher And that was a lot, every weekend. They never missed a trick.  30  Bishop You said you   re just in the corner now, but what   s a typical day like for  you today? What time do you usually get up out of bed, get your day  started, and what do you do during the day?  Matthews What do I do during the day? First thing I do is a go outside and I look  at everything that   s a growing out there, all the way around. Then I   m  ready for the day. If I see something out there that needs to be done I  know that I   ll got to do that today.  Ketcher Tell them what you wanted to do this morning and I wouldn   t let you. It  was too late by the time she decided to do it.  Matthews (Laughs) I was going to go out there   she says,    You can   t do that        Ketcher You was going to walk to the post office and back   Matthews Yeah, I was. I didn   t get to, though. You wouldn   t say    Well go on.     Bishop How far is the post office?  Ketcher Probably about a mile.  Matthews It   s up to the end and down to the highway.  Bishop Do you walk there often?  Matthews Yeah. I ain   t been walking lately. Ain   t had time to, trying to get all the  grass out of the flowerbeds. (Laughs)  Finchum How early do you get up?  Matthews About five o   clock.  Finchum When the sun comes.  Matthews I have to get up early because I have to make my bed up, have to  straighten my room up, have to take a bath, all them things you have to  do before you get out of your bedroom. (Laughs)  Finchum And what time do you go to bed? How late do you stay up?  Matthews Oh, eleven o   clock, twelve o   clock, whatever, whenever we get through  playing Farkle.  Finchum Playing Farkle? I don   t know that one.  31  Matthews We play Farkle, we play marbles, we still play like we always did.  Ketcher My family, our family, has always played games, games, games, every  kind of games when we get together. Every night we either play Farkle  or marbles, one of the two. Every night.  Finchum Do you win some?  Matthews Yeah, I win.  Ketcher She wins a lot.  Matthews Sometimes I   m on a losing streak though and I don   t win a thing. But  I   m just as happy anyway. I don   t care if I win or not, I got to play.  (Laughs) So that   s the way this old woman lives.  Ketcher We have friends that come over on Monday nights and we play, but we  play every night before we go to bed.  Finchum Would you go dancing when you were younger?  Matthews I   m afraid so.  Ketcher Still does.  Matthews I   d go dancing now if I didn   t have an equilibrium problem.  Bishop What kind of dancing would you do back in the day? Square-dancing,  ballroom dancing     Matthews I could dance all of them. I could jitterbug, too.  Finchum Jitterbug   Ketcher She square-danced too, loved square-dancing.  Matthews I can do all them things. My dad was a violinist so I learned to dance by  standing on his toes. That   s how little I learned, how little I was when I  started dancing.  Bishop Did you play an instrument? Did you ever play an instrument like the  violin or piano?  Matthews Me? No, I never did play an instrument.  Finchum He didn   t teach you how to play the violin?  32  Matthews No, he didn   t. He taught me how to read the stars though. He taught me  if I got lost, he taught me how to know where I was going by looking at  the stars. Boy that will help you out, you know it?  Finchum It will, especially out in the country.  Matthews It   ll help you out, won   t make you no difference where you are. You  look up in the sky at them stars, and if you know how to read them you  know which way to go to where you want to go. That star will tell you.  Where that star is   the different ways that you look at it that tells you  which way to go. Like if you lived this way, well that star will be a  certain way. He taught me to read them stars. I can   t read all of them  now.  Finchum How had he learned?  Matthews I don   t know how he learned. Now he could play any instrument that he  picked up, but he never went to school. He just could play.  Finchum Could play by ear? Well did you sing?  Matthews He did.  Finchum Did you?  Matthews Yeah, but it was not singing like people do today, but I sung to my kids  when they was little.  Bishop When history is written, what would you like it to say about you? How  would you like to be remembered?  Matthews Remembered as a normal, good, person. I guess that   s all. I hope I   m  good.  Finchum And I good pie maker.  Matthews Yeah.  Finchum For your next 100 years, what are your plans?  Matthews Oh, I ain   t going to live that long. The good Lord will be come for me  before then.  Finchum We don   t know.  33  Matthews He wouldn   t do that. That   d be bad. I   d get to where I couldn   t walk, do  nothing else if I   m going to live that long.  Finchum Well the next ten years.  Matthews Shoot, I ain   t going to live ten years. I   ll be dead. I   m just going to live  until I die. I   ll just be happy with whatever he gives me. If he wants me  to stay here another year, I   ll stay another year and be happy I am. How  you supposed to do it?  Finchum Sounds good to me.  Matthews I wouldn   t know any other way to do. Only thing is I don   t want nobody  to wait on me. I can   t stand for people to wait on me. I   m supposed to  wait on somebody else. That   s the way I feel. I don   t like to be waited  on.  Bishop You like to do for yourself.  Matthews Yeah, and I will if I can.  Bishop Do you have anything on your bucket list? Anything you still want to do  that you have never done before or tried?  Matthews No, because I   ve been on cruises and I   ve done everything. I   ve done  everything I   ve seen I wanted to do, if I wanted to do it bad enough.  This is what I taught my grandson. At one of my birthdays he got up  and talked. He said,    My grandma told me that I could do anything I  wanted to do if I wanted to do it bad enough.    (Laughs) So that   s what  I   m saying. If I   m wanting to do it bad enough, I   m going to do it. I   m  just going to live whatever he gives me and be glad he did it.  Finchum I just can   t picture you hopping on a train. (Laughs)  Matthews Well, boy I done it. (Laughs) I could do anything that anybody else  could do.  Bishop That   s something we didn   t ask, the Great Depression. The Great  Depression   do you remember   was it a bad time for you or a good  time? What was it like?  Matthews I   ll tell you what people. Now listen, I   m telling you the truth, so you  listen to this. During the Depression I   ve seen people standing in line  that reached from this house down yonder to that filling station just to  get a bowl of soup. They hadn   t had nothing to eat all day, they   d been  34  standing in that line. Now I   ve seen that  I know it   s the truth, I was  there  I didn   t have to stand in line, but I was one of the lucky ones.  And you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel, but you couldn   t get the  nickel. Now that was bad times, but I was still happy because I was  young. I wasn   t smart then. I just lived, but now I can see how bad it  was. It was bad. I wouldn   t want no more depressions to come.  Ketcher I   m going to tell you a story about Mom. I was young, I must   ve been  about seven, can   t remember, I was young. This lady came to our  house, I don   t know what it was all about. I grew up in a house that was  never any turmoil. We did not turmoil in our house. I never had turmoil  in my house. Anyway, I must   ve been about seven and this lady came to  the house and she was upset about something. I don   t remember what it  was over. I was scared because I wasn   t used to anybody   I was scared  to death because this woman was yelling around. Mother was just  standing there and Mother was saying,    I   m sorry, but that   s not how it  is.    She never raised her voice and this woman   I   m just scared to  death because this woman   s just yelling around and I   ve never been  around this before. Mom just kept saying,    I   m sorry, but that   s not how  it is. You   re looking at it wrong.    She just   same voice, just never got  upset. That impressed me, and I always wanted to be like Mother. That  was one of my goals when I was young, was to be like my mother. That  was the thing that stood in my heart forever. It was just that woman had  the wrong concept. Mother never got bent out of shape, she never raised  her voice, and that woman was just screaming at her. I   ll never forget  that.  Finchum Stayed calm and level-headed.  Ketcher She must   ve done something   she instilled something in all of us kids.  I   ll tell you, she did. I don   t know how she did it. I tried to do it with my  kids, but it   s just something that is there. I mean there   s five of us and  all five of us, our kids are very successful and have been, (knocks)  knock on wood, very good kids. We   ve been able to keep all of them  out of drugs. Don   t ask me how because I worked for the U.S. Federal  judges and I saw it from all families, all   from every step of life. For  some reason Mom has done something right and we   ve been very  lucky.  Our kids   my brother has two kids and they   re very successful and  professional jobs. My sister has two kids and they   re in very  professional jobs, one of them   s a doctor. I have two kids and they   re  very professional kids. My daughter has a degree in electrical  engineering. She   s never used it, she   s never worked, but she   s got it.  My son is in computers. Who have I left out? My little sister, did I leave  35  my little sister   my little sister has two kids, I think I mentioned her.  One of them   s a professional, he works at Tinker and the other one is a  doctor. Our kids   we   ve really been lucky. My husband and I put our  grandkids in private school, and my daughter has four children. One of  them is a schoolteacher, one of them this is her sixth year of medical  school, and the one of them this is her third year of nursing. She   s going  to be a diabetic specialist nurse. Then the boy is a petroleum engineer.  They   re all straight-A students. I   m telling you, my daughter has done a  good job. My mother has done a good job.  My little brother, his boy, is a   he hires doctors for a certain region.  What   s that   where is that hospital in that   that real, real, known  hospital? I think it   s in New York. He hires the doctors for that very  well-known hospital, whatever the name of it is. We   ve been very  fortunate. Mother has instilled in us the important   although she only  has an eighth grade education, she has always instilled in us to better  ourselves and to get the education. They always told us,    If you get that  education, nobody can take that away from you. You   ve got it. If  you   ve got an education, you   ve got it. No one can take that away from  you.    That   s what we tried to make sure that our kids had their  education no matter what. My daughter, she   s an electrical engineer, but  she   s never used it. (Laughs) Her husband   s an executive for  Honeywell, makes good money.  Finchum Come from good stock.  Bishop You started it.  Ketcher She did.  Matthews I didn   t. (Laughter)  Ketcher And to do things with your children. Always live on their level. Talk to  them, do things with them. Keep that rapport going. She instilled that in  us.  Matthews The next old woman that y   all visit, she   ll be nicer to you. (Laughs)  Finchum No, you   re great  If I live to be 100, I   d want to be just like you.  Matthews (Laughs) Well thank you  I look like I   m crying, but I   m not. I have  implants. The tears come and I can   t do nothing about it.  Finchum You have pretty blue eyes.  36  Matthews When they cry, they cry. I have nothing to do   I don   t have nothing to  do with it. I can   t control it.  Finchum Just say they   re tears of joy.  Matthews Because that   s the way they   s supposed to do.  Ketcher She still goes   she goes with us. We go dancing and she goes with us.  We   re out until one o   clock in the morning and she   s still out there. She  don   t say,    Let   s go home,    or nothing else. She waits until it   s all over.  Now she did spend her ninetieth birthday in the Bahamas   four  months  My brother kept her over there for four months. She   s  supposed to go to the Dominican Republic this winter.  Finchum Go and enjoy.  Bishop Yeah, absolutely.  Finchum I think we   ve covered a lot, are you ready to stop?  Matthews If the good Lord   s ready for me to stop     Finchum No, for me to stop asking you questions. Are you ready for me to stop  asking you questions?  Matthews Oh, I don   t care if you ask me questions. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, who   d you get your blue eyes from?  Matthews (Laughs) My dad. Ask her what kind of eyes my dad had.
