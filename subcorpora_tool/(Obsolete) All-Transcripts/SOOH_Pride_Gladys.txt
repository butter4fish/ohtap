 Wilson  Pride  Today is April 6, 2012, and my name is Latasha Wilson. I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. I   m in  Tipton, Oklahoma, with Gladys Pride, interviewing Gladys today for the  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project. Thanks for having me over.  Look and see there, the old horse all saddled up. See that? (Gestures)  We   re looking at this Tillman County Fair Cookbook from     You know what? Everybody got a recipe in here. Their names is in here.  Some of Joann   s and them up there at Stillwater, their names is in here,  too.  Oh, wow.  Yes, an old book. John McCullough and Richard McCullough   Richard  used to have a fraternity there in Stillwater, he and his wife. They moved  from Stillwater and stay in Edmond there, I think. John McCullough  used to stay in Norman, and I think they moved somewhere there in  Edmond. And see, Joann Elson, they all used to live here. Sharon Goba,  she used to live here, and Erin Goba, her and her married two brothers,  they live in Stillwater. See, I worked with Joann Elson about twenty-five  years. Margaret Ann and Jo Berry, they both was teachers up there in  Oklahoma City, up there in Stillwater, and they   ve been there quite some  time. I worked with their daddy twenty-five years. John McCulloch and  them got a country home out here. I worked in that country home out  there twenty-five years for them folks.  Wow. What did you do for them?  Cleaned house and ironed, and I worked for the bank up there. I   ve been  here at this bank. I was sent about twenty-six or twenty-seven years, and  5  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  I just come home from up there. I   ve been there that long, cleaning for  them. Then I worked for a farmer, Nicky Dyser, here, and I   ve been with  him about twenty-six years, and I   m still with him. I work three days a  week with him, and I   m ninety-two years old.  Wow.  I still work, and I work for a veterinary down there. I   ve been with them  going on about five years now. I went there this morning and cleaned  her house.  Wow. So you stay busy.  I still work, and I   m not on no welfare, nothing like that. We just  working. This is my little girl, and that was my daughter sitting there.  Well, she   s retarded. She   s never been able to go to anybody   s  schooling. She lose one of her eyes. I carries her a lot of times to this eye  specialist in Altus. I   ve been in Oklahoma City, had her up there, too.  They told me if they put her to sleep, she wouldn   t wake up, so I told  them no. I couldn   t give my child   s life away.  No way.  So I   m well known in Tipton.  Well, when were you born?  Me?  Yes.  I was born in 1920.  And where was that?  In Hillsboro, Texas.  Okay. How did you come to Oklahoma?  My grandmother brought us here.  Where   d she bring you?  Snyder. See, I came from Snyder down here, and I   ve been here about  thirty-two years now. Oh, it used to be a whole lot of people live up in  here. Kids went to school. The bus used to come in because lots of kids  6  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  used to live here and all around here. Now it ain   t but just myself and the  widow lady over there and a widow lady right up here, which her  husband   s in the rest home over at Altus. Oh, it used to be lots of people  here, all back down in those houses on that side. Used to be a big house  right there, and used to be a big building right there, a long barrack. A  lady there and her husband used to live right there. They all are gone,  but they got kids here and kinfolk. I don   t have any kinfolk live here.  What happened to everybody?  A lot of them died out, and some of them moved away. A lot of them  moved to Oklahoma City. Some of them passed away up there. It was  their parents and stuff. It was a lot of colored people living here when I  came here.  And when did you come here?  I would say about    59 or    60, I would say.  What brought you to Tipton?  Oh, I just got tired of Snyder. I worked for everybody up there, nearly  about. I got property there. Sometimes I drive back up there, but I used  to live in Houston.  Really? So you went from Snyder to Houston?  When it would get cold here in Snyder, I   d leave and go to Houston and  stay until it got warm. Then I   d move and come back. (Laughter) See,  my daughter just died. She   s been dead going on two years now. In  Houston, she lived practically all her life there, too. She had cancer, and  she passed away. Yes, I   m well known here. I   ve worked for a whole lot  of people here and still work for them. I don   t have problems with  people. I love people.  How do you find people to work for?  Well, they hire me. See, they hired me there at the bank, and this here  farmer I work for, his daddy-in-law hired me. Little ol    kids was about  like that when I started working for him. Now they all grown now, and I  still work three days a week for him. I tell you what. I never have no  trouble with people where I work for. I just do what I   m told to do, and  so I don   t have no problem with everybody. I get along with people, so I  don   t believe in problem. You know what? If the world would be like  that, these young folks, if they come up when I come up, it wouldn   t be  no jailhouse and all this stuff here. See, just like you, working. You   re  7  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  helping pay for all this food. If that   s left, they   d eat up. Look at TV,  we   re paying for all of that.  When I come up, there wasn   t no juvenile places. When you done  something, you got in trouble at home. If you at school, do something,  you got a spanking there, but they   re not allowed to spank them now.  And you know what? Things has changed since I grew up. I   d go over,  and I   d go visit people. I   d go visit white kids and played over there.  Well, see, when I done something there, my grandmother give me a  spanking there, and then when I got home, I was scared to tell it because  I   m going to get another one there. That   s the way I was raised, but now,  teacher can   t spank the kids. Kids beating the teachers up, killing them.  Well, what did your grandparents do for a living?  Well, my grandmother, she was a widow when she got us. I don   t even  know her husband. She was old, then, too. It was nine of us, and she  raised us all and had us all in a tent.  So there were ten people in that tent in Snyder?  My grandmother and my sisters and brothers.  What was the tent like?  Oh, it was just a great big ol    white tent. You know, you would say it  kind of looked like it was made out of, like, denim. It was big, huge, and  they had it stretched all down where it rained and nothing couldn   t get  in. It was just warm in that. It was warmer than a house.  And what were your beds like? What did you sleep on?  My grandmother just had beds and cots, them little folding cots for the  boys.  Did you have neighbors that were also in tents?  No. Well, I guess they probably had more than my grandmother did  because she had to raise all of us right then. And see, that was in WPA   Works Progress Administration  days when my grandmother   that   s  what helped raise us and feed us. They   d give away food and stuff for  people, poor people.  So did she do some work for WPA?  No, not WPA. She worked for a lawyer for about twenty-something  8  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  years. She   d go and clean their house. They had a little house out there  where she done their washing and ironing in. See, in them days, you  washed clothes on a rub board, and they had an old iron pot. She   d boil  the clothes outside, and then she   d hang them outside, and they   d dry.  Then the next day, she   d go back and iron. You see all them clothes  hanging there? I got to do them. There   s a box full there. That come  from Altus, and this is people around in Tipton. I just never have got at it  because we   ve been moving some of her stuff where they broke in the  house, piled up in my house. I ain   t got walking room.  My grandmother would go every Monday, and she   d do their washing,  and on a Tuesday, she done their ironing. That   s how I learned how to  iron. My grannymum would carry me when I was a big-sized little girl  like this. (Gestures) She had a little bench she   d always carry when  ironing time comes, and she   d carry me. Well, my grandmother done all  the good ironing and clothes and stuff, but when it come to the  handkerchief, she   d put me up on that little bench. Every time I   d iron a  wrinkle in it, she   d take it and re-sprinkle it, and she said,    Don   t stop  until you get every wrinkle out of it.    That   s how I learned how to iron.  Wow. The irons then, they didn   t plug in.  Yes, had them little old irons had a little hole in them, and you stick that  little handle in them. They put them on a hot plate and get them hot. You  don   t hardly ever see them now.  That was more work than it is today.  That   s how I learned how to iron. In them days, people learned their kids  how to do stuff. You didn   t get away. When you got out of school, you  had chores to do when you got home. Nowadays, some kids just as soon  as they get out of school, half the time their parents don   t know where.  They just get out. People going to the neighbors    houses for somebody  to play with. I couldn   t do that.  Where did you fall in line with your brothers and sisters? What number  child were you?  Well, I had a brother was older than all of us, and I got one more brother  left is older than I am. He   s in California. Just the two of us left now:  myself and my brother in California. My other brother, he lived in  Chickasha. He retired from the army, and he was retired from Tinker  Field up there. Well, he passed away with cancer. I had another brother  worked out in California, called Blythe, California. He worked there  where it was real hot, and they said it petrified his brains, and he died  out there. All of my brothers and sisters is all gone. Just myself and my  9  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  next oldest brother out in California, just the two of us left.  My other two sisters, they lived in Houston, and that   s where they died.  Somebody killed my older sister and her husband. We don   t know who  done it. I had a step-sister there. Somebody killed them. Nobody knows.  There   s been a lot of people been coming up in Altus dead. Nobody  don   t know, no. It   s getting sad. But I tell you about Tipton. I like  Tipton. We don   t have no trouble here in Tipton. We don   t have nobody  breaking in nothing in Tipton. We don   t have nobody breaking in  people   s houses, taking what they got, and beating the older people, like  they done that in Lawton, beating them, tying them up. They found a  lady, come out in the Lawton paper. She was from Lawton. They know  she come up missing. They found her way over there in Duncan under a  bridge. Somebody done killed her and I guess stuck her under a bridge.  Wow.  That   s sad, too.  Yes, that   s very sad. Well, did you go to school when you were growing  up in Snyder?  Yes, I went to school there in Snyder. I got high as the sixth grade there  in Snyder. We had a little colored school up there.  What was it called?  I forget what that little ol    school they had up there. Now they   ve got a  church there where they used to have the old school. Just everything up  there at Snyder is about gone. Where the older people lived, they done  built a project there. When I left there, they didn   t even have a project  there.  And now there is.  They tore the old church down instead of leaving it there for the old  landmark, but they didn   t. Yes, I lived there, and my grandmother, then  after she kind of got up and got on welfare with her, she bought a house.  Had it up there right on the street that you go on before you get to my  part way down this way. Well, then they finally tore the house up and  built that project all right there. You take Snyder. Snyder used to be a  little booming town. Like older people, a lot of older people is dead and  gone now. I used to work at a old juice store, there. Well, the juice store  is still there. Some of the kids is still running it. I   d go down there on a  Sunday, stamp stuff, and supply the shelves, and I worked at the cleaners  twelve years pressing men   s suits. That   s what I done. I like to do a lot  10  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  of stuff.  How old were you when you got your first job?  Well, I would say I was about twenty-five. I worked all my life, just like  I   m doing now. My grandmother didn   t raise no lazy kids. We had to get  up and go to school, and when you come from school, you had stuff to  do at home. You couldn   t go play.  Was there much segregation in Snyder?  Well, not too much, but they had their schools, and the colored people  had their schools. The colored school I think just went to the eleventh  grade. That   s as far as they could go. Well, then if the kids wanted to go  and finish, they had to leave. A lot of kids went to Langston. That   s a  colored place, I think. Went to Langston College.  And then you were mentioning the colored school here in Tipton.  No, I never did go to the colored school. I was grown when I come here.  Yes, but they did have one here.  Yes, back out there past the cemetery.  But the kids couldn   t graduate from high school here. They had to go     No, they had to go to Frederick, until they finally let them go to school  here. They can finish the twelfth grade here now. They all go to school  together here now.  When did that happen? Do you know?  I think that happened somewhere around, I believe, in the    60s. But see,  all the kids nowadays go to school. I don   t think they have no problem.  They all get along, and I think that   s pretty good. I wasn   t raised to hate  white people like some kids was raised to hate black people. My  grandmother didn   t allow that. She taught us, said,    Regardless of the  color, they human beings just like you. I don   t want y   all to be hating  them.    And you know what? I love people, and I get along with them. I  got a good pull with all the white folks here. They all know me. They  know I work hard. I don   t have problems. I was raised that way. I   m just  an old settled person. I love everybody. I can   t go to hating you or not  letting you come in my house. No. My grandmother would raise up in  her grave if she thought I would do something like that. No.  11  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  People are just people.  Yes. I love people. And, you know, where I work at, people love me,  too, because they tell me that. I work up there at the bank now. Most all  the older people that I work with way back, they not in there. They   re  just young girls just like you. And our security guard, he   s a young  fellow. I   m the oldest one in there. Our first banker, Bruce McCullough,  he live out there in the new edition. He tell them quickly,    Now, Gladys  was here when you all come in. Don   t bother with her because she   s not  going to bother y   all.    We don   t have no problem. All the girls up there,  all three of them, they young. Probably some of them getting close to  forty years old. We get along just like kinfolk. That   s the way it should  be.  Definitely.  Yes.  Well, what was Tipton like when you moved here?  Well, when I moved here, they had cafes here. Boy, this here place, I  had a teenage joint right there.  You had a what?  Teenage joint, piano, with kids coming. I   d give little parties for little  kids and give them presents every Christmas. I had a piano there, and  they danced and do everything. And we had another place over there.  You know the men, they always liked to play that gambling stuff to  make money, but I had a teenage joint over there. Boy, the kids would  just come in there from Frederick and Lawton and everywhere and just  have a good time. Now, if they   re fighting and going on, we had a high  sheriff that sure would take you in, so we didn   t have no problems like  that with them. I don   t have no problems with no police or no highway  patrol or nothing. Wherever I go, whenever they stop me for checking  and stuff, I have it out. I don   t believe in giving them no problem  whatsoever.  Were there quite a few more businesses in town when you arrived in  Tipton?  Yes, lots of people was here, and lots of colored people. See, a lot of  people used to live all back here on the farm, and the kids went to that  colored school. I don   t know how far it went, but they went over there at  that colored place there in Frederick, too. Now, Frederick is a big sized  place than this place. I   m just fourteen miles here from Frederick. Yes,  12  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  we had lots of   there   s a lot of people here, colored people live here.  They had homes and stuff here when I come in, all back up there by that  railroad track, people   s houses, and that big church there, too.  Really?  Yes, there was houses all along back in here.  What was the church?  Mount Zion, Mount Zion Baptist Church. Now they got their little  church there in town.  Okay. Did you go there?  Yes, I went several times. I never have been to this one up here. But,  boy, there used to be lots of people live here.  Were most people working in farming?  Yes, they were working for farmers, like some of them now. There   s a  few of them now are working for farmers, too. It   s not too many people  now working for farmers, just about one or two. I used to work ol    Bob  Young   s, stayed out here at what you call the Number One school. That  big school is still out there. I used to work all back in there. I worked for  that fellow   oh, let me see. What is his name? I forget his name. I  worked for him a long time back out in there. Then Bob Young, back  out in that, going to that old Number One. They called it Number One  school. I worked for him twelve years out there, and he passed on, too.  It   s still a lot of people that live back around in there.  I used to work for that Capps. He   s some senator or something,  Gilmer  Capps . He lived out in Snyder. I used to work for him, too, around  through there. I worked for lots of people just like I do here now. You  see these young folk? They play like they can   t do anything. I get up  early. I   m at work about seven o   clock every day. You see young  people   I was raised to get up and go to work. I had to help with my  little younger sisters and brothers. My grandmother would make us get  up and do chores. We had to do chores before you go to school. Then  when you come from school, you didn   t go running around playing like  kids do now. We had work to do. You had to do it or get a spanking.  And that built character?  Yes. Yes, you bet it do. You take kids nowadays, young kids won   t  work. All they do is try to get in trouble. You know that ain   t no good.  13  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  You mentioned there was a drugstore in Tipton when you moved here?  Yes. Yes, there was a drugstore right straight across from the First  National Bank there now. Well, see, the First National Bank used to be  right there on that corner on the north side, on that corner where they got  the water thing. Now the bank is over on the south corner there. And  straight down that way from that bank, there was a dry goods store right  in there. Used to be a theater in there, too. Then further on down, some  old fellow had a grocery store. Then on this north side, they had a  drugstore. That fellow had a pottery place, and then a little old man, he  had a hardware store in there. Him and his wife passed and gone. Then  they had a pressing shop there. All of them people is dead and gone.  Drugstore went out, and now little buggers going straight down that  way.  On the end, last end, a man had a body shop that way. He fixed cars.  They both got drowned in that  Lake  Lugert place up there. Then, some  man come in there. He put in a big funeral home. Well, he just only had  two bodies. Then he quit and left. The man I worked for, he bought the  building. His wife used to teach dancing lessons there. She passed away  when she had cancer. She had three kids when she passed away, so he  raised them three little ol    kids there by himself. I done their washing  and ironing and stuff. Now they all grown. I still keep stuff and keep the  house for them. Tyler, he   s finishing in May. His older boy   s already  finished and got his job, and his baby girl, she   s in Norman. That   s  where she go to college is Norman. Tyler, he   ll finish in May. He   s  going to be a technician in the hospital. I say he   ll make big money.  While he   s at home, I keep up with his clothes. They just don   t have  problems. I   ve just been working for them so long, I knows what to go  in the house and do.  Do you still buy your groceries in Tipton?  No. Boy, you can   t buy nothing in that store. (Laughter) What little he  got is awful expensive. I go to Altus. I went to Frederick today. I had to  go to the bank over there and get me some money. Then I bought roses  over there, and I buy a lot at that Wal-Mart, but they getting awful  expensive, too. Sometimes I go   I got my car, and I go to Lawton. I get  my grandson   that   s my grandson. (Gestures) He live in Lawton. He  works for that wholesale company, carrying stuff to bases and plum on  all around to Stillwater and around and further, and up here at the REA   Rural Electric Association  and around. He drives a truck. His wife is a  secretary of a college there.  Did you used to buy groceries in Tipton back when there were more  14  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  options?  Yes, well, Sam Killebrew and them owned a store, then. They still here  now. They live out there in the new addition. Yes, Tipton used to be a  booming little town. You know what? There used to be a lot of business  places here. Nice churches. They have three nice churches here.  What do you see as the future of Tipton?  I just don   t want to leave. I like it because I done got old, and I don   t  think older people at my age got no business going to these big towns  trying to live and take it up. It   s just not a good idea. I like Tipton. You  don   t have no trouble with people coming to your house, breaking in.  You just don   t have no problems with people, even uptown. It   s a lot of  widow ladies live alone. They don   t have nobody breaking in on them.  See, in Lawton, I wouldn   t dare to drive there by myself. Knock you in  the head. They   ve beaten older people, tying them up.  Goodness.  That   s bad. Well, it   s all young folks that   s doing it, not older people.  You think, old as I am, two young folks come in and beat me, I couldn   t  handle them. Hit you all in the head. They just robbed an old couple in  there. Been about two months ago. Broke into their house, beat the  people, older folk, took their money, and then turned around and tied  them up.  That   s awful.  I don   t see how they could do it. I don   t see how they could hit them.  I don   t either.  I couldn   t do that. Lawton is a bad   that   s a death city, there. I don   t  want no parts of it. I go to get my grandson, he comes and gets me and  cabs me over. I go to that Sam   s Wholesale over there. I go early  because I tell him to come and get me early. I get out of that place. I get  my groceries and get away from there because it   s dangerous. You don   t  ever know when they come in there with a machine gun and shoot a lot  of people. People done got evil. You got to take care of yourself. I done  got old, and my place is at home when I get off my job, at home. I get  out there and cut what you see. I   m starting to raise me a garden. I do  that every year. One year, I raised so many nice sweet potatoes, I carried  a great big box up there to the bank for the girls and everything.  Do you like to cook?  15  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Yes, I sure do love to cook  I raise the sweet potatoes that big, and they  kept on telling me I should have put that in the fair. I raise a lot of nice  sweet potatoes. I just go out there and dig them and put them in a box,  carry them up there to the girls at the bank, and let them share it with  them.  That   s really nice.  Yes, I love people, now.  Are there any recipes that your grandmother would make that you  know?  No, you know what? When my grandmother was raising my family, I  never seen a cookbook in her house. It seemed like them older people,  they didn   t have cookbooks. I guess they just knowed what to do. My  grandmother and them, and even when I came here to Tipton, raised  hogs here, raised chickens. Well, after this got in the city limit, they  wouldn   t let you raise hogs no more, but they didn   t bother you about  raising chicken. You take me. If I had somebody build me another  chicken house, I   d have chickens. The chicken you buy at the store, it  seems like you can   t cook them, blood running out of them. I don   t think  that   s decent to eat.  What   s your method for killing a chicken?  I kill the chicken, now  Boy, I get out there and wring his neck. They  just flop everywhere  And if the cats is out there, boy, cats would be out,  and you   d have to keep them away from them. Boy them chickens just  hop up, after you done wring their necks off. A lot of people say they  can   t kill chickens, but I did.  Then would you dip it in hot water?  Yes, dip it in hot water and pick them. You know, when I come up, we  done all that stuff. We washed clothes on a rub board in the tub.  With lye soap?  Yes, my grandmother made it. You know what she   d do? She   d mix  that, and she had one of those big iron pots. You hardly see that  anymore. She had them ol    big iron pots, and, Lord, she   d get out there  and boil her soap and make her soap, you know. She just sat there and  had a little thing like a paddle. She just sat there, and she stirred. She  always wore a big bonnet. Boy, she sat there, and she   d just stir that lye  16  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  soap. Well, when she thought that soap was ready, she   d make me go get  her a saucer. She   d take that paddle and dip it down there and put a little  of that in that saucer. Then she   d taste of it. Then she   d put water on it  and put the fire out. Well, then when that soap got cold, she   d just take  her a knife and cut it in blocks. She washed her hair with it, washed  dishes with it, took a bath with it. You didn   t see no other soap like that.  Did you taste it? Did you know what she was     No, I didn   t taste it, but I took a bath with it. Washed my hair with it,  too. You know what? People done lots of things in them days. That   s the  reason I don   t like to go to doctors, now. My grandmother never went to  a doctor. My grandmother sat down   she cured people with pneumonia.  Really?  She took tallow, the stuff from the hog. Ripped, pulled that tallow stuff  off a hog, guts. She   d render it out and put it where it   d get cold. Then  when it got cold, she would take that grease, put snuff in it, and she put  turpentine in it and make salve. She   d make all that up. When kids  would turn around and come down with pneumonia, she   d take them and  put them in the bed, and she   d just grease them, all the chest and back,  with that. She had this here what you call flannel. She   d light that oil,  that flannel, and she   d put it on them, here and then their back. She   d lay  them in the bed, and that hog hoof off of the hog, they dried that. She  made tea out of it. You drank that tea. She   d make that tea, and, boy,  she   d just cover you up, head and ear. She wouldn   t let you get out from  under there, and she said,    When you sweat, the pneumonia is over  with.    She   d lay there and cover you up with lots of covers. Boy, you   d  just be wringing sweat when you come out. Then she   d say,    It   s all over  with.    They had a lot of   they had an imagination they used, and it  worked. And now, look at that now. We just go to the doctor. She never  went to no doctor. She didn   t carry us to the doctor. She cured a lot of  things with the herbs. You see people, they scared to use stuff like that  now.  Would she grow her own herbs?  No, she bought it at a drugstore. You know what? Look at people sick  now. My grandmother, she never went to the cellar. I never did go to a  cellar until I come to Tipton. When I was in Snyder, didn   t go to no  cellar.  And what did you say the nickname for Snyder is?  Cyclone City  You know what? My grandmother, she didn   t go to the  17  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  cellar. She didn   t let us go. She had a big cellar, but we didn   t go to it.  When it come a storm, my grandma said,    Go get that Bible.    She said,     I want you to turn to the twenty-third of Psalm. I want you to read that  twice, the twenty-third verse of Psalm,    she said.    Read it twice.    When  I   d read it twice, she said,    Now, turn the face of that Bible down.    She  said,    That splits the storm.    Old folks used to even get an axe when  they see it   s going to come a storm. They take that double-blade axe,  stick it in the ground. They say that splits the storm. My grandmother  done that a many day.  I didn   t know what going to the cellar was until I come here. She didn   t  let us go to the cellar. You know, it was right there in that big cellar,  right close there. She had that big tent. It was on the north side of the  little colored church up there at Snyder, which they done tore that church  down. They should have left it as a landmark. That   s where she had that  big tent at. Boy, when my grandmother would be at work and we   d be  sitting up in that tent, boy, it   d be just pouring down rain. We   d go up  there, we kids just go there, opened the church door. They had benches,  then, what you sit on, them long benches. We kids would just go and  stretch out on them benches and go to sleep. One thing, you get up and  water would just be running everywhere. Storms, it didn   t bother us. Oh,  I tell you what. People lived good in them days. People raised their own  food, canned stuff. Look at it now. We have to go to the grocery store  for everything.  Did you all have a garden by your tent?  Yes, my grandmother raised a garden there. She raised us there in the  tent. That   s where my property is there in Tipton. That was two lots  there. One of them was my grandma   s, and my grandma said the other  one was our mother   s. She told me, she said,    Now, the first one of you  kids build a house on there, I   ll give you my lot, and you can have your  mother   s lot.    I was the one to build a house on that. I got her lot and  then my mother   s lot. I rented my house up there, and the people tore it  up, but I still got the two lots up there. Snyder used to be big up there.  There used to be lots of colored people there. Used to be, they   d have  big church, and then every year they   d have what you   d call some kind  of church thing, you know. It would be people coming from everywhere  there at Snyder in that church.  For a certain holiday?  In the church they had what you call some kind of anniversary. Boy, we  had people coming from that away. The pastor that owned that church, I  think they lived in Lawton that time. His name was Reverend Warren.  They   d come and always stay at my grandmother   s house. My  18  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  grandmother, she   d go to church. She   d carry us to church. When I got  grown, I was the secretary of the Eastern Star. I was secretary of the YW   Young Women  at the church, and I was secretary of the mission. When  I came from Snyder down here, it was kind of backwards. Nobody  belongs to Eastern Star here. I think the white folks had it, but it   s no  coloreds here that belong to it.  Did you encourage it?  No. Well, see, I wasn   t high enough to. I still got my mission book, and I  still got my book from that. When we got here, nobody belongs to stuff  like that. That was kind of odd to me. We had all that up there. Mission,  we have turnout days for mission. People would come to Lawton on  them days, join up there. They all wore white. It   s just odd when you go  to a town, just like nobody of color didn   t belong to Eastern Star. Well,  they had that at Lawton because they used to come to Snyder when we   d  have them big days for that.  What was your grandmother   s name?  Florence Tolliver.  Tolliver?  Yes. You know, when she went to church, she wore her bonnet. They  made them bonnets where you get this stiff paper and put in there.  That   s what she wore. What she wore all through the winter to church,  she just wore two pieces. She made her dresses. She made them little  things on the slip. We called them shimmies. She had a little ol    yoke  made on it that gathered on that in the back, wore all that stuff down to  the toe of her shoes, and she wore that bonnet. She had real long hair  because she was mixed with Indian. She wore her hair plaited, and she   d  part it, do big long plaits. She   d put on her bonnet. That   s the way she  wore it to church.  Did she live in Texas when you did, or did she always live in Snyder?  No, she lived in Texas, too. They moved from Hillsboro to Snyder.  I wonder why they moved to Snyder.  In Texas at that time, I think it   s still there now   just like people  drawing checks in Oklahoma. If you move to Texas, that   s all going to  be cut. You ain   t going to draw in Texas what you can here. That   s why  a lot of people come to Oklahoma. They can get more on their check  than they would in Texas because if you move to Texas and you   re  19  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  getting social security, it   s going to be cut. They have different rules  than Oklahoma. That   s the same way if you leave Texas with a car and  got Texas tags, after so long, the law will make you change to here.  You   ve got to change. That   s state rule. I like Texas. I go to Vernon a lot  and buy groceries. It   s different. They have different stuff than what we  have here. People in Texas, they more friendly than people in  Oklahoma.  Really?  Yes. I go to Vernon a lot. Them people that run the store, they look and  see us coming, boy, it seems like they just fall all over you. Tell you to  hurry back, don   t stay away too long. I don   t know why, but they just  more friendly. Seems like you get acquainted with Texas people better  than you do in Oklahoma. When I moved to Oklahoma, it took me a  long time to get acquainted and get friends with people in Oklahoma.  They   re not like Texas people. They   re more friendly.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Means a whole lot. I love Oklahoma. I   m going to stay Oklahoma, too. I  went to Texas when my daughter passed away down in Houston. That   s  a big, big, big place. It   s high cost of living, too. I wouldn   t want to live  there now. You couldn   t make enough money to pay bills. I tell you  what. I   m proud to be in Oklahoma, and I   m going to stay in Oklahoma.  I go to Vernon a lot. I do shopping around there. I like it because you  can go there and buy groceries. They got a United  Supermarket  there.  It   s a big store, and everything you want is there. It   s a lot of things they  grow there that you don   t see here. That   s what I like about Texas, too,  and people is more friendly. Lots of people in Vernon. But I like  Oklahoma because I   m going to stay here.  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  Well, I   d like for people to say nice things about me.  I think they will.  I   ll tell you what. I know everybody, and I   ll know you if you come  back again. I don   t forget people. I love people. You know, you take me.  A lot of these white folks here, ask them. I give them nice Christmas  presents. I go out of my way to buy nice stuff. I like people. And you  know what? I   m a fellow like this here. I like to pay a good price for  clothes. The friends I like, I like them. I buy them stuff. Don   t think  nothing about it. I like to share with people. My grandmother raised me,  20  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  said,    If you share with people, the Lord will bless you.    You know  what? I thank God every day. As old as I   I   m ninety-two years old. I  get up and work. I thank the Lord for that. It   s a lot of people ain   t old as  me already gone.  Yes, you look great, by the way   I love people. That   s why the Lord blessed me, because I love people. I  don   t shun nobody. I don   t hate people. People I can   t get along with, I  treat them nice. You   re supposed to treat your enemy just like you do  your friend. I treat them nice, I go on about my business, and I make it. I  like to work. I like to make a living for her because she   s not  responsible. You see people nowadays killing their own kids. I just  wonder,    Why is that?    You know something happened to that little kid,  I think it was over there in Lawton. Now they   re saying they   re going to  search them out. They don   t think the kid died like they say it did. I  think the little kid was three years old.  Goodness.  That   s sad.  Yes, well, Tipton is a great, nice community.  You know, Tipton is a great place for anybody to live that wants to live  because here   s the thing about it. We have polices here. They   re nice.  We   ve got a high sheriff in Frederick. They   re wonderful. They still  trying to keep the peace, and I sure hope we can keep them. Mighty fine  people. You know what? We   ve got our high sheriff. He   s a good man.  He   s a wonderful man, and I believe he   s a church man, too. One thing  that I like about him, he   s trying to get the drugs off the street. You  know, yourself, when he gets one bunch, it may be somebody else doing  the same thing, but he   s trying to clean it up. I think he   s a wonderful  man. We got a young fellow, he   s supposed to live out here north of  town, and I think he   s our county commissioner, I believe, Jimmie  Smith. Now, he   s got a young son over there. He   s with the high sheriff.  He   s a wonderful fellow, too. If we can keep them two people on, I think  they   d do wonderful.  We don   t have no problems here. We don   t have nobody breaking in  nothing. We   ve got two wonderful polices here who don   t be bothering  with people breaking in on people. We   ve got lots of widowed people  here. They can go lay down, they don   t have nobody coming and beating  them up and breaking in their house. Tipton is a good place for older  people to live. We don   t have problems here. We got nice people to run  the Senior Citizen. He got a little girl. Seemed like they said she was  21  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  twenty-five or something. She   s a pretty little girl. She can   t talk. She  can   t walk. She can   t feed herself. She can   t do nothing. He got a lady  that pushes her around while they at work. She   s a pretty little girl. They  bring her to the bank. The lady pushes her around because she brings the  money from the Senior Citizen, there. I quit and go up there and talk to  them. She tries to make a sound. She   s a very pretty little white girl.  I told them I   d just give anything if she could just even talk. She has  seizures pretty bad. She   s a very pretty little girl. He runs the Senior  Citizen. Wonderful people. His wife   s daddy is the Methodist priest.  That   s the one that run that little hardware store across the street there on  the end. He   s a wonderful man. That   s that little girl   s father. She   s a  very little ol    pretty girl. I said,    I   d just give anything if she could talk.     You go to talking to her, and she   ll just look at you and just smile. She   s  sweet. I   d just give anything for a little ol    girl like that if some way they  could make her talk. You know what? Sometimes them kids are kind of  pitiful. You know kids make fun of little ol    kids like that. They  shouldn   t do that because they could be that way someday. You never  know.  You mentioned it   s just been a few years that colored people could be  buried in the Tipton cemetery?  Yes, I believe it   s been about two or three years now that they start to  letting them bury there.  So where were they buried before?  Bury them in Frederick.  Really?  Yes. They   ve got a lot of colored people passed away. They buried in  Frederick. They never did seem to bother. I don   t know what was the  reason. You know, when I come here they had that little ol    theater up  here. Tipton, that   s when they wouldn   t hardly let colored people   my  husband had a uncle that lived here, and he worked with Mr. Jennings  out there on that road there. When he had that little theater up there, he   d  go down there by the white folks and sit down because he had Indian in  him. You couldn   t tell him from a white man. We had a law here called  Dick Lindsey. When he come up there at that show, he asked him why  he wasn   t up there in the buzzard roof. He told him,    I   m not going up  there.    Well, he made him get out of the show. He worked for Mr.  Jennings out here, and he told Dick Lindsey, he said,    Now, when I  come back tomorrow, I   m coming right back to the show. I   m going  back right where you made me get out. I   m going right back there and  22  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  sitting. I   m going to sit right there. I ain   t going to no buzzard roof up  there.     Well, Dick Lindsey, that evening, he found out he was back down there  sitting with the white folks, looking at the show. Then he come up in  there. He made him get out. He followed Dick Lindsey out on the  sidewalk. He took Dick Lindsey   s gun away from him. He turned around  and told him, he said,    Now I   ve got your gun. You made me get out of  the theater, but I   m not going to that buzzard roof. You   re not going to  bother me no more. I   ve got your gun. I could take your gun and turn  around and kill you right now, but I   m going to turn around and give it  back to you.    And he said,    Don   t you bother me no more.     Well, he went on there, and he told this Mr. Jennings. He was working  for Mr. Jennings, the farmer, out there. After he told him what Dick  Lindsey had done to him, here Mr. Jennings come back uptown, got in  his car and come uptown. He told Dick Lindsey, he said,    You know  what? I don   t want you to bother him again. You let him alone. That   s  my hand. I don   t want you to bother him again.    Well, he never did fool  with him. See, Mr. Jennings was a big farmer, you know. He used to, I  guess, own a lot around here. He never did bother that man again. I   ll  tell you the way he done. He didn   t like it because Mr. Jennings spoke  up for him. He turned around, Dick Lindsey, when they had all these  colored joints all up around down here. He called himself getting  revenge. He come up here in the colored part of town. He seen a colored  boy, and he said something to him. He just turned around and shot him  right there. Yes.  When was that?  Yes, turned around and shot him right there. That   s been years ago. He  was mad because Mr. Jennings told him,    Don   t bother that colored  fellow no more,    because that was his hand. Well, he come up there in  the colored part of town, had some few words with this colored boy, and  turned around and shot him right there.  So what happened to     That was it.  Nothing happened?  No, they didn   t go nowhere. They just killed him out of the blue sky.  Was that in the    60s?  23  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Oh, no, that was way back in then. That was probably back in the    30s.  Oh, yes, I guess you know it used to be some kind of mean people here  way back, but there ain   t none of them here. Them kind of people is all  dead and gone now. We   ve got good people here now, nice people. I like  them all. Now, we   ve got a postmaster up there, and I just don   t know.  (Laughter) That   s the meanest woman I ever seen. You know we   ve got  people who drive all the way Frederick just to get stamps   Wow.  They don   t want to fool with them. A lot of people go to Walgreen   s  over there and get stamps so they won   t have to go in there and fool with  her.  Oh, goodness. That   s too bad, but everybody else is nice.  Yes, she   s hateful. Her husband works at the REA, but seems to be a  nice person. Nobody here likes her. She   s hateful. I tell you what. I   ve  had two or three run-ins with her. I go to this store when I sometimes  need stamps, to get them if they   ve got them. One time I went in there     I   ve been in Tipton thirty-two years. I worked at the post office for  twelve years, cleaning it. That   s when Gordon Nelson was our  postmaster. Well, then she worked in there, putting up mail. I was right  there with her. She wasn   t that way. After she got postmaster   I   ve been  getting my mail, general delivery, ever since I   ve been in Tillman  County. Never had nobody to bother me.  One time I went in there, and, boy, she just went to beating on the  counter.    I   m not going to accept no more general delivery mail from  you     I said,    Well, why?       I   m just not going to accept no more     I  said,    Well, I hope that don   t be no problem.    I said,    If I have to get it,  I just have to get it.    So I went on in and got me a box. That stopped that  for a while in here about a month ago. That   s like if you owe a note at  the bank or something, if you   re going to pay it before time, you don   t  have to wait until just the exact date. Well, I went up there and wanted to  pay my box rent before time. She wouldn   t let me.    No, you wait until  the first.    I thanked her, and I went on. On the first, I went down to get  my mail. I didn   t go right on in there to pay it. I was going to pay it  when I come out to get my mail. Well, when I went to get my mail, she  done locked the box. Couldn   t get it. That   s just how hateful she is.  I asked her, I said,    Why did you lock my box?    Couldn   t answer that  question. She do older people wrong. I remember when poor little ol     Mrs. Gross, (she   s in the rest home now) she was sick. She had a  daughter that just come out of the hospital. Well, they both was trying to  wait on each other because her other daughter lived off then. They  24  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  Pride  Wilson  worked at banks. Mrs. Gross, she was sick, and she   s kind of crippled,  and she forgot the key. I was in there. She walked in there and said,     Suzanne, my daughter just got out of the hospital, and I   m not too well.  I forgot the box key. Would you mind giving me our mail? I forgot the  key.    She said,    Why don   t you just go back and get the key?  Go back,  see can you find it and get the key.    Poor little old lady came out of  there about crying. She   s in the rest home now.  Wow, how long has this woman been there as postmaster?  Oh, she been there quite some time because Gordon Nelson passed on.  She   s awful hateful. You know what I tried? I tried every way I know  how to get along with her, but she just   I   m not the only one she   s  hateful to.  Some people are a lost cause.  Best thing, just don   t bother with her because she   s our postmaster. I  don   t bother with her. I just get my stamps other places. We   ve got a  lady that works there on Saturdays. She   s the sweetest thing you ever  want to meet. She   s a real nice young person. It was two people that had  been working there with Suzanne. Well, Star, her daddy told me she had  a run-in with this woman. Star works in Altus at the post office. This  other woman worked there for a while. She quit. I don   t know what was  the problem. I mean, she quit, but she   s not there anymore with them.  The man that runs the store, that   s his step-daughter. She was working in  that, too.  This other little lady that lives across the street, there, she   s the nicest  thing that anybody would want to meet. I just love her. She   s a good  person. Everybody loves her. I like her because sometimes I might  forget my key, and I need my mail, too. I   d always have her to go get my  mail. Yes, she   s nice. When you facing the public, you supposed to treat  your enemies just like you do your friends. You don   t have to be that  way. There   s no call. We all human beings, just different in color, but  what difference do that matter? As long as a fellow can get along, be  nice, that   s all that counts. You can   t go to heaven hating people. What  would I look like turning you away from my door? I wouldn   t do that.  No, that   d be a mean thing to do because you come here, you may learn  me something. How do I know? You never get too old to learn. My  grandmother taught me that, and that   s really a true thing. Yes.  Well, I don   t mean to take up all your evening.  25  Pride  Oh, that don   t make no difference. I   ll work at night. (Laughter)  -------  -------
