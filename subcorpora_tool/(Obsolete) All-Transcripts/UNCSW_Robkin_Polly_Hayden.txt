 Mary Frederlckson: Where were you born? Polly Hayden Robkin: I was born in Franklin county, Virginia. Callaway, Virginia. If you ever heard of it. Nobody ever did. It's really built up now. We lived on sort of aI don't know whether I want to say this on tapebut it was a little half-assed farm. You didn't really make a living. You made enough to eat, but you didn't make a money crop. There was no such thing as a money crop. My father used to go to the coal mines in the winter time. He was a coal miner. I hardly remember my two older brothers, except as grown up people away. They worked in the coal mines. And then my oldest brother got a job at American Viscose Corporation in Roanoke.                                what year it was, because I was very young. M.F.: How many children were there in all? Robkin: There's six. And I'm the youngest of six. And my father used to do everything, like make whiskey. The stuff that all the miners, you know, mountain people do. M.F.: Was he born in the mountains, too? Robkin: I guess they both were. You know, I really don't know. I'm sure they were because they always. . . yeah. My mother's maiden name was Miles, so that must make her       German. M.F.: Do you know when their families came over? Robkin: I really don't. They were probably indentured slaves or came page 2 over, you know, in the very beginning when the mountain folks didn't want to fight the Civil War and kept pushing back. I really don't know what happened to those mountain people, but they kept moving back, into the hills. My earliest recollection is Franklin county and as far as I know we always lived there until my oldest brother and then my oldest sister went to work at American Viscos. And finally the whole family moved to Roanoke. M.F.: They went first and then. . . Robkin: Yeah, they went first. M.ff.: How far is it from Roanoke to. . . Robkin: Well, at that t. . . it's really not very far. I imagine it must be about 35 miles. Butst that time it seemed like an eternity. It just seemed like forever. I remember the first time my mother ever voted. I'm sure it wasn't the first time women could vote. But my brother came home from Roanoke and he had an old model T car. And she let me ride with them. This is such a vivid memoryJ I was a very small child. I don't know if I'd even gone to school yet. I don't think so. And we went to Callaway and mama voted. M.F.: Your father voted? Robkin: My father? No, he couldn't read or write. But she taught him, then, to read and write so he could vote. M.F.: Where had she gone to school? Robkin: Well, I really don't know. I guess she had enough initiative that she could go to school. He didn't really. But he was a bright man. But she taught him to read and write and he always voted for Byrd. Regardless, he'd always vote for Byrd. And one time, you know, mama said maybe she shouldn't have ever taught him. [Laughter.] page 3 M.F.: She didn't vote for Byrd? Robkin: Well, she used to think about who she voted for. She didn't just vote. M.F.: How far did she go in school? Robkin: I really don't know. I really don't know. Now I think I probably went further than anybody else in school. And I suppose you'd say. . . I don't even have a high school equivalence. But I suppose you'd say I do because I quit school in about the 10th grade. I was ready to go into high school. And then I went to night school. But I never did really get the diploma. M.F.: Why did you quit? \t is cose. Robkin: I quit to go to work at ^fcl And I went to work at Viscos*and the very year I went to work at Viscos I went to Southern School. M.F.: How old were you when you started, . . .? Robkin: Let's see. 1933 and I was born in 1912. M.F.: 21? Robkin: Must have been. But                                      seem that old. I went to work before that. 1933 was the depression. I must have gone to work about 1932. Hadn't been working very long. And I went to the YWGA because I wanted to learn how to swim. That was my motive in life. M.F.: Did they have. . . .? Robkin: Oh, they had a swimming pool and it was so nice. And I got involved in all this other stuff. Plus the fact. . . you know, my brothers and my father were all members of the coal miners union ever since there was a union. M.F.: From Franklin? page 4 Robkin: Yeah. Well, my brothers went to West Virginia and they worked in coal mines. My father used to go in winter time and work in the coal mines. M.F.: Even when you were in Roanoke he would leave? Robkin: No, when we were in Franklin. My father didn't go when we were in Roanoke but my next to the oldest brother worked in the coal mines until he retired a few years ago. He is like an old Goal miner. M.F.: But when you moved to Roanoke your father worked there year round in the mill? Robkin: No, he went to work for the city. He worked like on the streets in the city. M.F.: Did your mother work? Robkins No, She never worked. She was always a house__wife. Roanoke we had a cow and we had a garden. I said we had the only farm in town. Because I don't think either one of them could have existed without it. M.F.: Were you living right in the city? Robkin: Yes. When we first went to Roanoke we didn't have all this stuff. We lived upstairs. This really threw me. I think it was the first time that we had ever had or seen a flush toilet and all that. Running water in the house. Because when we lived in the country you had a stream and you carried the water. M.F.: How old were you when you first moved to Roanoke? Robkin: I think I was 12. Eleven or twelve. M.F.: Do you remember going to school in Franklin? Robkin: Oh yes. I remember. And this is an interesting story. This is good about my mother. We had a school, like sort of a half-way school. page 5 And a local school board. And they used to have a teacher who sometimes came and sometimes didn't. But we also had, in the same community, an Episcopalian church had what they called St Peter's in the Mountain. M.F.: Which was a school? Robkin: Yeah, which was a school and a church. But they had a graded school. They gave you hot lunch. My mother didn't send us to St Peter's in the Mountain. It wasn't necessarily for religious reasons. She said that her opinion was that she, if she did not send her kids to school we would never have a public school. Isn't that. . . I think it's very smart. So she used to send my two sisters and me, three of us. . .we used to go to school. And sometimes the teacher didn't come and we didn't come home. We'd play in the woods all day. And this went on . . . M.F.: Did you live in a community or were you out in the. . .? Robkin: We were on a farm but there were kids. ... We were the only kids that went to public school. Everyone else went to the Episcopalian school. But mama's opinion was that you had to support the public school, otherwise you wouldn't have one. M.F.: How many other children were there in the school? Robkin: Well, there should have been about 15 or 20. But it would boil down to about three of us. Us! M.F.: But I mean some other parents. . . Robkin: No other parents. M.F.: No other parents. You were the only children registered. Robkin: We were the only three as far as I know. I can't remember. But I just remember mama used to get us up, wash us and dress us and go to school and we'd come back all dirty. And finally she decided that our education was more important. So we started going to the Episcopalian page 6 school. And that was called St Peter's in the Mountain. It's still there. I don't know whether they have a school now, but the church is still there. And the teachers were residents there. It's really nice. M.F.: Were there a lot of children there? Robkin: Yeah. Practically all the children in the community. You know how any church school is. They didn't insist that you be a member of the church. They would prefer it. But we never did. M.F.: Did your family go to church at all? Robkin: Yeah, my mother was a hard- shell    Baptist and we used to go like once a month. She would. She'd take us. But there was nothing manditory about you joining the church. M.F.: What about your father? Robkin: Oh, he's just like me. He was like a heathen. He used to go once in a while. He didn't belong to the church. I never joined a church either. As a matter of fact, nobody except my oldest brother and that's been recentjoined the old hard-shelledjj Baptist church. My sisters joined other churches. But I never did join. M.F.: Was your mother just tangentially interested or was she. . ,? Robkin: No, she was very religious but not religious to the point where it wasn't a practical kind of a thing. We used to kid her all the time. You know, she believed in what is to be will be. Actually, I think it really was good for her, because she didn't worry. My brother would be in the coal mines and we'd say "But aren't you worried about him, mom?" "Well," she said, "if it's God's intention, he'll die." I really don't think she worried that much, because she did have that kind of a belief. M.F.: What about when you moved to Roanoke? Did she keep going to some kind of church? page ? Robkin: She went to the same. . . see, they had a branch in Roanoke, so she kept going to that church. That's when the kids got involved in other churches. I used to go to Sunday School. She never said we couldn't go, because the kids on the block went. But I think maybe one reason I never joined a church is because my sister that's next to me. . . . We used to go to the [Brethren?] Sunday School. And my sister joined the church. And mama always felt that she joined the church for social reasons and that she didn't believe in. She felt you had to have like a spiritual rebirth. And I never had it so I never joined the church. But my sister still goes to the Brethren church. But I remember mama. . . it was almost like she died. And we really had to put pressure on her to get her to go to the baptizing. She just said no. But she finally went. M.F.: This was when your sister joined the church. Robkin: Yeah. My sister must have been about 16 at the time. I was younger. Isn't that interesting? [interruption.] See, there was a group at the YWGA. M.F.: Okay, you moved to Roanoke when you were twelve. . . . Robkin: I went to school in Roanoke. I went to a couple of years of grade school, because this move from country to city set you back, made a big difference. And then I went to junior high school and I was ready to go into high school. But Clara, now, graduated from high school, in Roanoke. She's younger than I am. M.F.: Was your family in financial difficulty? Robkin: Oh yes, always, still are. I would say they were very low income, working class. When we were kids, it was really difficult, M.F.: But I mean, did you want to continue in school. . . .? page 8 Robkin: Yes I did, I really did. I used to. . . when I first went to work. . . . Now, you have to know Roanoke. At that time they had streetcars and they had transfer points. I used to transfer way down in the southeast section so I wouldn't have to run into the kids from the high school, because I didn't want them to know why I'd quit school. It was a very sensitive thing with me. M.F.: What about the kids you went to high school with, were they ... were there a lot of other children. . .? Robkin: A lot of them went to work after they graduated. So I wouldn't say they were too much better off. And some of them went on to college. See, I don't remember those kids, really. M.F.: There's just one high school in Roanoke? Robkin: Just one high school. But there are more now. But at that time there was just one. M.F.: So you were with rich kids and poor kids in the school. Robkin: Yes, more or less. You know, it's very interesting that I don't remember any kids that I went to school with. I remember kids I went to YWGA with. But going to school with youngsters didn't mean a thing. M.F.: What about teachers? Do you remember any? Robkin: I really don't remember any of our teachers except one teacher who was an English teacher and she went to Paris for the summer and she had to have surgery and she died in Paris. That's the only. ... I remember her and I remember her name. But otherwise, I don't remember any of them. M.F.: When did you first start with the YWGA? You said that you wanted to learn to swim. Robkin* I started with the YWGA when I first went to work and I think page 9 that was like in 1932. I'm not sure. But they had just recently built a new building. And this is interesting. They built the new building and, you knowwell, you probably don't, because you're too youngbut it always had the Phyllis Wheatly branch and the central branch. The Phyllis Wheatley branch was the black one. And the central one was the white one, the big one, the fancy one. M.F.: There's a Phyllis Wheatley branch in Atlanta, also. Was that. . . .? Robkin: There's still a Phyllis Wheatley branch but I think they're integrated more now. Anyway, when I went, they were not integrated. They had just built a new building with a new pool and everything. For the Central branch. And I remember this woman who came. . , she was a black woman from the national board of the YWGA. I don't remember what her name was. It wasn't Winifred Wygell. It was somebody. Anyhow, she had come down and she came over to our club group, the industrial group, to speak. And she simply said. . . oh, she was talking about our pool and she was talking about the Phyllis Wheatley branch and she said "Now what do you suppose would happen if Phyllis Wheatley girls came over to go swimming? Do you think the color would wash off?" And you know, it's really the first time I'd ever thought about it. Absolutely. It never occurred to me, you know, what I thought about it. They just didn't exist. Because if you were a white kid growing up in the South in that day and age, black kids were something over here  you didn't know about. M.F.: Did you have any contact. ... I know in small towns, you know, black and white children played together. But in the city it was. . . Robkin: Well, when we lived in the country we didn't have much contact with children but we used to have contact with a man who used to come to make the molassas and that kind of thing. There was a family that page 10 lived close by that we knew, but we didn't play with them because it was too far. And in the city. . . in the town, you didn't get the opportunity to know them. But after that remark, you know, I started thinking about it. And then our industrial club used to have joint meetings and we finally started having joint suppers, joint choir and all that business. So that's really where I learned that there's absolutely no difference. I think the YYCTA   is the same as it used to be. Maybe it is. But at that time, they were really very good. M.F.: Now who was the head of your industrial club? Was there an industrial secretary? Robkin: Well, in Roanoke, when I first started, we only had one person, who was the executive and everything else. And her name was Maude Foy. She's dead. Then come Anna Seaburg. Whom I'm sure Alice Hansan Cook knows. M.F.: She didn't mention her. Anna Seaburg? Robkin: Anna Seaburg. I think she's dead, too. Then we got wealthy enough to have an industrial person while Anna Seaburg was there. And the first one I remember was Pat Knight. Now I'm sure you've heard that name. I gave it to you, in fact. M.F.: Yes. She's in South America. Lima, Peru, working for the State Department. Robkin: Is she? Well, I knew she was with the State Department and the last time I saw Pat was in Washington. M.F.: Did she come before or after you went to the Southern Summer School? Robkin: She came after. When I went to Southern Summer School, Maude Foy was there. She was the only person. And I remember the reason I went to page 11 Southern Summer School is because Mabel,  Mabel Hutchison, felt she could Viscose not go. And anything, just anything to leave American #### for six weeks! Besides, they were laying off people anyway and I was new and I probably would have been laid off. I went instead. I just went. M.F.: But Maude Foy came and asked you to go? Robkin: I was recruited through the Y. But I went mainly because Mabel couldn't go. M.F.: And she would have been the one to go? Robkini She would have been the one to go. M.F.: Did she work atViscose too? Robkin: Yeah. She worked at Viscose Mabel and Clara both worked at Discos. Clara went to Southern Summer School after I did. I don't think Mabel ever did go. M.F.: No Mabel didn't go, but Clara did. I remember seeing her name. It was a later year. . Robkin: Clara went after I did. M.F.: Well, how many girls were in the Y. . . .? Tell me about the organization. Who the Y served and how the industrial department related to the rest of the Y? Robkin: Well, at the time I went, the best I can remember, they had of course the usual board of directors, which is made up of people from the community. And at one time, when Anna Seaburg was there, she wanted me to be on the board. But at that time in Roanoke, you had to be a member of the Christian Evangelical church to be on the board. And Miss Seaburg Miss, she wasthought that maybe, you know, I should go on to church. And I said [something about being crazy.] "I'm not going to join the church just to be on the board. If they won't accept me on the board as I am, they don't want me." And I didn't. But they would have accepted industrial girls page 12 on the board if we had joined the church. M.F.: Were you still living at home? Robkin: Yeah, I lived at home [all the time?]. M.F.: You were helping support. . .? Robkin: Well, I used to pay board, you know. Board and room and that was like a help of support. M.F.* What were you making, in '33? Robkin: Oh, good gosh. Nothing. I don't even remember how much. , . , we didn't have such things as vacation. We had nothing. . . . 1933*   M.F.: Were you at all organized at this time? Was there a union? Robkin: No. We had no union. . . . When I came back from Southern School in 1933 they did start a union. AFofL. And I joined it. M.F.: Was that UTW? Robkin: I guess it was. I suppose so. They didn't want women in it. The men didn't want women in it, but I joined it anyway. M.F.: How many people were in the plant? Robkin: Oh, in the plant? Geewhiz, I don't know. There were several thousand people in the plant because it was a big plant. M.F.: What about numbers of women to men? Robkin: And that I don't remember either. The women did the [fine?] kind of work and the men worked in other industries. That you would probably find from some sort of history of the American Viscose. Because I didn't pay much attention to it. M.F.: What did you do? Robkin: I was a reeler. And when I first went to work, I worked in the coning department. And I worked like 3-11, 7-U, and 7-3. Three shifts. Changing every week. page 13 M.F.: But an eight hour shift. Robkin: An eight hour shift. M.F.: How many days a week? Robkin1 Six days a week, I guess. Maybe it was five days. Anyhow, at my age, I looked much younger. So I had really wanted to go to night school. To go to night school, you can't go to night school and work shift work. So this woman said to me that worked with me, she said "Well, why don't you ask the boss." That's the big boss. I was afraid to. She said "I'll go with you." So she went with me. I'll never forget. He said "Well, you don't look old enough to work, anyway." Course I'd had to bring a birth certificate. M.F.: How old did you have to be to work? Robkin: You had to be. . . I think you had to be at least 18. I'm not sure. 16. Whatever the law was at that time. Maybe it was 16. But I was older. So Mr. Richardson said that he would arrange for me to be transferred onto straight day shift. That's when I went to the reeling department, which was 7-3 And then I went to night school. For several years. M.F.: And you were doing high school work in night school? Robkin * Well, I was doing like commercial course. Which I finished. And that's what I'm doing today is      secretary                              . M.F.: Well, were they very cooperative? He seems to be. . . . Robkin: Well, he was cooperative with me. Because I think they felt that anybody who wanted    going to go to school #*g*help them. They were not necessarily cooperative when it comes to the union. Certainly Alice could tell you that. She worked, after the CIO started, she was on the textile staff. [Something about what the union initials were.] page 14 M.F.: Let's talk about the year that you were at the Southern Summer School and then go into what happened when you came back. Robkin: Well, the year I was at Southern Summer School M.F.: Do you remember real well about the trip, getting there? Robkin: I remember the trip. I got the bus and you went up Bristol way and down to Weaverville, North Carolina. That's where it was, in that little school at Weaverville. It was very small. There must have been about twenty people there. I don't even know if it was that many. I think it was about 20. It was very small. And it was for six weeks. The first time I'd ever been away from home. That didn't bother me that much, because just to be away for six weeks I thought was just marvelous. But then, you know, there were so many people there who really. . . and particularly Louise and the whole staff. That they left some kind of an impression. Well, the YWGA itself had left an impression. M.F.: You had set up your contacts with the YWGA and you went because they had recommended you. Robkin: They had recommended me in place of Mabel. M.F.: What do you remember about the way the staff was set up and who your teachers were and. . . ? Robkin: Well, it seems to me like everybody was eventually your teacher. I remember Alice very well and I remember Hollis and I remember. . . there was a person there by the name of Marty somebody from Chicago. I don't remember her last name. And then there was a physical ed person there that. . . can't remember her name, but I remember her. If I'd see her, I'd remember. M.F.: Ontie Bell? Robkin: Yeah, I think it might have been. page 15 M.F.* I have some pictures. They're not very good. I just xeroxed them. Robkin: I may have some pictures of Southern School, too. M.F.: I was really fascinated by. . . I've been fascinated by this whole group, but I think, I thought you might like. . . Robkin: Oh, I think I have that group somewhere here. Oh yes! M.F.: Now I don't know if one of these is '33. Robkin: Oh, I remember this one. Helen Gregory. And she is probably still living. This looks like Hollis Randall's little boy. Carlos. I remember his name. This is Louise. Now I have a picture of the year that I went somewhere. That must be Ontee Bell. M.F.: And this was Lois MacDonald. Robkin: Oh, she wasn't there when I went, so this is not the year I was there. I'm looking to see if this is the year Clara was there. [There is a discussion of which picture is probably which year.] This looks like Louise with her knickers on. M.F.: What do you remember about her at the time? I've read a lot about how it was a very open kind of a atmosphere and there wasn't really a hierarchy. Robkin: It was so informal                            thing that impressed me. That everybody was like on the same level we were, kids were. We called Louise Louise. A good example of that is when I went back to the Y and Maudy Foy, Maude Foy. I was speaking of Louise. And she said "You couldn't be talking about Miss Leonard ." Foy was much older than Louise, I think. I said "But that's what they all call her." And she said "Well, I would never think of calling her Louise." That's how informal it was. And of course Alice everybody called Alice. That's the Bason I don't remember page 16 last names. M.F.: What was Louise Leonard, at the time, like? Robkin: Well, Louise Leonard was always a very dignified type of person. Tall. Well, for instance, one time we had a discussion about, you know, people always remind you of animals. And Louise was there and I said Louise always reminded me of a horse, a well bred horse. And she did, kind of. I wish I could find those pictures. I'll look for them. Leo Hublerman. He wasn't there the year I was there but that was pictures that I kept because they were duplicates. And I may have given them to her. I'm not sure. Leo Hubferman has since died, too. Yeah, he died. He was like                                          with that magazine? what do you call it? Not New Republic, something else. Anyhow, he passed away. M.F.: Do you remember what classes you took? Robkins: Well, it seems to me like we all took the same classes. Everything was like discussion groups or things that's happening in the newspaper or unions. You went on long hikes and we talked about things that's happening today. I don't remember any formal classes. Isn't that awful? M.F.: No. Do you remember the books you read? I mean, had you done much reading before you came? Robkin: I hadn't done much reading before I came and I didn't do a lot after, I don't think, except for the newspaper. You did learn how to read the newspaper and what to read and what not to read or how, you know. . . what to believe and what not to believe, sort of. I don't mean that literally. But I mean you could learn to read the newspaper fast. Like if you read the same story yesterday you'd know that Henry Kissinger did this and this and so, you don't have to read all that. You already know who page 17 he is. So you just read what he's doing today. M.F.: Were you taught to be critical of what was going on around you? I don't mean critical in a. . . . Robkin: You were taught to be aware of what was going on around you and you were also taught some labor history. Labor history I remember because we were all interested in unions. M.F.: Now, when did your interest in the unions start? Robkin: I guess I've always been interested in unions because I'm from a union family. My earliest recollection of any unionand this really dates mewas one time papa came home from West Virginia. And I just barely remember this. We were hard up. It was during the big railroad strike. And he had been offered a job in Roanoke with a railroad company, which would have been a scab job. And he wouldn't take it. And there was this big, long discussion about it. My mother's opinion was he was right, he shouldn't have taken it. Nobody scabs, even if you starve to death. You just don't scab. So I was always brought up with that kind of a background. But, . . it could be any union. * M.F.: What about the other students who were there that year? I mean there was a big variety, as far as I can tell, of people who had been exposed to unions and some people who. ... Robkin* Some had and some hadn't. There were some hosiery workers. I think somebody from furniture workers. My roommate was a woman from Richmond who had not been exposed to anything. She was probably more middle class than anybody else. Katherine Werenik or Wornick or something. I remember her name very well. And I used to sort of keep in touch with her, though I haven't for years. But she was the most unrelated to the whole field of industry. M.F.: What did she do? page 18 Robkin: I think she worked in an office. I'm not sure what she did. But she was a YWGA person . . . she was a YWGA woman. M.F.: Could it have been Katherine Pollitt? Robkin: No, it began with a W. Wannick, I think. I'm going to find that picture for you. I think I know where it is. M.F.: What do you remember being exposed to that you hadn't been exposed to before? Robkin: I think it was the staff of people that was there, more than anything else that impressed me. The people that you got to know. And you kind of just learned about everyday life from them. A life that was different from what you lived and the kind of things you had to do as a working woman. M.F.: What about religion? Was there any. . . . Robkin: I don't remember any thing about religion. If you were religious, on Sunday morning there was time for you to go to church if you wanted to go. No discussion about religion that I remember. M.F.: It wasn't a set part of the program. Robkin: No. M.F.: What about it being all female, all women? Was it discussion as far as what you had to do as a working woman, or what you had to do as a working person, as an individual, in industry. I mean was there emphasis on being female. . . ? Robkin: I don't recall any specific emphasis on being a woman, but there must have been because it was all women. It was for women. So, I think the emphasis was there whether it was really spelled out. And all of us were women who worked in the women type jobs in industry. Like I worked as a reeler in Viscose. And I rememberI don't know if it was Helen Gregory. , . maybe she was a hosiery worker. I don't know what she page 19 did. She was on staff. She was one of the cooks, I think, or something. M.F.: She had been a student I think earlier. Robkin: She had been a student earlier. I don't really remember. But everybody worked in a factory of some kind, M.F.: As I understand it, although I haven't seen any indication of that in going through the Southern Summer School papers, women were having trouble getting in to unions and stuff. Robkin: Well, as I said, when I joined the AFofL immediately after coming back fchtft the men didn't want us. That was obvious, M.F.: Was that something that was dealt with as women you're going to not be able . . . they're going to be problems. . . Robkin: No, they didn't say you couldn't. They didn't try to recruit you. If you joined the union they would accept your dues but you were never like elected to any office or any part of anything. Until the CIO came along. Then you got to be a little bit more a part of things. M.F.: At the Southern Summer School was there emphasis on. . . I mean when trade union policy and tactics and organizing was discussed, was there emphasis on the fact that AFL unions were not eager to organize women? Robkin: I don't remember that there was any emphasis on that. I think the emphasis was on, really, the fact that if you work in industry you should belong to a union. M.F.: How much emphasis was there on being southern and what was going on in the rest of the country? Robkin: Well, the emphasis was on reading newspapers. ... I don't remember that there was emphasis, because it was obvious that it was southern. page 20 M.F.: But I mean people like Alice Hanson Cook, McLaren wasn't from the South. Was there any feeling that they were coming from somewhere else to tell you what to do? Robkin: Not really. I didn't get that at the Southern School at all. I used to get that after the CIO started. People who came down from like New York who were like know-it-alls. That was not the feeling at the school. They never gave you that feeling. You more or less got the feeling that they wanted to learn from you. You know, more about the South. M.F.: What about the relationship of the school with the unions. Robkin: Well, the relationship with the unions was pretty good, I would say. And one of the reasons that Miss Jones felt that it wasn't the worst thing in the world that the Southern School closed is because unions had grown up enough and had enough money and an education department that they could furnish their own workers education. M.F.: That's what I was wondering. If when you disbanded they filled a gap that. . . Robkin: They should have filled the gap, and hopefully they did. M.F.: Why were the problems of money so severe? Robkin: Well, in the early days of the CIO money, staff and maybe even the inclination wasn't there. But then after unions began to grow up and be like a really bone fide good organization, they had their own education department. In some cases. . . when I was with Southern School, it sort of implemented the national CIO's education policies. But then page 21 local unions got so they could do their own, or they could get somebody from the national union to do it. And the need was not there any longer. M.F.: The things that you were doing when you were there were mainly the poll tax? Robkin* Well, we did things on organizing voter registration, like Martin Luther King. M.F.: You were criticized for working too much with blacks? Robkin: Yeah. That's right. You see what happened is, the wood workers union, which was a very poor union. . . . And there are an awful lot of wood workers in the South, black wood workers. And mostly we worked with black people. M.F.: You would say the majority of the work toward the end was with black? Robkin: The majority of the work that I did was. But we hadn't intended it that way. They were the people who needed it. M.F.: What about Helen Baker's work? She was working on the literacy . . . Robkin: Yeah. Helen Baker, who happened to be black, she worked on the literacy thing and she was one of the qualified teachers who could go in after the group was organized. Of course she was a good organizer, too. M.F.: What about Marvin Kaplin. . . . Robkin: Marvin Kaplin was on the board. He just worked as. . . he's a writer and he worked. . . . When he was in Richmond they used to have a magazine called The Southern Jewish Outlook. That's the way he earned his living. Then he moved to Washington and he got a job with Women's Wear Daily and he worked there for a long time. And now he works for the national AFofL-CIO and I don't know really what he does. M.F.: Well, when he was with the Southern Summer School. . . . page 22 Robkin* He was never on the staff. He was on the board, just on the board. M.F.* Oh, I thought he was on the staff. Robkin * No. M.F.* What about Elizabeth Hughes. She was a field worker. . . Robkin: Elizabeth Hughes was at the Southern School when I was there, I think, in 1933, as a teacher, wasn't she? And then she maybe worked some. . . . See, I didn't know Elizabeth Hughes as being on the staff of the school after it got to be a field work thing. But maybe she was. She's from California, isn't she? Did Alice mention her? I'd even forgotten her name. M.F.: She didn't mention her. She's listed in the minutes as being a field worker for a while. She might have just been there for one summer or something. Robkin: Maybe. Either that. Same thing as Hilda Cobb. M.F.: Hilda Cobb was a student, wasn't she? Robkin: Well, Hilda Cobb may have been a student and Hilda Cobb was there. See, Hilda Cobb is a good friend of mine. Not because of Southern School but because she used to work for the Amalgamated and when I came to New York she was living here. And she just recently left last year, for Oregon. M.F.: Is she from Greensville? Robkin: No, Danville. But I guess that she was on the staff of the Southern School for a while. I didn't know that then. M.F.* I think she was one of the students who came back. . . you know, come back and help, be an assistant. The McLarens spent an incredi-ble amount of time raising money. Did flMi Lee Jones? Robkin: Yeah, she used to, yeah. And then, you see, that got to be page 23 a problem because raising money for the Southern School. . . people would say, foundations or anybody with money, would say unions should be able to furnish their own. M.F.* In the early years though, unions had no programs of workers education though, right, and certainly they were. . . . Robkin* That's right. In the early years there was no such. . . not many unions even. When Louise McLaren had the Southern Summer School, like in 1927, I don't guess there were any unions even. M.F.* No, I don't think any of the people who came belonged to a union. Robkin * No, there was no such thing. There was no opportunity. M.F.: [Unions in the South have often lost out.] Robkin* Well, unions have lost out in many, many cases in the South, I guess. I think industry's seen to that. They have also lost out in the North, too. You just don't get it publicized as much. M.F.: When you worked for Amalgamated Clothing, what was the feeling of people who were assigned to the South? Was it a very different assignment from being assigned to Chicago or Philadelphia or. . . . Robkin* Well, you see, I really don't know because I didn't know those people. I just didn't. I really don't think I could be an organizer in the North because I wouldn't know how to go about it. First place, you have no particular thing in common to discuss. I don't know if I could be one in the South, either, anymore. M.F.* But when you were doing it. . . . Robkin: When I was doing it I worked in a factory, or I had worked in a factory and I at least knew a little bit about how to talk to a working person who lived just like I lived. page 24 M.F.: Who were the other people like here. I mean, did the Hutchinsons go on to do any organizing? Robkinsi Well, Clara did some organizing, I think, during the days of FTA in Winston-Salem. Mabel didn't. Mabel worked in the factory and then she worked in the YWGA. Her last job was with the YWGA as a bookkeeper. M.F.: Did you ever run into women who had been at the Southern in other years? Robkin: No. I never run into any of the students except the ones from Roanoke. I used to keep up with Katherine a little bit, who was my roommate but M.F.: But I mean in organizing in the South, did you ever run into. . . Robkin: No. M.F.* Did you ever use the YWGA in organizing in the South? Robkin* Well, I used my experience in talking. . . . M.F.* But you didn't go in and contact a YWGA group? Robkin* No. Well, you see, by the time I'd left the YWGA there was no longer an industrial division and it was all like one. M.F.: The industrial division was dropped in the late '30s? Robkin: I don't know when it dropped. When ever it did, it was never the same. Robkin: When the decision to disband was made, was there a feeling that the school had failed? Robkin: No. There was a feeling. . . I got the feeling that when the school disbanded. ... I don't know how Mrs McLaren felt about this. . . but I think it was the feeling of the board. . . that it had served a good purpose over the years and the necessity was no longer. You know, that page 25 unions had grown up. They could furnish their own workers education. And that people were not going to give money for it any more because they didn't feel it was needed. Although I think it was needed in certain fields. But maybe not fields of unions. Fields of civil rights and voter education and things like that. M.F.: Was there talk of changing the perspective of the school? Robkin: No. Because the money petered out and the decision was made by the board of directors to end it.       r M.F.: Did the money peter out  4   Rosenwald Fund? Robkin: Oh, it was the Rosenwald Fund that gave me the scholarship. Glad you mentioned that. M.F.: Well, the Southern Summer School got a large. . . . Robkin: Yeah. You see, I never knew all the places they got money from. But I know that during the time I was working in Richmond I used to come to New York once in a while to see people like Rose Willen. She was on our board. Pearl Willen. She used to do a lot of fund raising. And Betty Barnes. She wasn't on our board but she used to be a person that gave us a place to live M.F.: What about Helen Hill Miller? Robkin: I didn't know her. I knew that man M.F.* Did you ever meet Mary Barker? Robkin: No, but the name is familiar. I don't know her. M.F.* She was chairman of the board. What was the relationship from the staff to the board? Robkin* Well, when they had board meetings in Richmond, the staff used to go to the board meetings. But everybody didn't come. Everyone on the board didn't come. I knew Pearl, because she used to come. page 26 M.F.: Mrs,McLaren was on the board. Robkin: Well, she didn't come in Richmond, but we were always in touch with Louise M.F.: Did you talk to her about the school disbanding or about the Robkin: I'm sure Brownie did. I didn't. But I'm sure Brownie Lee did. M.F.: What did you do after the school closed? That's when you came to New York? Robkin* Well, yeah. I took a vacation first time in my life and I went to California to visit Helen Baker. Helen Baker was working for the American Friends Service Committee. She and Bunny, at the time. And I went to California and I lived with them. Bunny is her husband. Bunny is Professor Percy Baker, with a Ph.D. who is the dean of Morgan right now. But we call him Bunny. Anyhow, I went for two weeks and stayed six months. I got a job to make enough money to come back. Then I got an offer of a job. I don't remember exactly this whole thing because I didn't know any-thing about District 65       MM and FTA went in with them. When the CIO cleaned house. You remember that. They were trying to reorganize Winston-Salem. They never really did get the Camel factory organized. Jim Dirken, who used to be the, I guess he was the president of the Office and Professional Workers, CIO, was in there working trying to organize them. And I went in and worked for a while and then I left and came to New York and went to work in the District 65 shop. And then I worked on the District 65 staff on the security plan. And then I married Al. [Interruption.] M.F.* Was District 65  ILG? Robkin: No, District 65 is. . . well, they were independent for a while. It's a whole New York thing. It's a conglomerate, really. page 27 M.F.: Well, why did you leave the South? Robkin: I left the South because I couldn't get a job. It was very difficult to get a job in the South once you've worked for a union unless another union in the South's going to give you a job. M.F.: But it didn't work out to go back with the CIO? Robkin: No. It didn't work out to go back with the CIO. And I wasn't sure I really wanted to. I got a referral card and went to District 65 and worked in a shop for a while and then I went to work on the staff. The security plan is their health plan. They have a good health plan. And I worked there a few years and then I decided that I didn't particularly want to work there. Bobby Worthhelmer, who was Alice Hanson's friend, said that they wanted a secretary at Henry Street Settlement, which is right around the corner here. And I went to work at Henry Street and I worked there until about, I don't know, eight years ago. We had a strike. Imagine having a strike in a social work agency! We had a long strike. It was terrible. It was terrible for lots of reasons which I won't go into and has nothing to do with this, except it might have something to do with women, I don't know. Anyhow, we lost the strike. We picketed for eleven weeks. M.F.: This was the clerical staff? Robkin: Social workers, clerical and maintenance, everyone. We were all together. That was the problem. They didn't want us all together. But we wanted all to be together. So I went back to work because the Labor Board ruled that we should go back to work and we would have an election. And I worked about a year. And it was terrible. You know, if you're a secretary to like the program director, they can make life miserable for you. And I just didn't enjoy working there any more. So I quit, before the page 28 election. They lost the election, anyway. And then I worked at Karen Hornl Clinic as a, I guess, a secretary, too. And now I work at University Settlement because Karen Horn! clinic was just too far to travel. That's the only reason I quit there. M.F.: That's a health clinic? Robkin: Mental health. Now I'm a secretary at University Settlement for the executive director. M.F.: What does the settlement do? Robkin * The settlement is like a community organization. They have programs. They have like Head Start and day care and programs for the elderly and a regular after school program for children. M.F.: Are you in some of the programs? Robkin: Not really. I just do the secretarial work and keep things sort of straight for the executive director. I work quite a bit with the board of directors, but that's all. M.F.: Do you feel badly about having left the South? Robkin: Well, I'd like to go back to the South, to tell you the truth. I don't feel badly about it. I don't think it's been bad for me having left the South. But if I was going to go back say to live and retire, I think I might go back South. Because I like the South better. M.F.s The School. . . how did these people fit into the political spectrum during the '30s? The Southern Summer School people. Louise McLaren. . . . Robkin: Well, you see, that I didn't know. I didn't know anything about the political. Because I was sort of apolitical, I guess. I wouldn't really know that. I remember once riding down to somewhere, some kind of a conference, with Alice and with Louise. Now where were we riding to? And page 29 they were talking about. ... I guess it was during the time when Russia really got to be communist. And they were talking about Trotskyites. I'd never heard of a Trotskyite, so I didn't know what they were talking about. MF.: When you went to the school, was the economics course that you were taught at the school out of phase with what you had been thinking? Robkin: Well, everything there was out of phase with what I'd been thinking because I hadn't been thinking. But I don't remember anything really political other than to think about trade unions. Which if you thought about trade unions in that day and age was considered political, wasn't it? Nowadays it's an accepted thing, but then it was a political thing. M.F.: When the school was in Richmond, same sort of thing, what about Brownie Lee Jones' politics? Was she active? Robkin: No. I imagine Brownie Lee Jones voted Democratic. She read the paper. She had very good ideas on things. But she certainly was not political, to my knowledge. Maybe she was. I don't remember anything political about any of them, to tell you the truth. M.F.: If the Southern Summer School hadn't been there, what do you think you would have ended up doing? Robkin: I probably would have ended up just working until the factory closed down. I really don't know. But I don't think I would have ended up with any sort of. . . . I would have probably been like most southern people. I would have gotten married, which I did. Then I would have married somebody else, maybe. House, children, maybe. I don't know. And lived a life like a southern woman working at something to earn a living. But I doubt if I would have ended up with any                                 any real labor movement other than the fact that all working people should join unions. page 30 But women probably shouldn't be very active in them. Whether I would have ended up like that I don't know. But I do know that it made a big impression on me. That much, I know. But how I would have ended up, I really don't know. [interruption.] M.F.: She's also been involved? Robkin: She's been involved, yes. Clara right now is married and works in Washington. She's more or less inactive. I am, to tell you the truth. And Brownie. . . we all came back and were active in the CIO and we all worked. Brownie then came to New York, got married. . . . M.F.: She worked for the affiliated schools after she was in New York, right? Robkin: I think she may have. I'm not sure. I never know what Brownie did because Brownie. . . she's a nice gal. . . except she was a little bit off and on, you know. If you know what I mean? Her one thing that she really wanted most was to get married and have a family. I don't mean Miss Brownie, I mean the other one. No, this woman is a very professional woman. M.F.: Robkin: Thelma Brown. Thelma Brown was a student at the school. M.F.: Right. She was from Roanoke. Robkin: Yes. See, Thelma Brown used to be a YWGA person with Clara Hutchinson and me. That's the three students that I know of. Hilda Cobb was also from Virginia, but not from Roanoke. I believe Hilda did go to the school. I'm not sure. M.F.: If you ever talk about the school with other. . . Robkin* Oh, Hilda and I used to reminesce about the school a lot. And  page 31 Hilda was very friendly with Louise and Mac. Always, when we used to go to see Louise we'd take Hilda. And when we'd go to see Mac or have him over here, before she moved to Oregon, we'd always take her, M.F.: Louise was from Philadelphia? Robkin: I think she was from way further west, wasn't she? M.F.: Pittsburgh, perhaps. Robkin: It's a little town. Can't remember the name of it. I know Mac invited us to the unveiling, or whatever it is, of her ashes, what ever they do. But we didn't go. M.F.: What kinds of things                                    was she interested in? Robkin: Well, she worked for ALES for a while Otherwise, I don't know what she did. She worked for the thing, I think. M.F.* But she always earned the living for her family, didn't she? Robkin: More or less, I think. See, she always had the paying job. If that's what you mean. I feel kind of guilty about Mac. I should call him. Because, you see, they had no particular family except sisters and brothers. They had no children. M.F.s She seems like a very unusual woman, to me. Robkin: Well, I always thought she was unusual. I felt like she was a person who has really made a difference in my life. M.F.: Was she the one you were closest to when you were at the school? Robkin* I don't remember being closest to any of the staff. I guess I related more to her. M.F.* Did she ever talk about why she was first interested in the South? page 32 Robkin: No, I don't remember discussing why she was first interested. During the '30s everybody got interested in everything, didn't they? M.F.: But I mean she was always intensely interested in the South. . . Robkin: Probably because of her YWGA work. M.F.: She was industrial secretary there for six years. Robkin: I didn't know her then, but everybody in the Y knew her. M.F.: What did people think of her in the Y? Robkin: Oh, I think she was well thought of. When I think about what Maudy Foy said, you know. And Maude Foy was an executive secretary. But she didn't know anybody would call her Louise.
