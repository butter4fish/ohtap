Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson, and I'm the interviewer, and Matthew Hickey is the videographer, and Cathy Sandler is the observer.  And I'd like to have you start out by stating your name and spelling it for us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am Dr. Roscoe, R-O-S-C-O-E, C. Brown, B-R-O-W-N--without an e--Junior.
Speaker 1: And can you--"C" stands for?
Speaker 2: Conkling.
Speaker 1: Can you spell it?
Speaker 2: The famous Roscoe Conkling, C-O-N-K-L-I-N-G.  He was a senator for New York who, when Blanche K. Bruce was elected as the first senator from Mississippi and no one would take him down the aisle to be introduced.  Roscoe Conkling from New York took him down the aisle.  He was an advocate for black rights.  He also represented the oil companies, and that's why he got unelected, but my father was named after Roscoe Conkling and Roscoe Conkling Brown.  And there are a number of Roscoe Conklings around the black community.  There's one in Chicago [Illinois]; there's as Roscoe Conkling in Chicago, Roscoe Conkling Brown in Chicago.
Speaker 1: There is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Occasionally somebody will call me or say they were there; they saw the name in the phone book.

Story_ID: 178758
Speaker 1: Right, okay, I ask five questions of everyone, sir.  They're a little People magazine-ish, just very short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite what?
Speaker 1: Food (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I like all food (laughter).  I don't have any one particular favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's your answer?
Speaker 2: I eat meat, I eat chicken, fish, salad pasta.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Either spring or fall, probably fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite color?
Speaker 2: No particular favorite, maybe blue, maybe, maybe brown.  I don't have any particular favorite.  I have, I'm very eclectic and things like that.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I have a house in Sag Harbor in Long Island [New York, New York], and so that'd better be my favorite place, since I built it.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 178759
Speaker 1: I wanna start out by asking about your mother.  And I'd like you to give her name and what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was Vivian Kemp.  She was born in Richmond [Virginia].  She grew up in Richmond.  She went to Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia].  She became a teacher.  She met my father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] when she was twenty-five or thereabouts, and they got married.  And my father was working in Richmond at that time, but then he moved to Washington [D.C.], and that's where I was born and my sister was born.
Speaker 1: Did she tell you anything about her growing though in Richmond or was she not a talker?
Speaker 2: In some ways her mother's--my grandmother was named Catherine.  I think the maiden name was Ramsey.  She was originally from North Carolina, Virginia border, had Cherokee background.  And my grandfather, who was deceased when I was born, worked in the government.  He was sort of a personal assistant to the governor and worked in the State House.  He was, he was--
Speaker 1: And, and his name was--was that Ramsey Kemp?
Speaker 2: No, that was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was Kemp--my grandmother was Catherine--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Ramsey Kemp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Kemp, Grandpa Kemp, I don't know his first name.  I got to look it up, but I don't know it because he wasn't around.  He raised about seven or eight children.  They all became professionals of one type or another.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--but your mother didn't share any, any stories about growing up in Richmond with you that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, in one sense.  You know, Richmond was a segregated town.  But being middle class, they had the advantage of living in the better part of town, on a street called Abigail Street, and they did the normal things that middle-class people do.  They took music lessons, and dance lessons, and went to church, and went to picnics and so on, and didn't have a lot of experience with the rural racism because at that time, at the end of the 20th century, beginning of the 20th century, black communities were really integral communities.  They had their own banks, and shops, and schools, and churches, and cultural institutions.  And so long as they kept within those boundaries, they didn't really have the experience of racism that you experience in Mississippi for example.  So in cities ranging all the way from Durham [North Carolina] to, to Norfolk [Virginia], to Richmond, to Washington, to Baltimore [Maryland], to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], to Boston [Massachusetts], those black communities had their own structure.  We had our own newspapers.  So that I was fortunate to be born and brought up middle class, we really didn't experience the rural racism that many experience in the depths of Georgia, or Alabama, or Mississippi, Louisiana, because they were large communities.  Richmond was one of the larger black communities.  You had the bank, the Farmers and Merchants Bank; one of the first black banks were, were there.  Black folks owned real estate.  They, they had their own theaters.  So, in that sense, I didn't hear much about racism.  I heard about the normal things that middle-class people hear about, going to school, doing well in school, cultural institutions, dancing, learning whatever the new technology was at that time.
Story_ID: 178760
Speaker 1: And did you grow up knowing that you were middle class, or that being sort of discussed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that just a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, Washington, D.C., had probably the largest middle class in the country in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], and I grew there.  I grew up three blocks from Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  My father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] was a professional.  He was in [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt's Black Cabinet.  He had an office at Howard University, as well as one downtown.  And again, as I said, this is an integral community.  U Street was the big street.  We had three theaters there.  We had many churches that had existed from even before the Civil War because Washington was right on the Mason-Dixon line.  But blacks who worked in the government got the same salary as whites.  As a result, we were able to develop entire communities in northwest section of Washington, part of the northeast section.  And we were aware of the fact that there was racism, and segregation, and prejudice.  We knew how silly it was, how wrong it was.  And our job was to live an integrated community, live in an, in an inte--integral community of our peers.  And we had the same type of jealousies and fights and so on.  If you read [E.] Franklin Frazier's 'Black Bourgeoisie,' which was really centered in Washington--I knew--my dad knew Frazier and so on.  And Howard University was the center, what Mordecai Johnson used to say, "the capstone of Negro education."  So that's what I grew up in.  There were a considerable number of poor people in Washington, particularly living in an area, Capitol Hill and Georgetown, the swanky areas now.  Those were what we would've called the slums.  There were small houses, several people living in them, and particularly when I was around ten or eleven, the [Great] Depression, most people were out of work.  And those of us who were middle class thought we had an obligation to help them.  And our task was to not be too detached from them, although some were.  And of course color was a major factor in the black middle class.  There were some who--my father was light enough to have been considered white and, and a number of other people.  But he taught us that color didn't matter, and it did not give you any privilege other than what your behavior allowed you to have.  So, as a result, I really didn't feel, you know, the total weight of brutal discrimination.  I knew it was wrong.  I knew that we could move ahead because I knew people who had graduated and gotten--you know, I was in that generation where the first black, this is the first black to do this and so on--so that I and my fellow Washingtonians clearly knew that we were more privileged, but we also felt we had a responsibility for those who were less privileged.  We didn't have much patience for people whose behavior was boorish and lower class, which might have been a bias on our part, and as a result, we didn't socialize with them.  You know, we played baseball with them, or football, went to school and so on.  And--but Washington, D.C., had three high schools at the time: Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], the famous Dunbar, which was academic school; Armstrong [Manual Training School, Washington, D.C.], which was a technical school, that's the school Duke Ellington went to; and Cardozo [Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], which was a business school.  So we had competition among each other, and it was a sorting.  You know, the (unclear) students went to Dunbar, unless they were really interested in engineering; some of 'em would go to Armstrong; and then the business school would be Cardozo.  And then they had a vocational school, which was Phelps [Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School, Washington, D.C.], which was I think in the southwest section of Washington.  Washington's divided northwest, northwest, northeast, southeast, and southwest.  And the more middle-class area was northwest and parts of northeast divided by North Capitol Street.
Story_ID: 178761
Speaker 1: Now your father, can you give his name and tell about his background?  I would like to get, you know, just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was Roscoe C. Brown, Sr.  He was a graduate of Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.] when it was M Street High School [Washington, D.C.].  He was an outstanding student.  He went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  He finished dental school and undergraduate school in five years.  He then went to Richmond [Virginia] to practice dentistry.  He was on the cusp of the idea of preventive health and public.  And because of that, he got the attention of the people who ran North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, and he set up their health education program.  And back, backtracking a little, when he first went to Richmond [Virginia], he was practicing dentistry and teaching chemistry.  And just at the time of World War I [WWI], he had an accident in the laboratory he was teaching in, and he lost his right eye--right eye--left eye.  And he, but he still went into the service as a civil servant civilian public health educator, educating soldiers against venereal disease and tuberculosis.  And from there that he, he evolved into doing the public health work with the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, set up their public health program.  And as a result of hearing about that, he worked with Metropolitan Life.  And when the federal government wanted to have a public health education program, they brought him to Washington [D.C.] to do the public health education program, which was initially located at Howard University.  And then he became senior public health specialist, and they placed him in charge of health--public health for blacks all over the country, the United States Public Health Service, the National Negro Health Movement.  And that's when he became involved with Bob Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] and Mary McLeod Bethune and those folks in the Black Cabinet.  And he would travel; he would travel about two weeks out of the year to all of the Southern states, mainly working around the black colleges.  Because the black colleges would give you an avenue or access to the intelligent people who had in many of the colleges had extension services which would go out into the rural areas and the cities to talk about good health practices, venereal disease prevention, tuberculosis prevention, good nutrition.  Those were the key issues that he was dealing with.  So he would be on the road a fair amount of time.  Many times when you're traveling in the South, he just went up and bought a ticket because he was light-skinned and just road the train like everybody else.  But many times he did have to--when he got to the towns, usually at that time you'd stay with somebody.  There were no hotels, or very few.  You stayed with somebody at the college, with the college president, or, or one of the lawyers, or the ministers.
Story_ID: 178762
Speaker 1: Now I have one question.  You said he [Brown's father, Roscoe Brown, Sr.] was born though in Alexandria, Virginia, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then how had he come to, you know--
Speaker 2: Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: --grow up in Wash--
Speaker 2: His father worked in, his father was a, he worked in the [U.S.] Treasury Department, in the [U.S.] Bureau of Engraving [and Printing], helped to print and count money.  They said that Grandpa Brown could count money faster than anybody else.  He became the treasurer of 19th Street Baptist Church.  (Unclear)--church there.  And apparently his folks had lived in Washington and in Alexandria.  He was born in Alexandria, and he went to Washington, went to I think it's Sumner Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], Dunbar High [School, Washington, D.C.]--M Street High School at that time.
Speaker 1: And you said another thing that was--when was the Negro Health Movement that you talked about?  You said there was, you know, part of a Negro Health Movement.
Speaker 2: Well, actually the Public Health Service established a public health specialist in charge of Negro health.
Speaker 1: In what, do you know what year?
Speaker 2: That was established back in about 19--1931 or thereabouts, because basically he had been working with North Carolina Mutual [Life Insurance Company].  And they saw the value of that, and then the invited him to work for the Public Health Service because they were having trouble.  They'd been able to raise these rates, and particularly rates among blacks particular in the South were very high, because at that time, 80 percent of the blacks in the country lived in the South.  You lived in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.  So, and he had this concept of working through community-based organizations to help bring good health practices to the masses of people, many of them rural, but some of them urban.  And the, the organization title they gave to that was the National Negro Health Movement.  And he actually published a journal, The Journal of Negro Health, where it went to all the physicians he work--matter of fact, at one time he was the executive secretary for the, for the NMA, the National Medical Association, and he also worked with the National Dental Association, because that's the way that network worked.  People in the public health service in the state health department, in the medical profession, and at that time there were two medical schools, Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], so that was the network that they used to reach to the mass of people.  And the idea was to decrease the venereal disease rate, to decrease the tuberculosis rate, and to promote good nutrition child care practices.
Speaker 1: So, did the accident to his eye, you know, with his--did that affect his, you know, practice of dentistry?  'Cause he didn't--while he's doing these other things, he's not having a dental practice, right?
Speaker 2: No, he stopped practicing.
Speaker 1: He stopped, okay.
Speaker 2: After he had the accident he stopped practicing.  He went, that's when he went into the service as a civil servant in public health.  He could have practice dentistry, and I think he may have done a little bit, but his interest really was in promoting the positive aspects of health.
Story_ID: 178763
Speaker 1: Now what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Probably about three or four years old, 726 Kenyon Street [Washington, D.C.] in the backyard, in the little car, and wondering--I remember 'cause they took pictures of it, and they would--at that time, I don't know whether they do it now, they had baby books where they, your parents would chronicle all of the things that you did, your, your first step and this.  And I don't know whether they do that anymore.  But so, I do remember that.  I remember I was about three or four years, pushing my sister in this car 'cause I loved those automobiles.  (Unclear) I love automobiles and flying today.  And we lived in a nice block.  Really, actually, it was about maybe ten houses from Blanche K. Bruce Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], Blanche K. Bruce, being the first black elected senator from Mississippi, and I went to there, that school.  I started, went to kindergarten when I was four years old.  And I had two aunts and a cousin teaching in the school, so I couldn't really get away with much.
Story_ID: 178764
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Vivian Kemp] teaching at that point--
Speaker 2: No, she stopped.  At that time, most people, professional people, when they had children and the father had a civil service job, they--she stayed home.  She was a stay-at-home mom from the time we were born, and she was a teacher 'cause she spent--we used to have lessons at home.  We had projects at home.  And she worked in a church.  She would--young people.  But basically, she and practically all of the mothers of all of the children of the middle-class children--the lower class children--low income children, their parents were working, most of 'em in domestic service.
Story_ID: 178765
Speaker 1: Now you, you're the oldest, so you're--
Speaker 2: I'm the old--
Speaker 1: --the oldest boy.  Were you a typical sort--and you have a sister.
Speaker 2: My sister passed away--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --in 1984.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And--but she was a year younger than you, right?
Speaker 2: She was a year younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, were you a typical, you know, sort of older son and the expectations?
Speaker 2: What is typical?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: I shouldn't do that to an interviewer (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm just saying, you know, you're, you're your father's namesake and--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, remember--you don't remember, but most middle-class people didn't have more than two children.  And the group I grew up had the highest expectations.  If somebody had three children, that was a lot, so that our, our task was to do well in school, to behave, to be polite, to help in the neighborhood, and for boys to participate in sports, and for girls to participate in music and dance.  So I spent a lot of time in the YMCA and the Hi-Y Club.  And my sister spent a lot of time taking music lessons up at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], giving recitals.  And that was sort of the structure.  And we had friends around the corner.  We'd play ball together.  We'd sit on the corner and we'd talk and you know, just jive around.  But, it, it, it's an entirely different world now because we didn't--the radio was the thing.  And you wanted to get home after playing ball at six o'clock to hear Jack Armstrong and then at seven o'clock 'Amos 'n' Andy.'  And family would listen.  We'd turn the radio on, and everybody would listen and comment, etc.  And then they'd have the 'Texaco [Star] Theatre' at eight o'clock, and at that time you were in bed by nine-thirty, ten.  And you were up at, you know, six, and you got yourself ready.  You were hittin' the streets for school at seven o'clock.
Story_ID: 178766
Speaker 1: Now what--the, the family's reaction to 'Amos 'n' Andy,' was it a, was it a positive one in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It was--'Amos 'n' Andy' was one of the funniest shows that was ever produced (laughter) because everybody knew someone like that.  We, the objection was that it was a stereotype.  It was funny, but it was a stereotype, and that's why most of us, as we got older, would protest it.  But you wouldn't miss listening to 'Amos 'n' Andy' 'cause it was--and even today, they're still selling those radio tapes.  They are very, very funny because you could translate those into any ethnic group that you know.  There's always a hustle; there's always somebody who's trying to be in charge; there's always somebody who is the guilty one.  And it was really interesting.  It was a stereotype, and that was the nasty part about it.  But at that time, they had 'The Goldbergs,' which was a stereotype about Jews.  They had 'Life of Luigi,' which was a stereotype about Italians.  They had 'Duffy's Tavern,' which was a stereotype about Irish, because that's the way the world was.  Now we have television programs that's stereotypic, but they have a Jew, and an Irish, and a gay, and a this and that, but they're still talking about family situations, but they're across gender and across ethnic groups.  But at that time, it was one--and 'Amos 'n' Andy' was one of the most popular, if not the most popular show, because it was funny.  I mean you hear the king fish trying to get over.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was really, really funny.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a favorite character with 'Amos 'n' Andy' show?
Speaker 2: Not really, because I knew somebody like every one of those characters.  And that was the other thing, we knew somebody (laughter).
Story_ID: 178767
Speaker 1: Tell, just about your block.  It was Kenyon [Street, Washington, D.C.].  You said it was Ken--the name of--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--we lived on Kenyon Street, down the street from--up the street--Kenyon was about maybe two blocks from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  Gerard Street, where I spent most of childhood, from 1931 on, it was, it was about three blocks from Howard, between 11th and 13th.  The borderline for the black community at that time was 11th Street.  But then as more middle-class people moved in, the borderline moved up to 13th.  But during the [Great] Depression, the white folks weren't able to get out enough, so I lived on a block that was half black and half white, because 11th to 13th was one long block, and 12th Street didn't cut through.  So, just about at the 12th Street point, that's where most of the folks were white, but they couldn't get out.  And you know it was--you hear epithets.  We lived a separate life.  We were there, and they were there.  The only time we interacted was on the playground, where we'd play.  And usually it'd be a black team playing again a white team, but some white kids would play.  The white students went to white schools, which were around 14th and 15th Street.  They went to Central High School [Washington, D.C.], which was down at 11th and Hobart Street.  We had to walk past the white school to go to Dunbar, which was at 1st and M.  And the--at that time, they had Junior ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  The white high school cadets would come and drill on our block.  They'd block off the--and we got to know 'em.  We--there was not--there was difference, but not hostility.  We knew that they thought they were better, but we knew we were better 'cause basically it was a working class high school, so we didn't pay much attention to them.  It was a very, very interesting dynamic.  It was, it was a time in what people would say that race didn't matter, but race did matter.  We were, we were really more privileged and better off than the white folks, you know and they--so which is the reason why we didn't bother them and I guess the reason why they didn't bother us.
Speaker 1: Now, if you take yourself back to that block, I'm wondering if you could tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of your growing up.
Speaker 2: That was a pretty clean block.  I don't remember any particular sounds or--
Speaker 1: No sounds, no--
Speaker 2: --cooking or anything.  It was a pretty clean, it was a good middle-class block.  The leaves was cleaned up; the garbage people came around.  It wasn't a lot of ethnic cooking that brought aromas around the neighborhood.  It was, it was just a good middle-class block.
Speaker 1: No sounds, no smells, no sights?
Speaker 2: Not that I would, I can remember, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 178768
Speaker 1: And tell me how you, what you were like 'cause--you know, as, as a, a young person.  You know, were you--I know that there was a lot of, there was structure in the home, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everybody had structure (laughter).
Speaker 1: Everyone--that's what I'm saying.  There was--I don't mean just you, but I'm saying it was a structured--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There were expectations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there were several kinds.  You had tasks, tasks to do; you would go to the store.  They didn't have supermarkets then, but you'd go to the grocery store, and you'd take the order, and you'd bring it back home, and you'd help your mother put it up.  You eat at a certain time.  Most people we would eat breakfast together, and we'd eat dinner together.  And during the summer, if you had lunch, you'd eat lunch together.  It was, it was very well structured, I would say that (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Can you share anecdotal times about just growing up, some memories, you know, family life together?
Speaker 2: I guess the most important thing is the, the Sunday drive.  You'd get in the car--we were fortunate to have a car--and you'd drive around Washington [D.C.] to the, the various public places.  We did a lot of visiting the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.], the art gallery [National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.], the [United States] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] and so on, which was--those were not segregated.  You couldn't eat there, but you could go and have--I spent a lot of time in the Smithsonian, a lot of time in the Li--Library of Congress.  And then on Sunday afternoon we'd probably take a drive to, you know, Chevy Chase [Maryland] or to Virginia, and we did a lot of day trips.  We went to practically every Civil War site, went to Mount Vernon and so on.  So, it was a fairly unstructured, but yet it was structured in the sense that we had specific to do.  Almost every Friday night you'd go to theater, the Lincoln, the Republic, or the Booker T., and you'd see a movie.  And we would go together as a family.  And then when I got to be a teenager, we'd go to the, the music shows, the stage shows at the Howard Theater, where you got to see all the black performers, Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Duke Ellington, Jimmy Longfoot, etc.  But as I said, people running around don't realize just how, how comprehensive the community was.
Story_ID: 178769
Speaker 1: So you, you were talking about the, you know, the Sunday rides with your, you know, your fam, you know, your family.  And I would assume you would go--you said you did some day trips.  So those were to visit friends and things like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: We usually--well, we would go to Richmond [Virginia] to meet some of my mother's [Vivian Kemp Brown] folks, but we would go to Baltimore [Maryland].  My father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] had some relatives in Baltimore.  But we would go to Manassas [Virginia]; we would go to Gettysburg [Virginia]; we'd go to Fredericksburg [Virginia].  Usually it was to see something.  And you couldn't eat, so whatever you wanna eat you took with you.
Speaker 1: And your--did your father have a--did he like the Civil War era?  Was he sort of--that was--or, or why, why all the Civil War monuments?  I guess that's what I'm wondering.
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, they were public places.  They had history to them.  And not only blacks, but a lot of whites went.  More whites went to those places.  'Cause you're understanding how this battle was fought, what does it mean, and we always were interested what was the role of the blacks in that particular battle.  So, we, we went back to some of those places two or three times 'cause there was always something to see.  And then, of course, there were the museums, and the Black Annapolis, and the airports, spent a lot of time going to the airport, and then sometimes we just go out there and watch the airplanes land and take off.  That was really exciting.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's where your fascination with planes began really seeing that?  Or you said you also--
Speaker 2: Well, my fascination with planes would have began when I went to the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] and saw Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis.  The actual plane was hanging in the ceiling at the Smithsonian.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's when I got--and I read about Lindbergh and the flight and how he did it and so on.  Then I made--like almost every guy in Tuskegee made models of planes, and we knew what the planes were, and we wrote stories about the pilot and so on.  And then we would go out and watch the planes.  We had both Bolling Field [Bolling Air Force Base, later Join Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.], which was the military field, which was in Anacostia.  We used to go to Frederick Douglass's home in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], and then we'd go to the airport to watch the transport planes.  And they wouldn't let black, blacks take rides, they wouldn't even, the segregation was such.  So, my father cooked up this scheme one time after we kept badgering him.  He said well, I'm gonna tell 'em that you are the children of French West African diplomats.  And the State Department would really be upset if they couldn't fly.  Keep your mouth shut, 'cause he was light skinned, and they thought he was white.  And so that's the way we got our first ride (laughter) as the children of French West African diplomats.
Speaker 1: But your father didn't seem to be really hung up on the issue of color then is what I'm saying.  You weren't--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't--
Speaker 1: --part of that.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't part--
Speaker 1: He wasn't not a--
Speaker 2: --of that, but he would--
Speaker 1: He was not--he didn't promulgate it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would use it when it was to his, to his and our advantage, like if we were at a place where they weren't gonna sell to blacks, he'd go over and just buy the ice cream.

Speaker 1: Now you went to [Blanche K.] Bruce Elementary [School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was there anything, like any teachers or anything that influenced you there?  I know you said you had two, two aunt--
Speaker 2: Two aunts and a cousin.
Speaker 1: So you had to be on good behavior?
Speaker 2: I was behaving all the time, although I was pretty--I, I was pretty aggressive and sometimes they would say I was pushing the envelope a little bit too far.  I was a very good student.  I was the leading student in school as a matter of fact.  But--
Speaker 1: In elementary school even started, okay.
Speaker 2: Elementary school.
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite subjects then too?
Speaker 2: I was good in everything.  And I was the, the class spokesman.  Whenever there was a speech to be made, I'd give the speech and so on.  And let's see, what else did I do?  Well, I, I was always playing ball of one type or another, but it was so close to home.  I think I was in sixth grade when I moved--I was about in the fifth grade when I moved to Gerard Street.  And then at that time they had the schoolboy patrol, which was you'd wear these belts, and you'd stand at the street corners to keep the kids safe.  And it was like competitive, and you'd be, based on your academic and your behavior, you'd be made a lieutenant or a captain.  I think I was a, I was a first lieutenant in the patrol and so on.  And it was, it was a good school.  Practically who got out of there went to I guess was Garnet-Patterson Junior High School [Washington, D.C.].  I have friends today that who were friends of mine in elementary school.  One of 'em, Harold Jennifer [ph.], who you really ought to interview, he lives in Annapolis [Maryland] now.  We went to Bruce School, we went to, gone to Patterson, we went to Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.], and we went to Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts] together.
Speaker 1: That's pretty impressive.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you, all those, okay.  Now, now, was he, but he didn't live on the same street though?
Speaker 2: He lived three blocks away.  He lived on--but see, actually it was Gerard, Harvard, Irving, and Park Road, and it (unclear)--obviously (unclear)--and he lives on Park--he lived on Park Road.  My friend, Ernie Davis [ph.], who just passed away, lived on Irving Street.  And when my daughter went to Washington [D.C.], the first--the second house she lived in was on Irving Street, right next to where Ernest Davis used to live, 'cause his sister used to be my girlfriend.  I used to walk by there all the time.  So, it, it's very interesting, deja vu all over again.  My daughter has lived, who's been in Washington since 1982, has lived through some of those same experiences.  She now lives on Upshur Street, which is right near the Carter Barron Center, which was a place where black folks can live.  But then after the war, gradually the middle class black folks moved up to Upshur Street and--I forget--and the other, other streets there, so much so that the area is becoming gentrified--not gentrified--integrated, and the affluent white people are buying these houses from retired black people 'cause the houses are going at four five hundred thousand dollars, where when we first went in there even fifteen year ago, the house were like fifty-five, sixty thousand dollars, which is what's happening.  I'm sure it's happening in Chicago [Illinois].  It's happening in Harlem [New York, New York] and Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, New York] and a lot of places.
Story_ID: 178771
Speaker 1: Now you said you were a member of the Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association], you know, and you talked about the Hi-Y group [High School YMCA].
Speaker 2: The 12th Street YMCA [Washington, D.C.], one of the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in many black communities, the major social organization for the churches and the YM, and the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  We had the, the dances, the Hi-Y dances, the YW dance, YW at Rhode Island Avenue, the 9th Street, the YMCA on 12th Street, 12th Street Y.  And it was always called the branch.  Now they don't do that; they just say it's a certain Y.  But branch meant it was a black Y.  So you had the Butler Street Y in Atlanta [Georgia].  I forget--you had the Pine Street Y in St. Louis [Missouri].  I don't know what the blacks--
Speaker 1: In Chicago [Illinois] I think it was the Lawson--I don't know if it's Lawson, but-
Speaker 2: But every, every Y, 'cause the YC so itself is a French--
Speaker 1: Wabash YM in, in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, the saw it as a way of serving the people.  And they had money, and they had a board.  They raised money.  They had the Hi-Y Club where we would talk about issues, and we'd put on plays and so on.  They had job training programs.  And at that time, the Y was residential, so that many--that's why the Y started.  The country boys coming to the city, to be protected by, by Jesus and these over-(laughter)-looking people who were gonna keep 'em on the straight and narrow.  And every Y had a swimming pool.  That was the program: every Y had a swimming pool; every Y had a Hi Club, Y Club; every Y had a gymnasium; every Y had an education, a GED program.  And we all joined Hi-Y because that's a place you, you met people from other parts of the city.  And you'd have your basketball leagues.  You'd have your swimming.  And then you'd have your YW and the YM work together, and then most of the dances were at the YW.  And the parents would come and sit on the wall (laughter) so you couldn't dance too close.  Those days are long gone (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's so cute though, that's cute (laughter).  You were an A student who was a little naughty, but normal.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 178772
Speaker 1: What other, what now, what church did your parents [Vivian Kemp Brown and Roscoe Brown, Sr.], you know, did your family belong to?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was 19th Street, and I think my father went there.  And then they went to Berean Baptist [Church, Washington, D.C.], and then they ended up at Lincoln Temple [Washington, D.C.], which is a congregational church.
Speaker 1: So did you grow up congregational?  That's where your--did your parents, were they active churchgoers or not?
Speaker 2: They went.  Yeah, they, they weren't active, but they would go, and they were members, and they would go.  I went to Sunday school at St. Luke's Episcopal Church [Washington, D.C.], and that's where all, not all, but many of the pretty girls and so on went (laughter).  I went to Sunday school there, where, where my parents would be going to occasionally Berean, Lincoln Temple.  They weren't avid church, churchgoers; they would go from time to time.  Oh, and Howard University [Washington, D.C.] had a chapel.  We probably spent more time at the Howard University chapel, at that morning service with Mordecai Johnson delivering his various sermons, probably did more there.  But then we would go to the other churches.
Speaker 1: So, because he was legendary for his chapel, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, Howard was--
Speaker 1: Now that's what I wanna know: how, how--your father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] had an office, you said, at--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --you know, at Howard.
Speaker 2: The government actually established a Negro health movement office at Howard in the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], and then they transferred it downtown to the [U.S.] Public Health Service building [Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 178773
Speaker 1: And do you remember the time that your father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] was working for the [Franklin D.] Roosevelt Administration and that sort of being a big deal?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was big deal.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He was one of the most prominent blacks in, in America at that time.  You know, that Black Cabinet was the thing, so much so that--
Speaker 1: Do you remember who--
Speaker 2: --when I shot down the jet airplane over Berlin, the article in the paper said "Son of Dr. Roscoe Brown." (Laughter).
Speaker 1: That's absolutely right, it did say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I wanna go back just a little bit to any other organizations that you were a part of, you know, the Y was one.  You, you know you--
Speaker 2: In high school, football in high school, baseball team.  We went to camp; I went to Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], which is where--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --many of the middle class black kids went to--during the summer camp, which was near Springfield [Massachusetts], where I ended up going to college [Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts] actually.  And the--
Speaker 1: Now what age were you when you started going to Camp Atwater?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Story_ID: 178774
Speaker 1: Do you remember, you know, some of your camp experiences [at Camp Atwater, North Brookfield, Massachusetts], or even who some of your camp, you know, your camp mates or--were?
Speaker 2: The, the Camp Atwater drew from the South, from Alabama, Georgia, from Washington [D.C.], from Baltimore [Maryland], from New York [New York], and from Boston [Massachusetts], and from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And we sort of clustered around those natural--even though we lived in different huts, you know, buildings, we would cluster around each other.  So the Washington kids (unclear)--and with the Philadelphia kids all (unclear)--much of the competition was around your age groups, (unclear) hut, the Boston Hut, whatever it was.  And they're reviving Camp Atwater now.  And they--during the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] maybe, where there be more integration, when the white camps began to accept black kids, many of the middle-class kids went there.  And now there's a movement to both restore, rebuild Atwater, which was really an outgrowth of the Urban League in Springfield [Massachusetts].  It came out of St. John's Congregational Church, Dr. [William N.] DeBerry.  And somebody left this property to this church, and DeBerry came up with the idea it's a (unclear) for poor kids.  But he figured a way to keep this going is to let kids from other parts of the country, black kids, doctors' kids, lawyers', business--come all the way from Alabama to Camp Atwater.  We'd stay for a month, one month for the boys, one month for the girls.  That was a, that was a super experience.  It was a really bonding experience for black youth, and they're trying to do that again.  It's probably too late and too different for it to be totally that way, because many middle class black families live in integrated neighborhoods now, and they don't either see the need or have the need to come together to protect themselves or to project themselves, because there are so many ways of projecting.  It's, it's very, very--I, I think for all time of how different things are.  Of course we're talking about sixty, seventy years ago, how difficult it is, how different, not difficult, how different it is for middle class black youth or any black youth.  It's probably more similar for an extremely poor black youth because the ghetto is still the ghetto and with the constraints.  But for a middle class black youth, lower middle class, you know, middle, middle class black youth, the experience is so different now.  And so when we sit back and talk about how we built our communities and built our friendships and had our little rivalries and so on, it's, it's really a, a, a, a variation, not a variation, it's really something has passed.  It's, it's a nice thing to think about, etc., but in terms--for all black kids a main metaphor for life is race.  Race in this society is still the main social metaphor class, opportunity, etc.  And maybe, you know, in a hundred years, two hundred years it might not be that way, but that's the way it is now.  So even when black kids don't have that internal understanding, it's there.  There's nothing you can do about.  I mean that's the way--now some, you try to get over it by doing other kinds of things and mimicking whites or trying to be blacker than black, but we, we were just kids.  We were just plain old ordinary teenagers doing what teenagers do, aspiring, 'cause most of us knew we were going to graduate from high school.  That was a big thing then 'cause only about 10 percent of the kids went to college then.  But you were gonna graduate from high school and get a good civil service job.  You were gonna get--'cause it was civil service, you, or you get a social service job working in the Y, the church, and you were gonna be leaders basically.  We didn't use that term, but we were going to be people who had their raison d'etre, and believed in ourselves and our community.
Story_ID: 178775
Speaker 1: I would say nowadays, people would be attracted for a different reason, you know--
Speaker 2: People would what?
Speaker 1: The middle class are attracted for a different reason.
Speaker 2: Attracted to Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, because--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --they wanna rediscover--
Speaker 1: They wanna re--
Speaker 2: --their roots.
Speaker 1: --roots, right.
Speaker 2: And also marriage is a factor that if you get there and you meet other--that's the same thing with the Boule, you go to the Boule, and people wanna introduce their daughters and their sons and so on.  And that, that is, that is a reason.  There are so many other outlets because we have a sports provide and out, outlet for that now; drama provides an outlet; dance provides an outlet; Tuskegee Airmen, who have flying schools.
Speaker 1: But now, you, so you spent your summers at Camp Atwater.  Was that every summer?
Speaker 2: A month, yeah.
Speaker 1: A month, I'm sorry, a month.  And you're saying it was one month, all men, all boys?
Speaker 2: One month all girls.
Speaker 1: And one all--so there was no ever co-ed--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --thing?  (Laughter) I mean, okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's still that way.  They may have a month overlap, or they whatever, but--now when I--my kids went to the Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] camp, the New York City Y has some wonderful camps, the best in the country.  And my kids went to the Y camp, and there they had the girls with the boys.  And that was, you know, they were separated et cetera but there was more interaction.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I remember I interviewed [HM] Reverend [Calvin O.] Pressley.  He was talking about--
Speaker 2: Calvin, that's my buddy, yeah.
Speaker 1: Calvin Pressley, yes, okay, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, he--
Speaker 1: About--
Speaker 2: --ran [Camp] Minisink [Dover Plains, New York]--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --which was a camp for poor kids--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --and still a camp or poor--but some poor kids at that time were really lower middle class, you know.  My wife's cousins went to Minisink.  And they, their father was a porter or whatever, but he had a good job, and they went there.  There was a means test, and in Washington, D.C., the Y had Camp Lichtman [Washington, D.C.], named after the guy who ran the theaters there.  And some of us--I, I don't think I went to Lichtman, but some of the middle-class kids would go.  But you had the money to travel to Atwater.  You had to just get up there.  It wasn't that expensive, but you had to get there.
Story_ID: 178776
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking--now you--what you wanted to sort of be?  And I'm wondering--you're playing sports.  You played both basketball and--
Speaker 2: I played baseball and football.
Speaker 1: Baseball and football?
Speaker 2: I played basketball, but I wasn't on a team.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well, did you have a preference or did you have a, you know, which one you liked better really?
Speaker 2: I thought I was a better baseball player.
Speaker 1: You did?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And--but when I got to college, I became a better football player.  I played football and then I played lacrosse.  I was one of the first black lacrosse players because I wasn't quite a good enough baseball player to make the first team.  But I was fast and strong, and I could make the lacrosse team.
Speaker 1: That picture that I saw in the stack, is that of you on the lacrosse team?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  I was one of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause it--
Speaker 2: --the first, maybe one of the first two blacks to play lacrosse collegiately.
Speaker 1: Now, I just, I wanna just let's get through Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].  Are there--I mean at Dunbar, what are you thinking you're wanting to do, and you know, are you active in other activities in school, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  I was a company commander.  And when I graduated high school I went to--during high school, I went to the summer military camp.  I went there because they had a great baseball program, but I also learned to shoot machine guns and pass the test to be a lieutenant.  And I was a lieutenant in the Infantry when I was nineteen, before draft age.  So when Tuskegee Airmen came up, I had to resign my commission as a lieutenant so they wouldn't call me up, so that I could go in as a private as a Tuskegee--to learn to fly.  So--but all of--not all of us--most of us knew that we were gonna go to college.  There was a teachers' college, Miner Teachers College, now D.C. Teachers, part of Federal City, UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  And some of those who didn't have the resources, the finances, would go to Miner, but that was competitive, based on scores, grades; and some would go to Howard; and some would go to basically New England school; some would go to Union and Hampton.  And I had the option of going to Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire] or Springfield [College, Springfield, Massachusetts], or one of the New England schools because we had a wonderful teacher, Mrs. [Mary Gibson] Hundley, who wrote the book 'The Dunbar Story [1870-1955],' who would pick out the brightest students and aim them to the Ivy League schools.  And I was looking at Dartmouth and looking at Springfield.  I went, the reason I went to Springfield is that the coach and physical education director at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] had organized a group called the Howard Cubs where we would play football like the Howard University team.  And through the Y and 'cause of Springfield had a relationship with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association], which founded the YMCA College, he then had encouraged three of my upperclassmen to go to Springfield.  They'd done very well.  They made the teams.  That was--(unclear)--thing to be on an integrated team.  And they did well in school.  They were star students, so it was a compatible place.  So three of my classmates, Howard Jennifer, Bill Waters, and I went to Springfield as freshmen.  So we joined Percy Pitts and John Pinderhughes, and we became a group of about maybe 12 or 14 blacks out of about 660 students, and we became class officers, valedictorians, captains of teams, etc.  And that was better than going to a place like Dartmouth where there were two.  We (unclear) had some social life, plus the Camp Atwater was run by the black church (unclear), which was an upper class black church, not upper class, but middle class black church, one of the leaders in the Civil Rights Movement.  And so there they had a lot of--Springfield, because they had had the armory and so on, had again a small middle class, only about 3,000 people, who worked in businesses and government up there.  And so we met their daughters and joined.  I ended up teaching Sunday school because that's a place where you meet the young women and have social life and so on.  Springfield was a--I've been very fortunately, and I have to say that.  It has--I do--my social attitude of not being as bitter as some people, my, my philosophy being: don't get mad; get even.  And so these experiences of which I'm telling you about high school, and Atwater, and Springfield College and so on, helped to foster that.  Because if you're successful, even in a limited environment, if you're successful and you recognize where your talents, you don't get mad, even with the racism around you.  Because basically my father [Roscoe Brown] and my mother [Vivian Kemp Brown] taught us racism is stupid, and we're better than white folks, and just don't even pay any attention--not pay any attention, but don't let 'em denigrate you.  And so that is an environment that myself and a number of other middle-class blacks and lower middle-class blacks--'cause not just middle class, they were working-class folks who had the same values.  They may have done domestic work or, or, or, or manual work, but they had that same value: don't get mad; get even, and we, we'll overcome.  The sad part of it is that, having done that, we still collectively haven't overcome.  We're not collectively accepted for our skills regardless of our color.
Story_ID: 178777
Speaker 1: You were the valedictorian though of your class at Du--
Speaker 2: Springfield.
Speaker 1: What, were you the--oh, not, not at DuSable [High School, Chicago Illinois] though?
Speaker 2: Not, DuSable--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, that's Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: I mean Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.].  I'm sorry (laughter).  Okay, thanks, guys, okay.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's Chicago.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That is Chicago.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Buddy Elm [ph.] was a good friend of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was one of the great football players out--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --of DuSable.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--there were about five of us within, you know, two-tenths of a point.  I was about third I think, the Sam Bullock--no, Charles Bundy was first--no, was Charles Bundy--yeah, Charles Bundy, Sam Bullock, Joan Hirsch, myself, we were within, you know, five-tenths or seven-tenths of a point.  And so we all went to great schools.  Bullock went to Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], and Hirsch went to Amherst [College, Amherst, Massachusetts] I think, Bundy went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I went to Springfield [College, Springfield, Massachusetts], and so we were, we were really very, very close.  And I was the valedict--valedictorian of my high school--my college class.
Speaker 1: Just--okay, now, okay, this--I mean that's pretty amazing when you think about it, the competition that tight.
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: You don't hear about that often.
Speaker 2: --good (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean I'm just saying, you don't hear about that that often.
Speaker 2: Well, you do hear about it in schools like Bronx Science [Bronx High School of Science, New York, New York], which is--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --our upper-class school, and Stuyvesant High School [New York, New York].  You have that all the time, but it was--I've been in a lot of scholarship programs, and the difference between kids is really something else.  When you get achieving--the thing about Dunbar, you had such a cluster of achieving people, which will never happen again.  You have a town of 300,00 or 100,000 black folks.  You have one academic school, and the best go there, and we had great teachers.  And that, that doesn't happen in the average--well, Dunbar wasn't an average (unclear)--it was likened, a specialized school.  So, and you had that kind of competition in your specialized schools.
Speaker 1: And a lot of your teachers, you know, were also, they had Ph.D.s--
Speaker 2: We had about--
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: --five, five or six teachers with Ph.D.s, and they were, they were achievement motivated, pushing, pushing to do the best, a lot of--(unclear)--some of it not so nice and that--sometimes you pushed a little hard, but the parents were pushing; everybody was pushing.  It was a--yet we had a certain camaraderie among ourselves.
Story_ID: 178778
Speaker 1: Your father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.], what year was he appointed by, you know, to be--what year did he start with the [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt--
Speaker 2: Well, he started with the civil service probably about 1930, '31 [1931].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the Black Cabinet came more or less informally with Mary McLeod Bethune getting these under--he was like an undersecretary of health--getting these undersecretaries who were black dealing with Negro affairs together.  And they started probably maybe 1935 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he worked there from '35 [1935] to what--I mean as undersec--
Speaker 2: No, he worked through the, through the--he retired in '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he'd been there for twenty--thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty years.
Speaker 1: But as his role as undersecretary, who was part of that Black Cabinet?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: William Hastie was the first black federal judge; Robert Weaver was the first black cabinet officer; Mary McCleod Bethune; Ambrose Caliver.  Those were the key ones.
Speaker 1: Do you remember being in their company much yourself, any of, of the--
Speaker 2: Well, I met them all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First of all, I answer the phone, they would be calling him.  And then whenever he'd give, he gave a lot of speeches, I met some of them at the, when they gave speeches or when they came to the high school.  One of the things that they did at Dunbar [High School, Washington, D.C.], ever assembly they would have some outstanding black there.  Ralph Bunche came there, and Mordecai Johnson came there, and Robert Weaver came there, and Judge Hastie came there, and Mary McLeod Bethune to exhort us to reach, reach higher.  That was, that was the exhortation; that's where we got that.  You won't find anybody who went to Dunbar in that time that doesn't feel that type of exhortation and special mission.
Speaker 1: Of the race.
Speaker 2: For the race, for themselves--
Speaker 1: For themselves.
Speaker 2: --and for the race.
Story_ID: 178779
Speaker 1: Now when you, when you decided that you were going to Springfield [College, Springfield, Massachusetts], in that decision process since you had gotten admitted to Dartmouth [College, Hanover, New Hampshire], did your, did your mother [Vivian Kemp Brown] or father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] weigh in on the decision at all?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what were their feel--
Speaker 2: It was inter, well, it was interact--(unclear)--Springfield had a critical mass of black folks.  It was probably I had a scholarship there.  That was probably helped a little bit.  And it was interested in health and physical education.  See, my father was in health education, and he--I thought and he wanted me to continue in health education and--or medical school.  And at Springfield you could measure--major in health and physical education and pre-medicine.  So, when I was at Springfield I had three majors: I had a chemistry major; I had a health and physical education major; and I had a pre-med major.  So I had the option, and that was the idea, the option: what are you going to do when you graduate?  You might decide to go to medical school; or you might decide to coach; or you might decide to go into industry as a chemist.  There were very few opportunities for black chemists at that time, and so you--but you could teach chemistry in a black college or, or a school.  So those were some of the options, whereas it (unclear)--that was basically a liberal arts school.  And you would go there, and you would be the--get enough credits to be a teacher or to be a doctor.  At that time law was not a major option for blacks, black attorneys.  Most of the black attorneys came out of black law schools and worked in black communities.  We knew we would probably work in a black community, but--
Speaker 1: So when you went to, when you, you go to Springfield, this is your first time really in an integrated environment, I mean (unclear)--right?
Speaker 2: Being in an integrated educational environment.
Speaker 1: Environment, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because in Washington [D.C.], when you go to the museum, you'd meet white kids and white people, you'd talk to them, and I was an avid baseball, autograph collector.  We lived about a mile from Griffith Stadium, which is where Howard University Medical School [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] is located now.  And I collected autographs for three or four years, and I would--and most of the kids that were collecting autographs were white.  So we got to be friends and interactive, etc.  I also was a real football fan, so the [Washington] Redskins came to Washington 1937, and they practiced at Griffith Stadium, which is right on the way.  And we used to stop by there.  We got to know some of the players and some of the white guys and so on.  So, I was not unaccustomed to dealing with white folks.  At Springfield, basically, the average white student was of a lower social class than those of us who were middle class.  They were working-class people, and our parents were doctors, and lawyers, and civil servants.  They were working-class people--they're nice people--and some few from doctors and so on.  But basically, they did not have that intrinsic feeling of superiority that many upper class white folks had.  So, you know, it was more what are you like or how do you do this, etc., so.  And we were smarter than they were, so they looked up to us for leadership.  And, and the faculty coming out of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] tradition were, were very fair.  They didn't, they didn't expect any less or any more, like they, they were very pleased.  And you know, when we got there, we got 99 percentile, etc., etc.  They were pleased to have some smart folks around there.  And so it was a, that was a very, very positive experience.
Speaker 1: There weren't a lot of those experiences around the country, don't you--do you think that--
Speaker 2: Damn few.
Speaker 1: Right, that's why I'm--
Speaker 2: Springfield is one of the very, very few, because when--
Speaker 1: So you're--
Speaker 2: --the black kids went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or (unclear) and wanted--(unclear)--(unclear)--we used socialize, and they were very smart.  And what we did, 'cause it was all in New England, we'd socialize among each other.  But Springfield had the largest cadre now.  I would imagine, I don't know, I was thinking in a place like--not even Michigan, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], maybe not even Illinois 'cause they--Illinois was very prejudiced--they were, Springfield was very unusual.
Story_ID: 178780
Speaker 1: The only other place that I've heard, you know, people--historically people going, but I think it was your classic too.  A lot was Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio], you know--
Speaker 2: Oberlin, I knew you were gonna say that--
Speaker 1: Right, right, but--
Speaker 2: --Oberlin.  That was--
Speaker 1: --but I don't--
Speaker 2: --that was a--I didn't wanna go to Oberlin--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but that was the other place, because Oberlin made an attempt to bring in a lot of the leaders of the Civil Rights Movement came out of Oberlin.  That's the oth--that is the other place.
Speaker 1: So, you're saying you get there, and there are four already there, and I mean--
Speaker 2: There were twelve because they're from other places, from New Jersey, and Massachusetts, and Maryland, so it was about twelve of us.  They all became very successful.  Harold Amos, who recently passed away, was valedictorian of his class.  He became one of the primary microbiologist at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and the medical school [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts]; Harold Jennifer, who I mentioned; Bill became a doctor; Alison Miller became a doctor.  [Price] Dealyon Rice [ph.] was a Tuskegee Airman and leader in his community; Ben Hargrave was a football star; Paul Rowles (ph.) from Cleveland [Ohio].  So, and we all got into it through our YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] connections, and they were all great people.  Johnny Pinderhughes, in fact his, his son is a very well-known photographer, John Pinderhughes.
Story_ID: 178781
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up taking up lacrosse?  Where did that come in the--
Speaker 2: Well, I said I was a great baseball player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I looked around at the talent, and I figured I wasn't gonna make the first team.  And lacrosse was a new sport.  A lot of the football players--I played football.  I was fast; I was agile; and some of my football players said let's try it.  So we got out there, and we learned--I learned the first lacrosse game I saw was the first one I played or vice versa, so--and I got, because I was fast, and I was kind of a leader guy, I was the only black on the team, but they sort of coalesced around me.
Speaker 1: 'Cause earlier we were looking at the picture of you, you know, with, sitting with your, your team.  And we didn't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what it wa--you know, what actually--
Speaker 2: What that was--
Speaker 1: --what the team was.
Speaker 2: That's lacrosse.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: A lot of blacks are playing lacrosse now.  Like the star of Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] who won the national championship was a black guy, Cushton [sic, John Christmas, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia].
Story_ID: 178782
Speaker 1: Now, so what other, what things are forming you here [at Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts]?  You don't--it's not like you're particularly isolated, but it's not--I mean you're still a small number, but it's a large number and a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a large number.
Speaker 1: --number and a northern, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had a ball.  We, we organized a group called the College Fellows [ph.], and we gave an annual dance.  I don't know what we used the money for, but we gave a party that was the party at Springfield.  Because these, these working-class people wanted their children to meet college students, and they, they had a couple of doctors and so on.  We had a--we took over the hotel.  It was, it was something, and everybody was proud.  They were proud of the, the Springfield College boys.  Remember, we're talking about a town where there might have been only three or four--Springfield itself is only about 150,000, only about three or four thousand black folks at that time.  Now a third of the town is Latino and, and so on.  It's a different town, just like everything else.  Springfield was the place of Springfield Armory where they made the Springfield rifle, so there were good government jobs there.  See, again, it's focused around a steady income.  And you have to have some educational skills to get those jobs and keep them.  It's sort of a ceiling as to how far you could go, but you would have a good job.  And then many people with the civil service jobs would do business things on the side.  They, they would do a restaurant; they'd do a construction business or whatever, and it just keeps growing.  As I said, those days are so far way, it's--you almost feel guilty talking about them because, in a sense, we had a kind of, even though with the discrimination, a kind of privilege and a kind of hope that some kids today can't have.  Because even when the middle class have a good education, they, they sold us covert racism that keeps them either slotted or diminished in terms of the opportunity.
Story_ID: 178783
Speaker 1: Now was there an ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] program as well on campus [at Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts] or not?  Because you had--there was one--
Speaker 2: One, there was one in, in high school [Dunbar High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: High school, right, I know.
Speaker 2: Springfield did not have an ROTC.
Speaker 1: Have one, okay, okay.  But you're saying when you were in the ROTC program there, that's--I mean in high school and--
Speaker 2: And then the summer, the government had what they called a Civilian Military Training Program where--
Speaker 1: That was an outgrowth.  Was that an outgrowth of--wasn't it all part--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --of the doub--
Speaker 2: No, that wasn't part of the WPA [Works Progress Administration].  That wasn't part of, the, the youth camps of CCC [Civic Conservation Corps].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, this was just a plain military camp to train people to be soldiers and officers.  That was perfect to become officers, and they recruited from the ROTCs.  And we would go there, and we would get advanced training.  And at the end you take some correspondence tests and you get a commission.  This was in '39 [1939], '38 [1938], getting ready for the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: And so you did that, did you do that are you saying during college?  Also, did you--
Speaker 2: I did ROT--is CM--
Speaker 1: I know you did the military--
Speaker 2: --TC--
Speaker 1: --camps in high school, right?
Speaker 2: --and I did it in my, in my senior year and my sophomore year--my senior and freshman year in college--senior year in high school and freshman year in college.  The main reason we went there was to play baseball 'cause they had the best baseball players from Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia, and we'd compete with each other.
Story_ID: 178784
Speaker 1: Now when you--anything else about col--but you're thinking that--wait, you said you, you had a biolog--no, chemistry and--
Speaker 2: Pre-med [pre-medical] and--
Speaker 1: Pre--
Speaker 2: --health and physical education major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I took sixty more credits because at that time you didn't pay back credits.  You took as many classes as you could take.  I was also a lab assistant in chemistry because I was a good chemistry student, and that was my extra work.  So I was able to work in my academic with my lab work as well.  In fact I was the lab instructor.  I would actually run classes.
Speaker 1: And so when you--what made you decide not to go premed though, ultimately?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I, I got recruited in the [U.S.] military (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But even before then, my desire I guess was to really be a, a coach or a YMC--the big job for black folks at that time was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] director.  You'd be an executive.  And I wanted to be a YMCA director.  I wanted to be a coach and YMCA director because I didn't want to teach in the public school.  I would have taught in a college.  I was--which is what I ended up doing right after I came out of the service.  I taught.  My first job was teaching at West Virginia State College [later West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] when I came out the service.  And when I came out of the service, I had the option of going to medical school because I had the option of going to take my Ph.D. in chemistry.  I had the option of, of coaching.  And when I came out of the service, I matriculated at Columbia [University, New York, New York] for my Master of Public Health degree.  And then I decided I didn't want to do that, so then I switched my matriculation to teachers college.  And I went for one class and I found the racism so intolerable.  You know, the guy was asking me, you know, what do you know about this?  And why do you wanna know about that?  And so I left Columbia, and that's when I went to teach at West Virginia.  And then when I came back, by that time I'd got--earned a fellowship and was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  So all of my Ph.D. education was paid for between fellowship and government, and I had a job teaching as well.  So my graduate education really didn't cost me any money, per se.  And that's true with most people who came out the service.  Many people went through medical school.  And I had the option of doing medical school, but I liked the idea of merging my interest in sports and activity with my interest in teaching and health.  So I did a lot of organizing of programs.  I was assistant basketball coach.  I was coach of the women's team, and that opened up the door so that I wasn't that anxious to be a physician, 'cause a physician at that time was--(unclear)--it still is fairly--they didn't have the, the spectrum.  For example, my son's in emergency medicine, which he loves.  It's a tremendous spectrum and so on.  At that time, you basically go to deal with babies and children, and I was more interested in the scientific aspect of it.  I was a very good chemistry student and very good physiology student.  So when I got into health and physical education, I was teaching kinesiology, anatomy, and physiology, and applied chemistry.  So that really whetted my interest.  Because at that time, the economic difference between being an entering professor and an entering physician really wasn't that great.  You had to work.  And so that, that--and then I got into, got the Ph.D., and there were a number of other things that I was able to do with that.
Story_ID: 178785
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go--so you got--let's deal with your time in the service.  So, the time that you get--you got drafted.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't--
Speaker 1: No, no--
Speaker 2: I enlisted.
Speaker 1: --you joined, you joined--
Speaker 2: Yeah, see, I was a--I had a lieutenant's commission.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they wanted to call me to active duty while I was a junior.  And as you know, the service was segregated, and I wanted to finish college, and I also wanted.  So, therefore, I resigned my commission, which I could do, and I enlisted as an aviation cadet so that when I graduated for college there was a deal.  The day I graduated from college [Springfield College, Springfield, Massachusetts] is the day I left for, for training at Tuskegee [Institute, later Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Now at the time that you go there, the, the 99th squadron has been in existence, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, no?
Speaker 2: I went, went when--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I enlisted, they were just getting started.  Remember, I enlisted in '41 [1941], something like that, '41 [1941], '42 [1942].  They were just getting started.  And they, they had already started the training for the 99th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were also talking about expanding it.  And that's when I got in as they expanded it to the 332nd.  And so my training began in March of '43 [1943].  And I don't think the 99th got overseas until May of '43 [1943].
Speaker 1: 'Cause they had been held up.
Speaker 2: They'd been held up.  And then I graduated in March of '44 [1944].  The 332nd had gotten over in January of '44 [1944], and I got over--I graduated March of '44 [1944], and I was overseas by July of '44 [1944].  That's the way that circle went--
Story_ID: 178786
Speaker 1: So the whole, the 99th and the 100th sort of merged in some respects.
Speaker 2: No--the 99th was the, was--the history of this: the 99th was pursuit squadron, was the first squadron.  Then they realized that they couldn't fly by themselves, and they, they assigned them to North Africa to a white squadron.  But in the meantime, simultaneously, they started the 100th, the 301st, and the 302nd, which was the 332nd fighter group.  And fi--and then the 332nd went overseas in January of '44 [1944].  And the 99th joined them in May of '44 [1944] or June of '44 [1944] to become the only four squadron group in the Air Force--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --because they tried the 99th with a white group, and that didn't really work because the white group didn't want 'em, even though one of 'em tried to help 'em move it.  And so we had this four squadron that started flying escort over Germany for the bombers, which is what made our reputation.  Everything else that they talk about, about the Tuskegee Airmen is solely--is, is not directly related to our reputation, which is that period, June of '44 [1944] to May of '45 [1945], when we escorted bombers over Germany and never lost one to enemy fighters.  That's the thing that made our reputation.
Speaker 1: Now did you fly with [HM] John Rogers, Sr.?
Speaker 2: Jack, yeah, I saw him--
Speaker 1: Jack, right, right.
Speaker 2: I saw the judge.  I saw him--
Speaker 1: Okay, yes.
Speaker 2: --at our convention just a month ago.
Speaker 1: 'Cause both of you were bomber pilots, right?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: --we're fighter pilots, we were-
Speaker 1: Fighter pa--sorry, okay.
Speaker 2: The (unclear)--the 330--the Tuskegee Airmen's reputation is based on the fighter pilots.  They started a bomber group, and they never got into--because the war ended.  The B-25 pilots, and those were the ones involved in the Freeman Field incident, where the officers got arrested for trying to go in that.  That's a good part of, of the movement, but our reputation is those 450 fighter pilots and those 1200 mechanic and so on that went overseas, that's our reputation.  Now the broader group, there were 1000 pilots trained; 660 were, were fighter pilots; 350 were bomber pilots; there were about 8 to 10,000 ground officers and others, which is what we called the Tuskegee experience 'cause we all experienced segregation.  But the reputation of the Tuskegee Airmen is the reputation of the fighter pilots protecting those bombers.  And it's sometimes a little awkward to talk about it because it was, I'll say the accident of chance that we were there and they weren't.  But the, the deal is that it is our bodies and our planes that protected those bombers, not that the others couldn't have done it, but it's part of the larger experience because, as I said, it's really an element of chance as to who got trained first and who got trained second and who, who was over there.  You, you can't say that we were better; we were just there.
Story_ID: 178787
Speaker 1: Now you went from Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] to--where was your first--did you go to Africa first or was it, was it--
Speaker 2: Well, the 99th went from Tuskegee to Selfridge Field in Michigan, where they got their transition training, and then finally over to North Africa, where they got their action somewhere in '43 [1943], late '43 [1943].  We were, my class went from Tuskegee to Selfridge Field for a couple of weeks and to Walterboro, South Carolina.  That's where we got most of our training, and then from there went o--went over to Naples [Italy] to then go to Foggia [Airfield Complex, Foggia, Italy], and then to go to Ramitelli [Airfield, Apulia, Italy], which was on the Adriatic side.  We used to take out, for our missions, we went right over the Adriatic Sea and then fly up into Germany.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the, your time, you know, the ta--the ta--I don't wanna call it expedition, but you know, the flight where you, you know, bombed--you--I mean, I'm saying it wrong (laughter).  I know the Red Tail, I know you're part of the Red Tails (laughter), but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--I mean how many would fly in a, you know, in a--
Speaker 2: Well, we--there were sixteen planes in each squadron.  And we were flying in groups of four, what we call flights, is that we--one that take off and be right back there.  And then when we got over the bombers, the sixteen planes here, sixty-four planes altogether (unclear) going up.  And we got up to twenty-five thousand feet, we would then break up and be assigned to different parts of the bomber flight.  It must have been three or four hundred bombers up there like birds flying.  And we would get a certain weather, and we would fly--they'll be four planes over here and four planes over here, and we cross over the bombers like that, protecting the bombers.  And that's the reason why we didn't lose 'em, 'cause we stayed close to the bombers, whereas some of the white pilots would leave the bombers to, to chase enemy fighters.
Speaker 1: And who was the mastermind behind this at this point, you know, the, the--in charge of this, you know, the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, Colonel Benjamin O. Davis was our commander when our tactics were basic Air Force tactics, and then each one of us who were squadron commanders or, or flight commanders would, you know, direct certain planes to go here and certain planes to go there.  I was the squadron from (unclear) and the leader on many of the missions.  They go okay, let's go.  We rendezvous, you take--Red Flight take this one; Dream Flight take that one.  And you just watch out, and then when the bomber is approaching target, then (unclear) the target, bombers go to through the flack, we go on the side, picked the bombers up.  Our guys would--bomber over there.  Let's go, keep it going.  Considering the fact we were twenty-one, twenty-two years old, it was just tremendous responsibility, but that's the way it is.  Wars--well, first of all, life expectancy at that time was about sixty-five, and somebody fifty was old, and somebody forty was about to be old.  So, therefore, when you were twenty-two years old flying an airplane, you're right in the peak of, peak of your life.
Speaker 1: And did you have any fear at all--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --with--none?
Speaker 2: No, wouldn't do it if you're scared.  You know, you have anxiety.  When the bullets come at you, you hope they don't hit you.  But you can't be scared, because you're scared, then you lose control.
Story_ID: 178788
Speaker 1: The mission that got you the notoriety, can you just describe what happen--
Speaker 2: The Berlin [Germany] mission that's--
Speaker 1: The Berlin mission, right.
Speaker 2: That's the longest mission of the Fifteenth [U.S.] Air Force, 1,600 miles roundtrip, from Southern Italy to Berlin and return.  And it was toward the end of the war, and we were given the assignment along with several other fighter groups of escorting the B-17s over, over Berlin.  And when we got close to Berlin, I was leading my squadron, and I saw some jet planes streaking up, which were about a hundred miles faster than ours.  And I said to my pilots who were with me to drop your extra fuel tanks so we can get maneuverability and follow me.  So I turned upside down and went down--the bombers were here--went down under the bombers with my pilots here.  The jets were coming in over here, and they made a hard right turn.  And I climbed up, and I got the jet just as he was about to shoot down the bomber plane.  The jet blew up, and he bailed out.  And my wingman faced a couple of other guys down, shot them down, and we shot down the first three jets over Berlin.  And that allowed us to win the Presidential Unit Citation.  That's, that's a highlight mission of the Tuskegee Airmen.  Tuskegee Airmen also had some other fabulous missions.  We're the only fighter group to blow up a Destroyer with fighter planes.  They were coming back from a mission, and they were flying I think B-20--B-47s.  And they shot at this Destroyer, and it so happened they hit the magazine, and the plane blew up, it blew it.  We also had great missions to Athens.  We liberated the Athens' air, airbase.  We probably shot up every, every airbase in Europe, in Southern Europe.  We had a tre--tremendous record.  We had one ace, Lee Archer, who's my best friend today.  He shot down five planes.  And Clarence Lester shot down three planes.  And Harry Stewart shot down three planes.  And we altogether shot down 111 planes.  We destroyed about 120 on the ground, and had this outstanding combat record of never having lost a bomber that we were escorting to enemy fighters.  That's really what we're known for.
Story_ID: 178789
Speaker 1: So you do this, you know, you are really sailing high.  Here are the Tuskegee [Air]men and you know, and you're a hero, right?  You're written up in the--
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, you don't think of yourself.  You did your job.  You, you're not really--you're, you're good, and you did what you had to do, but it's only now that people say you're a hero.  I'm, I'm a good guy.  I did what I had to do.
Speaker 1: But look at the, look at the article that, that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: --that talks about you.  That had to be--what, what newspaper was that in?
Speaker 2: That was the, the Afro [American Newspaper] or the--
Speaker 1: The Afro, but I'm get--
Speaker 2: --[Pittsburgh] Courier or something like that.
Speaker 1: But I'm sure your father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.] was just busting full of pride, right?
Speaker 2: He was.  But see, I come from a generation where you, if you have an opportunity, you're expected to be good.  You're expected to be good, and (laughter) you gotta shoot up there.  And you shoot here, you gotta shoot even higher.  So, my job, when I got back, I was pretty cocky and (unclear) damn good pilot.  I could've stayed in the [U.S. Army] Air Force and so on.  But my job was to go back and get--become a great coach, or become a great professor, or to become a great science, or become a great writer.  And I've sort of accomplished all of those things because that's where I was gonna go.  I was gonna be the first black professor.  I was gonna be this because that's what we were expected to do.  That's, those are the expectate--you might not always get exactly there, but you, you--so, what you did yesterday is what you did yesterday.  It's, it's a preparation for what you're gonna do tomorrow.  And that's, that's the worriation I have about some of these kids who get to be good in movies or whatever.  They act like they've really arrived.  Well, they have.  I had, but there's always something else you can do.  And not only that, you can have fun doing--everything I've done I have enjoyed.  My studies, my athletics, my running, my administration, whatever, I have enjoyed because it's, it's a challenge.  And you get the satisfaction that you have done something that is going to achieve a goal, is going to help people, and most of all, is gonna help people to know that black folks are really tops.  That, that's really part of it.  You just can't do that enough, and there are a few black folks who really do that.  There are some who have privilege and so on that don't do that, but there are some.  Arthur Ashe, he was like one of my, my men--mentees in a sense.  Arthur Ashe, he really did that.  Jackie Robinson, he really did that.  Some other people like [HM] Ossie Davis, [HM] Harry Belafonte, they really do that.  I mean you could just see it in their, in their soul, just comes out.  Some of the people now who make lots of big money, I'm very impressed with [HM] Danny Glover, for example.  Danny Glover has that same thing.  I interviewed Danny on my television program right in this very studio, and he, he had that.  But because of the way in which the white world and the black world treats music celebrities, etc., and television celebrities, sports celebrities, they get a disproportionate view of themselves and their role.  I mean it--true, you have to enjoy what you do; you have to have a talent.  But at the same time, you have a responsibility to, to the world at large, but particularly black folks.  You have a responsibility, and if you don't do that, you are falling short.
Speaker 1: But what you're saying, Dr. Brown, is that you did, but I mean you're talking about a commitment, a sense of, you know, importance higher than one's self, you know, that--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --that was what--and that that's really important for--
Speaker 2: That's Dunbar High School [Washington, D.C.]; that's Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts]; that's Howard University [Washington, D.C.]; that's my parents; that's the people that I knew who put that up there.  And my goal, and I think I've done it with my own children to put that up there.  Their goal is to put that up there.
Speaker 1: And, and that's what you're saying takes people for the long haul.
Speaker 2: That's right--
Story_ID: 178790
Speaker 1: But what I'm also saying is that you did have your minutes of fame when you returned, right?
Speaker 2: They were very short because my, my favorite story is that when I got back I was going to try to fly in the airlines before I went to graduate school.  And I went to Eastern Air Lines on 5th, 5th Avenue [New York, New York] and filled this application with all of my hours and so on.  And as I was going out the door, I had forgotten a New York Times I had brought with me.  I was looking at the want ads, and so I went back to get the Times, and the secretary, white secretary, was throwing the application in the waste basket.  And her face got red, and she said, "I'm sorry, we don't hire Negroes here."  So my--(unclear)--welcome back to the good old U.S.A.  So you can't get too high when, you know, the rest of the world--see, you can be high inside, but you realize the mountain you still have yet to climb.  And that's why I became active in the American Veterans Association [ph.], which was the, the liberal veterans organization.  I became active in politics, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], and the Henry Wallace campaign, and the, and the unions, because that's the way you bring about social change.  You, you can't bring about social change just by yourself.
Story_ID: 178791
Speaker 1: So you came back then and that's when you were hired as a social investi--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I took the job as a--
Speaker 1: So you didn't get the job at, at, at Eastern Air Lines.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you then took, you took the job with the city [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I applied because that was a job where college people could get a job.  I could, I could have taught on a temporary license, but I didn't want to do that.  And it was good.  I was helping people.  I was learning new skills.  I was working in an integrated situation.  My co-workers were white.  We bonded together.  Some of them were veterans and the, some of the women were impressed--that we worked on the Eastside.  And I worked with Vito Marcantonio, the congressman, in challenging the establishment and going to rallies and things like that because I knew it was temporary.  I was going to go back to college.  Because I got out of the service in October, November, I had to wait for another year.  So when I finished that, I was gonna go back, and I did.  That's when I left the job to go to Columbia [University, New York, New York].  And I was so insulted, the way I was treated at Columbia, I at that same period of time, I got a recommendation--not recommendation--an invitation to go to West Virginia State [College, later West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] to teach, which came from Springfield College.  So I went down there for a couple of years, and then from there I got a fellowship to come back to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] to work on my Ph.D.  And because of my chemistry background, I ended up being the principal research associate in a major research project.  And so I was teaching my fellow students while I was taking my degree, so--
Speaker 1: And what was the research project on?
Speaker 2: It was a project on the physical fitness of [U.S.] Air Force personnel.  And they, they were doing work on what they do now, sports medicine on a treadmill to find out what was the effect of extreme exercise on oxygen death, lactic acid accumulations, stuff they do now.  And I, I was one of, with that, I was one of the founders of the sports medicine movement.  My dissertation and the people I'm with, we were one of the first groups to do team dissertations.  Each one of us took the same--took one subject and somebody did the lactic acids, somebody did the blood pattern, somebody else did the, the oxygen recovery pattern, and somebody else did the lactic acid.  And out of this, my professors and folks like ourselves founded the American College of Sports Medicine.  My, one of my principal advisors was a physician at NYU.  And out of that we got that moving.  And I got my Ph.D., and then I had an offer to go to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] at twice the salary that I could have made at NYU.  But because I loved New York, my wife loved New York--(unclear)--and I wanted to break that barrier at NYU.  And my mentor, Dr. J. B. Nash, said well, we'll--"You stay here, it'll be a few years before we'll be able to match that, but you have the talent and I'll see to it that you, you move up."  So I turned down Morgan, and I went--kept teaching at NYU and did a lot of interesting things.
Story_ID: 178792
Speaker 1: Well, can we talk about your time at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] because you--it was--I know you started there in 1950, right?
Speaker 2: I started when I, when I graduated in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948], I'm sorry.  You started--you graduated--
Speaker 2: I got my master's in '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: While I was doing my master's I was also working on my Ph.D.  And I'd actually finished my work on my Ph.D. by 1950, but I had to finish writing.  And I got the PI--got my thesis approved in February of '51 [1951], which was the same day my twin sons were born.  And then I was already teaching at NYU part time.  And then after I got that, I got a full-time position, was an instructor, and then I got to be assistant professor, associate professor, full professor.
Speaker 1: That must have been a pretty glorious day that your sons were born.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: --that was, that's like double bonanza and--
Speaker 2: --that was it.
Speaker 1: --and you're, and you're--okay (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: I was kind of a legend down there because I was a top student and teacher, and I had the beautiful wife.  And they knew that I had these boys come in, and these boys came and you know, my students, you know, celebrated.  They collected money for the crib and so on, 'cause we were living in public housing at that time.
Speaker 1: Now you're--you got married in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943]--
Speaker 1: In 19--okay, that's-
Speaker 2: --while I was a senior.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, okay, okay, okay.  So your wife, while you were stationed, she was here.  She was--
Speaker 2: In New York [New York].
Speaker 1: She was in New York, okay.  And she, her name is Mort--
Speaker 2: Laura.
Speaker 1: Laura, right, right, 'cause there's that one picture of you and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, with her, with the inscription to her--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and that.  So, so you and whatever ni--well, 1949 I guess, well, before that, 40--'48 [1948], '48 [1948]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started at NYU in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Forty-eight [1948].  You start your association with NYU, and that went on for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, til '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 178793
Speaker 1: So, but I, I want you to tell me--the New York [New York] of that time, who are your, who are the people the African--you know, the other black people that are doing things in this city, 'cause that's still--this is, you know, way before the '60s [1960s].  And so I'm just wondering who, who are the, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, Adam [Clayton] Powell [Jr.] was the congressman.  And people like Judge [Hubert Thomas] Delaney, who were well known in the city of New York, Bill Robinson, entertainer, had a lot of publicity.  And Jackie [Robinson] started in, in '48 [1948], and Jackie was doing very well.
Speaker 1: Well, the people like Bill Hutchins, did you know--
Speaker 2: Bill Hutchins, he was just gettin' started.  And I was just thinking, education was John King.  The undertakers were always big in the city.  Political leaders were Huen [ph.] Jack, who became the--and oh, the fox, J. Raymond Jones.  I didn't know any of those folks 'cause basically I lived in Queens.  I went to school in the Village, and I had very little interaction with them.  I--(unclear)--(unclear)--my interaction with the political community didn't really begin till Percy Sutton ran for mayor 'cause Percy Sutton was a Tuskegee Airman.  He was our intelligence officer, and so we hooked up.  And Percy he was subway conductor while he was going to law school, so we hooked up.  And then I had friends from the military, Bill Wheeler, who's still here, and Rudy McCoy, who was in (unclear) Brownsville.  And those were my, my social friends.  And it wasn't until I started working with Percy and helping his campaign that I got to know people like [HM] Basil Paterson and Charlie Rangel [HM Charles Rangel].  And that was in the--
Speaker 1: That's in the six--
Speaker 2: --mid, mid-'60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Sixties [1960s], right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, mid-'60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So up to that point, now who--what is NYU as a university?  I mean can you tell me how large it was at that point and--
Speaker 2: At that time it was the largest university in the country.  It had about 50,000 students.  They--you had a large school of business, a large school of educate--school of education might have had 5,000 students itself.  It was the main producer of teachers before City University [of New York, New York, New York] got larger in the fifties [1950s] and so on.  And NYU had more black graduates than all the black colleges combined back in the late forties [1940s], early fifties [1950s] because the Southern colleges would not allow the teachers to go to graduate school, so they would pay for them to come to NYU and Columbia.  And NYU probably had more of them than Columbia because NYU was more open to ideas and concerns of blacks.  So, NYU was really a place, and I became a faculty leader.  I was chairman of the Faculty Welfare Committee key person, and the Faculty Council's key person on the senate, president of AUP [ph.] chapter.  So, I, I was a leader in, in the university.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: In any other contemporary time, I'd probably have been a candidate for president.  But at that time, this was, you know, '64 [1964], '65 [1965], you know, the world was different.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that when you even came on, were there other blacks on the faculty?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was Hale Woodruff, the famous artist--he's my buddy--and someone in the nursing department I think.  I think Arthur Davis and Jill Pamacarb [ph.] were, were professors in the liberal arts school.  I think Sam Pierce was a, was in the law school then.  Randy Chase was in the medical school.  There may have been fifteen--
Speaker 1: Now I'm asking in the 1950s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm talking about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's--okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there weren't many of us.  There may have been four or five.  And then the '60s [1960s], we began to get more and--but at that time, my career was really based on my expertise in measurement and statistics and exercise physiology, and I was a faculty leader, basically the only black, but I was a faculty leader.  So, that was a, that was the beginning of the integration kind of situation.
Story_ID: 178794
Speaker 1: When [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, we developed a protest movement.  By that time, there were about a hundred black students, and we all helped to organize that, and we protested.  And out of that we got a commitment for a thousand black students the next year.  And then for the development of the African American Institute, which I founded, and that just changed the whole world.  At one time I was a professor there and head of the institute we had eighty-five black faculty.  You know, you that's out of a faculty of about 2,000, 3,000.  But still--or was it 2,000?  It was a large number.  And NYU [New York University, New York, New York] changed.  Then, of course, it became an upscale university with, with more money and more buildings on campus, etc.
Speaker 2: So you're saying--did that really happened, that it--it didn't go from a hundred to a thousand.  You just--
Speaker 1: Yes, it did.
Speaker 2: In one--not one year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Remember, things were--
Speaker 2: I know things opened up.
Speaker 1: Things were so, we, we got this commitment that we were gonna, gonna increase the number from, was a hundred, a hundred and fifty, whatever, to a thousand, and we did it.  We, we (unclear)--every school, the (unclear) school, the graduate school, the education school, the liberal arts school; we had a special program for kids who, you know, had academic problems, etc.  We recruited a lot of people.
Speaker 2: So where were you--talk about who was involved in those recruitment efforts, I mean what organizations and things that were important.
Speaker 1: Well, basically it was the university [New York University, New York, New York].  And we let the word out, and we had a network out in the black community, went to the high schools, and we got them to recommend people.  We went right to the high schools.  That's exactly the way we did it.  And we had a screening committee, and we had a good financial aid package.
Speaker 2: And this is, you know, part of--I mean just in historical context is part of the whole great--I mean the great society--I mean--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, it's not.
Speaker 1: This is part of the Martin Luther King--
Speaker 2: Oh, this is even--
Speaker 1: --civil rights--
Speaker 2: --before, okay.
Speaker 1: No, this was after.  This was from '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, right--
Speaker 1: This is, it's the revolution.
Speaker 2: --this is '68 [1968].  I don't know why I'm con--but this, this is all part of--this is Kennedy, John--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we see--remember, at one time, maybe there might have been--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: No, fifty black students at NYU.  And the result of the open enrollment--not the open enrollment--the great society--
Speaker 2: Right great--
Speaker 1: --we moved up to may- I said a hundred.  It maybe have been 200.  We got that, and then we were moving; see, we were moving.  And so when we--King got assassinated, they wanted to keep the black students quiet, so they president asked me what can we do?  Said well, set a target of bringing in a thousand black students.  And he got up the money, and we, you know, we may have taken a year or so, but we did it.
Speaker 2: That's pretty amazing.  And was that around the time that the Institute of Afro-American Studies was created?
Speaker 1: That was one of the demands--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The non-negotiable demands (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so did you have, did you have takeovers of buildings and things around that time, or everything--
Speaker 1: Well, they--but we--
Speaker 2: --the university didn't--
Speaker 1: --threatened it.
Speaker 2: --have--
Speaker 1: We--
Speaker 2: --they didn't have--they didn't do it.
Speaker 1: We threatened it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was the negotiation strategy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so what, what were you using as a guide for the institute at that point, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Me.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Dr. Brown (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Basically, see, I'm a, I'm a, I--by that time, I was a full professor.  I had been the key person in the Senate.  I was involved in curriculum development, and I had already started a television program on "Black Letters."  And the point is that this is what we want.  We want to explore the depth of the black experience.  You read the, the document, the depths of the black experience in all elements.  We want courses on all departments.  And my idea was rather than have a separate where all the black courses were in the one place, we'd be an institute and we would permeate--that was our success.  'Cause many of the schools that the Africana program, which is okay now, they, they just disappeared because, you know, it was black a lot.  But we, we felt we had proof and we--I, I recruited Ralph Ellison to be a distinguished professor, we called a sweitzer [ph.] professor.  He wasn't there just to teach blacks 'cause that's not the way Ralph was, but he was there.  And we had Hale Woodruff in art.  We got people in politics, and in social studies, and in mathematics, and in biology.  And the idea was to have courses which related to the black experience, but--(unclear)--(unclear)--department, politics of the urban community, psychology of African American, African American youth, psychology of African Americans, African American literature.  So you got a core, and, and the students would take a degree in that major.  And we had a concentration, but we didn't have a major, and we got some criticism for that.  But actually it obviously worked out better because that's the way most schools are now.
Story_ID: 178795
Speaker 1: And, and I, well, I can ask a question but I'd be answering it.  It worked out better because you integrated it within the whole, the overall curriculum.
Speaker 2: That's my opinion.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And because we avoided the resistance.  There was a tremendous amount of resistance, and we got broader talent.  So we got people on tenure lines in departments.  The problem is we were so successful--(unclear)--name people, other colleges came and graded us.  So now there are fewer black professors at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] than there were when I was there by a long shot because they've all been raided.
Speaker 1: Now, David Levering Lewis, he just joined though.  I think he joined--
Speaker 2: He just joined--
Speaker 1: Columbia [University, New York, New York], Columbia or NYU.  He--
Speaker 2: NYU.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, you have another younger black scholar here that is--
Speaker 2: Robin [D.G.] Kelly, right.
Speaker 1: Robin Kelly.
Speaker 2: But he's left to go to Columbia.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But this is light years.  I've been away from NYU for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, that's true.
Speaker 2: --twenty-seven--
Speaker 1: That's so sorry, okay.  No, I didn't mean that.
Speaker 2: --twenty-six years.
Speaker 1: No, I know it's--that's true it has been twenty-something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty-six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178796
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Could I just say, say out loud?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  There's this--I was just trying to understand something you said about the black colleges [HBCUs].  You had more black graduates than NYU [New York University, New York, New York] in the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: More black alumni, right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  And more, more black alumni than the black colleges?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Combined?
Speaker 1: Yeah. (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  And that was--so that was like a critical number, right?
Speaker 2: Right because remember, the black colleges, there were only about a hundred of them, and maybe, maybe they might have 2 or 3,000 graduates.  We were graduating five hundred and a thousand and five hundred and seven hundred people who came the summer to get their master's degrees.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  In the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In the fif--well, this is collective, not just one year, but collectively.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  I just wondered.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  That was a--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because the black colleges--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  --at this time--
Speaker 1: --were really very small.  You know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there are only about a hundred of them.
Speaker 2: Plus they never wanted anyone--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --to go on to--I mean they had no place to go for graduate school--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause all the pla--all the places around the country were paying for them not to go to those schools.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  (Unclear)--'cause I just read about a woman whose moth--Billy Avery's mother went to NYU in the summers to do like a degree in, in, in nursing or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, nursing, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  And I was curious.  I said wow, she went to NYU.  Now I--
Speaker 2: Big nursing program.  That's right--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Now I understand.
Speaker 2: --one of the biggest, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Yeah, now I understand.
Story_ID: 178797
Speaker 1: Now, okay, so let me ask you the--so you're doing this, the TV program is 'Black--
Speaker 2: Letters.
Speaker 1: --Letters,' okay.  And your whole--and yet it's bay--was it--where was--was that with W--
Speaker 2: CBS.
Speaker 1: Oh, that was with CBS, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: It was early in the morning.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the sit--essentially, the cities are sort of burning.  People are scared, right, after [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  So, broadcasting is opening up.  But how did that--how did you--did they come to you or you went to them?  How did that happen?
Speaker 2: A combination.  We created an idea.  And they wanted us, and we had a media person to work with them.  I'd already done 'Sunrise Semester,' some instructional TV, so this was a natural segue.
Speaker 1: And the other thing I wanna know is just your--the specially, your view about education and how it was supposed, you know, work and you're work and curriculum, what were you--what were your findings in terms of, you know, the assessment work you were doing and curriculum development?
Speaker 2: Well, they're really two--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --different parts.
Speaker 1: I know, right.
Speaker 2: The, the assessment is sort of normative work, where do you stand in relation to other people?  And curriculum development is, what are the objectives of trying to get a full-fledged curriculum?  And I, I was particularly interested.  I helped to develop a New York State proficiency examination and black culture and black history.  I helped to develop a curriculum for that.  And, and, and basically there we were trying to get a parallel track, what was happening in so-called standard history?  What was happening in African American history, so we could then gradually infuse African American history into the standard history.
Speaker 1: Okay, but at the, at the same time that you're doing this, there are other people that are, you know, "I'm black and I'm proud," and are taking a looser--what do I wanna say--a looser, a view of, you know, maybe the scholarship within black history is what I'm saying.  Am I say--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, basically it was political.  A lot of the early African American studies were really, understandably, but politically-oriented in sometimes oversimplified the historical fact or the political reality.  And the scholarship was, was thin in some instances, many a folks didn't know or have access to [W.E.B] Du Bois and what's the name?
Speaker 1: Which, which one, cha, cha--not cha--
Speaker 2: Du Bois, [Paul] Robeson, and many of the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the, the established like Benjamin Quarrels and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --[HM] John Hope Franklin and people like--
Speaker 1: John--okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, what we were able to do is to begin to get them to focus on those issues and then we, because there's been a lot of black scholarship, the publishers helped us by going back and digging up older black documents and publish them and making the available in series and the like.
Speaker 1: And that work happened in the '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: That happened in the '70s [1970s] mainly.
Speaker 1: In the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you find--at that point in time in the '70s [1970s], are you finding much resistance to this, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in terms of mainstream--
Speaker 2: --it's a two-way.  In the black community there was a lot of real acceptance and desire for it.  In the white academic community, some places there some resistance, some places there was a lot of resistance, and some places there was, I won't say support, but a kind of, well, let's see what you can produce kind of thing.  And a lot of his personality, I mean if somebody like myself had been a professor, by the time this came on, I'd already been a professor for--in '69 [1969] I'd been a professor for 18 years.  And I had a status in the university which caused people to listen to me, not just about black curriculum, about any curriculum, about any kind of thing.  So, I was able to build on--a number of white colleagues had the same feelings.  And the president, Jim Hester, was very supportive.  You know, that gives you the climate, whereas in some other institutions there were really not even one or two black professors who had infused a--the system.  Not many presidents who were right there.
Story_ID: 178798
Speaker 1: Well, what transpired, being at the African American Institute, Institute of African American Affairs [New York University, New York, New York], I became quite active in citywide and regional and even national black affairs.  I helped to organize New York State Black Conference with some of the organization of black scholars.  And through that, I became known to some of the black political leaders.  And I was involved in helping to form the City University [of New York, New York, New York]'s SEEK [Search for Education, Elevation, and Knowledge] Program, even though I was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and helping the City University to expand, which was done through political pressure to create new colleges.  In 1970, I was offered--'69 [1969]--the presidency of Medgar Evers when it was founded, and I turned that down because I wanted to stay at the university and found the institute.  And then I kept interacting with the chancellors and so on to put pressure to make sure blacks had fair opportunities and expanded programs.  And when the presidency of Bronx Community College became available, when the first black president in the whole state, James Colston, retired, they said they're trouble getting another black president, and they were gonna bring in the white president.  And one of my political contacts said well, look, would you take this if you are nominated?  And I said I'll think about it.  So I went to the college, and I talked to some of the faculty and students--faculty, mostly whites (unclear) mostly black and brown.  And they had seen the university had gone through a budget crisis where they cut the budget, and they had to fire a third of the faculty.  And I saw this is a challenge.  And I told the president: you, you make me a vice chancellor over all of the student activity programs or else I would think about taking this job at City University.  And they considered it.  And there were some political things where they felt they couldn't do it, so I said well, I'll take the challenge.  I took a pay cut actually to take the job at Bronx.  But it gave me a chance to use my administrative skills and political skills.  I put the faculty on notice.  I expected them to teach the students, to respect students.  I reorganized the structure of the school from departmental fiefdoms to divisions.  I put them on a managed by--management by objectives framework.  I developed a grant program where, by the time I'd been there five, six years, we were raising more money in grants than any community college in the country, using my skill with grants and political things.  I helped to get money to renovate the, this Hall of Fame of Great American, which is First Hall of Fame, and developed about ten new programs in areas ranging from aviation technology to multimedia technology.  And as concurrent with that, I became a sort of a political figure because I was a major supporter of black political candidates, using both my presence, my radio program.  I worked with [HM the Honorable Charles] Rangel, and [HM the Honorable David] Dinkins, and Patterson, and Sutton.  And I was delegate for one of the leaders of [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson for President campaign in '84 [1984].  I was an elected delegate in '84 [1984] to Jackson, to the Democratic National Convention.  I was an appointed delegate in '88 [1988], and I was the key black fundraiser for Dave Dinkins in 1990.  And then when about '92' [1992], '93' [1993] came on, a new chancellor came, started puttin' some heat on me.  And I said well, I'm going to step down as president and move on to the next level, which is here to the graduate center, where I founded the Center for Urban Education policy and raised money.  And I've been involved for the past eight, ten years of influencing public policy related to urban education, particularly here in New York and New York State.  I'd been on the Technical Advisory Committee for the New Jersey State Assessment Program, the Graduation Test Program for the past 50 years.  I'm on the Advisory Committee for the New York State Testing Program, the Regents Exam, and head of a group called the Friends of CUNY, which is a major advocate group to get money for CUNY.  I was instrumental in moving that budget ahead.  I'm co-chair of the New York State Public Higher Education Conference with [HM H.] Carl McCall to help promote the support for public higher education.  And I still continue to do my television program, 'African-American Legends,' which I'm into my tenth year, and a few other things.

Speaker 1: Sir, let me ask you just a little bit, because the whole area of community colleges, that history goes back how far?
Speaker 2: Well, the community colleges really started around in the mid-'50s [1950s] at a time when there was a, a demand for increased public higher education that was supported by the state system.  California had a community college system back going on to the '30s [1930s] supported by state monies.  But in the '50s [1950s], the community college movement began to grow because the four-year colleges were reaching their--
Speaker 1: Capacity.
Speaker 2: --their enrollment caps, but that's not everybody wanted a four-year degree.  And the community colleges were really built around business, and technical, and medical, and paramedical programs.  And today, as you know, over 50 percent of all college students attend the community colleges.  And with the fact that they get technical training where they can go right into the job market, at least 25 or 30 percent of them transferred to the four-year college, which was the cauli--California model.  Community colleges are real leaders in computer technology, health technology, media technology, engineering technology for people who do any basic engineering work, computer system design.  And this is where we developed our programs.  We developed new programs in every single one of those areas.  And you, you get, you get state funding, you get city funding, and students have to pay tuition a little bit too much, but they have to pay some tuition, and it is an avenue.  And then, of course, students don't have to graduate if they--they should.  But they would come, they get their technical training, they get a job.  It's a, it's, it's an open door to higher education.  And what's happening with some of the state universities and the private universities, they raise the standards so high and the cost so high that either you get a scholarship or you come from a, a social class where you can afford it.  Whereas, the community colleges are, are and should be affordable for everybody.  And now many middle-class people are going to like Nassau Community College [Garden City, New York] or Queensborough Community College [Queens, New York, New York] to get their two years because it's cheaper.  They get the same quality.  In the City University you have the same requirements to be a professor at the community.  You get a Ph.D. and experience as you do at a four-year college.  So the quality level is high.  The students are definitely required more support services, but that's part of the challenge of being in this business.  And I can tell you the number of people who started in the remedial work who at Bronx Community College [Bronx, New York, New York] ended up being lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists, etc.  It may take 'em a little longer, but it isn't, it isn't the final analysis.  Another three years against four years doesn't make a, a bit of difference.  Community college is where--and you could be more creative there.  A good community college president can be very--and you don't have to depend on a good football team to get you money.  You just count on a good program, really exciting.
Story_ID: 178800
Speaker 1: Now what do you--when you look at, you know, the higher ed--higher education in this country, where do you see the trends going, sort of?  I mean you definitely see a growth in the community college, but where do you see the trends?
Speaker 2: That's interesting because we've gotten away from a standardized curriculum, the original freshman curriculum.  People are more specialized, and, and this ranges from art and music to politics, whatever.  Also it's a gap between the haves and the have-nots.  The most prestigious institutions have people with higher levels of income.  And I think that really is a challenge to higher education, to what we say in Friends of CUNY, access and excellence, to maintain the access, don't set up arbitrary barriers to keep people from moving ahead.  Give them some time to move ahead, at the same time, have high-quality standards for exit from high education.  Even in the four-year colleges, the average graduation rate is somewhere around the, the sixties [percentage-wise].  So it's only a few places like the Harvards of the world that graduated in the nineties [percentage-wise], and basically they're precursors for graduate and professional education.  The state universities have a wide range.  And higher education really does need to continue to be open.  We have some problems in higher education.  For example, over-emphasis in athletics is a tremendous negative because too much energy is spent in that.  There's this recent study even in the Ivy Leagues that they say that the athletes come in and don't measure up to their predicted success because they are not pushed.  They don't push themselves.  So, we've got a, got some challenges, and I think the major challenge for higher education is diversity and opportunity, diversity and opportunity, and that's at the faculty level, the administrative level, the student level.
Speaker 1: But you know, you sit here today seeing things sort of regressing in many ways.
Speaker 2: Seeing what?
Speaker 1: Regret--re--you know, a regression--
Speaker 2: In what?
Speaker 1: --in terms of some diversity, you know, efforts of rolling back the clock.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, in terms of the--
Speaker 1: That's what--
Speaker 2: --anti-affirmative action movement, you're right.  But in terms of public higher education, it's still diverse.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A lot of it comes through the community colleges, the state colleges, the city colleges.  The basic affirmative action thing has been about the elites.  And the elites, as you know, have been falsely elite, legacies, and so on, and that needs to be challenged and will continue to be challenged.  And the question now, are they darting around and how do you include race?  And now they say we have a 19 variable phenomenon criteria, and we look at the whole person, you now.  But eventually somebody like me is gonna say well, look, I want 20 percent of my students to be people of color.  I don't give a damn how you get 'em, because I know they can do it.  That's (unclear)--we definitely know they can do it.
Story_ID: 178801
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Brown, what are you wanting to do, you know, that you haven't done yet in the field of, you know, just in the field of education?  What are things that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm wanna improve in assessment.  I wanna make assessment more than just multiple choice type of questions and you know, portfolio assessment, looking to body of work.  That's something that really needs to e done.  I wanna improve the quality of teaching, improving teaching so they have a variety of strategies.  And at the other end, we have to figure out how to deal with disruptive kids and kids who are not tuned into high education or to education.  And that means we need the new, different teaching techniques.  Everybody is teachable.  In fact, that they learn how to do drugs and crime is something that they learn.  They weren't born that way.  So, having said that, we need to go into our inner city schools and figure out ways of reaching them and different, different approaches.  We--and it isn't a question of the color of teacher; it's a question of the approach of the teacher.  And we also need to get the parents more involved, but that's a community; it's a total community.
Speaker 1: So where do you think we lost it then?  You know--
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: --where do we--you know, where did we lose it?  Because, you know, I--
Speaker 2: We never had it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, no, that's not true.  Your description of your upbringing was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, what--
Speaker 1: --very civil--
Speaker 2: --what, what I'm--
Speaker 1: --very civil--
Speaker 2: What I'm--I didn't say that well.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: The underclass has always had inferior education; they've had antisocial behaviors; and they've been pushed out of the system.  And because the economy would accommodate people who would work without intellectual skills, we didn't notice that.  But class differentiation and unsatisfactory behaviors have always existed, but we pushed them out.  Now, as you know, we're concerned about push-outs, wanna keep them in, so that makes a challenge more real.  That's a great challenge, and it's something that young people have to be involved in, as well as older people, particularly young people.  They really have to be involved in this.  I work with a lot of young teachers, and it's difficult because the expectations on those teachers are very high.  In the old days where you could grab a kid by their arm and say look, you sit down, those are gone.  You've got to really be able to deal with kids in here and groups of kids in the community.  I really do believe that community-based organizations, afterschool programs, nutrition programs, cultural programs, all of those things have to be part of the mix of getting the lower income populations focused on achievement and education.
Story_ID: 178802
Speaker 1: And politically, you know, you, you were very active in, you know, the, the election of, of the first, well, the, the bureau president, black bureau president, very active in the election of, you know, the first black mayor of, of New York [HM David Dinkins], and you know, and also you said [HM] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson's, you know, presidential campaign.  And I'm wondering, you know, given that, really, almost thirty-year history, you know, of, of political activity what your view of on--you know, are we making gains?  Are we not?  You know, are we--have we sort of stood still?  In Chicago [Illinois] we say we'll never see another black mayor again.
Speaker 2: Well, the question is you don't necessarily have to have a black mayor; you just need to have a mayor who has our agenda.  And we're working for coalition politics.  Coalition politics are there, and the question, who do you coalesce with and how?  And that, that takes a lot of interaction, a lot of efforts.  And sometimes you have to (unclear) a black, sometimes you support a black, sometimes you (unclear), some have to support him.  But we, we've got to see a picture of, of a political structure that helps a range of people, and we gotta oppose tax cuts, for example, and a few other things.
Story_ID: 178803
Speaker 1: You know, you've been a prolific writer.  You've been a significant writer, and I'm just wondering which of your publications you're most proud of.
Speaker 2: Well, from a scientific point of view, I'm most proud of--
Speaker 1: Is it the, the--
Speaker 2: --with Kenyan and on a scientific basis of--
Speaker 1: Class--
Speaker 2: --physical activities--
Speaker 1: --classical studies on physical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that--
Speaker 1: --activities.
Speaker 2: --is a classic in the field, because it's a compendium with an analysis of the history of sports medicine really.  And the other is the Negro Almanac, which was the first all comprehensive fact book about blacks in America.  And the third is the book I'm gonna write about me (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.
Speaker 2: --on--
Speaker 1: See, that's good, and we're gonna get (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We're gonna make that seriously.  You know, time is--never mind.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No, you're in good health.  But the Negro Almanac, can you just tell me how that came about?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my former students and one of his colleagues had been teaching in the schools, very interested in pulling black material together.  And we came up with the idea of getting all of these original documents and materials about black history and putting it in one place, and that became the Negro Almanac.  It had--it was a comprehensive fact book of blacks in America, black history, and sports, and politics with the pictures.  It, it, it was the first of its kind.  They probably, I guess--see, the problem is there's so much more known about blacks now than then, it's almost--[HM Henry Louis] Gates tried to put something together, which is really deficient.  It's not as good as what we did because he tried to accomplish too much, and he left--by doing that, see, you raise expectation.  You left out too much.  And I think the Tuskegee Airmen got three lines, but it was a ch--it was a beginning of something.
Story_ID: 178804
Speaker 1: And then the Black Culture Quiz that I did, we did five hundred thousand copies all the way and got people interested in black history--
Speaker 2: But can you talk about that, how even that came about?  Was that sort of an outgrowth of the Negro Almanac, or that was its--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --own--
Speaker 1: I was at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], and I don't know, one of the companies wanted to do something that got people interested in black history.  And they came up with the idea of the Black Culture Quiz and the--we had a little game and we did a few other little things.  And we got the book out together, and then people began to get in it and so on.  Because see, the, unfortunately, the level of awareness about black history now is any bet--greater upon the masses than it was then, but at least then it was unique.  And the--I don't know if you've seen it.  I don't even know where, where my copies are now.  But it was a very, very penetrating piece of work, and we'd give lectures, and we'd play games and so on.  But people are not as interested in black history, per se, now because they're more concerned with our, with our political advancement, and they don't see the historical framework for it.  And it's understandable because we had all these promises from [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  Everybody, the world's gonna be better for black folks, and the world is not any better for the majority of black folks.  For many black folks it's worse.  So, it's, it's, it's a kind of an intellectual luxury to learn all of this as--remember, we were dealing with isolated facts, not themes.  See, that's the thing about a quiz, it leads with isolated facts; that's bad testing.  But it's interesting.  It's an attention getting device, but now we need to deal with seams.  And that's why the tremendous number of black writers, you know, E. Lynn Harris and all those people, [HM] Terry McMillan and [HM] Bebe [Moore] Campbell and so on who are writing.  Now we got this, so you don't really need to go back to that kind of history.  You, you develop it.
Speaker 2: There's so little--I totally di--okay (laughter) (unclear)--but I disagree with that.  I can't believe you're saying that, given your background.
Speaker 1: Well, the--
Speaker 2: But maybe you've given--that's--okay, well, never--we won't--
Speaker 1: Well, what, what I mean was that what, what does it mean to know that--what's his name?
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: --Fleetwood Walker was the first Major League Baseball player.  Without knowing the context--you don't even know that yourself (laughter).
Speaker 2: I did not know that (laughter).
Speaker 1: In, in the, in the 1880s--
Speaker 2: I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: --blacks played Major League Baseball--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and were discriminated because the star white player, Cap Anson, was prejudiced.  That's--
Speaker 2: But you're asking me--
Speaker 1: --that's whatever--what does it, what does it mean just to know that fact, that Fleetwood Walker was the first Major League Baseball player without developing the context?
Speaker 2: Because you may have thought that Jackie Robinson was the first one.
Speaker 1: Well, but that's a fact.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--Jackie Robinson is a context (laughter).  He's a--
Speaker 2: But Jackie Robinson--
Speaker 1: --he's a context.
Speaker 2: But is a context in today's world?  Okay, well, we won't get--
Speaker 1: It is a context.  It is a--that my--that's my exact point, that the isolated historical facts without a context means nothing.
Speaker 2: So that's where--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --you see the next move?
Speaker 1: That's where we've got to develop, but that's what we're trying to do.  I've, I've written on the, I've written a book on blacks in sports.  It's about context.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: See, context is the--everything you do is context.  And you know, it might sound a little academic.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the fact is whatever we do is placed in a, a context.  Kobe Bryant getting caught with that woman is in a context.  Well, the context isn't about Kobe Bryant having sex with that woman [Katelyn Faber].  It's about a black man and white women.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's the fact that nobody talks about (laughter).  That's the context, which then goes back to slavery for the cherished one looking, you know.  Got it?  So, that's why I'm a, I'm a head of the curve on a lot of these things, but you--and not in a controversial way, but helping people to think through.  So the quiz was nice at its time, but we need to go beyond that.  I, I used to run it in the black newspapers every week, but we gotta go beyond that.
Speaker 2: I understand.
Speaker 1: Okay?
Speaker 2: Okay, I, I--
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: --understand, okay, point, point well made.
Story_ID: 178805
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look at the African American community, what hopes and con--and concerns do you have for that community?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the hope I have is that we will be more, more central to the focus of this country, that we will be considered to be just a, a part of the social and economic stream.  We won't be special.  We won't be, be isolated.  We won't be caught in the intellectual or social ghetto, that we will be part of the, of the gorgeous mosaic of this country that's gonna be 50 percent people of color.  And we will be good parts of that, whether it be from Latin America, or Africa, or whatever, and we'll have that.  We'll have skills.  We will understand both our culture and other cultures, that we will have leadership, that we will not have this artificial ceiling that we have.  But in order to do that, we need to keep pressing the system, and at the same time we need to understand ourselves, that we are not helpless, that we do have skills, and we can come together, and that some of the behaviors that we indulge in are self-defeating behaviors.  That's that optimism we were talking about.  Don't get mad, get even, okay.
Story_ID: 178806
Speaker 1: With that and looking in the context of your own life, 'cause I, I keep thinking about what a civil--you know, your background is, was the ultimate of civility--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in a world that is losing that, I think--you--would you agree?
Speaker 2: I won't say the world, some people are losing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--Michigan.  It can't be a generalization like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, where there is a loss of some of that, okay.  And I'm wondering, when you look back over the, you know, as you are, you know, even writing your own story, what were the, the critical things you think, the building blocks, [cough]--excuse me--Dr. Brown, that were important for your, you know, your success as a person in American society?
Speaker 2: Family structure, and teachers, role models.  Basically that's it.
Story_ID: 178807
Speaker 1: And [HM] Dr. [Roscoe C.] Brown, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Oh, keep trying to change things.  Don't get mad, get even (laughter).
Story_ID: 178808
Speaker 1: And what do you wanna be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Doing a lot of things.
Speaker 1: All the things that you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They did this story on me in one of the newspapers about my five careers.  So, basically, I wanna spread that, this opportunity.  You can use whatever you have, and you, you have a, both a responsibility and a, and a joy in doing this.  This is--you need those challenges.

Speaker 1: At my home at 1121 Gerard Street, and I think I have on my schoolboy patrol belt.  And this was probably when I was in the fifth grade, fifth, sixth grade, thereabouts, in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: That's Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts] in front of the Lakeview Hut where I was at camp on the right side, and that's my friend Eugene [ph.] on the other side.
Speaker 1: Does Eugene have a last name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, no problem.  Do you know what year approximately?
Speaker 2: That was probably 1935, 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Atwater is spelled A-T-W-A-T-E-R.
Speaker 2: A-T-W-A-T-E-R--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Why were you in the Boston Hut?
Speaker 2: That's the name of the hut.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Oh, okay, I thought maybe it was in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: I thought that's what you talked about-- No.
Speaker 1: --the different huts; I thought they were, 'cause you said--
Speaker 2: They had names.
Speaker 1: Right but I thought that everyone grouped from different communities.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, one was Goodwill Hut, one was Lakeview--that's my sister on the steps at Gerard Street.  She was probably about sixth grade at that time.
Speaker 1: Give your sister's name.
Speaker 2: Portia, that's my sister Portia.
Speaker 1: P-O-R-T-I-A.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that's [HM] Roscoe Brown, Tuskegee Airman, in front of number seven.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Real heroic shot.
Speaker 1: Isn't that nice?  And it says it's inscribed to my darling Laura--
Speaker 2: Laura, right.
Speaker 1: --from your Roscoe.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Interesting; they have a similar photo that was taken last month.  I'll have to give that to you. It's in the newspaper, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was that out of your archives or out of another?
Speaker 1: No, it just came in the newspaper last week.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's the Vostic [ph.] Club at Springfield College [Springfield, Massachusetts].  And I can see there's one person of color in there.  His name is Roscoe Brown.  He's in the second row, second from the left.  Here it is.
Speaker 2: That's Roscoe Brown, lacrosse player.  It's a reunion, but I was playing lacrosse in 1942.
Speaker 1: This is at Dover Airbase Naval Air Museum.  They restored a P-51 in the colors of my plane.  And that's the one that was at Rockefeller Center advertising the--celebrating the centennial flight back this past July 29th.  That was taken in 1996.
Speaker 2: That's Roscoe Brown as president of Bronx Community College [New York, New York], taken probably in 1990 or something like that.
Speaker 1: That's a story in the, in the Norfolk Journal and Guide of--describing my shooting down the jet plane.
Speaker 2: And that's on March 31st of 1945.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's where you were emphasizing even--it says son of Dr. Brown (laughter), even though you're a war hero.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a picture of my flying P-51 number seven over the Alps in 1945.  That picture appeared in National Geographic.  And the next one is an enlargement of that picture over the Alps, Red Tail Number Seven, the most famous P-51 in history.  It's in all the P-51 exhibits, largely because of the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: That's on the occasion of my father's retirement from the Public Health Service in 1954.  That's my sister on the left and my mother on the right.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know who else is--can you go--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  They're, they're officials in the Public Health Service.
Speaker 1: Okay, but your sisters, Portia--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Portia and my mother is Vivian [Kemp Brown].
Speaker 1: Vivian, who's here.
Speaker 2: Right there.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: I don't know who that gentleman is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's your father [Roscoe Brown, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: That's my dad.  Do you see what I meant about the color (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I do.
Speaker 2: That's a painting done by an artist, Roy LaGrone, who's a friend of mine.  It's a popular painting that's distributed all over the country, me sitting in the cockpit of my plane.
Speaker 1: This is Captain Roscoe Brown with my mother and sister in Cambridge, Massachusetts when I came back from the service when my sister was going to Radcliffe College [Cambridge, Massachusetts] at that time.  And blacks didn't live on the campus, so my, my dad got an apartment for her, my mother and my sister.
Speaker 2: So she, she went to--how many were at, at, at Radcliffe?  Was it at the number two at that point?
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: That's Roscoe Brown, Tuskegee Airman, in Italy beside my plane in 1945.
Speaker 1: That's Roscoe Brown and--with his crew chief, Wendell Smith, in 1945 in the cockpit.  That's a widely used photo all over the, all over the world.  That was--I think that photo was sports, Sports Illustrated during the (unclear)-- Okay, this is what you were describing--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's an artist's portrayal of my shooting down the first German jet over Berlin [Germany], May--March 24th, 1945.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  So you knocked out the jets before they hit any of the bombers?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  That's amazing.
Speaker 1: That is amazing.  That's what you described, that's--
Speaker 2: That's the Journal and Gride--Guide [Journal and Guide] story talking about our shooting down the jets over Berlin, where we won the Presidential Unit Citation.
Speaker 1: And wait, and that is--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh, this is March 31st, 1945, paper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the same paper.  They, they did their separate (unclear) story on me, as well as the one on the group where we all shot down their planes.
Speaker 1: This is a portrait of Dr. Roscoe C. Brown, Sr., probably taken somewhere in the 1940s I guess.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Those are some interesting spectacles.
Speaker 1: That's my--yeah, at that time, he, he had the, he had (unclear) the, he had this chemical accident, and it took out the socket of his eye, so he wore that clouded socket to, to protect that.  And you know, they're really cool glasses now.  People'll wear it.  Yeah, that's what dad did.
Speaker 2: So in this picture, it's what--'cause these are different glasses.
Speaker 1: Let me, let me see.  He probably was, he probably had gotten to the point where it--
Speaker 2: He didn't matter?
Speaker 1: --it, it, it--well, I think it healed up some.  It closed up some.
