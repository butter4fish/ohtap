Nancy L. Buc: This is an oral history of Karen Newman, being conducted by Nancy Buc for the
Lamphere project that the Pembroke Center for Teaching and Research on Women is putting on as part of
Brown’s two-hundred fiftieth celebration. Karen, I’d like to start by your introducing yourself and a little
bit of your history at Brown.
Karen Newman: Well, I came to Brown in 1978 in the Department of Comparative Literature. I was
promoted in 1984. When I arrived at Brown I was the only woman in my department. We also had a rule
that the youngest person took the notes, so I was the secretary of the department. Rosalie Colie had been a
part of the department, but she had died not long before I came. When I was promoted, I then had a joint
appointment with English. And I spent most of my career at Brown, though I did move briefly to NYU
for about five years several years ago, where I taught in the department of English. At Brown I have been
chair of my department, I was director of the Pembroke Center for about five years, I think. And also
Dean of the Graduate School during Ruth Simmons’ and Bob Zimmer’s tenure at Brown.
Buc: And you hold a chair at this point?
Newman: I do, I hold the Owen Walker, Class of ‘33 Chair in the Humanities.
Buc: In the humanities, so it’s broader than, quote, “just Comp Lit.”
Newman: [Laughter] —just Comp Lit, right. It’s a chair that would go to anyone in the humanities, and
isn’t linked to our department. Where some are, but—
Buc: Okay. I’d like you to go back to your coming to Brown. You got your Ph.D. from Berkeley in—?
Newman: 1978, so this was my first job.
Buc: What was the hiring process like? And were you aware of the fact that the Consent Decree in the
Lamphere case had been entered in the fall of 1977 and became final probably right around the time you
were getting your offer?
Newman: No. I have to confess I didn’t have any idea. I must have received the infamous postcard—
Buc: No, because that didn’t come until after the decree.
Newman: Ah, well no I was not aware.
1

Buc: Okay, so were you hired through the standard process? A meeting at the MLA? How did you apply?
Newman: I applied because the job was advertised in the Modern Language Association job list, which
was, and is the typical way for people in my field to find jobs that are advertised nationally. I applied in
the standard way. I sent my curriculum vitae, I heard—I sent materials from my dissertation to be read,
which is also standard practice. I was then called to participate in an interview at the Modern Language
Association meetings, which that year were in Chicago. And since I was coming from Berkeley, I had
only a little cloth coat, and it was pretty bad [laughter]. You know, I interviewed in a hotel room. Several
of my senior colleagues interviewed me. The chair, Arnold Weinstein; a new incoming senior faculty
member, Al Cooke; Michel-André Bossy I believe was there, and I—I think there were three. Then I
came down to Brown subsequently and gave a talk, along with—I think one or two other people, I know
at least one. And then I was offered the job.
Buc: And did you have then or do you have now, in retrospect, any sense of their interest in you because
you were a woman? Interested in you, just neutrally? I mean, the Lamphere case must have been bustling
around in their heads, if not in yours.
Newman: Right, I think that’s the way it was. It certainly wasn’t in mine. And I didn’t have any
impression from anything that was said to me during my visit or during the interview that they were only
looking at women, or that I was being looked at because I was a woman. I didn’t have any idea. The one
thing that I do remember after I was hired is they asked me if I [5:00] taught anything having to do with
gender or women. And I had taught at Berkeley a course on the female protagonist in the nineteenthcentury novel, which was outside my field but also there was so much interest at that time in work on
women, or with women as a theme, or women writers. And I taught that course my first year at Brown.
And unexpectedly seventy people signed up, and they didn’t have any TA available except for a guy who
was a medievalist, and I think my department felt that was a little inappropriate—so did I. I didn’t think
that would probably be the best way to teach my first semester. So I had a lot of grading—
Buc: So you did all the—you had to grade all the papers yourself, and all the—
Newman: Exactly. [Laughter]
Buc: You mention that you were the only woman in the department at the time? And you said that
because you were the junior person, you had to take the notes—
Newman: Right, it was whoever was the most junior.
Buc: That’s like the Supreme Court. Just whoever’s the most junior does it.
Newman: Right, and that could easily have been–and had been a man before that. Now we simply take
turns alphabetically.
2

Buc: And did the specter of Colie hang over the department? Or had she been here such a short time that
she—
Newman: Well she had—she was a very well known person in the field, and very admired by people in
the department. And she had died under difficult circumstances, where it wasn’t clear whether she had
taken her own life or died in a drowning accident. So, yes I think she was missed.
Buc: And what was your introduction to the other women faculty at Brown—both junior and senior?
How did you—did you get involved at all with the politics of women at Brown?
Newman: Well I remember Howard Swearer had a party right at the beginning of the year for all new
faculty. And I—
Buc: Howard Swearer was—
Newman: President of Brown. And at his home on Power Street. And I remember that Naomi Schor was
there—she had just been hired in the French Department—but as a tenured woman faculty member. And
she came across the room and said, “Are you the feminist?” And I remember that still, that you could use
the definite article as if there were only one. And we became fast friends. We saw each other once a
week, and talked about what it was like being new. I also remember going to lunch at the Faculty Club
that Karen Romer, who was a really important figure at Brown in the Dean’s office, and advising, and so
forth—I don’t remember her exact title now. And she sort of was running that meeting, and it was a
committee on women or the group of women faculty. And there was lots of joking about whenever
women meet together, people are worried—the guys ask, you know, questions. “What are you all talking
about in there?”
Buc: The old joke: when three men have lunch it’s lunch, and when three women have lunch it’s a
revolution.
Newman: That’s it [laughter].
Buc: Okay. You talked about your promotion—so that’s from assistant professor to associate professor
and the granting of tenure. Was that routine in your case? Was there any—by the time you were promoted
the decree was in effect. Do you remember any of the circumstances, or did it just happen?
Newman: Well, I remember when my colleague Michel-André called me when I was still a graduate
student finishing my degree, and telling me that they would like to interview me in Chicago at the MLA,
he said, “You know if you get this job you will—” Or maybe it was when called me to offer the job, I
don’t remember the sequence—but I remember his saying and using the expression, “You know it’ll be
really important, you will have to be productive.” And I understood what that meant, because I was
already a professional, you know, up-coming professional in my field—that I would need to publish and
3

would be expected to have published a book by the time of my tenure hearing. So I was busy and active in
my field [10:00] through those years, and did indeed have a book from a good press and articles coming
out, and so forth. So I didn’t ever think for myself that I was getting some easy ride.
Buc: Well, I didn’t mean the question that way. But did you get, for example, the annual reviews or the
regular reviews that the decree required?
Newman: Oh yes, that’s right. I definitely got the annual reviews, and my department also had a tradition
already of doing peer teaching evaluations. That is, faculty—we didn’t just use student evaluations, but
had senior faculty visit junior faculty classes. But they were a little uncomfortable with that, and so they
invited me to their classes, as if the power dynamic made—
Buc: To teach their classes?
Newman: —didn’t count. No, to come and visit and see. Since they were going to have to visit and
evaluate mine, they invited me to come to theirs, without recognizing—I guess in a sense—that the power
dynamic completely changed what that meant. So, but I do remember going to one of my senior
colleague’s classes and feeling as if he took the whole course to say—the whole fifty minutes to say what
I said in about the first five, and that maybe I needed to slow down. [Laughter]
Buc: Oh, in terms of the speaking—all right, okay. But—what I’m groping for here is—your promotion
from assistant professor to associate professor was pursuant to the terms of the decree. That is—we’ll
come back to this—to what the AAMC procedures were. But do you have any recollection that—of
anybody’s talking about that? Or did it just happen and they took care of all the paperwork?
Newman: Well, they certainly did what they were supposed to do about, sort of letting me know what the
procedures were, and what the timing would be. But I was the one who prepared my dossier: a statement
about my research, copies of all the materials, and so forth. I think that all... It’s interesting, the time that I
first had the sense that someone might, on the outside, perceive my being at Brown as being because
Brown had to hire women was actually from someone outside of Brown. I was asked to be a facilitator for
a conference held at Woods Hole by a group of faculty mainly at MIT, and I’m not sure how or why I got
involved, but it had something to do also with science and the humanities—something like that. And I
remember one of the organizers making a kind of a remark, “Well, you’re probably there because…” You
know, that sort of thing. So actually it was outside of Brown where—the only time I had a really
pejorative sense of that. But certainly the women faculty were still abuzz with all the work that had gone
on to—and the struggle and the contention through the seventies leading up to the decree itself.
Buc: You [coughing] excuse me. You got yourself elected to the Faculty Executive Committee in, I think
1984.
Newman: Right, I did.

4

Buc: How did that happen? Did you volunteer? Did somebody say, “come do this?”
Newman: Well, no, no. They had to have one junior person. And it was a good time for me because I was
still junior, but basically I think—you know, my stuff was being sent out, and though I wasn’t yet tenured
I was late in the process. And so it wasn’t—therefore it was perceived as less burdensome for a junior
person who was already into the process. Also, I’m kind of an easy hit. I’ve always done a lot of stuff at
Brown of that kind of work.
Buc: So that means after you got promoted you couldn’t hold that slot any longer—
Newman: That’s right
Buc: And that’s when you go on the Affirmative Action Monitoring Committee?
Newman: Yes I did.
Buc: 1986. According to my notes.
Newman: That’s right. [laughter]
Buc: What I’d like to talk about first with respect to the AAMC was what they were doing [15:00]. And
just by way of introduction, the decree—as you know—the Consent Decree and the Lamphere case
required that the university set up something, which came to be called the Affirmative Action Monitoring
Committee, which had broad jurisdiction over searches for newly hired faculty at all levels, promotions
from assistant professor to associate professor, and I guess from associate professor to professor as well.
But what did they actually do? If there was a search, could the department make an offer before going
through the AAMC? Or did you have to—?
Newman: No. In fact—
Buc: How did it work?
Newman: The way it worked was the committee—my memory is, and I might not be correct in this—but
at least a proportion of us, not every single one of us, I think it was three, had to review. And we had a
certain period of time to do it in, so that the offer could be made promptly and without causing undue
delay. And so we—the materials were kept, and I’ll talk about what the materials were—were kept in a
room on the third floor of University Hall, or maybe the fourth floor. And we would go there and review
them, and in the case of a hire we would look at the—there’s a report that people filled out and it gave the
proportion of men, the proportion of women, the proportion of minorities—
Buc: Who had applied.

5

Newman: Who had applied, and how many were going to be interviewed in those categories. And so we
would review that. And then if they—at the point when they were making an offer, we would look at
what those balances were. How many women there were in the pool, how many they were interviewing.
And if they were interviewing no women, for example, and there were fifty percent of the pool was
women, we would ask for some explanation for what were the problems with all of these candidates that
you couldn’t find one that you wanted to interview.
Buc: All of this was before a department could make an offer to the candidate they had chosen?
Newman: No, this was before they—this was at the point when they were bringing their top choices back
to campus to—
Buc: I see, so they hadn’t quite gotten as far as an offer.
Newman: That’s right. That’s when we—what we did was want to make sure that the departments were
looking at candidates carefully.
Buc: So if the search had been appropriately done—let’s just take a hypothetical. Suppose that they had
half women and half men in the total applicant pool, but everybody being interviewed on campus was
male.
Newman: Then you would ask for an explanation, and if you were convinced by it—and one of the
things that we could then do was look at the applicant pool, and see if there was some disagreement, if
there—and we always tried to involve—For example, if it was a social science appointment, the people
on the committee who represented those areas would try to be the ones that reviewed the documents, just
so that we were ensuring knowledge of the field in some way.
Buc: But through these procedures you could, in effect, block an appointment at least until you were
convinced that it was okay?
Newman: Yes.
Buc: And what happened if you said, “No, we’re going to block it.”
Newman: Well, we never said, “No, we’re going to block it.” What we always said was, “Could you
explain why you’re doing this?”
Buc: Right, but if after all the back and forth and all the explanations you said no, you’re still not
satisfied, what happened? Do you remember that that ever happened in your time?
Newman: No. Because, what I think the Consent Decree did was ensure that departments really did their
homework and looked, and chose, and interviewed the best candidates. And so as—I’ll always remember,
6

maybe we’ll get to this later, but in the faculty forum at the point [20:00] when the university was trying
to vacate the decree, a colleague of mine in the English Department used the expression, “unaided virtue.”
He said what the Consent Decree provides is it aids virtue. Virtue was happening, people were doing what
they were supposed to do, but they were doing it because we were watching.
Buc: Yeah, yeah. But the other part of this is it must have been an enormous amount of work. I mean, by
the time you got on the AAMC it was five, six, seven years later from the entry of the decree. But it was a
time when Brown was hiring. That means every assistant professor search the AAMC had to review. So
there was a lot of work in the trenches, so to speak.
Newman: That’s right. That’s right.
Buc: And how about with promotions to tenure? From the assistant professor to the associate professor
level, what was the process there, do you remember?
Newman: That I don’t remember as well. I think we only looked if a woman was denied tenure. In other
words, we weren’t preventing men from being promoted. But we were asked to review any cases in which
women weren’t being promoted.
Buc: So at that point each candidate, male or female, stood on his or her own merits for promotion—
Newman: Exactly, and wasn’t being compared to other candidates. Because when you come up for
tenure they’re just reviewing your materials, and there are outside evaluators who have written letters
either on your behalf or saying, “Don’t promote this person,” and so forth.
Buc: Well that’s sort of true, except in the Lamphere case itself one of the reasons given for not
promoting her was that they had only so many tenure slots in the department under the staffing plan.
Newman: Right.
Buc: And I wonder if that ever came up later as well. Because if there are two candidates or three
candidates for tenure who happened to come up in the same year and the department doesn’t have the
slots, it is comparative, isn’t it?
Newman: Yes, but I don’t remember that ever happening during my term in the AAMC. And also, you
know, there was not a lot of hiring going on then. We were certainly doing better financially than Brown
had been doing in the period when Lamphere was denied tenure, but still even in my case there was no
other junior person hired in Comp Lit during my entire junior—term as a junior faculty member. And it
wasn’t until I was promoted—in fact, Susan Bernstein was the next junior person to be hired, and that
wasn’t until—
Buc: That was years later.
7

Newman: Yeah, years later. So in fact there was not a lot of hiring going on. No, that’s not right actually,
I’m mistaken. After I was hired we hired a person in Japanese and a person in Chinese.
Buc: Okay, so then the—
Newman: But still there was two years’ difference, and two years’ difference, so none of us ever came up
at the same time. And I just don’t know—
Buc: Although that may have been the case in other departments?
Newman: Right. That’s what I said, I just don't know in other departments whether those kinds of points
of competition emerged.
Buc: Do you remember hearing or having any disappointed women who had not been given tenure
complaining to the AAMC during your time on the committee? Let’s not use their names if they’re not
otherwise public.
Newman: I mean, I certainly remember cases that involved other departments. And—
Buc: So yes, there may have been some.
Newman: Yes. Or, there may have been that someone felt that they should’ve been hired and weren’t,
or—you know, that sort of thing.
Buc: You just raised something I hadn’t thought of. Women who applied for jobs at Brown who didn’t
get them—whether as assistant professors or as associate professors, full professors, all had the right to—
Newman: And they often did.
Buc: —to come to the AAMC?
Newman: Well, or to inquire legally of why they weren’t. And that would always go not to the AAMC,
but to the University Council.
Buc: So AAMC didn’t hear the disappointed applicant cases?
Newman: Not usually, though [25:00] in some cases if someone wasn’t just an—yeah we didn’t hear the
disappointed applicant. In the case I’m thinking of it was somebody who actually came, and then the
question was how or whether she would stay or not.

8

Buc: As I read the report—the AAMC filed annual reports. And it looks like there were between twenty
and thirty applications a year that they had to review. And there were how many people on the AAMC?
Newman: I think we were five.
Buc: Were you chosen by the plaintiffs or the faculty?
Newman: I think I was elected by the faculty.
Buc: Did it make any difference, do you remember, once people were chosen?
Newman: No, no. And, you know, part—
Buc: Was there a—was it like the Supreme Court? Was there a faculty side and a plaintiff side?
Newman: No, I don’t think so. And, you know, Louise was, as the years passed, of course, further and
further away. And so she often relied on people she had known from before. But no, I didn’t ever feel that
there was ever that kind of disagreement.
Buc: Just curious. And one of the other things that had to happen under the decree: the decree established
goals and timetables for both tenured and non-tenured women, through—as I recall—1987. But they had
to be updated, because depending on the size of the faculty, and the pools of people, pools of the people
who’d gotten Ph.D.s in the relevant years. Brown doesn’t have too many non-Ph.D.s.
Newman: Yes, I was very involved in that part of the AAMC’s work—the updating of the goals.
Buc: Well since the ‘87 fell right in the middle of your chairship. Can you talk about that a little bit? Let
me back up first and ask this question: the goals and the timetables are stated in terms of university-wide
numbers. And yet, decisions about how many people departments get to hire, and who they hire, and
whether those people are male or female, happen at the departmental level. Can you talk a little bit about
how the goals, university-wide, got translated or didn’t get translated into these decisions that were
happening department by department? Because if one department did well but another department did
horribly, you couldn’t get there.
Newman: We also worked to ensure that every department had some woman faculty member. And the
two most difficult departments were Economics and Computer Science. And they always claimed it was
impossible, they couldn’t find anyone. So then we would always ask to see what special measures they
were taking to try and recruit top faculty who were women.
Buc: And that’s because the decree actually required departments that had no women to make, what the
decree calls “special efforts.”

9

Newman: “Special efforts,” that’s right, that’s right. And one of the things we also did was review when
faculty members had an issue with the department. So that if a young woman member of a department
was feeling that the environment of the department was inhospitable, then they could come to the AAMC.
And I remember a particular case of a young woman who—actually in Computer Science—who was
Jewish. And she was practicing, and the department had a practice of getting together for drinks on Friday
afternoon at the end of the week, and they wanted her to participate. And she didn’t want to because she
wanted to go to services. So, I was involved in helping negotiate that with the then-chair of Computer
Science, and trying to get him to understand precisely the kinds of issues that make for a hospitable or
inhospitable environment. And that was also an interesting case, because it’s where different kinds of
differences come together in interesting ways. He also hassled her about [30:00] putting a coke can on her
wooden desk in her office. She left. She had a good offer elsewhere, and didn’t feel that it was an
environment she wanted to stay in.
Buc: I’ve read some of the paper in correspondence between the AAMC and those two departments:
Computer Science and Economics. The Computer Science paper has a much different tone. They say very
nicely how hard they’re working at it. The Economics Department can only be described as truculent.
Newman: Yes, and I think Computer Science was working at it. And this was a later date when they had
finally succeeded in hiring a woman, and a different chair.
Buc: Because there’s one document in which the Computer Science Department reports that they had a
woman who was a visiting assistant professor. And they begged her, they say, to apply for a job. They
had an opening as an assistant professor the following year, but she followed her husband to Harvard.
And that sounded reasonably credible, and is a problem generally that everybody is familiar with.
Newman: Right.
Buc: All right, so these goals—
Newman: That still happens.
Buc: Well it does, although sometimes now it happens the other way.
Newman: That’s right.
Buc: We both know of at least one full professor at Brown of the female variety whose husband followed
her here.
Newman: That’s right [laughter].
Buc: Let’s talk about—a little bit about this goals and timetables thing. The university had—and I want to
tie it to Brown’s efforts unilaterally to vacate the decree. And it looks like Brown started talking about
10

vacating the decree as early as 1984, from the documents. And before we go to the goals and timetables
and how that ties in, can you talk a little bit about why the university—the administration of the
university—felt so oppressed by this decree? That barely five years later—1984—they started talking
about vacating. What was bothering them so much, do you know?
Newman: Well, I think at the time—I don’t remember now exactly what year Gregorian joined.
Buc: This was all Swearer.
Newman: No, I know. But what I’m saying is I think—as you know, Howard got some grief for settling.
Howard Swearer got some grief from some members of the larger Brown community for agreeing to the
consent decree and settling the case rather than taking it to court. And so I think he also felt that as soon
as the university had sort of cleaned up its act, we should put it behind us. That we were doing the right
thing, and so forth. And also I think as time passed, and Howard thought he was leaving—or that then he
became interested in taking care of that piece of business before a new person would be recruited, and so
forth. So I think there was a period of time during which those two different issues were at stake.
Buc: Well Howard didn’t leave until 1988.
Newman: But that’s only four years. You said they started in 1984, and he left in ‘88. He definitely knew
he was leaving a year in advance.
Buc: So that’s ‘87—
Newman: I’m just saying I think there were different issues at stake. One, the response that much of the
community had had to Howard’s choice and decision on arriving to settle. And later as he wanting to
leave a kind of clean slate for his successor.
Buc: The way that—
Newman: I see you’re leery, but you know, in legal time three years is not that long. [laughter]
Buc: That’s certainly… Okay, we’ll leave it there. So the goals for tenured and untenured faculty, we do
agree that the decree itself provided for them through 1987. And they needed then to be updated if the
decree were to continue in effect. And it seems to have been the updating of the goals and the timetables
[35:00] that especially propelled the university to want to get rid of the decree. And can you talk a little
bit about how that all played out?
Newman: Well, it’s interesting because the AAMC was sort of between the two opposing parties. That is,
Louise Lamphere wanted a much higher number than the university. They were quite—
Buc: For a new goal?
11

Newman: For a new goal.
Buc: Post ‘87.
Newman: And they were quite far apart. And the AAMC took a kind of middle ground because we—I
mean, one of the big issues was whether or not attrition should be counted or not. And Louise felt, rightly,
that—Louise Lamphere, whom I had never met at that time at all—felt that the university shouldn’t get
some kind of reward for when women left by not having to—therefore lowering the goals. Because then
you could just make it an unpleasant environment and you wouldn’t—and women would leave. And they
should have to make—the university should have to make—all of the best efforts it can to retain women,
and so forth. So the AAMC agreed with that position, but also thought it was true that people leave for
many different reasons, not because it’s a bad environment necessarily, but because families are trying to
be together, or somebody gets an offer in California and doesn't like the New England winter, whatever.
So we thought that there should be some attention to recognizing that every loss was not a loss because of
some failure on Brown’s part. And so we, on the AAMC, took a kind of middle position about the
numbers.
Buc: And, but there was quite a lot of debate. I mean, I remember it went on for years. As to how to
calculate, and—
Newman: Looking—who was—you know, there was debate about the pools. And where the numbers
came from, and whether we could agree upon them in the different pools. There was also the issue of
having a woman in each department, and therefore the departments that had still not managed to attain
that. There was the attrition that lasted quite a long time. And also, you know, we would sometimes—as I
remember it, the plaintiff’s side would make a proposal and the university would—then there would be a
period of elapsed time before there would be a judgment on it. And then, you know, people would have to
argue again.
Buc: I remember, there’s one letter from—I think probably Maurice Glicksman or John Quinn to either
the plaintiffs or to the AAMC that dealt with that attrition question that you’re talking about. Where they
say, “Look, these aren’t all our fault. Barbara Lewalski went to Harvard for a chair, Joan Scott went to the
Institute for Advanced Study, one died, what do you want from us?”
Newman: And that was—so the AAMC, I think was a very reasonable body. And we felt that those were
legitimate points of view, but we also felt that all attrition should not be—that if in fact the university
were rewarded by being able to count all attrition against the goals, they would, in effect, have an
incentive to make it not such a great environment in some cases.
Buc: It was the AAMC, I think, that introduced into that debate the concept of full utilization, which the
decree also requires. Which, apart from the numbers, also means that every department—or at least every
discipline—is supposed to have as many women faculty members at the various levels as the pools of
12

available Ph.Ds. would have yielded by that time. And so, you distinguished—and in fact in your letters
to Judge Pettine dealing with this issue [40:00]—you really emphasized the full utilization part of it, as
the other part of the decree that had to be given effect.
Newman: We did. Because we felt that it would be dangerous to—we knew that the desire on the part of
the university to vacate the decree was around [laughter]—
Buc: Well, they kept telling you.
Newman: —and at work. They kept telling us. And we felt that it would be particularly dangerous to
leave the university to “unaided virtue” if there were still departments who had no women at all.
Buc: There was also a tension, which you exploited very effectively. This goes back to the question of the
overall goals, which are numbers for the university as a whole, versus full utilization, which breaks it
down more. At least by discipline, if not by department.
Newman: Instead of letting the humanities take all the—because humanities had higher pools, and there
are also areas of the university even today that are less well-paid, where the teaching course load is
higher, and so forth. So we wanted to be sure that it wasn't that English and the languages were doing all
of the work, but that we were also ensuring that areas of the sciences, physical and biological, and the
social sciences also had women in their ranks.
Buc: So this came to its first head in the fall of 1987, when the university was threatening to go to court
unilaterally—by unilaterally I mean without the agreement of either the plaintiffs, or the AAMC, or
anybody but themselves—to try to vacate the decree. And there was a faculty forum that fall, and since
you were the chair of the AAMC, you presided over this forum. You didn’t, you weren’t chairing it, but
you made a speech about why you thought this was too soon. What did—
Newman: I did, and John Quinn was the Dean of the Faculty and he was the university representative of
that position. Well, I think I’ve sort of said what and why we felt the way we did. And we were not
allowed to take a vote, because there is no vote at a forum, but we did do a straw vote, and
overwhelmingly the faculty supported the continuation of the decree. And I think if you look at the
minutes, one of the things that people said over and over again—and I think it was Arlene Gorton who
used this expression—“if it ain’t broke, why fix it?” And I think—and also in that forum—it was a very
interesting moment—Ken Miller, who is a tenured full professor now, stood up and made a statement that
he believed that Brown was a better institution because of the Consent Decree, because the Consent
Decree ensured that we hired the best candidate every time. And he was a man who had been hired in
Biomed, there were certainly women in the pool with him. And I think, you know, that’s a really
important point to underline. That it’s not that the Consent Decree required that women be hired, it’s that
in circumstances where people’s credentials were equal, women had to be hired. But if the man were the
better candidate, hire him. And they did.

13

Buc: So it was the —the effect was that if you did a search, a full search, and really worked hard to get
the best people to apply, you then had your choice of the best people.
Newman: Absolutely.
Buc: Male, female—
Newman: Absolutely. And one of the ways in which Brown had worked prior to the Consent Decree was
people would just call up their buddy at Harvard, or Princeton, or somewhere and say, “Who’ve you got
for me?” And Brown was sort of in that—often in that position. And so doing national searches, I think
was a very important part of how the eighties propelled Brown into a different position with regard to its
reputation, and research profile.
Buc: That’s interesting. So you would argue that the Decree is part of what made [45:00] Brown’s
striking improvement occur?
Newman: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I believe that categorically [laughter]
Buc: At least one former provost agrees with you. There’s paper to that effect—
Newman: Is it Maurice?
Buc: Yes, Maurice Glicksman. All right, so after this faculty forum the AAMC then went to meet with
Howard Swearer, and according to the minutes of that meeting you told him that there was overwhelming
opposition to Brown’s doing this.
Newman: We did.
Buc: And he must’ve listened to you, because it was a year later that they then did go to court all by
themselves, and lost. And you were off the AAMC by that time—
Newman: Right, and Mary Ann Doane was, I think—
Buc: But you do remember that they lost?
Newman: I do.
Buc: And you perhaps remember also, that essentially what Judge Pettine said in denying Brown’s
motion was that they had done okay on the goals and timetables, especially for non-tenured women, and
lifted the goals and timetables entirely for the non-tenured women. But that they had not achieved full
utilization, which was your—

14

Newman: Expression.
Buc: And not only yours, but that you were the spokesperson for full utilization. And so basically you
won your case. Must’ve been gratifying.
Newman: It was.
Buc: [Laughter] And then after that apparently you yourself went back to your —other academic pursuits.
Newman: I did. And you know, something that’s interesting about that is—you know, it was not a
rancorous meeting, for example, that forum. John Quinn is a friend of mine, a colleague, someone I
admire. He went on to be the president of the University of Tennessee. And—but he had been told that
this was something—and you can kind of tell that if you read the minutes—that he was required to do
this. And he was talking to a lot of his own colleagues as well about—who disagreed with him—
Buc: And he had been an AAMC member.
Newman: He had been.
Buc: At an earlier time.
Newman: Right, right. And so it does give you some sense of what’s required of you as an administrator
sometimes, to put it into effect, or to work toward positions that you might not fully subscribe to.
Buc: You and he had an exchange over the so-called “Nobel prize problem—”
Newman: Right [laughter]
Buc: —which Brown always adduced. That if you had to wait to make an offer to a Nobel Prize winner
of the male variety, he would never come. And in fact there was one of those. They had a—was it Joseph
Brodsky, do you remember that one? They wanted to appoint him, the Nobel prize-winning poet.
Newman: Yes, but I don’t think—
Buc: They went to court ultimately to get an exception, which of course was granted instantly—
Newman: And then he came!
Buc: Did he come or not come?

15

Newman: Well, I thought that he supposedly came, but never appeared. That’s my memory. But I don’t
think anyone ever thought that the AAMC and the Consent Decree and its rules had any negative effect
on that kind of recruitment as we—as those interchanges suggest. I opposed anecdotal arguments.
Buc: There’s a line that they use at FDA all the time that the plural of anecdote is not data.
Newman: Right, perfect. I love that. I’m going to write that down [laughter]
Buc: The [pause] once, a couple of years later Judge Pettine—although he refused to vacate the Decree—
essentially said, “Listen, you people. Get yourselves together and agree on how to do this.” But that
happened after you had left the AAMC. I mean it did happen—
Newman: Right. And just to go back to one issue you raised, Nancy, I think—I mean we should look at
the timing because I know that Gregorian was very eager to vacate the Decree. And I think that even
though he didn’t start ‘til ‘88 he was hired earlier than ‘88, so the period in ‘87 when Howard wanted to
vacate was that period when, particularly, I think, Gregorian who had all these connections in New York
and wanted to be able to bring people and this and that, felt that his hands would be tied. So I think the
nexus [50:00] around ‘87 to ‘88 had to do with that transition of presidents, and Gregorian’s desire to be
able to, you know, bring some of his illustrious people to Brown, and so forth.
Buc: Would you also surmise, though—I mean, that was Gregorian. He would routinely want to fix
things that other people hadn’t been able to fix.
Newman: Rights, right [laughter], yeah.
Buc: And so—
Newman: But he—I mean I talked to him about it after he was here because, you know, he really felt that
the university’s hands shouldn’t be tied was sort of the metaphor that he would use. And—
Buc: But there is some resonance to that that cuts the other way. The whole basis that—the primary basis
on which Brown defended the case in the first place was that courts and procedure shouldn’t mess with
the wonderful academic prerogative of deciding on their own faculty. And in fact the Brown faculty
moved to intervene in the Lamphere litigation on the grounds that they were wonderful, and all very
talented, and should have the right, male—
Newman: To make their own decisions.
Buc: Yes. Some of them were female, of course, but to make their own decisions. And so when
Gregorian talked about not wanting his hands to be tied, I think maybe he, but certainly not everyone, was
sort of tone deaf to the wrong resonance of that. The reason there was a Decree was because Brown,
although it never admitted it, had been, arguably, discriminating.
16

Newman: That’s right.
Buc: I’m not suggesting that they were or weren’t; they didn’t admit any guilt. But you’re quite right
about what Gregorian wanted to do, because in the event—the Decree was vacated in May of 1989, and
Brown put out a press release so that Gregorian could announce it at Commencement. Do you remember
that? I’d forgotten—
Newman: I don’t remember that detail of the timing.
Buc: He announced at Commencement, “We have vacated the Decree!”
Newman: But I do remember when it was vacated, because I was very involved in the establishment of
the new procedures and committee—
Buc: That was my next question.
Newman: —in relation to after the Decree was vacated.
Buc: So what followed?
Newman: Well, from the outset, Louise Lamphere had asked that minorities also be included in the
Consent Decree, to be monitored and to have goals and timetables, and the university opposed that. So
then when—so the question became, when the Decree was vacated, whether there should be one
committee doing what the AAMC had done for both women and minorities, or whether there should be
two committees. And initially many people felt one committee was good, because one committee is
always better than two committees. But the—I can’t remember its acronym—COFE, or something like
that—the Committee on Faculty Minority Hiring, or—
Buc: And they opposed that.
Newman: And they opposed that. And I remember writing a note to Maurice [Glicksman], and saying,
“We think one committee is a good idea, but—” And for other reasons than just “one committee is always
better than two committees. ” We really thought that it would be good to have one group that was doing
the sort of watchdog work across the university, so there wouldn’t be something going on here that
somebody else didn’t know about, and things like that. But that group felt not—that they wanted to have a
separate committee, and so we said fine. Then lets keep them separate.
Buc: And is that informal—not informal, but is that committee that was the successor to the AAMC,
except that it was no longer supervised by the court—is that still in existence? Do you know?

17

Newman: No, now what we have is a—we have an affirmative action officer who looks at the same kind
of documentation and materials that used to be reviewed by the AAMC, and has to approve every single
search and offer that’s made.
Buc: Brown had an affirmative action officer then too.
Newman: Mm hmm. But [55:00] [pause].
Buc: So that committee is no longer in existence. How long did it last? Do you know? Do you remember?
Newman: I don’t remember.
Buc: Because there doesn’t seem to be any paper—
Newman: Oh yeah?
Buc: —about it. I can’t find anything.
Newman: I don’t remember—
Buc: Did you serve on it?
Newman: After? No. I mean, I served during—on the AAMC, but I didn’t serve on the committee
subsequently.
Buc: And I have a couple more, not too many more questions. But one of the things that was striking at
that time of that faculty forum that you were talking about, in 1987, is that at that time Brown was way
ahead of most of our competitors in women faculty. But that’s no longer the case. Parity has, more or less,
come to women at our competitors. Was it all worth it?
Newman: Well, I think partly the reason parity has come at our peer institutions is because—you know,
after Brown and some other institutions who had similar kinds of situations, people began to recognize, as
they increasingly do, that you simply can’t afford to leave out fifty percent of the talent. And so—fiftyone I believe it is. And so I think that part of what happened was change—the kind of social change that
was happening in lots of different arenas. You know, that people became more enlightened and realized
that if you’re really dedicated to a certain kind of research success that, again, you want to use all the
talent you’ve got. And so—and I think, actually this is interesting in relation to minority hiring, is that
often what you hear is just these laments, “Oh, there’s still only this many, you know, African-Americans,
or this many minority—” But what’s left in out in those discussions is always the question of the pool.
And that’s what was always a crucial part of the Consent Decree, is that there’s a certain kind of realistic
expectation if you’ve got a pool that you can turn to, whereas if you say, “Why aren’t there more AfricanAmericans?” And there’s one percent availability, and everybody’s competing for that one percent,
18

you’ve got different kinds of—a different kind of struggle. And that’s happening at the level of students
as well, as you know. That there’s huge competition for those top students entering Brown, and Princeton,
and Harvard, and Stanford, and so forth.
Buc: I think that’s right. I think that the Decree was very well crafted to take account of the reality of the
size of the pools. And on the other hand, that often was used as an excuse. I sat through many Corporation
meetings where the answer to “Why don’t we have more fill-in-the-blanks” was always “No pool, no
pool.”
Newman: Right, right.
Buc: And the evidence was, in many areas, to the contrary. Although that is exactly the argument that
both your friends in Computer Sciences and your friends in Economics used.
Newman: Well, and their pools were smaller. No question about that. But, they weren’t non-existent.
[laughter]
Buc: Exactly. I want to talk about one other aspect of this that kind ties together both what the case was
about and your own fields of academic enterprise, and that’s the whole question of—in quotes—
“Women’s Studies.” Part of what the case was about was Lamphere’s shift in emphasis in her scholarship
from Navajos to women—
Newman: From Navajos to women, right.
Buc: And it’s not exactly clear how much the case was about that, we’ll talk—that’s going to be an
important subject in this. But you mentioned that you were asked if you taught anything having to do with
women’s perspectives on anything—to broaden out women’s studies. And the answer was yes, and you
went ahead and did it. Would a man have been asked the same question?
Newman: No, of course not. And I think, though—
Buc: And today?
Newman: —that’s... well, whereas now men would teach it—I mean, still, statistically speaking, there are
more women doing it than men. But still identity politics has sort of broken down to some degree at least.
I remember once, Maurice said to me—Maurice Glicksman, Provost, said, “So, I understand now what
the Pembroke Center does. You’re not studying women, but you’re studying difference, and gender, and
the social construction of sexual difference. So what you mean is that the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair could
be a man.” And I remember saying, “Right, Maurice. The Nancy Duke Lewis Chair can be a man when
there are women in lots of other chairs at this institution, in this university.” You know, that is, he got the
principle, but the direction he wanted to go with it was—had a certain irony to it since there was in fact

19

only one chaired professor for many—woman professor—for many, many years, and was the Nancy
Duke Lewis Chair that Joan Scott held. And subsequently Naomi Schor.
Buc: Naomi Schor?
Newman: Yeah.
Buc: Hadn’t Rosemary Colie been the Nancy Duke Lewis Chair? Was that her name? Her first name?
What’s was her name?
Newman: Nancy Duke Lewis—
Buc: No, your predecessor—
Newman: Yeah, Rosalie Colie. I think she had held it before.
Buc: Rosalie Colie. She was Nancy Duke Lewis, and it was when she died that the chair stayed vacant for
a while, while they sorted it out.
Newman: Right, right.
Buc: But that then—but Maurice’s comment, ironic or not, and your response really sums it all up,
doesn’t it? The millennium will arrive when everybody of all descriptions is studying all different kinds
of identity politics, and ultimately maybe there will be no identity politics.
Newman: Yeah, because the thing about the study of women—I mean, what kind of research can you do
in any area, whether it’s pharmaceutical research, or the history of the past—Ancient Greece, modern
England, whatever—if you don’t study women and their roles and contributions? Then you’re, in effect—
I mean, it’s sort of the same argument—you can’t afford to give up on fifty-one percent of the talent. You
also aren’t doing serious intellectual work and research if you’re not looking at half the data.
Buc: But then it’s no different—I mean all these arguments are different—but it’s analogous to the
argument about the nature of the canon. About what you study. Is it all Western literature, or—
Newman: Yes, I think you’re absolutely right, that’s part of what’s happened in terms of the canon, too.
And its opening, as people say, is precisely recognizing that there is all of this literature being written, or
[pause] you know, medical—I mean all kinds of things happening all over the world, and that’s why now
globalization and internationalization of research is so important to the university. And I think you’re
absolutely right that it’s the same argument—
Buc: Just a different kind of difference—

20

Newman: Right, a different kind of difference. Right.
Buc: Thank you very much.
Newman: Thank you.
Buc: Have I failed to ask you anything where you’d like to make a speech? What else do you want to
say?
Newman: I don’t know, I was thinking about some of the things that we—you know, some of the, sort of,
events that happened. And I was trying to remember—that might be more fun for your—for the film—
than just a talking head answering questions. But maybe I’ve done those.
Buc: Well, you’ve answered—you certainly said one of things I know that you think is the most
important, which is that the effect of the decree was to improve Brown’s faculty across the board. Male,
female, and—
Newman: And I believe that so strongly. And I think other people do, too. I don’t think I’m alone in that,
in my judgment of its impact. So, yeah.
Buc: Good, we’ll all take—Louise can take credit for that.
Newman: [Laughter] yeah.
Buc: Thank you very much.
Newman: Thank you.
