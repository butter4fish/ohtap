Speaker 1: My name is Julieanna Richardson and I'm the interviewer, and Scott Stearns is the videographer, and Larry Crowe is the observer. And sir, I want you to first start off by saying--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I'm David Dinkins.  I was the one hundred and sixth mayor of the city of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: And can you spell your name?
Speaker 2: D-I-N-K-I-N-S.  I assume you all can spell David.
Speaker 1: Your date of birth?
Speaker 2: July 10, 1927.  Same birthday as Arthur Ashe [tennis player], July 10.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?  I have no idea with today's date is.
Speaker 1: It's March 4, 2003.
Speaker 2: They'll take it from you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Right?
Speaker 1: Well, yes, and the location we're at (inaudible)?
Speaker 2: You're at 215 E. 68th Street, Manhattan, New York City.
Speaker 1: And your profession?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor at Columbia University [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: You would describe yourself as the lawyer, politician, or--?
Speaker 2: I am a lawyer.  I don't use the term politician so much as I have been in public service.  I have held public office.  Politician for some has a connotation that's not favorable.

Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Before I went to Pritikin Longevity Center and Spa [Aventura, Florida], otherwise known as a fat farm, or since?
Speaker 1: [Laughing] Before.
Speaker 2: Well before, I liked trotters and wrinkle steak.  You're familiar with those terms.  And, you know, in general soul food.  Loved it.  Collard greens with cooked in a ham and whatnot.  But now, I avoid fat and salt and sugar.  And so I eat oatmeal now almost every morning.  Love granola with fruit and strawberries and blackberries and pineapple.  I had a big bowl of oatmeal this morning with those fruits in it.  I drink soymilk.  The brand name is Boca Burger, but it's a soy burger and I've come to like those a lot.  I eat a lot of salad, eat a lot more vegetables.  And last count, my cholesterol was 151, which is a hell of a lot better than what it was before I started eating right.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well, when you attain my age you have to see the sunrise.  And if you're able to sit up and take nourishment, it's not quite a thing.  Except to say, that because I like tennis and I play tennis year-round, indoor and out, I suppose I prefer the spring has to be my favorite time of the year.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Well, I tend to wear what people call conservative colors, blue and dark grey, charcoal grey, black.  But I like bright colors as well.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation.
Speaker 2: Anyplace with tennis courts, which is why I don't go on a cruise.  My wife [Joyce Burrows] wants to go on a cruise.  I tell her when they put a tennis court on the boat I'll go.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose I'm fond of reminding audiences that everybody stands on somebody's shoulders.  Nobody gets anywhere alone.  And I make reference to many of the kids of people that you cover in your interviews, some of them who've gone like Malcolm X and [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks, Percy Sutton who's my personal hero because he ran for mayor in New York City in 1977 with such class and distinction that nobody laughed when I dared to think of it in 1989.
Story_ID: 17569
Speaker 1: I'd like to first start out by asking about your mother.  Her name and--?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Sarah.  Her maiden name Lucy.  Sarah Lucy, but everyone called her Sally.  She was born in Newport News, Virginia.  As was my father.  His name was William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.  And they both went to Huntington High School in Newport News and left there, got married and moved to Trenton, New Jersey, where I was born in 1927.
Speaker 1: Did they talk at all about growing up in Newport News?
Speaker 2: I don't have any recollections of stories of my parents growing up other than the fact that my mommy, who was a little half-pint, she was about 5 [feet], 1 [inch] and she was captain of the girls' basketball team at Huntington High School in Newport News.
Speaker 1: And so they met actually in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were classmates.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your other siblings?
Speaker 2: I have one sister.  I had a brother, Fred, who died an infant.  He died at two, three, four years old.  And I have no recollection of him at all except for some photographs.  And my sister's three years younger than I am, but will not admit to that.  She will probably maintain she's twenty years younger than I am.
Story_ID: 17570
Speaker 1: What is your oldest memory of growing up?  Do you remember?  Your youngest--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I have--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Earliest memory.
Speaker 2: Well, I've many, many memories of growing up.  My father [William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.] and mother [Sarah Lucy] separated when I was six or seven years old and my mother had moved from Trenton, New Jersey to New York City [New York].  And my grandmother was here, my mother's mother, and they were domestics.  They cooked and cleaned for other folks for a dollar a day.  Because these were the [Great] Depression years and I remember that well.  We used to move a lot.  I lived in Harlem [New York, New York].  And we'd move when the rent was due, seemed like a good thing to do.  And I was poor but I didn't know it.  My clothes were clean because my mother and my grandmother scrubbed them.  They didn't have holes because they sewed them up.  I always had toys because they bought them when little white children got through playing with the toys.  My mother and my grandmother would bring them to me.  So I had a good time.  I do recall one incident.  In those days the kids used to make what they call skate scooters.  It was a two-by-four with a roller skate on the front and a roller skate on the back.  Not these in-line skates, but old-fashioned roller skates.  And a box, like a soapbox on the front.  And that was called a skate scooter.  But no self-respecting skate scooter was plain and ordinary.  You had to put some kind of ornaments on it.  The classic ornament was a bottle top from a soda bottle.  They put a tack in it and stick that on it.  But if you really were down, what you got were reflectors like they have on license plates.  But you didn't buy them, we were out liberating them from license plates on one occasion and I got caught because a police officer chased us, he was a black cop in plainclothes and I was small, the smallest of the lot, and he caught me.  You will understand when I tell you I went into the [U.S.] Marine Corps in 1945, I weighed 128 pounds.  So you can see as a child I was very little.  They brought me home to my mother and my grandmother and their good little boy they never had to lay a hand on me, they'd just speak to me and tell me how hard they worked and how they were trying to do for me and then in about thirty seconds I'd be in tears.  But on this occasion, my mother and my grandmother put me in a tub, took all my clothes off and beat me with straps.  I have not stolen a reflector since.  That's a clear memory.  I remember that real well.
Story_ID: 17571
Speaker 1: You were born in Trenton [New Jersey], but you moved very quickly to Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I came here when I was six or seven years old, if that's quickly.  But I went back to Trenton about junior high school and I lived in Trenton with my father [William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.] up through high school, college at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], the [U.S.] Marine Corps and then I came to Trenton--came to New York in 1950, '51 [1951].  I got married in '53 [1953] and started law school the next month.  I got married in August.  So as you will see by today's date, I will have been married forty-nine years come August [2002].
Story_ID: 17572
Speaker 1: When I was a--in junior high school, it was an all black junior high school.  Totally black.  All the students, all the teachers, the principal.  In fact, my stepmother who was a teacher at that time in that school, she taught in the public school system for forty years and she became a second mother to me.  Although when my father announced to me he was going to remarry, I thought I would die.  I mean, my world had come to an end, because my mother and father were always very civil and I thought they would get back together.  I didn't understand that they would never do that.  At any rate, among my memories at this high school, I had--some people remember certain teachers, I had one teacher, Bessie Nellentill, and a second, Bernice Munce, they were all black.  And they were terrific.  And so I did well in English and in Latin.  Mrs. Munce taught Latin.  So much so that when I went to high school, although I'd never done better than a B in junior high school, when I got to the tenth grade, high school was tenth, eleventh and twelfth grade, it was integrated, everybody went to that school except the Catholics, they had a separate school, and the first term I lead the class, did better than anybody else.  On the other hand, in mathematics, I never in grammar school, junior high school, in arithmetic and math I never ever got anything but an A.  And I got to high school and the first day the teacher put a square root sign on the board and referred to it as a radical and I had never, ever heard the term.  I didn't know what he was talking about.  So I struggled.  They had six marking periods.  I went from a D to, I think I got a B+ toward the end.  Interestingly enough, I ended up getting my degree with honors in math.  But, the point of the story really is that it's not so necessarily a function of whether it's a black school or a white school, sometimes it's the teacher because I had real good teachers.
Speaker 2: Take me through the schools.  You went to elementary school where?
Speaker 1: In PS 5, PS 90 in New York City [New York].  Then I went back to Trenton, New Jersey, and most of time for a little bit in one grammar school for like an hour and a half, I guess, and then to what was called junior five, or Lincoln School.  You know by the name that that's where the black folks went.  And from there to high school, Trenton Central High [Trenton, New Jersey].  You know I was an okay student.  I wasn't terrific, but I got reasonably good grades.
Story_ID: 17573
Speaker 1: When you went to live with your father [William Harvey Dinkins Jr.], do you think there was a lot of discussion about the (inaudible)?
Speaker 2: He had more money than my mother [Sarah Lucy].  My father started out as a barber with one chair, and built that into a four-chair barbershop.  And he was a smart man, but a real self-made man.  He never went to college, but he went to a series of these technical-type schools.  He went to beauty school and barber school and then later insurance and real estate.  And at his death, at just short of age eighty-six, he was in the real estate business and real estate and insurance.  But he had a superior ability to care for me than did my mother.  And I assume that's why.  But I would see my mother often and we'd be together, the whole family on some certain occasions, which is why I suppose I always thought that my mother and father would remarry or get back together.
Story_ID: 17574
Speaker 1: Which traits do you think you take from your father [William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.], and what traits from your mother [Sarah Lucy]?
Speaker 2: Well, any good traits that I have, and there are those who would argue I don't have many, but any good traits that I have I got from my father and my mother, and all the bad ones I accept as coming strictly from me.  But genetically, my mother was a very interesting woman.  She was satisfied, she thought it was remarkable and she was so proud of me when I finished high school, she was proud of me when I finished college and law school.  She wasn't around when I became mayor [of New York, New York].  But my father, he too was very proud of me and some things that I did that I don't think were remarkable at all, there'd be all kids if you can read and write you can do, but they were just doting parents in that sense.  And my father, I remember on January 1st, 1990, when I was inaugurated as mayor, it was very cold day and I had a little speech for about a half an hour or so and a pretty good speech we thought.  And they had teleprompters, you know the glass on one side and the glass on the other, and I had been trained sufficiently so that I knew how to use a teleprompter.  People who would have an inability to use one, they'd do this, this (turns head), this (turns head to opposite side) and this (turns head).  Whereas, you're supposed to speak over here and then remember enough of the sentence so that you look straight ahead where there are no words and so forth.  I was reasonable good at that.  So when I got through, my father said, "Gee Dave, great speech and no notes."  I said, "Pop, I got to tell you," and had to explain to him what the teleprompter was.  But he--my mother and father were always very proud of me.  No matter what I did they, all my failings and what not, they were always there with me.
Story_ID: 17575
Speaker 1: I remember so well, I went to--when I finished Howard University [Washington D.C.], I finally had gotten serious.  Up to the last year or so my motto was, "Don't let your education interfere with your recreation."  But by the time I got to be a junior and I realized I had to have a major, I saw I had more math courses than anything else, so I started to concentrate on math and physics.  And I got my degree and then I won a fellowship to Rutgers [State] University [of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] in math.  And so while I had worked a little bit in college, I had the GI Bill [federal education benefit for veterans] and waited tables and other things.  And Trenton [New Jersey] was a very industrial town.  You could always get a job, anybody who wanted to work could find a job.  And so I worked in factories and in summers though, I waited tables also.  But this particular summer after graduating from Howard, I worked in factories and I would work a double-shift.  Not every day, but on occasion work eight hours and work a second eight hours.  This is not overtime.  The shift boss, the crew master for that shift, he don't give a damn about the fact that you already worked eight hours, he would drive you just as hard.  The reason for this was to save enough money so that I'd have sufficient funds to ride that train from Trenton to New Brunswick everyday and not have to work so I could spend all my time studying.  By then I was real serious.  Well, I did fairly well.  I finished one semester and I got okay grades.  Math at that level is almost--a lot of its words.  You don't see numbers a whole lot.  And one day though we had a problem, I did this homework and stayed up all night struggling and came to class the next day and I went to the smartest person in class, who of course was a woman, and I said, "Did you get the answer to number two?"  She said, "Yeah, it's pi over three."  I said, "That's what I got."  And then on reflecting, I said, "How long did it take you?"  She said, "About twenty minutes."  I'd studied all night.  So I knew that that was not what I was cut out to do.  So I came and I told my father [William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.] that, I said, "I'm going to drop out of school."  He said, "What are you going to do?  You can't do that.  What will you do?"  I said, "I don't know, Pop, but I know what I don't want to do."  So I sold insurance for about a year and a half and then I came to New York.  I sold insurance in Trenton, New Jersey.  At first it was what they called industrial insurance.  People pay the premiums weekly.  In fact, the definition of industrial insurance is insurance of a face amount of a thousand dollars or less, the premiums paid weekly, sometimes monthly.  And you made your money in collections, plus the net.  You'd sell so much insurance and somebody would lapse and if you were ahead you made money on that in the end.  But this industrial insurance you had to collect the premiums, which meant you had to know the habits of your people.  One guy gets paid on Thursday and his first stop was at the bar.  You'd meet him before he spent all his money.  Another guy would come home on Friday, got paid on Friday, give his check to his wife.  And you had to know all their habits and I was pretty good at that, because I had a youthful appearance, I used to wear a hat.  And so I'd knock on the door and I'd wait until the person came to the door so they could see me take the hat off.  And I wore the hat to appear older.  But I'd take the hat off like that so I would appear courteous to people.  Especially since the white insurance people from Metropolitan [Life Insurance Company] and other companies, they were coming and calling people by their first name.  I never ever did that.  My parents taught me different than that.  So then one day I met a guy who was selling insurance in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And he was selling what they called ordinary insurance or whole life.  This is where the premiums are paid quarterly, sometimes annually for face amounts of a thousand [dollars] and up.  And he was doing things like taking people to lunch and sending flowers on their birthday.  I said, "Man, this is the way to go."  So he got me a job working for what they call a general agent in Philadelphia.  And I was pretty good at it.  I worked at that until I decided to come to New York.  I came to New York because that's where my wife [Joyce Burrows] was and I went to Brooklyn Law School [Brooklyn, New York] because I was a [Brooklyn] Dodgers [baseball team] fan.
Story_ID: 17576
Speaker 1: I want to take you back, if you don't mind, a few other things that I have questions about.  When you were young, what type of child would you say you were?  Were you introspective, were you sort of outgoing, were you rambunctious, were you fun loving?
Speaker 2: I was fun loving and outgoing, maybe rambunctious some of the time, but I certainly wasn't a moody, brooding, introspective child who sat in the corner and contemplated my navel or something.  I was pretty much an ordinary kid.
Story_ID: 17577
Speaker 1: Did you have dreams of what you wanted to be at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I hadn't the remotest idea.  Except that one has to appreciate when this was.  When the war [World War II] was going on, 1945, I was in high school [Trenton Central High School, Trenton, New Jersey], going to finish in June or May, I forget.  But I was going to turn eighteen in July.  And everybody's going to war.  People you knew were dying.  This is not Vietnam where people running off to Canada.  Everybody went to war.  The only one's who didn't go were those who were 4F [ref. to draft exemption classification of 'unfit for duty'], had some disability or those who were for some reason essential, police officers or whatever. So you never gave a second thought to not going.  The question was, which branch of the service.  And if you were drafted, if you could envision a long line of people in a queue, and you get up to the desk and the man says, "Where do you want to go?"  "Army."  "Navy."  "Next."  "Navy."  "Army."  Nobody got what they wanted.  So I figured--keep in mind now, I'm little, I'm seventeen years old, people are dying, and in my head they way to stay alive is to be well-trained.  And so therefore I wanted to be a Marine because I had a friend whose brother was in the [U.S.] Marine Corps and he looked so good in his uniform.  Incidentally, later on in my uniform I looked like a Boy Scout.  I was so little.  So I tried to enlist in the Marine Corps because only by enlisting could you select your branch of service.  So there was no recruiting office in Trenton, New Jersey.  The Marine Corps was an elite corps and there were no blacks at all in the Marine Corps prior to 1942.  So I went in succession to these places.  I went to Camden, New Jersey, to Newark, New Jersey, to New York, to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and when I went to places in New Jersey I was told, "We have our quota of Negro Marines," which is what we were called in those days.  When I want to New York and Philadelphia, they said, "You have to go to the state of your residence."  And so I just kept coming.  So I went back to Philadelphia and I was so persistent that they let me fill out the application and gave me a physical.  Then they told me I had high blood pressure.  Of course I didn't believe it and I figured it was just discriminating against me because they didn't want any black folks.  So I went to a doctor's office in Philadelphia, blood pressure normal.  Got home to Trenton, went to the family doctor who had been an Army surgeon, blood pressure normal.  I go back to Philadelphia, they take it on the left arm, right arm, lying down, standing up, always high.  We later concluded it was what they call a white coat syndrome, you are anxious and nervous and therefore your pressure goes up.  So they gave me a letter.  They wrote a letter to the draft board and gave me a copy saying if this recruit, if he requests the Marine Corps you should put him in the Marine Corps.  And that's how I got in the Marine Corps.  On the 10th of July I registered.  I requested immediate induction.  On the 28th, I went back, took my toothbrush as they say and I went on in.  And white marines were trained at Parris Island, South Carolina.  Black recruits went to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  And we took off from Jersey City [New Jersey] and there were a lot of white fellows and one other black besides me.  And since he was nineteen, I was eighteen, they have him the orders for the two of us.  And I'm writing postcard after postcard after postcard because I'm so proud I'm going to be a Marine, and thereby I remembered the itinerary.  Fortunately, because this clown missed the train in Washington [D.C.].  And so now I'm on the train, he's not there, I've got no ticket, no orders, no nothing, so when the conductor would come through I said, "I'm with them.  I'm with them."  And that worked until I had to leave them because they were going to South Carolina, I'm going to North Carolina, and I had to get off and get on a bus and that was my first real experience with the South.  I'd been to the South before.  I'd been home with my mother [Sarah Lucy] and father [William Harvey Dinkins, Jr.] to Newport News [Virginia] where the greatest thing for me was the fact that they had chicken in the middle of the week.  See back in Trenton and in New York, chicken was Sunday dinner.  Down there they just go out in the yard and you had chicken in the middle of the week. But I never really experienced the Jim Crow, the terrible treatment that blacks had in the South.  I went to buy a ticket for the bus and you had to go over there to that cage, you know, they raised it.  Anyway, I finally got to Jacksonville, North Carolina.  When I got off the bus the sargeant said, "Where are your orders, boy?"  And I tried to explain that this other fellow--I got three words out before he hit me and I'm bounced off the ground.  That was my introduction to the United States Marine Corps.  Because I--I learned fast.  And I happened to be in a company almost all of them were from Arkansas, this particular company.  And many of them had not finished high school and many of them were under age.  They'd put their age up to get a draft card to get a job and they got drafted.  And that was an experience in itself.  I tell audiences on occasion that the drill instructors were mostly black, DI's as we call them.  But the gunnery sergeants who taught us how to use an M1 rifle and the bayonet they were by and large white.  And they'd say sometimes, "All right niggers, fall in."  That was until we got ammunition.  Amazing how polite they got.  By anyway, when I got out of boot camp they put me in what they call malaria control.  You go out in the boondocks, into the bushes, the jungle, and forest and you're spraying DDT [pesticide].  It's the worst job in the world.  And the older guys were going to Pearl Harbor [Hawaii] for MP [military police] duty, but I was too young.  So when I filled out the papers, you know, upon being inducted, I pretty much described myself as almost an auto mechanic.  I'd worked in a garage changing tires and oil and like that.  So anyway, I finally talked my way into motor transport.  That was a pretty good job.  Except I found out--and I liked to drive, at least I did them.  And I found out that convoys never went anywhere except starting out at four o'clock in the morning.  And that was not a lot of fun.  And so I wanted to get where I had a regular job, I'd have a regular vehicle of my own.  And I worked up to driving--ultimately driving the executive officer of the base.  That was pretty good duty.
Story_ID: 17578
Speaker 1: You said that you got a pretty good position that you were driving the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the executive office of the base.  But before that, the first job I got after I was able to get out of the--just the pool as it were, the commanding officer of the company was a warrant officer and he said, "All right, I'll give you a job.  You can drive the ambulance."  He said, "However, it's a twenty-four hour, seven day a week job.  You and another fellow."  And this is may be the only man whose name I remember.  His name was Willy Twigs, from Georgia.  So Willy Twigs and I were the ambulance drivers.  So arranged between ourselves, you cover Tuesday,  I'll cover Wednesday, and whatever.  And we found out that the corpsman who were [U.S.] Navy people, that they loved to drive the ambulance 'cause they turned the siren on.  So we did, like, Huckleberry Finn [character from Mark Twain's 'Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'], you know, said, "I'll tell you what, we're going to let you drive the ambulance."  And these clowns would take that and exchange for that we got butter and eggs--because we had powdered eggs.  They had fresh eggs and ham and stuff like that.  So it was a pretty good deal.
Story_ID: 17579
Speaker 1: That experience in the service--so after thirteen months you say--you know, you--.
Speaker 2: I was discharged.  I got out in late August.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there--was there any thought about what you wanted to do at that point?
Speaker 2: None.  I was ready.  I had, I don't know how much money, maybe two or three hundred dollars, you know, severance pay and I'm ready to party.  I wanted to go to New York [New York].  And my stepmother, who was a Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] graduate, Class of '29 [1929], and she said, "No, you need to go to college."  She was concerned that I would just go off and, quote, "Never make anything of myself."  And she and my father and my mother, they were all insistent.  I said, "Well, this is August.  School starts in September, it's too late.  I can't go now."  And it happened that a man named Carroll Miller [educator], who was in charge of the Veteran's Affairs at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], who had been her classmate.  So she called him and he said, "No problem."  Pardon me--I had--my grades were sufficiently good in high school to take of it.  I had the G.I. Bill [educational benefit for veterans] that took care of the money, at least for a while.  And I got in Howard.  But the catch was, because I was a veteran, they would not let me live on the hill in the dormitories where the rent was $17.50 a month.  And I had my budget all planned.  I had to live out in northeast in one of three vet dorms.  They had three vet dorms out there, Guam, Wake, and Midway [named after Pacific islands].  And I lived out at Wake Hall, and in addition to the rent being $30.50 a month, you had to buy a trolley pass.  So it was almost double, almost exactly $35, instead of the $17.50 I thought I was going to pay.  The result was that sometimes we had 'month left at the end of our money', if you can follow that expression.
Speaker 1: Month left--meaning month left--nothing month--?
Speaker 2: Month left--days left when you run out of money.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.
Speaker 2: Month left at the end of your money.
Speaker 1: That's nice, okay (laughs).
Speaker 2: But we took care of that.  I remember one time with one crazy clown, we used to eat grass sandwiches.  But also you could go to cafeteria and you'd get a bowl of soup, then you pass the meat and put the meat down in the soup and put your plate and then bread on top of that and you get to the checkout counter and you pay for the bread and the soup.  But you got a pork chop down in there.  It was dishonest, but we did that.
Speaker 1: Now, I--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Desperate times make people do these things.
Story_ID: 17580
Speaker 1: So Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] though was a different experience for you wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we--those of us who were veterans, we talked about the youngsters that these kids at sixteen, seventeen, eighteen who they were going to have a class queen and all that.  And we rebelled against that.  In fact, we won.  We forced them to have a set of class queen kind of thing of the smartest girl and the smartest boy in the class.  That was our big victory.  That was our radical movement.
Speaker 1: How did you react to the black society that you experienced there?
Speaker 2: We didn't--we ignored them.  See, I was--that hybrid thing, I was young, but I was a veteran.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--you said you partied a lot during that time.
Speaker 2: I can remember we used to drink anything that was wet.  Oh, yeah.  But God is good,  God is good.  God took care of me and I managed to survive Howard and I have a lot to be thankful for.  Among other things there was Mrs. Alice Jackson Houston, taught freshman English.  And to this day I listen to people with Ph.D.s with screwed up grammar and I say, "Well they--for sure, they didn't have Alice Jackson Houston."  But she was really good.  Howard University is a fine institution.
Speaker 1: Who was dean at that time?
Speaker 2: Well the president was Mordecai Johnson [edcucator].
Speaker 1: (unclear, simultaneously) Mordecai--okay.
Speaker 2: He said, he said, "If you have a C class mind, you'll work it and you work it and you get a B class mind.  And you work it and your work it and it becomes an A class mind.  You got to work it."  He was good.
Speaker 1: Were there any other teachers that influenced you while you were at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well the ones I remember most, of course, my English teacher.  The head of the math department was David Blackwell.  He was small man--small in stature, short, and of slight build.  And he was brilliant. He got his Ph.D. at the University of Illinois [Champaign, Illinois] at age twenty-two.  His expertise was probability.  And one year, many, many years later--in fact, I graduated in 1950.  In 1990, I was a speaker at Berkeley, California, and I'm being introduced at the convocation they call it.  I'm being introduced to various professors and whatnot in their robes and all.  And I was introduced to David Blackwell and I said, "Blackwell?  Dr. Blackwell?"  He said, "Yes," he has a very soft voice.  And then he said, "Ah, Dinkins.  I remember you."  Of course, he didn't remember me really, I'm sure, but he was very polite.  But I hadn't seen him in forty years. And he was a professor there then.  A brilliant, brilliant man.  God--and he was the kind of guy that if you came to class and you didn't have--hadn't done your homework or hadn't done it sufficiently well, he'd call on you, he'd never embarrass you.  He'd say, "Well, perhaps tomorrow you'll be prepared."  He was just--he made you want to be prepared and be ready.  He was really good.

Speaker 1: Was there anything else about the Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] experience that influenced you, you know, in hindsight?
Speaker 2: Well, I had some great classmates, [U.S. Ambassador] Andrew Young [civil rights activist], among them.  We used to call him 'Little Andy Young'.  Andy was younger.  He came to Howard at age--I don't know, maybe sixteen--he was much younger and he a couple years behind me.  Andy, I guess, at least five years younger than I am, but he was the same--he is the same today as he was then.  And I love to tell the story of how Andy was in the [U.S.] Congress--and you want to wait for--.
Speaker 1: We're rolling.
Speaker 2: I recall--a story I like to tell a lot is how Andy was in the Congress--Andrew Young--and I was running for Borough President of Manhattan [New York].  I ran a lot, in fact, I ran three times before I succeeded, and people use dot say to me, "What do you do?"  And I'd say, "I run for borough president."  Anyway, Andy was going to campaign with me and I just knew--Andy was enormously popular--and so Andy out in the street walking the streets of Harlem [New York] with a bullhorn saying, "Vote for Dinkins," it was gonna really help a lot.  Well, [U.S. President] Jimmy Carter appointed him to the United Nations.  So I'm crestfallen.  On the one hand, I'm happy for my friend, he'll be an ambassador.  On the other hand, he won't be there to campaign.  Andy said, "Sure."  He walked--it rained that day, a light rain, and Andy was out there, this dignified ambassador, walking the streets of Harlem with me,  I'll never for get it.  I'm very grateful for him. He's a good friend.  But, anyway, there were lots of people that passed through Howard that were really great, great folks.  And I have friends of mine from Trenton [New Jersey], Fred Schenck, spelled S-C-H-E-N-C-K, and he went to Howard.  In fact, we were roommates for a while.  The Hayling brothers.  William Hartley Hayling, known as Bill, who lives out in California now, and his brother Leslie Hayling, whose son is my godson, Leslie Hayling, Jr.  And Bill Hayling has two daughters, Pamela and Patricia, and I'm the only one permitted to call her Patty.  And she's my goddaughter.  And have--we're friends, close friends to this day.  And we grew up together as little kids, you know, three, four, five years old.  So when you look at it, we're talking about seventy-year relationships and we're as close today as we ever were.
Speaker 1: When you said Andrew Young was just as he is today, was he a old young person?
Speaker 2: No, I don't mean that. I mean Andy is warm and friendly and the last thing he is is pretentious.  He's just a nice guy.  Very smart, very smart.  And just a very nice decent person.
Story_ID: 17582
Speaker 1: When you left Howard [University], you came back and that's when you started with the insurance, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no, first I went to Rutgers [State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Oh, you went to Rutgers--that's right--and decided--and math.
Speaker 2: I'm gonna test you later on this information
Speaker 1: I didn't know--oh that's right.
Speaker 2: Get the sequence right.
Speaker 1: (laughs) Okay, but you went for math, and then you went to your father and you said this is not--this is not going to work.
Speaker 2: And then I sold insurance for maybe a year and a half and then I came to New York [New York].  I got married in August--August 30th, 1953, the hottest day the world has ever seen.  And we had a big formal wedding.  We got married in St. Martin's Episcopal Church on Lenox Avenue, 122nd Street, Harlem [New York].  And our reception was at the Renaissance.  The Renaissance was pretty big in those days.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: She came walking down the senior walk at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And in 1949.  She had great legs.  And I said, "Hey, freshman."  'Cause freshmen aren't supposed to be walking on the senior walk.  So I was her first date at Howard.  And she later became a 'Que' Queen [Omega Psi Phi fraternity] and I was an Alpha [Phi Alpha fraternity], and boy did they resent this Alpha coming form New York to come down there and take out their 'Que' Queen.  But she--I have friends of mine who say that I should just give her a medal.  You know they have these medals come with the ribbons you put around your neck?  And they're right.  She has tolerated me all these years.  As a matter of fact, in 2003, August 2003, it will then be fifty years.  And so I though it'd be a great idea for our children--we have a little boy as I call him, he'll be forty-eight this year, our son and our daughter, Donna, naturally our son's name is David, I mean what else would it be?  For them to give us a party.  So some friends of mine, the Tisches, they had a 50th wedding anniversary big party at Four Seasons Restaurant [New York] about so big in six or seven panels, in color.  I went to Kinko's and had two made.  When I told them what I wanted to do they wouldn't even charge me.  I said, "I'd never been in the place."  I sent one to our son and one to our daughter.  Notice I said our daughter, because my wife might be listening.  And I sent a note saying, well, if you start saving your money--they had five years at that point, then you can throw us a party.  And my son called up and said that he didn't need to wait that long--McDonald's didn't require too much money.  But I'm still looking for this party they're going to throw me.
Speaker 1: It's nice.  Well, you deserve a party.
Speaker 2: My wife certainly deserves it.
Speaker 1: That's right, but both of you do. So you got married and you settled in New York.
Speaker 2: And we lived in Harlem.
Speaker 1: Where were you living?
Speaker 2: We lived in what's called the Riverton.  It's on the eastside of Manhattan, from 135th [Street] to 138th Street, 5th [Avenue] to Madison [Avenue].  And I used to ride that subway to Brooklyn [New York] to law school everyday.  I worked full-time at night in a liquor store and went to school full-time in the day.
Story_ID: 17583
Speaker 1: How did you end up wanting to go to law school?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I don't know. It was an option, I suppose.  You know, you thought of grad school.  I tried in May--what else was I going to do kind of thing.  And even then, I thought that law school would be a good foundation for anything.  You don't have to necessarily practice law, although I did.  I practiced from 1956 to 1975.  And I was right about that, and I still believe that today.  And I counsel young people that law school is an excellent foundation.  People think lawyers are smarter than they are.  Lawyers aren't any smarter than anybody else, but people see you have a law degree, you must know what you're talking about.  That is not so.  Although there's some obviously very brilliant lawyers.  I have a lot of friends of mine who are just brilliant, brilliant lawyers, great legal minds.  But everybody does not become [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall.
Story_ID: 17584
Speaker 1: Did you have any role models or people you knew who were lawyers?
Speaker 2: I mean, you came to this thinking--.
Speaker 1: Well, not when I started.  But subsequently I came to obviously admire people like [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall.  We had a classmate, she's dead now, a wonderful woman, who was the head of the--black woman, who was the head of the class, two years ahead of me.  And we admired her a great deal.  I have these senior moments when you can't find names.  But she--she was brilliant.  We all walked around class--around school like we had something to do with it, that we were responsible for her achievements.  But I--in later years, I came to know and admire a lot of many very fine black lawyers.  A law partner of mine, the man who first showed me where the courthouse was, was Fritz Alexander--Fritz W. Alexander II--Dartmouth College [Hanover, New Hampshire], NYU [New York University] Law School [New York, New York]--and we became partners, he and Thomas Benjamin Dyett, who was a dean of black lawyers in New York--D-Y-E-T-T.  And Mr. Dyett, and Fritz and I formed a law firm.  And Fritz went on later to become the first black to serve a full term--appointed a full term in our Court of Appeals, which is the highest court in New York [state].  And later the same Fritz Alexander resigned from the bench to become a deputy mayor with me.  As a matter of fact, he had been preceded by Milt [Milton] Mollen, who was the presiding justice of the second department, which is Brooklyn [New York] and certain other counties, and he had resigned the bench to become a deputy mayor for criminal justice and that whole area.  And then there was another man, George Daniels, who was then a criminal court judge, and Basil Paterson, who was later a law partner of mine.  I can talk about him a long time.  A wonderful man.  And Basil introduced me to George Daniels, and George resigned his judgeship to become my counsel.  And then when I left office, I reappointed him to the criminal court. He then got elected to the [New York State] Supreme Court and then was appointed to the federal bench and he is today a judge of the Federal District Court in New York.  Brilliant young man.  So there were three judges, Alexander, Mollen and Daniels, who resigned from the bench to come with me, and I said, "They need a psychiatrist.  They probably could get a fleet rate, sice there are three of them."  But they're all very fine people.  And then there was Bernie Jackson--Bernard Hampton Jackson.  Bernie and I were classmates in law school and he and Fritz Alexander helped me when I first ran for office.  I ran for the [New York State] Assembly in 1965.
Story_ID: 17585
Speaker 1: By the time you had actually, even maybe probably when you start selling insurance, but definitely by the time you went to law school you were hitting your stride.  You were sort of on a mission.
Speaker 2: No, I can't say that.  I'd love to be able to say that one morning in woke and I saw in the stars.  I didn't know what the hell I wanted to do.  I just wanted to--I wanted to get married, I wanted to raise a family. I loved children.  I maintain I'm in charge of kids, all children.  But it really wasn't until 1965, when Ray [J. Raymond] Jones [politician], who was 'The [Harlem] Fox'--he was the fist black county leader of what was then called Tammany Hall, New York County.  A brilliant, brilliant man, and he's responsible for the success of many.  Many people who passed through Carver Democratic Club that have succeeded and gone onto greatness.  At any rate, he one day said to me, "Boy, you want to run for the [New York State] Assembly?"  And I said, "Yeah, I guess. What do I know?"  Well, I wasn't supposed to win I guess, but we went out and we won.  And then I got reapportioned out of my seat.  And that same year I was elected a delegate to the Constitutional Convention of New York State, which is pretty much like the Assembly.  And from that moment on, I was hopelessly hooked on public service.  That's all I wanted to do.  And I ran, and I ran, and whatnot.  And I suppose--I joined a political club around 1958.  I got admitted to the [New York State] Bar in '56 [1956] and I put on a shirt and tie and I'd go down to my law office.  But at night I went to the liquor store, because that's what was paying the rent.  I wasn't making any money practicing law to speak of.  When I got to the point where I could give up the second job, as it were, I then joined a political club because that's what everybody did.  That's how you meet people, get clients, and so forth.  And a lot of people who came through Carver like [J.] Bruce Llewellyn [entrepreneur], whose name is perhaps known to you, [Justice] Constance Baker Motley, many who went on to greatness, Skids Watson--James Watson who was a federal judge, he's dead now too.  Many passed through there.  And Dr. Kenneth Clark [psychologist], another magnificent man.  Ken Clark was the chairman of my citizen's committee.  I needed somebody to give me respectability.  And Ken, bless his heart, he did that for me.  And he and Ray Jones were very close.  And Ken, of course, is most famous for the 1954, 'Brown vs. Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas'] case where it says his research that shows when you're a little child, when you choose from the black doll and the white doll and you grab the white doll.  Ken Clark is still alive.  A wonderful man.  He and his wife, Mamie Clark, who's gone--Dr. Mamie Clark, they're amazing people.  There are so many good people of accomplishment of color that a lot of folks don't know about.  That it's good that you're doing what you're doing.  I am flattered to be included in this esteemed company, but there are so many wonderful, great people.  I know many of whom that you have interviewed already.
Speaker 1: Well that's what we're really trying to show now.  I want--just one thing about Brooklyn Law School [Brooklyn, New York], well how many blacks were in your class?
Speaker 2: I don't know, maybe six or eight.  Not many then.
Story_ID: 17586
Speaker 1: When you came out [of Brooklyn Law School, Brooklyn, New York], how did you find your partners to--did you--when you came out were you--did you automatically go into--?
Speaker 2: No. Well see, when I came out, my father-in-law, Danny Burrows, B-U-R-R-O-W-S, he's another self-made man who had been in the Assembly in New York State, way back in 1939, and he knew Tom [Thomas] Dyett [attorney].  And so Mr. Dyett let me come in.  I'm sort of--almost an intern, you know, a gofer.  But Mr. Dyett was very nice to me, and he and I and Fritz Alexander [attorney], and then there was Kenneth Phipps--Kenneth MacArthur Phipps, who's dead now too, who was in the Assembly, later became a judge--and we were all in the same law office.  It was a very small firm.  It became a firm later.  It was just an association at that point.  And then Bernie [Bernard] Jackson joined us for a while.  Bernie and I, who had been classmates--we had been classmates in law school.  But I didn't have any pre-conceived plan.  And perhaps I should have had one.  Many years ago the very first congressional--I guess it was the first--but among the first [U.S.] Congressional Black Caucus galas, the big dinner they have, Ossie Davis was the speaker, and he said, "It ain't the rap, it's the map.  You need a plan."  And I suppose I should have had one.  I did not have a plan.  As a matter of fact, even when I ran for mayor, I did not--when I became borough president [of Manhattan], I never said, "Ah, one day I'll be mayor."  I mean [U.S. President] John [F.] Kennedy and [U.S. President] Bill Clinton, they said, "One day I'll be president."  I never thought that way.  I thought that I wanted public service and I enjoyed what I was doing.  And in the days when I was the borough president, borough presidents really had some power and influence, because there was something called a Board of Estimate that consisted of the mayor, [city] controller, what was then called president of [New York] City Council, and then five borough presidents, and they passed on the budget, major contracts, land use, it really was honest-to-God power.  As Borough President of Manhattan I was a significant individual, as Percy Sutton has been before me, and others before him, who were black.  Connie [Constance Baker] Motley, had been a borough president, Hulan Jack was the very first, Ed [Edward] Dudley.  There had been a very distinguished list that I joined.  Today it's a black woman, C. Virginia Fields is Borough President of Manhattan.  But when I--there came a time many of us; Percy Sutton, Basil Paterson, a lot of us had supported [Mayor] Ed Koch.  In 1977 there had been a primary with half dozen or more--six or seven candidates for the Democratic nomination including Percy Sutton.  It was Percy Sutton, Abe [Mayor Abraham] Beame who was the incumbent mayor, Ed Koch, [future New York Governor] Mario Cuomo--Koch of course became mayor.  Cuomo later became governor.  [U.S. Congresswoman] Bella Abzug--Herman Badillo later became a [U.S.] Congressman.  At any rate, all of these folks seeking this office--and we supported.  There was a run-off.  Nobody got 40 percent.  There was a run-off between Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo, so all the blacks had supported Percy Sutton, and then Percy led us and we supported Ed Koch, who at that time was a very liberal member of [U.S.] Congress.  He over--he served three terms and by the time he got in his third term he was no longer so seen by us.  And there was dissatisfaction with him, and we were looking for a candidate.  And folks came to me, and I don't mean to suggest that I was drafted or anything like that, but it was given me by some friends as an option, "You should think about this."  And I thought I could run for re-election as the borough president and be elected easily.  Now if you keep in mind I had run three times before I had succeeded and if I run for mayor and lose, I got zero.  But I was persuaded that this was--it was a smart thing, a good thing, a thing of value to do.  And so I ran.  Of course, no black had ever been elected mayor of New York, and I had three opponents: Ed Koch the incumbent, Dick [Richard] Ravitch a successful business man--all smart good people--Jay [Harrison J.] Goldin who had been [city] controller for I guess three terms.  Brilliant people and each was Jewish and the wisdom was that I would lose or at the very best, even if I finished second--first I wouldn't get 40 percent, if I finished second, I'm in a run-off with the lead person, I would lose because the supporters of the three Jewish candidates would gang up against me and I would lose.
Story_ID: 17587
Speaker 1: I want to go back a little bit to the Carver political club [sic. Carver Democratic Club] and Ray [J. Raymond] Jones, because I'm sort of intrigued about the history of that organization.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, someone should really do a book on the Carver Democratic Club and Ray Jones.  Now Ray did one book himself, but there are not many books about Harlem [New York, New York] politics.  By Harlem politics I don't mean to limit it to the geographical Harlem, because we love to say Harlem is a state of mind and Brooklyn [New York, New York] and Bronx [New York, New York], and whatnot, but an awful lot grew out of there.  J. Raymond Jones, an amazing man, and he's gone to his reward now.  But Ray Jones, so many brilliant people who passed through there, [U.S. Congressman] Charlie [Charles] Rangel got a boost from Ray Jones.  The story that one can tell of Charlie Rangel and Percy Sutton is just remarkable.  And Charlie Rangel is my brother incidentally.  We use the term brother, but Charlie is really my brother and he used to call me brother and his mother once said, "Well, why do you call the mayor brother?  He's not your brother.  You had one brother, Ralph and he's gone.  And you insist on calling the mayor brother."  Charlie tried to explain that we were very close politically and personally and that's why he called me brother.  That didn't go over too well with Mom and one day, it was Mother's Day and I sent her some flowers and a note that said, "Since my mother's [Sarah Lucy] gone and Charlie's my brother, therefore you're my mother too."  From then on I was tight with mom.  So much so that she was in the hospital and Charlie was not there.  His sister Frances was and Charlie called in and his mother said, "My other son is here."  Charlie said he didn't mind that so much, but instead of saying my son, the congressman, she was saying my son the mayor.  But Charlie Rangel and I are very close.  There's nothing I would not do for Charlie Rangel.
Story_ID: 17588
Speaker 1: Back to this--just the Carver Democratic Club.  Do you know when it started?  Did it start in the '20s [1920s] or did it start--?
Speaker 2: No, it was later than the '20s [1920s].  I guess in maybe the '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s].  When Ray [J. Raymond] Jones was (inaudible).  In those days three used to be tremendous battles for what we call party positions.  Party positions as distinguished from a public office.  Public office is what it sounds like.  Party positions are district leaders, county committee people and such things.  And if you go way back, they tell stories of how in the political clubs, white folks met upstairs and black folk met downstairs.  Same damn club. This is long before my time.  So it--there's some folks tossing in their graves, I guess, because blacks are coming into their own in politics in New York and elsewhere.  And even, I know those of us here in New York that are privileged to have some success we or I, at least, was inspired by people like [former Gary, Indiana mayor Richard] Dick Hatcher who I'm going to be on a panel with him in Tennessee or someplace sometime soon.  I think Dick Hatcher's a remarkable guy.  And they achieved--some of those who achieved, some blacks who achieved early on are entitled to an awful lot more than some of us who came along later for the reason that we were able to build on that which they had accomplished.  And I have always maintained that if a black in any discipline--I spoke just last night at a funeral for Mike Holomon, eighty-three [years old], physician, wonderful, wonderful gifted person.  His success, he was the first black to head up New York's Health and Hospitals Corporation, which consists of about thirteen hospitals.  And his success and the successes of others in any discipline assists the rest of us.  No matter, you could be an architect, an engineer, a physician, a lawyer, whatever.  Look at the Tuskegee Airmen.  [Media entrepreneur] Percy Sutton was a Tuskegee Airman, Roscoe Brown was the first pilot who was black.  The first pilot to shoot down a jet while flying a prop [propeller plane.]  Dr. Roscoe Brown, to this day, I call him 'The Fighter Pilot.'  Lee Archer, a lot of these wonderful men who came along at a time when they said, "First of all, you blacks aren't intelligent enough to fly."  Then when they proved they could fly, they said "Well, yeah, but you can't fight."  Then they not only fought, they fought so well that the white bomber pilots said, "We want those black guys to protect us because they never ever lost a bomber, not one."  So--but the fact that they were successful, that how to somehow help say, a [former U.S. Secretary of State] Colin Powell.  But Colin Powell would not have had the opportunity had not Cliff Alexander, who was secretary to the [U.S.] Army when they brought him a list of generals for promotion, said, "There's no blacks on the list."  Incidentally, that same Cliff Alexander came out of Carver Democratic Club.  I mean this stuff is all intertwined.  And so we--it truly is a fact that everybody stands on somebody's shoulders.
Speaker 1: Now Carver Democratic Club, I'm assuming there were lots of different clubs.
Speaker 2: There were other clubs, sure.
Speaker 1: But this was--.
Speaker 2: The preeminent club.  Especially because Ray Jones became the county leader.  And Ray and [U.S. Congressman] Adam [Clayton] Powell [Jr.] used to be opponents from time to time.  They'd be at each other's throats.  And sometimes when they would have a battle over something and they would resolve it and their subordinates would still be fighting not knowing that there had been resolution at this level.  But Adam Powell, of course, was a magnificent man who contributed much.  [U.S. Congressman] Charlie [Charles] Rangel succeeded him, defeated him by, I don't know, one hundred or two hundred votes.  And I'm proud of the fact that when Charlie ran for the [U.S.] Congress the first time, Fritz Alexander [attorney] and I 'wrapped his petition'.  Now the petitions come in sheets of paper.  Then they have to be bound and certain rules have to be followed before their submission to the board of elections.  And there are many, many stories of how a candidate would receive a phone call and his campaign manager or some person charged with the responsibility of caring for those petitions would say, "Damn if I can understand how the fire started."  Or, "I could have sworn I locked the car."  Or, "I don't know who did it."  Once your petition is gone, you have no candidacy.  In fact the expression was, "You sleep with your petition under your pillow."  So I'm proud of the fact that Charlie Rangel permitted Fritz Alexander and me to wrap his petitions, that we had that good relationship.
Speaker 1: Now, so you got involved--so Ray Jones, does he see something in you and that's why--?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't know.  Maybe he did.  Maybe he did.  Maybe he did, I don't know.
Speaker 1: He had to.  Ok, did he have a white sponsor of any sort?  Was he, was it like--.
Speaker 2: No, he was his own man, but he was very close to Robert Wagner, the mayor.  He was close to [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson.  But he was no front man for any white person.  Hell no.  Ray Jones was Ray Jones.  He was terrific.
Story_ID: 17589
Speaker 1: Actually are you still with Danny Burrows, I mean are you working as an intern in his firm or you've already--?
Speaker 2: No, Danny Burrows is my father-in-law.
Speaker 1: Right, I know, but you started out--oh, he personally referred you to--.
Speaker 2: He referred me to Tom [Thomas] Dyett [attorney]--.
Speaker 1: Tom Dyett, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And I was at that law firm.  I was there when I started in the political club in around 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't want to fail to mention someone else from this Harlem [New York, New York] community and that's Basil Paterson.  Now, he is especially significant these days because [H.] Carl McCall, who is black and who is a state comptroller and was a candidate for the Democratic nomination for governor in this state [New York], and if he succeeds he's got to win a primary against Andrew Cuomo [politician], and then defeat the incumbent Governor [George] Pataki, he will become only the second black governor in the state.  Although in Oregon, Jim Hill is running, the treasury [sic. state treasurer], he's black, he's running.  And, of course, [former governor] Doug Wilder in Virginia. Now, the reason Basil is so significant is, Basil was a good friend of mine, we were partners at one point I might add.  And Basil was a deputy mayor, thanks to Percy Sutton in light who when we supported [Mayor Ed] Koch way back when, and then he became secretary of state of New York State.  And then he ran for lieutenant governor.  Now in running he won sixty-one out of sixty-two counties in this state. The only county he didn't win was Suffolk County from which his opponent, a member of [U.S.] Congress named Jerome Ambro came.  Sixty-one out of sixty-two counties, remarkable feat.  Then he joined with Arthur Goldberg because governor and lieutenant governor wanted to run as a pair much like you vote, cast one ballot for president and vice president of the United States.  Arthur [Joseph] Goldberg, former United States Supreme Court justice [1962-1965], former Secretary of Labor, former United Nations ambassador [1965-1968] and the lousiest damn candidate you ever saw.  And Basil went down to defeat with Goldberg, but he was that close to becoming the first black governor.  So today as [New York state Comptroller] [H.] Carl McCall runs for governor, I say that he stands on Basil Paterson's shoulders.  It's very important I think that we recognize and understand the contributions made by so many.  You will never hear this from Basil.  He'd never, ever--we're very close friends and, in fact I'm fond of his son, David Paterson who is a very accomplished New York state senator, legally blind, got through law school and is the deputy minority leader in the Senate.  And so I love to tell people that David used to be Basil Paterson's son, now he is really the father of the New York state senator.  But he is a remarkable guy.  Lots of wonderful people here, and women, [Hon.] Constance Baker Motley [federal court justice] among them.  She's terrific--a lot of good people.

Speaker 1: Were you sort of slated by Ray, Ray [J. Raymond] Jones [political leader] in, I mean in the spot for [New York State] Assembly?
Speaker 2: Assembly.  Well, he selected me and the club quote "carried my petitions" is how I got on the ballot to run in the primary.  I ran against a fellow named, Franz Leichter who came out of a reform club, which is why Ken Clark's [Dr. Kenneth Clark, psychologist] chairmanship of my Citizen's Committee was so important.  And I defeated Franz in the primary and Franz Leichter and I have been friends ever since.  But had it not been for Ray Jones, I would never, ever have had the opportunity.  About that, there's no doubt.  No, unquestionably.
Speaker 1: Now assemblyman is pretty important here, right?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a state legislature.  State legislature consists of 150 members statewide.  And, as a matter of fact, an interesting story that in 1965 the assembly was in a deadlock to select its speaker.  A speaker is what it sounds like, it's the head person, but he's chosen by the majority party.  And the Democrats were in the majority.  But they couldn't agree.  It was a deadlock between a man named Stanley Steingut and Tony Travia, each from Brooklyn [New York, New York].  And after thirty days or more, [governor Nelson A.] Rockefeller, a Republican, threw Republican votes to Travia and he became speaker.  So the next year we had an expanded assembly of 165 members because the federal court had so ruled.  But of the 165 approximately ninety were Democrats.  But of the ninety  Democrats, you had eight or nine blacks, so that if you subtracted our number from the ninety , they didn't have a majority of 165.  So Percy Sutton, [U.S. Congresswoman] Shirley Chisholm, some of these names I know are known to you, we went in and said to Tony Travia, "Look we're politicians too.  We got to take something home.  And without our vote you're going to be embarrassed, you wont' have a majority."  And the SEEK program was born that night, Search for Elevation in Education and something, something.  And so it's a program that assists minority students--.
Speaker 1: Search for Elevation in Education and Knowledge.
Speaker 2: That's it.  And, I meet, to this day, even now, in 2002, I will encounter people who tell me that they're a product of that program and they give me credit, but it wasn't Dinkins.  It was Dinkins and Sutton and Chisholm and a whole bunch of us.  But in my head, you see, all of that is linked to Ray Jones, Carver Democratic Club and all the people who helped me get where I was in the first damn place.  And the leadership of Percy Sutton and Shirley and whatnot, that helped produce some youngster who went on to college and has gone off to do great and wonderful things.  And that's why when you meet someone who says, "I have a master's degree and I worked my way through college.  I had two jobs.  Nobody ever helped me.  I did it all myself."  They're wrong.  They too stand on somebody's shoulders.
Speaker 1: Now, did you like being an assemblyman?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it.  I loved it.  I wasn't there but an hour and a half though.  You know.  I lost my seat immediately after one year.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had an apportionment and it had 165 Districts reduced to 150, so my seat no longer existed.  And it was at that time that I ran for delegate to the Constitution Convention, which was pretty much the same kind of thing.  We met even in the same chambers, sat at the same desks.  In fact, Tony Travia, the speaker, was the president of the convention.  And it's a long time, it's over three or four months so it's very much like the legislature.  Though, by then I'm hopelessly hooked on public service.
Speaker 1: And for a delegate, how long was that?
Speaker 2: It was three or four months.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh I see.
Speaker 2: We're producing a product, a proposed constitution, a new constitution, which the people in their wisdom voted down.
Speaker 1: And then what--so then what happened from 1965, 1966?  Did you hold public office until you became board--on board of elections (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I was president of board of elections around '71 [1971] or '72 [1972].  I became the--.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying from '66 [1966] to '72 [1972], were you really mainly practicing and involved in (inaudible) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Practicing and involved in campaigns and whatnot, but I didn't hold any office in that period.  No, I held no public office during that period, from the time I--from '67 [1967] to '71 [1971].  But it was only four or five years.
Speaker 1: What campaigns are you involved in?  Now, Adam Clayton--.
Speaker 2: Anyone that came down the pike.
Speaker 1: Okay, [U.S. Congressman] Adam Clayton Powell [Jr.], when did he get, he was out in--.
Speaker 2: [U.S. Congressman Charlie] Rangel defeated him in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: In the '70s.
Speaker 2: It was later.

Speaker 1: How did the whole Board of Elections, how did that come into your plan?  I mean, is that something you sought or were you once again sought out for it or--?
Speaker 2: No, that's a highly political position.  You get, you get there through really political involvement.  And in those days, there were only four commissions of the elections.  And those four people elected one of their number as president and I was elected president.  And in those days you had to have a Republican from New York County and a Democratic from New York County.  And a Republican from Kings County or Brooklyn [New York], and one from the other party.  You had to be a member of one of those two parties in one of those two counties. If you're from the Bronx  or Staten Island or Queens [New York city boroughs], you couldn't be a commissioner of elections.  Finally the courts overruled all that.  Today there are ten commissioners, one Republican, one Democrat from each of the five boroughs.  Each borough is itself a county in New York.  And they in turn appoint an executive director who runs it.  In my day it was different.  So all the while I was involved in politics, helping others seek office, as I do even today.

Speaker 1: When did you become City Clerk [of New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: 1975.
Speaker 1: And that was--you ran for that office?
Speaker 2: You get elected or selected by the City Council [of New York, New York].  And what happened there was Paul O'Dwyer, whose gone to his reward, he was in those days the president of city council, he and Percy Sutton had the idea that this might be good for me politically.  And they called me and I in turn called  [Abraham] Abe Beame who was the mayor [of New York], who really technically had nothing to do with the appointment, but I told him I had an interest in it.  He said okay and he hung up.  And he and I from that day to this never discussed it, but obviously the word came down.  And I was elected, overwhelming vote, to be clerk.  City clerk runs the marriage license bureau among other things.  So for ten years that's what I did.  I did it until I got elected [Manhattan] borough president in '85 [1985].  And then for four years as mayor I could perform marriage ceremonies and then when I was no longer mayor, I could not.  But I discovered that they changed the law in the late '80s [1980s] to permit former judges to marry people.  This is state law that says who may perform marriage ceremonies.  So it seemed to me quite logical that former mayors should have the same authority.  So I went to Denny [Dennis] Farrell, a good friend and influential member of the assembly and to Shelly [Sheldon] Silver, the speaker.  And as people say to politicians, "You know I never asked you for anything."  They said, "Oh my God, what's he want?"  I said, "I just want to change the law."  So they did and the governor signed the bill on July 3, 1996.  So then I did some ceremonies.  I got a call from Abe Beame, the former mayor.  He said, "David, I see you married somebody.  Can you do that?"  I said, "Yeah, Abe, and so can you."  So he later performed a ceremony for his grandson.  So I'll do one for anybody who happens to ask me, but I did [U.S. Congressman] Charlie [Charles] Rangel's daughter, I've got upcoming Percy Sutton's granddaughter, Bill Cosby's, one of his daughters.  I did David Belafonte.  I'll do one for anybody.  I mean, are you married?
Speaker 1: No, I'm looking.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: You must remember that marriage is a supreme sharing of adventure in the most intimate of human relationships.  It's a joyous uniting of a man and woman whose comradeship and mutual understanding have flowered into love.  And I always tell people, you must remember that it is rarely the great things that destroy a home.  It's more often the small things.  If you together--if each of you take care of the small things, together you can defend your home against the great things.  If somebody was standing next to you, you'd be damn near married now.
Speaker 1: (Laughing) With your blessing, that's right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 17593
Speaker 1: I want you to talk just a little bit about you and [U.S. Congressman] Charlie [Charles] Rangel, what really cemented your relationship under what--you met through the Carver Democratic Club?
Speaker 2: Not really.  We met before, even before that.  Charlie Rangel was just starting to practice law and I was already practicing law.  Charlie had been a dropout from high school, went into Korea, was a hero, decorated, a couple of medals, Purple Heart and some other medal.  And then came back--went back to college, or went to college, finished high school, went to college and then to law school.  And he bought some bookcases from Tom [Thomas] Dyett [attorney] when he was setting up is law office.  And we were, of course there weren't that many lawyers who were black so we sort of all knew each other. And Charlie and I were friends from way, way back, long before we were political associates.  And his association with Ray [J. Raymond] Jones [political leader] came late in the game.  Before that he was first with Sutton and then against Sutton.  They were on the same side and then different sides over the years.  But for all the times that mattered, they've been very close.  And Charlie owes much to Percy Sutton and Percy Sutton would be the first to say that Charlie Rangel has contributed to his success as well.
Story_ID: 17594
Speaker 1: And Percy Sutton, when did you first meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  In the late '50s [1950s] or early 60s [1960s].  He and his brother Oliver were practicing law and his brother Oliver, whose dead now, later became a judge.  But--and Percy and Basil Paterson especially were very active in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Each had been at one time or another president of the local branch of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Now when it came time to really run for borough president, how did that (inaudible)?
Speaker 2: Well, I first ran in 1977, when Sutton ran for mayor.  He had been--was at that time president of the borough Manhattan [New York, New York].  And he was going to run for mayor.  And I remember the day he told me he was going to run for mayor.  I said, "Wow, that's great."  And then twenty seconds later I said, "What about borough president?"  He said, "You ought to run for that."  And, of course, there were several other candidates.  There were four candidates and I finished third.  And then the next election, I ran against the incumbent who was Andrew Stein.  And I almost beat him.  Then the third time around, he ran for a different office and I ran and I defeated a fellow named Nadler.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, just lay, in a short period of time, the dynamics of borough president and a black person winning from Manhattan, that's--.
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, there had been other blacks who were president of Manhattan--borough or Manhattan.  First was Hulan Jack.  Then I think Ed Dudley, then [Hon. Constance] Connie [Baker] Motley, then Percy Sutton.  And when Percy Sutton became borough president of Manhattan, that decision really was in the hands of [J. Raymond] Ray Jones, politically and he designated Sutton.  I won't take you through the machinations of how that happened, but that's why he got to be.  Now, Percy's leaving to run for mayor and I want to run for borough president of Manhattan and I did.  But I had three white opponents.  And I finished third in a field of four.  Four years later, in 1981, I ran again and this time I ran against the incumbent, Andrew Stein, and I almost beat him. And then the next term, 1985, I succeeded against Gerald Nadler, who today is a member of the [U.S.] Congress.  The reason that the borough presidency was so important is prior to July 1, 1990, there was something called the Board of Estimate in New York.  This entity consisted of the five borough presidents, the mayor, the controller and the president of the city council.  And they passed on the budget and all major contracts and land-use items.  So it was a position of real authority and power.  It's different today than it was then.
