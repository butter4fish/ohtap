Speaker 1: First it's descriptive, it's corrective, and it's prescriptive.  By descriptive, I mean, it tells young people who we are.  It provides a description of the substance of black culture and heritage in history.  Corrective; it challenges racist stereotypes and the weight of prejudicial scholar- pseudo-scholarship about us, and you know it's hard, it's impossible to live in this country without being appalled almost every other day or every day by the racist things that even people in power say.  A few days ago William Bennett, speculating well perhaps to get rid of crime we should abort black babies--now of course all--he was unfairly judged.  I just received an e-mail a few minutes ago, from a colleague saying how terrible it was that everyone jumped on William Bennett.  While in truth, it's, it's true; it's just that we shouldn't use those draconian means to control crime.  To prescriptive; that is intellectuals who think of history--I mean who think of the task of scholarship to be broadly of social change and service. How do we enhance and empower people with ideas.  So, descriptive, corrective, prescriptive; is what the intellectual tradition is.  I try to convey that to young people and give that to them, and so they can make of it as they wish, but they first have to know their heritage before they can create new history.

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, you are?
Speaker 2: I'm Manning Marable.  I'm a professor of public affairs, history, political science, and African American studies at Columbia University in the City of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Your date of birth?
Speaker 2: May--I, I was also going to add; I'm also the director of the Center for Contemporary Black History and we're in the center right now.  My date of birth is May 13th, 1950.
Speaker 1: Your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dayton, Ohio.

Speaker 1: And I wonder what will be here a hundred years from now or will it still remain?
Speaker 2: Columbia, because Columbia is more of a real estate company that does education as a side line.  Given real estate values in New York, it's a good bet that Columbia, the real estate company, will be here.

Story_ID: 579847
Speaker 1: We will start by talking about your family, your mother's side and your father's [James Marable, Sr.] side, and we will start with your mother's side.  So, if you can just state your mother's name for me and spell it out?
Speaker 2: June Morehead [June Morehead Marable], M-O-R--J-U-N-E, M-O-R-E-H-E-A-D, Marable.  My mother was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Born?
Speaker 2: Was born June the 8th, 1924, in Columbus, Ohio.  She was the second child of six of Minnie [Minnie Morehead] and Jack Morehead [Jack W. Morehead].  My grandfather, Jack Morehead, was an A.M.E, African Methodist Episcopal minister.  He was like A.M.E. ministers, an itinerant.  He moved from one church to another, usually once every two years, so my mother grew up in West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, and Eastern Ohio, in the area where--in that diocese or in that locale of the A.M.E. church, in and around within a hundred miles of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you about your mother do you know, did, I mean what--did your mother talk to you about her life as a child, her childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your mother's childhood?
Speaker 2: She grew up in rural Ohio and in West Virginia during a time when there was de facto segregation, especially in West Virginia.  She grew up in a African American--in, in a household of relative privilege, a black minister's family.  J.W. Morehead was not a wealthy man.  He had attended high school and had graduated from high school, but was unable to afford going to college, but he read extensively, and the household was filled with hundreds of books.  She learned in high school how to type and became so proficient that when the outbreak of World War II [WWII] occurred, she worked for three years as a typist, as a secretary at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base [Dayton, Ohio] in Columbus--in Dayton, Ohio, where she saved her money and was in the fall of 1944 able to enroll at Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] in Xenia, Ohio [sic.]. And she graduated in--she transferred and went into Central State University [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in 1947 when the split occurred between the religious, the parochial side and the state side of that institution, going with Dr. Charles H. Wesley, who was the president, the first president of Central.  She was the salutatorian, graduating second in the class of the first graduating class of Central State University in 1948.
Story_ID: 579848
Speaker 1: When she [Marable's mother, June Morehead Marable] graduated [from College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], she said, if I have a child, I would like to have my child become a historian in honor of Dr. Wesley [Charles H. Wesley] who was of course the historian of Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], a leading figure in the formation and development, rather, of the Association for the Study of Negro Life in History [sic. Association for the Study of Negro Life and History; Association for the Study of African American Life and History].  That's why I'm a historian.  It was decided before I was born, and my mother had a great hand in it and in my development when I was a child, beginning in the second summer of the second grade.  My real education did not occur in the classroom.  It occurred because my mother was a school teacher and gave and dumped books for me to read that were years ahead of the reading cycle or mandated by the public schools. So by the time I was at the end of elementary school, I was reading high school text.  By the time I was in junior high, I was reading college history books.  I was reading books by historians, nuanced articles, when I was in high school [Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio].  So, I had a very rigorous training imposed by my mother, and very much like the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams] or Tiger [Tiger Woods], I loved it.  I loved it.  And I loved to write, and she encouraged that.
Story_ID: 579849
Speaker 1: What was your mother's [June Morehead Marable], your mother's siblings like?  Did, did she ever talk about what some of the family traditions were, what Christmases were like, what holidays were like in the home?
Speaker 2: They had a very patriarchal, conservative, even authoritarian sort of home.  Reverend Morehead [Jack W. Morehead] was very con- class conscious, and he imposed a kind of stern patriarchy over the household and the family.  The children referred to their father--even the language they used was a kind of a merger between God and the image and the role of their father in their household.  They referred to him as daddy or deity, almost like a deity.  That's how my mother pronounces daddy, deity, right, so deity, daddy get merged; a little disturbing.  I met the reverend when I was a boy and--but he was, he was a character, but the extraordinary thing about, about J.W. [Jack W. Morehead] was his remarkable ability to perform at the pulpit.  He was a terrific ser- sermonizer. He gave erudite, very informed, richly, richly illuminating, scholarly sermons, drawing from literature, drawing from scholarship as well as from the Bible.
Speaker 1: Now what's his--your--this is your mother's father, Reverend Morehead?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What's his background?  When he was born, where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: He was from North Carolina.  His background is kind of obscured in mystery that he himself imposed. From a family that had some Native American, Cherokee background in the late 19th century.  His family--at some point when he as a teenager or his early twenties, he left--in the early 20th century--he left North Carolina, moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], met his wife [Minnie Morehead], they got married, and he decided to become a minister. And he deliberately refused to speak substantively about his family.
Speaker 1: Now did you know his mother and father, your great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: The only thing I knew was about Aunt Clara [ph.] and Uncle Oscar [ph.] who lived in Columbus, Ohio. Clara was his sister and Oscar was her son.  I knew that family.  They were, they were business people.  They owned some businesses and real estate.
Speaker 1: What businesses did they own?
Speaker 2: I was a small child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I don't, I can't recall, but they came from the black middle class in Columbus, Ohio, on the East Side of the city.
Speaker 1: So, you said that Reverend Morehead, Morehead was class conscious.
Speaker 2: Very.
Speaker 1: What does that mean?
Speaker 2: His home had to be im- impeccable and immaculate. That you played the piano.  You dressed in very heavily starched clothing.  You sat quietly at church.  You came home, you sat in the parlor on Sunday afternoons.  I was incredibly bored out of my mind as, as a kid having to go through this regime. And because my father [James Marable, Sr.] had persuaded my mother to became an Episcopalian, so I grew up in a much more relaxed religious environment.  Every time--I used to dread having to go and spend these insufferable Sundays or you know the other kinds of rituals that you go--or Wednesday nights at, for the, you know that were imposed by the regime of the A.M.E.s [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: The bible class on Wednesday nights, was it bible class (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Story_ID: 579850
Speaker 1: So Reverend Morehead [Jack W. Morehead] was, was, was very concerned about class and so you sort of had these very middle class values or--piano playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  My mother [June Morehead Marable] brought that into the marriage too.
Speaker 1: Now where did they get them from, themselves, these values from themselves?
Speaker 2: You know the African American middle class has been around for a couple of hundred years.  I mean I just gave a lecture on this today that prior to the Civil War blacks, free blacks in New Orleans [Louisiana] owned fifteen million dollars' worth of real estate. In Charleston [South Carolina], in 1860, blacks owned three-quarters of a million dollars of real estate in Charleston, South Carolina as Fort Sumter was being fired upon.  There was a, what, they called it a free, what, a brown society that had been formed in Charleston, of free African Americans who actually, if not actively sided with the Confederacy, then when the Yankees fired back and started--homes started catching fire of the Confederates in South Carolina, in Charleston, that they had fire bucket brigades to put out the fires.  So, the black petty bourgeoisie has been around a long time.  They were just a part of it.  This was the elite that ran, you know part of that elite came out of the chur- our churches and many of them--you know A.M.E. Church Review [The A.M.E. Church Review], I'm sure, J.W. [Jack W. Morehead] read that, just fantastic material.  We had great intellectuals.
Speaker 1: Who were some of them, the--out of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 2: Coming out of the A.M.E. church--I mean I'm thinking, well right now I'm drawing a blank on this, and I'm probably gonna kick myself in a few minutes. But there were a number of people who came out of the A.M.E. church generally who ended up in the bishop leader--as bishops, who were just extraordinary intellectuals, who--their, their intellectual leadership created the kind of both aura and the expectation of a high level of discourse.
Story_ID: 579851
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your mother [June Morehead Marable] then.  And when you were a child, what did your mother--what conversations did you have with your mother about race, about being black?  Did you have conversations like that?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  My mother (laughter)--my, well you know the, the difference between Frederick Douglass and Martin R. Delany [Martin Delany] is kind of like the difference between my mother and my father [James Marable, Sr.].  My mother was, was a stone cold integrationist.  Yeah, she was about assimilation.  She wanted to be next to the white man, wanted to be with white folk, live like white folk, emulated their standards of beauty and culture, so that that's what she wanted. And it was hard to actually be cri- be critical of her because the pre- the dominant point of view by most African American middle class people during the first half of the 20th century, was assimilationist, that is to be equal meant to live and be--have those things that are of value by middle class white Americans, to make that available to, to Negro Americans.  That's what we wanted.  We wanted, not just the right to vote or to live or to be able to purchase a house in areas that had been redlined and segregated from us, it was also to be able to attend colleges or universities where we had merit and we should be admitted, but we were denied access because of the color of our skin. That no one should--you know, there were over fifteen states when I grew up in the '50s [1950s] where it was illegal for blacks and whites to marry each other.  They were opposed to anti-miscegenation laws.  The Loving decision [Loving v. Virginia] didn't occur until 1967.  So, those kinds of overt forms of discrimination my mother believed in fighting against and--but culturally, she took pride, a curious pride, in Negro heritage, but it was always from the vantage point of how we could be more American.
Speaker 1: Give me an example of, of being more American.
Speaker 2: When I was twelve; eleven or twelve years old after John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was elected president, I read a letter to the president and I said well you know no offense but you know I, I'm really glad you won.  I was for you and the campaign, but why, why don't you wear a hat? You know, wearing a hat would be judicious.  It would be the prudent thing to do and I'm worried about your health.  All right, so I sent the letter in and I got a response from President Kennedy. Thank you for the letter, et cetera, et cetera.  Well, my mother thought this was extraordinary.  Her son, eleven years old, wrote to the president and gets a letter back.  She sent it to the newspaper.  They, did, did a story on it.  They sent a reporter to the house.  I was interviewed.  It was a big deal, right.  No offense, but why not wear a hat.  So, positioning her son to take in a way publicity, but it's framed in a way that is integrationist.  Another way, which is actually more of an activist mode.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], and this was--I go back in my life, and there have been maybe about a half dozen events that have changed the course of my life; this was one.  On April the 4th, 1968, Martin Luther King, Jr., was assassinated.  I wrote a newspaper column.  I was seventeen years old at the time, I was a senior in high school [Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio].  I wrote a column called Youth Speaks Out for the Dayton Black Express [sic. Dayton Express].  You know I was a youth, I was speaking out, Youth Speaks Out, okay.  But, I was very precocious; was writing a newspap- weekly newspaper column and I'm seventeen years old.  My mother says it's a great idea.  She thought of this on Sunday at church, after church, you should fly to Atlanta [Georgia] and cover the funeral for the newspaper.  I'd never flown anywhere in my life.  She packed me up, I got on a plane, went to Dayton, Ohio on Monday, flew to Atlanta, was met by my aunt or my, actually my cousin, Joanne [ph.], and we--I spent the night about twenty miles outside of Atlanta and the next day I got on a bus around 4 a.m., 4:30 in the morning. I found--I went to the center of town, Peachtree Street.  I walked and I found Ebenezer Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] around 6:30 a.m., and I was the first person there and I covered the whole thing. And I walked along with the meal team and the wagon and I saw you know--witness, I bore witness to the funeral and the march from Ebenezer all the way to Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] to AU, and I heard Marian Anderson sing and I heard Dr. Benjamin Mays speak that remarkable, glorious funeral oration at AU.  I saw it all.  I was there because of my mother, because she wanted me to be a part of that history. And what that was about was making sure her son would be a legit who would be a part of a process that was essential--for her not just Negroes, but American history and very much it resound, it re- resounds of, "I, too, am America" ['I, Too'].  This is Langston Hughes.  That's my mother.
Story_ID: 579852
Speaker 1: She [Marable's mother, June Morehead Marable] saw that and fashioned her son, the environment for her son to be in a certain kind of mode, middle class certainly, but profoundly American and, and it redounds in ways even in unthinking ways like one of my recent books, 'The Great Wells of Democracy' ['The Great Wells of Democracy: The Meaning of Race in American Life,' Manning Marable], I'm sure my mom would love that.
Speaker 2: Because?
Speaker 1: Because it speaks to the possibility of America becoming better, because there is something deep in the soul of the nation.  There are deep wells of, of democracy and freedom that even though its founders may have owned slaves and were racist and filled with contradictions, that it is worth fighting for, for Negro--for people of African descent to find freedom through being wholly and fully American.  That is what she believes deeply, right, and for her, her spin on that is to be deeply American, is to be white.  That is, that is whiteness and Americanness for her are really kind of inseparable.  That's where she and I depart (laughter).
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: We part company on that.
Speaker 2: Right.  What did that, did you understand that as a child that to be American meant to be white, from your mother?
Speaker 1: That is not explicitly, it was never explicitly stated that boldly.
Speaker 2: No not stated, but it was implied.
Speaker 1: It was always implied, always.
Speaker 2: And how did you internalize that?
Speaker 1: In that there were certain social and cultural conventions that one went through to be a gentleman, a young gentleman.  So, how, I mean how this got played out in my life, it was through the Negro club thing.  You know black clubs have been around for about two, two hundred and fifty years and in the early 20th century, Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] helped to fost- found the Alpha Phi Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  Well the sister organization of the Alphas is AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  Our house as I grew up was pink and green.  You get the picture?  My mother is like an AKA's, AKA. Her--.
Speaker 2: Now was your mother light skinned?
Speaker 1: No, she's kind of like medium, so she just barely passed the brown bag test of white, which is sad (laughter).  You had to go, this is kind of, really retro and I hate that stuff, but--.
Speaker 2: Let's hear though, go ahead.
Speaker 1: It's terrible.  It shows just the profound degree of, of self-loathing that is informed by the imposition of, of racism and how people hate their own image.  I'm a Malcolmite [Malcolm X] in this.  I'm, I'm a Frantz Fanonian [Franz Fanon] about this stuff.  And it's really tragic and sad, but it's very true that it is impossible to live under a regime that negates your humanity as people of African descent and not be scarred by that process over many generations.  People bear the scars of that and one of the manifestations that is cruelest is a hatred of this, the color of your own skin and your hair.  Malcolm was very eloquent about that.  My mother fried her hair, believed in light, bright, almost white; wanted her son to date girls who have long flowing hair, light-skinned from a good family, you know, only a good family would do, which when I was five years old she joined the Jack and Jill's [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.].  So, Jack and Jill became the framework of my cultural life along with attending St. Margaret's Episcopal Church [Dayton, Ohio].
Story_ID: 579853
Speaker 1: I think politically my father [James Marable, Sr.] was active in Urban League.
Speaker 2: So, if you mother [June Morehead Marable] was an integrationist, what was your father?
Speaker 1: My father was basically a black nationalist.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about him some.  What was his date of birth?  What was his family, what was he like?
Speaker 1: Dad was born in--near Wedowee, Alabama, in Randolph County north, northea- western part of Randolph County on November the 21st, 1921.  He was the third child of thirteen, of Fannie [Fannie Heard Marable] and Manning Marable.
Speaker 2: So you were named after him?
Speaker 1: That's right.  He had nine sons, didn't name any after him.  Manning didn't name any of his kids after himself, so I was the--became [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable.  So, I became a pet of my grandmother, Fannie.
Story_ID: 579854
Speaker 1: We're talking about your father [James Marable, Sr.] and being a nationalist. Your father was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.  Well, my dad just grew up in a very different environment.  They didn't even have electricity in the '20s [1920s] where he lived.
Speaker 1: And what, was this in Alabama?  What town was it in, in Alabama?
Speaker 2: It's [Wedowee, Alabama] in, near Randolph, it's near, it's in Randolph County [Alabama] near Roanoke [Alabama].  They lived in a more rural area than even Roanoke.  Roanoke was the big city for my father, growing up.  My family goes back to Morris Marable, my great-grandfather, who was a slave.  He was born Morris Robinson in 1845 near Rome, Georgia.  He was sold at the age of nine according to my grandmother, Fannie Marable [Fannie Heard Marable], for five hundred dollars by the man who was both his owner and his biological father.  He was sold to a white man named Marable.  Marable took (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Before you go on, he was sold by his biological father who was a white man also, yes?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was his owner.
Speaker 1: He was his owner?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So, his owner sold him to another white man, Marable?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When he was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Nine years old.  Continue.
Speaker 2: My great-grandfather told my grandmother the last time he saw his mother was on, when he stood on the auction block and tears were streaming down her face.  She wiped her tears, she wore a big white apron, so she was a household slave, and she wiped the tears as she saw her son being sold.  He was sold to a white man named Marable who took the boy across the Chattahoochee River from Georgia to Alabama, and the boy worked on Marable's farm in Randolph County.  The farm had at least twenty slaves.  The boy was-- because of his light skin and his gray-blue eyes and sandy straight hair, was privileged by his owner.  He was trained to be a mechanic.  He operated the ma- he fixed the machinery, drove, and also became something of a butler and drove the master around.  Drove the wagons. During the Civil War when the master--he accompanied the master at the beginning of the war, then came back home.  The master was wounded.  He was assigned to pick up the master and bring him home and did.  So, as a teenager he grew up in a very privileged way compared to other slaves on the plantation.  In 1865, in the early part of that year as the war was ending, but before the war was over, according to my grandfather [Manning Marable], Morris, who had just turned twenty-one, took forty dollars of gold out of the house and stole two oxen and disappeared.  And he took them and resettled about twenty miles north of where he had been a slave.  As the war ended, he was a, he was secured.  He used the money to begin to purchase land.  By the 1880s, he owned several hundred acres of land and became a black businessman.  He owned a cotton gin, and he ginned cotton from the 1890s until about 1915 when there, because of War World I [WWI], there was a collapse of the cotton market and he went bankrupt.  So, his experiences were much more different than the vast majority of African Americans who were enslaved around him.
Story_ID: 579855
Speaker 1: So he [Marable's paternal great-grandfather, Morris Marable] met your grandmother, your great-grandmother, after--
Speaker 2: That's right.  My great-grandmother was a Creek Indian [Native American] named Warner Clockster.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: W-A-R-N-E-R, C-L-O-C-K-S-T-E-R.  She was a Creek and even though Andrew Jackson [President Andrew Jackson] removed the Indians, overwhelming majority of them, thousands of them remained east of the Mississippi, especially in Florida, southern Florida around Lake Okeechoebee and the Keys [Florida Keys, Florida] and all of that, but also in Alabama and Georgia.  There were Creeks and Cherokees that still existed east of the Mississippi.  He married Warner, they had thirteen children.  The oldest son was Manning Marable.
Speaker 1: And that's your father [James Marable, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: And that's my [paternal] grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, and then your--so when your, your father came along where was the family?
Speaker 2: Well, by the early 20th century, Morris Marable, my great-grandfather, was a prominent leader of the African American community even though he was phenotypically white.  He looked like a white man.  He could easily be mistaken--in fact he was a white man except he identified himself with the black community and so frequently he was the interlocutor, the go between, between Negroes and white people.  He was a protector.  He confronted white people around issues of discrimination.  This may be apocryphal, but I understand he was even briefly a sheriff in one of these towns in the 1890s where, where he was with the local magistrate.
Story_ID: 579856
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [James Marable, Sr.] physically look like?
Speaker 2: My dad looks a lot like kind of a hybrid, but more like actually Warner Clockster than--he looks like his, his [paternal] grandmother.  He looks a little like his grandmother in the face, but very light skinned and kind of curly, but straight-ish hair, very light skinned.
Speaker 1: Okay, so talk to me about what, what your father did?  Now, now your father--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he grows up in--where is the family when your father is growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, we're skipping a generation because then there's Manning Marable.
Speaker 1: Manning Marable.  Well talk to me about Manning.
Speaker 2: That's my [paternal] grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Manning grew up in rural Alabama.  He followed in his father's [Morris Marable] footsteps.  He became a businessman.  As my grandfather would put it a bi'nessman [ph.].
Speaker 1: But his father had gone bankrupt, no?
Speaker 2: No, he still had land.
Speaker 1: He still had land.
Speaker 2: It was just the business because of the, the crisis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, War World I [WWI].
Speaker 2: --in World War II [WWII], World War I, but he still owned land and then went into cutting timber.  So, he grew up relatively with some, with some privilege, but I'm reluctant to use that term--
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: --because this is rural Alabama during the Jim Crow era where literally from 1882 to 1927 there are 3500 lynchings of black people across this region.  Hundreds of lynchings in Alabama, dozens in this county [Randolph County, Alabama], so you know to use terms like privilege really need to be qualified a bit.  It was a scary place, disenfranchisement, loss of the right to vote, lynch--massive lynchings, not being able to get money, credit, or capital from banks.
Speaker 1: So, let me just step back because you bring up an interesting point.  Did your great-grandfather talk about the Reconstruction era at all, what happened after they were freed there was, with the forty--?  He had the forty dollars and the two oxes, but did he talk much--
Speaker 2: He didn't get the, he didn't get the forty acres--
Speaker 1: He didn't, he didn't--
Speaker 2: --but he had to buy them.
Speaker 1: --he had the forty--
Speaker 2: But, yeah, but he ultimate--
Speaker 1: --his own gold, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, that's right he ultimately had a couple of hundred acres.
Speaker 1: Right.  But, they never talked about the Reconstruction era or any--
Speaker 2: He talked about racist violence against black people.  He told the story about a white man who put out a cigar into the head of a black man in, in the town, I don't know if it was Wedowee [Alabama] or Roanoke [Alabama] and my grandfather stood his ground and he walked up to protect the man and threatened the white man to attack and he took him, and he took him home.  That's a story that my grandmother [Fannie Heard Marable] told with great pride.  Confrontation that occurred in the 1880s or early 1890s.  So, but, but that's really, it's really fragmentary.
Speaker 1: Okay so moving forward to Manning Marable.
Speaker 2: My grandfather grew up in that household, thirteen children.  He was the oldest son.  There were only two boys out of the thirteen children, you know Manning and Roosevelt Marable [ph.] who was much younger; born in--my grandfather was born in 19, 1894.  Roosevelt was born in 1905.  So, my grand, great-grandfather though voted I understand until 1905, which is interesting because blacks were disfranchised in the State of Alabama in 1901, but he continued to vote until '05 [1905] and then that's when they finally stopped him from voting, okay.  My great--my Grandfather Manning grew up in that environment.  My great-grandfather died, he passed away in 1927.  It was a big funeral.  First thing my father remembers really of growing up is sitting on the wagon next to the casket carrying my great-grandfather, people crying.  Hundreds of people turned up.  It was a very big thing.  It was the biggest thing my father ever had seen in his life.  He was like six years old and because the big man had passed away.  In the 1930s, my grandfather, Manning, went into--bought two entrepreneurial activities, milling, saw milling, and then it became a large business in the '40s [1940s] and then the '50s [1950s] and moonshining.  So, during Prohibition he sold illegal whiskey and made good money from that, bought more land, had people who worked at the house, and he was a business man.  He, too, had thirteen children.

Speaker 1: My father was the third eldest, second eldest son, James Marable [James Marable, Sr.].  He was born Joshua Pierce [ph.] Marable, but as black folk were told back in the '40s [1940s] you have to change your name to be more American, more middle class, so James Palmer [ph.] is what my father used instead of Joshua Pierce.  So, very much like ethnics who recover what their real name was--you know what Walinchinski [ph.] becomes Wallace and then the grandson goes back to Walinchinski.  That's what I did with my son, so my son is named Joshua [Joshua Marable], which is my dad, for my dad (laughter).  But he was called Jake by everybody.  He was terrible at farming.  Couldn't plow, he couldn't plow a row straight.
Speaker 2: Now was your father able to go to school?
Speaker 1: Oh yes he went to school.  In fact, my dad was the first Marable to graduate from high school.  It was a big thing, 1941, graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Where did he go to high school?  What was the name of the high school?
Speaker 1: It was some place outside of Wedowee [Alabama], and first time--remember he graduated from high school and he saw an airplane.  First time he saw an airplane was when he was like nineteen years old.  It was a big deal.  He also remembers the first time he saw a Model A [Ford Model A] automobile that you didn't have to crank in front like the Model Ts [Ford Model T].  It was around '34 [1934] that came through town.
Speaker 2: How did the Depression [Great Depression] affect them?
Speaker 1: It had a profound effect.  My grandfather [Manning Marable] had to rely more on moonshining.  Milling business suffered, but they had a lot of acreage.  They had a huge farm, and there were workers who depended on them and instead of paying them cash--they had no cash--they lived on the farm, so there was, there were extended families who were connected to my grandfather.
Speaker 2: Who lived on the farm because they couldn't pay?
Speaker 1: And worked there, but also lived; subsistence.  They ate food, slaughtered pigs, you know, had cows, steers, things like that.
Speaker 2: Do you know much about that because that's not a part of history that most people or that, that I've heard a lot of about is when they lived sort of as sharecroppers to get by during the, during the Depression like, black land owners had other black families come and live with them?
Speaker 1: The larger black landowners would have tenant farmers.  It was very atypical.  It was very unusual, but most black families all experienced great deprivation during this period.  Fifty percent of all black adults in the labor force were unemployed throughout the 1930s.  So, this is the time of great, great suffering, economic and personal suffering and tragedy.  So, people had to depend upon each other, and they were cash poor.  Even if you held, even if you owned hundreds of acres of land, it was hard to pay the property taxes on that land unless you generated capital, selling hogs, corn, timber, whatever you could, and moonshining.
Story_ID: 579858
Speaker 1: How did your mother [June Morehead Marable] and father [James Marable, Sr.] meet?
Speaker 2: Ha, ha.  My dad joined the [U.S.] Army, segregated Army during World War II [WWII], in 1942 and served to '46 [1946]. And by the end of the war he was a master sergeant in the [U.S.] Army Air Corps.  He was in charge of a whole group of mechanics outside of Detroit [Michigan] working on airplanes, and with the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] he was able to go to college.  He enrolled at Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] in the fall of 1946.  There was a dance the first couple of weeks, probably the first or second weekend of college.  He went to the dance and that's where he met my mother.  They began to date, two years later, about two and half years later, they got married.
Speaker 1: So, how do you, how do you think they dealt with each other in these opposing views of what it means to be black?  How did it play out in the household?
Speaker 2: In realistic terms--well even with Malcolm [Malcolm X] and Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], there's a tendency to look to juxtapose--to focus on differences rather than commonalities.  Delany [Martin Delany] and Douglass [Frederick Douglass] is perhaps the best, a better example.  They agreed on about 90 percent of the stuff, Delaney and Fred Douglass right, but it was that 10 percent that we as historians tend to focus on.  Let's focus on the things they agreed on.  Mom and dad were similar.  There were things they disagreed about, but about 90 percent of the stuff they agreed on.
Story_ID: 579859
Speaker 1: My dad [James Marable, Sr.] worked overtime for more than a decade.  He worked his way through college [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] because he had to support a family.  He had two little boys, Jimmy [James Marable, Jr.], who was a year and half older than me and then me.  He was born in '49 [1949].  I was born in the middle of 1950.  Dad finished his B.A. degree in 1950 and then went immediately to get a master's degree at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] and graduated in 1951; and then was hired at Kansas City [Missouri] and we lived there for three years, four years, and then in '55 [1955] we returned, came back to Dayton, Ohio, where he and mom [June Morehead Marable] got jobs in the Dayton public school system.
Speaker 2: Both as teachers?
Speaker 1: That's right.  Dad then got a principal's certificate.  He had a master's degree, but he was systemically denied the right--access to be principal even though there were black schools.  They refused to hire Negroes as principals of these schools, all through the '50s [1950s], just would not do it.
Story_ID: 579860
Speaker 1: In Dayton [Ohio] where they [Marable's parents, June Morehead Marable and James Marable, Sr.] were teaching, the schools were legally integrated, schools were integrated.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Technically.
Speaker 1: Technically.  So, what does that--
Speaker 2: But, because of residential patterns and because there were no magnet schools back then, Negroes lived on the west side, schools on the west side were black, even though technically you didn't have de fact, you didn't have de jure segregation, you had de facto segregation 'cause of discriminate--'cause of redlining and discrimination in housing policy.  Not a single black family lived in Oakwood [Ohio] or in Kettering [Ohio].  These were white neighborhoods in the southern part of Dayton.  Jews, Jewish people generally lived and were confined to Dayton View [Dayton, Ohio] through the same pernicious form of discrimination except it was anti-Semitism rather than white, white racism, anti-black racism.  Black people were confined to the west side.  That's where we lived.  We attended the schools there, and my mother was an elementary school teacher.  I went to Edison School [Edison Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio], which was a couple of blocks away from Paul Laurence Dunbar's home.
Story_ID: 579861
Speaker 1: We were very proud of him [Paul Laurence Dunbar].  I learned when I was in elementary school I could recite 'When Malindy Sings' [Paul Laurence Dunbar] and as I grew older, one of my favorite poems in high school [Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio] was "We wear the mask that grins and lies that hides our cheeks and shades our eyes," ['We Wear the Mask'] great Paul Laurence Dunbar poem.  Very black power-ish poem, showed the anger of the brother, of what he had to put up with, as a great poet, as a great intellectual, great artist, with the racism of that time.  But, I digress, anyway, mom [June Morehead Marable] and dad [James Marable, Sr.] negotiated those differences usually successfully, sometimes no.  Dad felt very strongly, kind of Booker T. Washington black nationalist stuff.  Black people should own their own businesses, own their own homes.  They needed to assert their rights as black men and women.  They shouldn't back down to the man, et cetera.  My [paternal] grandfather [Manning Marable] used to preach this.  He used to--his, his motto to my father was I'm trying to teach you how to, how to deal with man.  That's what he used to say.  My dad used to say that to me. And so you had to be strong and self-assertive.  You had to be proud and confident.  You had to be about building black institutions, black ownership, black entrepreneurship, owning property and be better than them and twice as good as them. And we had to know what we know; know what they know and know what we know, right.  Very different line than mom, right.  So, I should say, in this ideological tug of war, I'm a Marable (laughter), I'm a Marable.  I agree with dad.  I think it is a great idea, build strong black institutions, have people under, young people understand and internalize the lessons from our heritage and culture, but operate within that, those existing structures and fight for opportunity wherever we can win it.  I don't think that that's a bad philosophy.  I think that makes sense.
Story_ID: 579862
Speaker 1: So, what are some of your earliest memories of growing up in your house, in the household as a child?  What do you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Books.
Speaker 1: Books.
Speaker 2: Books.
Speaker 1: What books do you remember?
Speaker 2: The Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [Association for the Study of African American Life and History] produced books and so all, the pan- all the panoply of books that you can think of that they produced, we owned.  They had a Negro encyclopedia; we had that.  We have all that stuff, right.  Carter G. Woodson, Charles H. Wesley, you know, all, Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  I read Du Bois probably in junior high.  I read 'The Souls of Black Folk' [W.E.B. Du Bois], it had to be maybe in the eighth grade, I think.  But, I knew passages of Du Bois by heart by the time I was in eleventh and twelfth grade [at Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio]; I knew that stuff; very atypical childhood, right.  So, that's one of the things.  The second thing is being precocious; like, we were expected to write, be musically in, inclined, proficient, and to do very well in school.
Story_ID: 579863
Speaker 1: When I was in the second grade, my dad [James Marable, Sr.] moved us out to the township, to Jefferson Township [Ohio], which was a rural, semi-rural suburban area just west of Dayton [Ohio].  That's where Negroes with money could move to.  Ours was the third black house in the township, right.
Speaker 2: Meaning third black family that had moved into the township?
Speaker 1: That's right, and now it's like a hundred percent black, you know.
Speaker 2: But talk to me about those days when you were the third black family that lived in the township.  What was the, the rest of the township like in reference to--how did they treat you?
Speaker 1: It was interesting.  It's kind of like (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you give me a year?
Speaker 1: Yeah it's 19, it's, it's, I can tell you March 1, 1958.  I was seven years old, second grade and we moved out to the township.  In the third grade--and I was attending Edison School [Edison Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio].  Third grade, I started in the township in the third grade and I went through, all the way through twelfth grade, graduated salutatorian of my high school class [at Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio] in Jefferson Township.  The last year I was there was the first year that the majority of the students in my cohort were black.  Mine was the first class to graduate that was majority black.  So, I grew up with white, with white people.  Most of the whites--it's kind of similar to Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts.  What I love about Oak Bluffs is that when you walk down the street in Oak Bluffs and you see black people--unless they're Brazilians and there're like three thousand Brazilians on the island-unless they're Brazilians, you can bet that they have more money than nearly 95 percent of the white people you see.  So, there is this class inversion, and the white folk knew it.  So, they treat black people--it's remarkable.  One of the great things about it--they treat black people with deference because they have money.  They are wealthy black people (laughter), so white people have been conditioned in a curious way not to act white.  It's very strange for white people not to be white, but whiteness kind of erodes because of the inversion of wealth.  The Brazilians have an expression, money lightens the skin.  There is a kind of backward truth to that, at least it works for Condi [Condoleezza Rice].  Anyway, in Jefferson Township the black folk had more money than white people.  White people were like rural farmers. They were like Germans in the mid-1840s, well '50s [1850s] because the failed German revolution of 1848.  Tens of thousands of Germans migrated to Ohio, and many of them clustered in, in southeast, southwestern, Ohio.  Germantown [Ohio] was just a couple of miles away from where I lived.  Germantown Pike is where my father built our first black nursery school in Dayton, Ohio, in 1961.  So, the kids I grew up with spoke German at home.  When we had Christmas trees and we would all sing in elementary school, the principal, Adam Becker [ph.], sang Christmas carols frequently in German.  That's a part of America's ethnic history that gets, really is rapidly wipe, being wiped out to the sea of whiteness, which is no culture at all.  It is a very thin culture because it's not a culture, it's empty.  It's an empty category.  It's not ethnic at all.  It's a racial category.  But, German Americans had a rich, deep and wonderful culture, and generally speaking they were, you know I got along with them and they, if they had overt racial animosities, they rarely manifested themselves in overt ways, but the way it came out was through the curriculum and through teachers, and the bizarre and horrific things that were imposed on us.
Speaker 2: Give me some examples.
Speaker 1: Oh I'll give you an example.  Seventh grade we were, eighth grade we were given Rudyard Kipling, 'The White Man's Burden' ['The White Man's Burden: The United States and the Philippine Islands'] you know the poem.  "Pick up the white man's burden," right.  We had to memorize that damn poem, right, and recite it in class, 'The White Man's Burden,' right.  Never, not a mention on Africa in the world civilization stuff, ridicule of blacks, grossest stereotypes you can possibly imagine that were replete in the text books of that time, about Africa, about black people, about slaves, Sambo.  All of the kind of racial imagery that is denigrating to black people.  That was a part of what we learned.  That was a part of the instructional program, and for--it was only until high school that black families and black students like myself, because we protested, where there were even marginal changes that were made.
Story_ID: 579864
Speaker 1: We will talk about teachers that during your high school or junior high school you'll tell me--but that have made an impression or had something to do with who you are today.
Speaker 2: The one teacher whose name I can--will always remember and for whom I owe a tremendous debt is Frederick Gallo [ph.].  Fred Gallo was an Italian American.  He was in his ear, late twenties, and he had just been hired.  It was his very first year as the eleventh grade history teacher at Jefferson Township High School [Dayton, Ohio]. In the eleventh grade in our, in the regime under which I was taught, American history is the social science course.  In Ohio, there are Regents Exams like in New York State and in other states, so there is a statewide competition where you actually compete statewide for these exams.  I had taken the Regents, or the statewide exams as a freshman and sophomore, but what I was really looking forward to was, was the junior exam statewide, in history.  Gallo kept me after school and drilled me on U. S. history, I mean drilled me.  I knew I could do this, the questions backward and forward, can answer all of these things. And thousands of people took the exam and when it came back I was tied for first in-state.  Got my little award, they had a big ceremony, picture and all of that.  But it was Mr. Gallo that made it possible.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate high school?
Speaker 2: Graduated the end of May 1968.
Speaker 1: King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been killed--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in April.
Speaker 2: That's right and I, when I went to the funeral, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A senior.
Speaker 2: --about five weeks away from graduating.
Story_ID: 579865
Speaker 1: Had you decided which university you were going to?
Speaker 2: That had long since been decided.
Speaker 1: And how did that, tell me about that decision (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By accident.  I had only applied to three colleges, showed the limits of my imagination.  Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana], Earlham or Earlham is in Richmond, Indiana.  It's a Quaker college, and it's only forty miles away from Dayton [Ohio], and I was advised by a guidance counselor to apply there; it was a good school and that I might be able to win a scholarship.  She had also advised me to apply to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio], and my mother [June Morehead Marable] had heard of Oberlin, knew something about it, knew that Negroes had a long history of being at Oberlin, going all the way back to the 1830s and '40s [1840s].  Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], my mother strongly suggested I apply to.  I got waitlisted at Harvard, immediately got into Oberlin and Earlham.  Earlham actually accepted me, early decision.  I didn't even know what early decision was.  I applied in the summer.  I got a letter back in about a week saying I'm in, and I have a scholarship, you know.  They didn't even get my exam, I mean my boards, yet; I got in.  So, my dad [James Marable, Sr.] and I drove over to the place, we looked at it, and it looked absolutely bleak.  All the students were gone.  It was cold, frigid, Richmond, Indiana, racist place.  Lord, Lord knows why I went there.  It's interesting; I sometimes wonder what would have happened had I gone to Harvard.  I was waitlisted, maybe I would have been admitted later in May or June, I don't know, but--or if I had applied to other more lead institutions, but as far as my father was concerned he was very upset that I didn't go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], his alma mater where he received his master's degree because in Ohio by the '60s [1960s] they had established a tradition that if you graduate salutatorian or valedictorian of your high school class you got a free ride at OSU [The Ohio State University].  So, I turned that down to go to a place that cost $3,150 a year.  My father said go figure, you know, what can you tell these young people.  So, I went to Earlham, okay.
Story_ID: 579866
Speaker 1: Back in the late '60s [1960s], black adult male unemployment was about 2.5 percent.  Black youth unemployment was 7 percent.  It's hard to even imagine that today, seven percent.  There was a war [Vietnam War] going on, and the economy was booming.  There were jobs.  You wanted to work, you could get a job, so I actually paid my way through school as a junior.  I was in undergrad school--I said I was precocious; got through the four-year program in three years.  So, junior, the fir- the second and third year I paid my way through school.  I went to Earlham [Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana].  One of those events that change, changes your life is that I decided to go to Earlham because they gave me a hundred dollars more than Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  That was the only reason, hundred dollars per year, and on that whim my life changed.  I went to Earlham (laughter).  So, I went there and it was a very good experience.  They had just created BLAC [Black Leadership Action Committee].  I became active immediately because I was articulate and I had skill sets.  I could write.  I immediately got on the newspaper, started writing things, had a column, transferred my column to the paper, had notoriety.  I got a third class radio license, and by the spring of my freshman year, I had a radio show called 'The Black Magazine' [ph.]; and so every Saturday from nine to twelve, I was on the radio running jazz and talking trash.  So, I was elected to be the president of BLAC.
Speaker 2: What were you talking about?
Speaker 1: Talking about how we had to take on the man, the system stunk.  We--we were faced with oppression.  We had to organize and fight back.
Story_ID: 579867
Speaker 1: When I was in high school [Jefferson Township High School, Dayton, Ohio], I was the head of the, the Urban League youth group of the Urban League.  Attended the Urban League convention [National Urban League Conference] in Portland, Oregon, I believe in '67 [1967], the summer of '67 [1967].  And my dad [James Marable, Sr.], who was the head of St. Margaret's [St. Margaret's Episcopal Church, Dayton, Ohio] adult--the adults had, prior to mass, they had their own, like 9:30 to eleven, they had their Sunday school.  But he turned it into a political discussion and so you brought in black powerites and radicals. And as a junior, I began attending the adult session, so I through my father became familiar with black power, Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], protests.  So, all of that by the time I went to, became a freshman in college [Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana] I was, you know not a Black Panther, but I was pretty well familiar with a lot of the radicalism, the radical ideas surfacing in the black community at that time.
Speaker 2: And how did you feel about those ideas versus the ideas that had come before them, King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] idea sort of--?
Speaker 1: I was really a King man until the winter of '67 [1967], I mean of '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: And what changed you?
Speaker 1: The radicalization of the movement.  The rise of the Black Panther Party, the, what--we didn't know the word COINTELPRO, Counterintelligence Program, but the federal government and local law enforcement suppression against the Black Panthers, the emergence in 1970 of the [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis thing with first the support for Angela Davis. Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan], the governor or California tried to fire her because she was a Communist, and then Angela Davis having to go underground being accused of being involved in the shootout at this courthouse in northern California, so defend Angela Davis. And so by the end, by the time, end of my freshman year I'd been really radicalized.  We protested; we need black studies, and we protested and surrounded the faculty meeting house and actually kind of kidnapped for a couple of hours, the entire faculty at our college.  We endangered ourselves in the sense of being expelled and all of that, and we did that because we were part of a student protest movement.  That's how we saw ourselves.  I was the point man for that.
Speaker 2: So you said that you felt you needed black studies because you didn't have them.
Speaker 1: And black professors.
Speaker 2: And, and black professors.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Did you get either of the two?
Speaker 1: Yes and no.  Well, they quickly went out and hired a brother who was an attorney, to put in front of us as a teacher.  He was a good brother, but a very poor teacher.  So, a black face in a public place, the worst form of integration.  It's what I call symbolic representation.  Here's somebody who looks like you, go away and be happy.  You know like Clarence Thomas.  You, you know you have somebody on the court [U.S. Supreme Court], what's your complaint, what's your problem.  You know why are you whining and crying.
Speaker 2: Right, and, and, and that's understandable, but just to, just to speak to that just for a moment and then we'll go back towards--but what, why do you feel that that when we gather as black people that we feel we should, that we should speak with the same voice, that there's no room for, I mean there's no room for a Clarence Thomas in the black community?  Is that what I hear, no?  Tell me what I hear, that's what I'm asking?
Speaker 1: It's not that we should throw him out.  It's that he has outed himself by what he's done.  He doesn't see himself in any kind of structural way committed to a project that enhances and empowers African American culture or heritage in his practice, that is, by what he does.  I don't see it unless I've missed something.  So, I'm not trying to impose ideological constructs on what it means to be black.  There's a long history of African Americans having widely divergent views ideologically, and that's a healthy thing.  And there--I have tremendous respect for sisters and brothers who are Republicans, but who are dedicated to a politics of anti-racism, in empowering and building strong African American institutions.  I have respect for that, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was your mother [June Morehead Marable] a Republican?
Speaker 1: Oh goodness, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know my parents were products of the Great Depression.  Anybody who went through that, it would be very hard to feel that love for the Republicans.  My father hates Republicans.  Can't stand the Republicans.  So, no, Jake would never--you know there are many things my father might do.  One thing is--one thing he will never do is throw that lever for a Republican, you know.  Constitutionally, he is incapable and now he's in his eighties.  And the same thing is true for me, I mean, please.  It would, it would be very difficult after Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], no thank you.  You know or, or G. or, or G.W. [President George Walker Bush].  Yeah, I've seen enough of what they're about.

Speaker 1: So let's say you graduate [from Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana] in 1971 from Earlham (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Graduate in '71 [1971], I spent a year in Africa.
Speaker 1: Spent--so what were you doing in Africa?
Speaker 2: I spent my senior year, most of it at the University of Nairobi [Nairobi, Kenya], at the college, University College [University College Nairobi; University of Nairobi, Nairobi, Kenya] as a student. And fell deeply in love with Africa and also with a young woman, Claudia [ph.], lived together.  We traveled extensively throughout East Africa, and came back, went to grad school together and I almost got married.  And it was all my fault and that's all I'll say about it other than it was--it was an enormous missed opportunity that I even to this day regret.  But I was just too young.  I couldn't handle it.  But what I came away with was a profound love for Africa.
Story_ID: 579869
Speaker 1: And one other event; there was an event that occurred in, at the University of Nairobi [Nairobi, Kenya], one of those half dozen events that changes your life.  It was in a class, in a lecture, people were bored.  The instructor was K.J. King, Kenneth J. King. He was a Scot, and he was a lecturing in the college and he mentioned something that woke me up, got my attention.  He kept mispronouncing Tuskegee [Alabama].  Now you know my family is from now--my--Mar, the Marables relocated and moved everything to Tuskegee in the '50s [1950s].  So, as a kid every summer I went down and I spent time with my [paternal] granny [Fannie Heard Marable], and because I was named for her husband [Manning Marable], I was a pet, Manning, Manning [HistoryMaker Manning Marable]. And family reunion the first weekend in August; Marable, Manning Marable's reunion on Saturday, the first Saturday; Morris Marable's reunion on the first Sunday of August. So Morris Marable and Manning Marable.  And those reunions still exist to this day, both, right, okay, for the two great men.  Okay, he pronounced it Tuskagee [ph.] instead of Tuskegee.  I said "Hold, what, hold up K.J. (laughter)."  I said, "You're not pronouncing it right."  But, he talked about a brother named John Langalibalele Dube, he's a Zulu born in 1871.  He was a Kiowa.  He was an African, Christian African, second generation of an elite.  James Dube was his father, first minister of the Congregational church, sent his kid to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] where he went to school for a couple of years, 1887, 1889, then he travelled around the United States raising money, came back to the U.S. in 1897 and he gave a graduation address at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] in 18--in the spring of 1897.  He saw Tuskegee, and it blew his mind, and he said, Dube said, the guy is twenty-six, he said, "What you have here I wanna take back to South Africa and duplicate.  I wanna be the Booker T. Washington in South Africa, that's what I wanna do."  So get this, Dube raises money, travels around with John Chilembwe, another African who, whose later claim to fame is that he leads a bloody revolt against the British in the Nyasaland, Malawi, in 1915, raises money, goes back in 1899 to South Africa.  By 1901, he establishes the Zulu Christian Industrial School, which is now Ohlange Institute, just outside of Durban [South Africa], about fifteen miles outside of Durban in Zululand.  In 1901, he founds Ilanga lase Natal, lase Natal, first Zulu language newspaper in South Africa.  In 1903, he sends his cousin, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, 1901, to be educated in the United States and he attends Columbia University [New York, New York] and in 1905 Pixley ka Isaka Seme wins the university's prize, grand prize, for oratory, and he's the first black person to graduate from law school at Columbia University, in history, in 1905.  Well anyway, Dube and Seme did--go back and they're so frustrated and fed up with the racism they had to deal with, in January 190- 1912 in Bloemfontein in Orange Free State [Free State, South Africa], they have a meeting of other African Americ- Africans about what can we do to develop something. And they looked at the United States as a model.  They said well you know got the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Let's develop an organization that will advocate native, educated native rights and fight for equal justice.  Let's call it the African National Congress [ANC], and Dube becomes the first president and Seme becomes the first secretary general, right.  Interesting story right, Dube becomes the founder of the ANC and all that is traced back to South Africa.  K.J. King is talking about this story.  I'm finding this very fascinating.  I decide to do--in effect that becomes my dissertation topic.  I'm a senior, listening to this story, and I said has anybody written on this guy.  No.  So, I go to grad school and that became my topic.
Story_ID: 579870
Speaker 1: And you go to grad school at the University of--?
Speaker 2: Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], where I got my master's [degree].  University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland]--because when I applied for grad school no one really told me what the rule is that you should follow, more than anything else you should go to a place where you can work with an individual or a group of people whose work you admire and you like because they can be, they can mentor you; that's what it's about, is mentorship.  And I really didn't have that at the University of Wisconsin, and by--but, however, I'm a quick study and by the middle of my master's, by the middle of the first year I knew I had to leave and I had to go to a place where I could work with somebody.  At College Park, University of Maryland, you have Louis Harlan [Louis R. Harlan] who is the biographer of Booker T. Washington.  That's where I went.  Harlan only took one student every other year, but I was the student, and so I went there in the fall of--after I had my master's in hand August, 1972, transferred in, started being a TA [teaching assistant] in late August, 1972.  Whatever--
Speaker 1: What did Harlan say about Booker T.?
Speaker 2: Well, we always disagreed about Booker.  Harlan is a great historian, wonderful writer, and I learned to write in part from Louis.  I like to say I'm a second generation C. Vann Woodward student.  What I admire about Woodward is the beautiful prose in the writing, history is a, should be an art, it should be literature, it should be read, and spoken and Harlan's writing is just exquisite and I try to write to make it accessible to people and to be literature.  I really try to write well, right. But on Booker, Harlan was just wrong.  And part of that was coming to terms, helping him deal with being a Mississippi white guy.  He's a white guy from Mississippi, and I have enormous respect and admiration for white southern anti-racists, because they had the courage that few people have, few black people have, to stand up to that kind of racism and defend the humanity of black people in front of their friends, family, their you know, sometimes children, wives, husbands.  That was Harlan.  He was just an enor- I mean just a tremendously progressive liberal Democrat, but a southerner from Mississippi and so his attitude about Booker is that he would say Booker T. is an onion.  You would peel a layer and there's another layer, you'll peel and there, there's another layer, you, finally and peel everything and there's nothing.  Booker was a master Machiavellian who used symbols and stratagems to enhance his power, but he had no overriding ideology.
Speaker 1: What happened with the meeting in Atlanta [Georgia]?  That was a big division between Booker T and who was the--?
Speaker 2: W.E.B [W.E.B. Du Bois].
Speaker 1: W.E.B.
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: I mean I just finished writing a book about this called 'Living Black History' ['Living Black History: How Re-Imagining the African American Past Can Remake America's Racial Future,' Manning Marable].  There's a whole chapter on Du Bois.  When Du Bois--you're referring to the Atlanta Compromise  address [Cotton States and International Exposition speech] of September 1895, Booker says we can be as separate as the fingers, yet one in the hand in all matters of mutual progress.  We can be separate, but equal.  He does like this, right.  Du Bois thought it was a good speech, and he sent him a note saying it was word fitly, fit, fitly spoken.  Du Bois thought it was okay.  They agreed on about 80 or 90 percent of the stuff.  They collaborated on projects.  In 1901, Washington pushed for Du Bois to become the Negro superintendent of the Washington, D. C. public school system, which was a very prestigious job at that time for Negroes.  Washington--it was Du Bois who suggested through the conferences he had at AU, Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], the development of the National Negro Business League.  Washington proceeded to do so with the instance of his invaluable lieutenant, Emmett Scott [Emmett J. Scott]--
Speaker 1: Well Harlan--
Speaker 2: --in 1900.
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry, go head.
Speaker 2: So, but what Harlan is wrong about is that Booker did not have an underwriting philosophical orientation or a strategy through which his politics flowed.  That's wrong.  And Harlan could never understand the link between Washington and Garvey [Marcus Garvey].  He thought Garvey was confused.  It wasn't Garvey who was confused.  It was Harlan who was confused.  Garvey understood it.  He just took Washington's ideas and framed it in a pan-Africanist mode, but it's nothing but Booker T. Washington-ism.  Washington is the father of black capitalism, so much of black power was Washing- was Booker T. Washington.  Cast out your buckets where you are, we can be as separate from white people, yet one in the hand in all matters of mutual progress.  Using capitalism as a vehicle for capital accumulation.  Use segregation as a barrier from white capital to invest in the black community, but to create the space for black capital accumulation through black entrepreneurship using black markets as a means to do so.  That's what Washington said.  That's what Elijah Muhammad said, that's what Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] says today, and that's nothing but Booker T. Washington-ism, that's what it is, and that's black economic nationalism.  Harlan could never understand that because he had--he could not overcome or navigate being a white Mississippian and coming to terms with those kinds of paradigms.  Garvey got it right and so did Elijah Muhammad.  So, that was our difference, but I respected him as, as a mentor and he's just a wonderful historian, a wonderful man.

Speaker 1: So, you graduated from the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and--
Speaker 2: I survived it.
Speaker 1: You survived it.
Speaker 2: It was a horrible place and for many years I never went back.  I didn't want to go back just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was horrible because?
Speaker 2: Maryland in the early '70s [1970s] was the South, was the South.  When you traveled from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] to Baltimore [Maryland], you're traveling north, but you're heading south.  Maryland is a slave state, okay.  It was a Jim Crow state.  In the spring of 19--of '72 [1972], George Wallace won an overwhelming victory in the Maryland Democratic primary after he got shot, okay.  White people turned out for George Wallace.  It was a scary place.  I was almost beaten up once with a group of my white students.  I think the second weekend I was a grad student there we went into this rural bar.  Black people develop real good antenna about these things, like when are you in trouble from a racist mob?  White folks started, white men started getting up with beer bottles.  I said to the white folk who were obli- who I was with who were oblivious to what was impending.  I said we have to get out of here now. Because it had been less than a decade that Jim Crow racial segregation in public accommodations had been outlawed.  It's '72 [1972], it'd been less than ten years since the public accommodations act [Title II, Civil Rights Act] of '64 [1964] had been passed.  Maryland still had--was enormously segregated; housing segregation, what I ran into, racist steering by these business, you know these firms that would find you, you're a grad student you go to a place and you, you fill in your form and then you can find an apartment.  They would send you to the worse slums.  They would just do this to, you know to, to me just routinely.  Racist, hardly any professors who were black.  One saving grace was a very young law professor, lawyer and history prof who was barely just starting out named Mary Frances Berry and but unfortunately she was snapped up into administration, so I never could take a course with her.
Story_ID: 579872
Speaker 1: What's the name of this poem?  I'll think of it in a minute.  The phrase I'm thinking of is because we do not hope to know the infirm glory of the positive hour because time is always and only time and place is always an only place and what's actual is actual only for one time and one place ['Ash Wednesday,' T.S. Eliot].  In effect, we should celebrate the way things are as they are and rejoice having to construct something upon which to rejoice. That we, despite all of the bad stuff that's happened to us, there's a lot of reason for celebration and a lot of pride of what our people have accomplished, and building upon that and passing that on as a mandate, as a trust and in playing a role kind of like Carter G. Woodson, to protect and preserve that legacy and extend that to future generations and to provoke thought and engagement about the meaning of what our story is, and how it relates to the larger society, that's what I do.  That's my job, you know, and I don't flinch, you know I love it, and it's, it's an interesting role because you know Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and Woodson and people like that put that forward and Freddy Douglass [Frederick Douglass], right, and you know I defy you to find a better speech on planet earth than, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?, that Douglass gives on July 4th, 1852 [sic. July 5, 1852] in Rochester, New York, and it sets a stan- it's a high standard and that's a standard that I try to live by to speak truth to power.  If people don't like it, that's just tough.
Speaker 2: That's the title of one of your books isn't it?
Speaker 1: That's right.  'Speak Truth to Power' ['Speaking Truth to Power: Essays on Race, Resistance, and Radicalism,' Manning Marable].  That's, it's a phrase from the Quakers, that is the righteous person speaks truth to power.  You don't back away from it.  You go to the very precipice to fight for justice.
Story_ID: 579873
Speaker 1: So, when you were graduat-, when you were at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and you graduated, did you have your eye set on a particular job or an endeavor?  Or you--
Speaker 2: Well remember before I was born it had been decided.
Speaker 1: That you'd be an historian and you'd accepted that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't accept it, I loved it.
Speaker 1: You loved it.
Speaker 2: I loved it.  It wasn't a question.  It wasn't like I wonder what I'm gonna be.  No, no, I was already decided this is what I would do.  I would be a writer.  I would be a journalist, author, but I would, that I would write books, and I would teach history. And I was trained to do this and I loved it.  So, it wasn't something I had to think about.  This is something that was.
Speaker 1: So, you are at Colgate University [Hamilton, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh, we're jumping ahead okay.
Speaker 1: Okay no, if I'm jumping too far ahead let me know because it was '70 [1970]--
Speaker 2: Let me, yeah there are two--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --events I have to talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay and give me the years for these.
Speaker 2: All right, when you look at my vitae [curriculum vitae] you'd find this anomaly that it's like I couldn't hold a job for the first fifteen years 'cause I went to like seven places, I mean you know I moved like every two years.  Why is this?  Well, when you're in your twenties or early thirties, you don't have any property.  You know you pack up your book, you have folding book cases, you might have a couple of thousand books, you have clothes.  Even when you get married and you have little kids, how much stuff do you really have, so you just move, right, and you're also learning.  You're trying to acquire knowledge about things, about the world, about what you think, who you are, and from the very beginning I pursued three kinds of sights of engagement, simultaneously.  Jour- political journalism, academe, teaching, doing scholarly research, and political engagement, direct political, civil rights, black power, political, progressive political work, and activism, all three.  And they all overlapped and they were all part of my existence.  In 1976, I started what was then called, From the Grassroots, which was a newspaper column.  I was twenty-six years old and I was in Tuskegee, Alabama, and I first started writing for a weekly newspaper in Tuskegee.  Black newspaper in Pensacola, Florida, asked hey that's a great column, can we carry it?  I said sure.  The next thing I knew Jackson Advocate in Jackson, Mississippi, wanted it; sent it to them.  Then in Albany, Georgia, then in Charleston, South Carolina, The Charleston Advocate [sic.] or whatever the newspaper is there.  The next thing I know by 1980 about one hundred black newspapers are carrying the co- the series.  The Omaha Star, the San Francisco Sun Reporter, the Baltimore [Maryland], Washington [D.C.] and Norfolk [Virginia] Afro, Afro-American [Afro-American Company; Afro-American Newspapers], and by 1983 it's about two hundred newspapers and so the series today goes to about four hundred papers worldwide. And there is one thing; it is free for any black-owned or black-oriented newspaper on planet earth, it is a free series and you can download it at www.ManningMarable.net where it is free to this day.  So, most black folk know me from the column, read me in the newspapers.  I get folk who were like in their seventies, who you know kind of walk up to me and say I've been reading you all of my life, you know, sincerely and I said no brother I don't think you have (laughter), I'm fifty-five, I don't think so.  But, you know I have now second generation people who have been reading me for thirty years, been reading me for thirty years, and it's a wonderful feeling you know, but it's through the press, through the black press; millions of people read me on a monthly basis through my newspaper column.  So, that's one.
Story_ID: 579874
Speaker 1: Two, academe, as a scholar, as a historian--when I got out of graduate school [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland] I felt there was so much I wasn't taught on political economy and I spent about three years or four years really reading extensively in political economy, political theory, and the relationship between structures of power and the way the economy is organized and how it impacted black people.  And so I kind of remade my own discipline so that--and then there was one of these accidents of history.  My first job was as--teaching, as a lecturer at Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts], before I finished my Ph.D. I was hired when I was twenty-four, and I was lecturing, teaching at Smith and I was offered the job of chairing political science at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Negroes said you are insane; why in the world would you leave Smith College and go to Tuskegee?  It's because my family is there and because I was young, you know I was not even twenty-six. I wanted to find out is it possible to carry these ideas I had and enhance and build a strong black institution.  I had no clue how conservative black institutions like Tuskegee would be and how difficult it would be for me during the three years I was there.
Speaker 2: I wanna know what you mean by conservative?
Speaker 1: Oh you have to wear a shirt and tie everyday if you're an administrator.  That was, no one said that, but that was clearly expected.  The department clearly would not get a subsidy or any kind of allocation if you walked in wearing a dashiki.  Incredibly conservative, incredibly conservative.  Social conventions, conservative, not enough time to do research, not privileging research, not, no support for scholarly travel, things like that, that I'd grown accustomed to at Smith.  Difficulties with faculty.  Huge teaching loads where you're teaching four courses a semester.  It's impossible to do research.  And the social conservatism of the South where it's a chur- it's a deeply religious church culture; very, very patriarchal, misogynistic, homophobic, all those things.  I'd, I'd been socialized in academe in the Northeast and had come away with many of those values and I had real difficulty trying to negotiate that in my twenties, being back in that environment.
Speaker 2: How do you negotiate it now?  Has it changed?
Speaker 1: I've changed a lot.
Speaker 2: You've changed, but has it changed?
Speaker 1: Unfortunately not as much as it should.  I just went back about a month ago where my youngest daughter, Sojourner [Sojourner Marable Grimmett], got married to a wonderful young man, great family, outside of Atlanta [Georgia], but still it's a very conservative environment. You know, very--they looked askance when we said you know maybe we should have dancing at the wedding 'cause we had the reception at the church.  They finally bent the rules a little bit, all right so you can dance with your daughter and Roland [Roland Grimmett] can dance with his mother at the church (laughter).  But, there will be no general dancing (laughter); that's conservative right, and of course no alcohol, oh heaven forbid.  So, the champagne and the wine had to wait.  But, it's, it was making, it was difficulty making an adjustment to all that, and that's part of the reason why--
Story_ID: 579875
Speaker 1: There was too much I needed to know and learn about the world 'cause the third area of my life, political engagement, I was very involved in activism in, in my twenties.  In the '70s [1970s], I was involved in--from '76 [1976] to '80 [1980], I was a communications coordinator for a group called the National Black Political Assembly, the NBPA, which was the group that emerged out of the Gary Black Political Convention [National Black Political Convention] of Gary, Indiana, the very famous black convention of March, 1972, the high point, the apex of black power.
Speaker 2: You know they're supposed to be doing that again here soon with the--there was talk--
Speaker 1: Yikes.
Speaker 2: --yeah there was talk of reconvening, some twen- you know thirty whatever years-
Speaker 1: Thirty years later.
Speaker 2: --later, thirty years later.
Speaker 1: The Gary convention.
Speaker 2: Okay go ahead so this came out of Gary.  Talk to me, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Well okay, well I went to the Cincinnati [Ohio] convention in March '76 [1976], was the third in the series.  There was Little Rock [Arkansas] in '74 [1974], then Ga- you had Gary in '72 [1972], Little Rock '74 [1974], then Cincinnati in '76 [1976] and we wanted to run somebody for president, so I went and I ended up because I was articulate and, and very aggressive, I was twenty-five and you know full of spunk, I ended up by the end of the year becoming communications coordinator for the NBPA.  And this is a network of a couple of thousand black activists throughout the country, but primarily in key states in the Central South, the Midwest, and the East Coast.  And, where the story gets funny is that at Cincinnati, [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond had several days earlier declined our nomination to run for president on an independent ticket.  Julian wouldn't do it, okay.  Since then we've become friends, but I, we were very angry at Julian for doing, you know, basically to deny our nomination on an independent black ticket.  So, we sat in a room, there were about fifty of us and we were talking through and the meeting was chaired by Ron Daniels who is now the head of the Center for Constitutional Rights [New York, New York], an old friend. So Daniels is saying we need to find somebody who will run for president, maybe somebody in this room.  There were fifty of us, we're all organizers for the NBPA, and Daniels said wait a minute is anybody, who, who's over thirty-five.  You gotta be thirty-five or older to run for president.  We said what about you Daniels?  Daniels said I can't do it I'm thirty-four.  Then he said who in here is thirty-five or older?  Out of fifty people, not a single person was thirty-five or older, not one.  And it speak volu- I was twenty-five, I couldn't do it.  But, it just tells you what black activism was like in the '70s [1970s], how young we were.  None of us were thirty-five, and we were taking the lead in defining things and pushing the envelope. And it really says a lot about how far we've retreated from activism that around a race class crisis like Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] instead our predominant response instead of protest is philanthropy, is charity; because that was a crisis that revealed that just through the covers of, of the reality of race, class, and equality in the country. And young people thirty years ago were taking the lead in speaking truth to power around that inequality and fighting for vision of a better society. But I'm--digress.
Speaker 2: But don't digress, you can stay right here--
Story_ID: 579876
Speaker 1: This is the last tape.  We might as well finish it on something that we want to finish it on.  What did you guys have in the '70s [1970s] that was, that is missing today from that group of people under thirty-five giving money as opposed to taking to the streets protesting?
Speaker 2: Right.  I'll tell you. It was a profound rootedness in the terrain of our history of struggle.
Speaker 1: Explain that to me again.
Speaker 2: We knew history was on our side.  We looked throughout the world and we saw sister and brothers in Zimbabwe fighting to overthrow the white minority regime of Ian Smith and they came to victory in 1980 and Robert Mugabe became president.  The ANC [African National Congress] was mobilizing, the Spear of the Nation [Umkhonto we Sizwe], the guerilla group of the ANC, that I read, Amilcar Cabral of Guinea-Bissau and I was profoundly influenced by Cabral and that Cabral, Agostinho Neto of Angola, Eduardo Mondlane of Mozambique, Malema [ph.], Julius Nyerere--.  I've forgotten most of the Kiswahili I used to know, but I used to be able to speak it pretty well; of Tanzania.  All of that, and I, I was greatly privileged to know as a friend Michael Manley of Jamaica.  In 1983, Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] was supposed to be the keynote speaker on international night at the People's National Party convention in Kingston [Jamaica].  He couldn't go.  I happen to be in his office for Congressional Black Caucus giving a talk that his staff had org- had mobile- had set up.  He said Manning [HistoryMaker Manning Marable] you represent us.  So, I got on a plane, flew to Jamaica.  P.J. Patterson, prime minister, picked me up at the airport, right.  Back then he was a gofer for Michael.  So P.J. drives me to the stadium, eight thousand people; one of these days, events that changes your life.  Quafes [ph.] of marijuana smoke all over the standium.  It's fantastic, you know, Peter Tosh, Bob Marley are playing.  I walk in and I go, I'm ushered right up to the podium right to speak.  It was a trip.  Maybe it was the marijuana, I don't know.  Anyway, but that's what my life was like as a relatively young man in my twenties and early thirties, in political engagement, but we saw that history could be rewritten and that it was through the power of struggle and being grounded in a history of struggle.  I mean I refer--my students say why do you call Fred Douglass [Frederick Douglass], Freddie?  'Cause it's a brother I know.  I know Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  C.L.R. James is not somebody I didn't know.  I, I met Nella [ph.] once, and spent an afternoon with him [C.L.R. James] debating with him in his flat in Brixton [London, England].  But I knew C.L.R. James and I knew these people and I know them even if we never met because I know their work backwards and forwards. And you must be comfortable with your own heritage and your own history, in order to make new history.  If you don't have a sense of where you've been, how can you possibly know where you're going?  How can you develop a vision of the future if you had no consciousness of the past?  And I believe that very deeply.
Story_ID: 579877
Speaker 1: Well, how did we go from thirty years, I mean, to being that conscious to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To charity.  In steady of protest--
Speaker 1: --(laughter) charity, to charity.
Speaker 2: --charity, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If you don't know your own history, then history acts on you.  Are you the subject?  Do you create it?  Are, are you the catalyst?  Do you have the capacity to transform the trajectory of the future or does history just impact you, then you become the object of it?  And I, I don't mean that rhetorically.  I mean that substantively.  And so my task as a teacher is to provoke, it is to raise the right sets of questions.  Socrates had the right idea, that is, you want people to disagree with you.  You want to provoke them to think and to find their own answers because they must be their own answers, that is the path people must take and the Quakers and the Buddhists have the right idea.  You have to find your own path.  I can't tell you what that is, you have to find it for yourself, but you must do so with the recognition that the path you walk down has been laid out, and there is a trajectory to it by nameless women and men who you'll never meet, but you should know something about the nature of that struggle.  Today I showed a couple scenes of lynching, and I said you know I talked about Jim Crow and I save that to last.  There are a whole panoply of liabilities to being blocked under a Jim Crow segregated South regime.  The last one, the glue that holds it together is violence, extra-legal violence.  So you have 300, you have 3,500 black folk lynched in the South from '80s [1880s] to 1927 and the [U.S.] Senate can't get a unanimous apology after a hundred years of blocking anti-lynching legislation and that just occurred this summer.  You get a handful of Republican conservatives who refuse to apologize to black people for the mass lynching of our people.  Now, maybe elements of the hip hop generation can step aside from that.  Me, I take I personally, right because what does it say about your humanity or when Bill Bennett [William Bennett] can give up for instance, if we ki- if we aborted all black babies, then we can reduce crime.  Well, you know, they say the PC [political correctness] police beat him up.  No, no, no, it obscures the central point.  To use that as the example as a kind of, as, as for instance to discuss draconian kinds of approaches to crime and just say, then to throw that off the table, it never would have occurred to him to use some other ethnic group that's experienced intolerance as a substitute for it.  But, the ease with which he could seize upon the Negro in a kind of draconian way, in a genocidal way, that's the point we're trying to make and this may be the first generation of African Americans, many of whom are disconnected from their heritage of struggle and that worries me.  Because struggle begins with the capacity, with knowledge of where we have been.  I mean it was the Egyptians and the Greeks picked it up who said the first step in knowledge production is to know thy self.  That's the first prerequisite.  You gotta know yourself.  Or Cabral [Amilcar Cabral], or the Vietnamese used to say it a different way when they were struggling against the United States.  They said there are three things that any oppressed people have to do in order to win against overwhelming odds.  You have to understand yourself, you have to understand your enemy, and you have to build a program based on reality.  If you do those three things, you, you're gonna win.  And it begins with self.  By that I mean, collective self, which is heritage and history and traditions and all that, and then understand what we're up against.

Speaker 1: We go back to the--what would you say were the, were the tangible signs of the, of receiving the freedom that you were expressing you had been denied that you were seeking out?  What were the, what were in the, what was the struggle for specifically in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: We wanted what I now write, what I know describe as symbolic representation.
Speaker 1: Which means?
Speaker 2: A black face at high place.  We wanted somebody who looked like us in a position of authority.  We wanted black control of the cities.  We wanted to triple or quadruple the size of the Congressional Black Caucus; we succeeded.  We wanted black mayors of major cities and thousands of black elected officials.  We have that, twelve thousand okay; not enough, but you know.
Speaker 1: But that brings up an interesting point because you got what you were fighting for.
Speaker 2: No, no, not really.
Speaker 1: Not really, okay.
Speaker 2: No because there was a cruel hoax to it all and that is called de-industrialization, it's called globalization, and the fragmentation of the tax base of the central cities.  So, when the cities became bankrupt they were turned over to people of color to manage, to African Americans, so it's an ungovernable situation.  So, you want Detroit [Michigan], Coleman Young, here, you have it.  Meanwhile, de-industrialization, thousands, millions of jobs flee the United States beginning in the '70s [1970s], escalating in the '80s [1980s].  Huge tracts of cities become urban wastelands, so much so that by 1989 as David Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] inherits New York City [New York, New York] become, becomes a place where it's impossible to govern without massive federal help that is not forthcoming.  And much the same as crack [crack cocaine] was allowed to proliferate by public health officials in black urban areas.  It had only became a public health issue and a national issue of drug enforcement when it went into the white suburbs.  Just lay waste to millions of young black and Hispanic young women and men, but to do almost nothing until it became a problem of the white suburbs.

Speaker 1: What did you think about the media in the '70s [1970s]; shows like 'Good Times'?  Were they, was that bad for us or was that good for us?
Speaker 2: One step forward, two steps back.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a deep element of minstrelsy in this that I took offense to.  As funny as J.J. [James "J.J." Evans, Jr.] might have been with dynamite (laughter), there were--I loved elements, I loved elements of the popular culture of the period (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you love?  What elements did you love of popular culture?
Speaker 2: I loved the music of the period, of the mid and late '70s [1970s], great stuff.
Speaker 1: Name some of the people you liked.
Speaker 2: I liked, I liked Parliament-Funkadelic.  I liked Donna Summer.  I liked Kool and the Gang.  I like, I liked the music of the period.  It's danceable and it's very black.  It's great.  It's great stuff.  But, mostly I also liked political music, so Marvin Gaye's, 'What's Going On' and Stevie Wonder's 'Songs in the Key of Life' and 'Talking Book.'  Great political music.  And I loved the Black Arts Movement and my renegade pal, Amiri Baraka, in poetry, and I'm part of that generation that would memorize poems, so there are many poems that were just really evocative of what we were about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 579880
Speaker 1: --[we] organize memories and present them as a type of representation of self.  And because people represent themselves through the architecture of memory, they have a deeply engrained interest to forget certain painful events or to push them to the periphery and to put in the foreground those singular events in which, which are achievements and accomplishments in their lives; those events that turn their lives and move them forward rather than backward; and even when people don't engage in dishonesty they subconsciously do it because the mind is trying to protect the body. And there's another problem as well that I found in doing a little history is that those who have experienced mass trauma or catastrophic trauma, their memories are disorganized or fragmented and you have fragmented or fractured memory and it's characteristic of survivors of the Holocaust and survivors of Rwanda [Rwandan genocide].  There is now a growing literature, a novelist, I can't recall his name, just brilliant novel, drawing on the Rwanda and holocaust of the Tutsi and the way it's organized is disorganized; that is, it's presented in a post-modern way.  You don't go from A to B, you go from A to Q to B to F to Z to, right and so your memory and the sequence of events is very much like 'Pulp Fiction.'  It's disjointed, but that is what happens to people who experience catastrophic trauma and so you must keep that in mind as you weigh the evidence that is presented.  To a certain extent someone like Malcolm X who experienced the death of his father [Earl Little] at a very early age; who had, who lived in poverty; whose mother [Louise Norton Little] was institutionalized when he was thirteen or fourteen years old, experienced trauma, and the signs of that are clear in 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley]. And so when you interview people as a part of this project you must keep all of those things in mind.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, or smells remind you of your childhood?  Are there any particular things that stands out that are uniquely black or just cultural things?
Speaker 2: Yes, I can smell pork chops and biscuits and, and sausage, and sausage gravy coming from the kitchen as I lay in bed.  I could smell the wonderful smells, and that would wake--I would be awakened by those smells at about six a.m., maybe a little earlier sometimes, maybe 5:30 and I would get up as a boy and climb out of bed. This was in my [paternal] grandmother's [Fannie Heard Marable] home, and I would race to the kitchen.  Usually, some of my uncles were already sitting at the table.  After my great, after my grandfather [Manning Marable] died in 1952, Granny became really the, the center--she already was--of the entire Marable household, Marable clan.  My seven uncles and three aunts who lived in Tuskegee [Alabama], and the boys as she referred to my uncles, would come to the house every morning and eat; religiously, every day at about six a.m. and then they would depart maybe at about seven or 7:15 to go off to work.
Speaker 1: What did they talk about at six a.m. around the table?
Speaker 2: Business.  They'd talk about what they were doing that day.  They were all involved in either building houses, cutting timber, doing construction work of various types.  Marable enterprises built hundreds of homes and a football stadium in Tuskegee, in Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Is the football stadium still standing?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and, well Marable development on the east side of Tuskegee--there's Marable, Marable Drive, Brothers Drive, hundreds and hundreds of homes that my family has built.  Marable Apartments [Tuskegee, Alabama] as you drive from downtown Tuskegee on the only street that leads from the center of the town square where the confederate monument is, past Grey Columns [Varner-Alexander House, Tuskegee, Alabama] which is this imposing plantation.  The road bends 90 degrees and on either side as you enter the campus you have the Marable Apartments on the right and the left.
Story_ID: 579882
Speaker 1: Can you give me a brief history of Tus- Tuskegee [Alabama], the settlement of it and how did it come about?  Is it like Mound Bayou [Mississippi], Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: It has a different history.  Tuskegee is a Creek [Native American] word, which means little warrior.  It was settled as a community, as a town, prior to the Civil War.  It was a white town.  In, in the election of 1880, African Americans still voted in Alabama.  There was a deal that was struck between black voters and the Democratic Party.  If blacks supported the Democrats, then the Democrats said we will set aside $3,000 or a certain amount of money to establish a black school in Macon County [Alabama] near or in Tuskegee.  The blacks did and the white Democrats, for once, kept their word and that's how Tuskegee [Tuskegee State Normal School; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] was founded in 1881.  Booker T. Washington who, who was then the assistant principal of Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] was chosen at the age of twenty-five to be the founding principal of Tuskegee Institute, and that's how the institute was formed.  By the early 20th century, Tuskegee was the largest black university in the world.  There were over 1,100 students at Tuskegee.  Tuskegee is famous because it was constructed by the students from brick by brick from the ground up, and it's a remarkable architecture when you would stroll through the campus.  And there were enormous intellectuals and scholars; George Washington Carver and social scientist, Monroe Work and others; Oliver Cromwell Cox [Oliver Cox] was there in the 1940s, the socio- the great sociologist.  So, it's, it's a remarkable place, but the institute was always separate from the town.  The institute was black, the town was white supremacist, white, white.  Black folk did live in Tuskegee on the east side, but they were not the college elite and by the '20s [1920s] with the development of the VA hospital, the veterans hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], you have on the west side of town around Tuskegee Institute, the univer- you have the university as well as the black middle class professionals, the doctors, the nurses who were affiliated with that veterans hospital. So, it was a powerful and very large and substantial black middle class presence in Macon County.
Story_ID: 579883
Speaker 1: And your family then built homes around the university along that street (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Well that's where, that's where we depart.  You see the Marables were not part of that elite.  They had--my [paternal] great-grandfather [Morris Marable] had been a slave there.  My gra- (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Tuskegee [Alabama] or in that, in Alabama--
Speaker 2: In that area.
Speaker 1: --yeah in Alabama.
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Manning Marable, had been a saw miller and boot, and, and bootlegger during the Great Depression, but he was not a part of any kind of elite.  He was an entrepreneur, a businessman, and a farmer.  My uncles when they came to Tuskegee in the '50s [1950s] bought hou- homes and then began to build their, their enterprise, their business really in the early '60s [1960s] when it took off.  The houses they began to build in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s], were uniformly on the east side of town, where the neglected, more working class and, but growing middle class areas of the black community of the city were, on the other side from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  So, you had to drive through town to get to the, to the institute. But they, they actively developed the east side of the down, which is near the Tuskegee airport where the Tuskegee Airmen, the famous black airmen of World War II [WWII] were trained [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  My house, when I lived there, was literally adjacent to the airfield, quite literally, and back in the '70s [1970s] they still operated the airfield in a kind of primitive way.  I mean I could literally walk from my home and walk over to, to get in the, get in the airplane to fly to Atlanta [Georgia], you know.  But, all of that is on the east side of town.
Story_ID: 579884
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s] you said that some of the things you were fighting for were the Congressional Black Caucus [CBC], to get more members in the caucus.  Around that time, Shirley Chisholm ran for president (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: --around '72 [1972], the nomination.  Do you remember that incident?
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me anything about what, what the atmosphere was like in the country at the time and what your role was in her--or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't have a role--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --in it.  There was actually a great deal of hostility towards Shirley within the CBC because she made a decision to do this without consulting or informing most of the members of the CBC.  I must--from my judgment though, much of the hostility against her was unfortunately grounded in sexism and patriarchy.  These were men who were perplexed by a brilliant woman who was independent politically, taking the lead to assert herself in national politics.  She didn't feel she had to consult them for anything, and so there was a great deal of hostility against her.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about her?
Speaker 2: Well, I thought that it was interesting, but that she did not--at the time I didn't think she actually built a base.  I was twenty-one.  I didn't think she built a base sufficiently to establish a successful national run.  There weren't strong black institutions.  She had not taken--to run successfully for a national office requires a good two years of ground or three years or more of base building, and that I saw it as a symbolic run, which is what it was.
Speaker 1: Did you guys support her in her run, the organization that you were in was the B--?
Speaker 2: The National Black Political Assembly.  She actually distanced herself from that and that was another kind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because?
Speaker 2: Well, I think because of a lot of the things, controversial things that came out of Gary [Indiana].  Gary was largely a black nationalist style meeting.  There were integrationists there, but overwhelming, the majority of the sentiment of the people at Gary pursued a black nationalist oriented agenda, which meant that for example African Americans I think overwhelmingly at Gary were critical of the idea of school de- school integration.  We believed in community controlled schools.  We are very critical of busing for school integration.  We were critical, intensely critical of both political parties, Republicans and Democrats.  Shirley Chisholm was a loyal member of the Democratic Party and had been a member of a kind of regular Democrats here in New York State, and so she was not an insurgent Democrat. Even though she was independent as a person, as, as an individual she was really tied to the Democratic Party and we favored a break from that in the development of independent black institutions, almost a kind of parallel black government, the idea of a constituent assembly of black people, which is opened only to people of African descent to make independent decisions and then to use our power to influence whoever is elected to respond to an agenda, a black agenda, and if he or she didn't do that then you vote them out or you organize to defeat them.  That was our idea, and Shirley really didn't embrace those things.  So, no she was not, she was not an insurgent candidate in that sense, and she really took a strong distance from black nationalism.  The other thing is that she kept the distance from the Gary convention [National Black Political Convention, Gary, Indiana] because Gary was very critical of the State of Israel.
Speaker 1: The State of Israel?
Speaker 2: Very critical of the state of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why were you, why were they--
Speaker 2: Be, because of its endorsement of Palestinian rights.
Speaker 1: Because they did not endorse Palestinian rights or they gave them up.
Speaker 2: The Gary invent, the convention--
Speaker 1: The Gary convention endorsed Palestinian rights.
Speaker 2: --was strongly in favor of Palestinian rights of self-determination.
Speaker 1: Right, so they wanted a Palestinian state.
Speaker 2: And Shirley Chisholm could not have taken that position.  No, she's a Democrat in New York, no.
Story_ID: 579885
Speaker 1: Okay, so how openly can you talk about your feelings about Israel and the Palestinian state today? I mean is it something that we can't put on this tape?
Speaker 2: Sure, we could talk about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so versus how you felt in the '70s [1970s] the Gary [National Black Political Convention, Gary, Indiana], how--I mean just because you guys were for a Palestinian state did not necessary mean you opposed the State of Israel or did it mean you opposed the state?
Speaker 2: No it didn't.
Speaker 1: What did it mean?  It meant that you--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to speak for the Gary convention--
Speaker 1: Okay we'll stick with yourself.
Speaker 2: --'cause your presuming in the question--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: --that I speak for them.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, I'll, I'll take, yeah speak--
Speaker 2: All I will say and what I've learned over the last twelve or thirteen years in New York [New York] is that it's important, it's imperative to be very, very conscious of what you say.
Speaker 1: But I'll ask you this, I mean I'm, I guess what I'm trying what I've always thought is what would it be like had blacks in this country fought for a state as the Palestinians are fighting for in Israel?  What would a black state in this country look like?  I've often wondered if we armed our, if we had armed ourselves would we, you know--so that's the only reason I ask is to draw the parallels between us and them.
Speaker 2: I would be happy to talk about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: African Americans have imagined the possibility of a black state here for a couple of hundred years.  That goes back to Martin R. Delany [Martin Delany] in the 1830s; then Delany as a young man in his twenties traveled throughout the western United States dialoging with Native American tribes to seek to establish a territory for black people to immigrate to, an all-black state, and then in the nine, eight, 1840s, in the early 1850s he speculated on the possibility of a black state in Central America, Nicaragua or Costa Rica, or El Salvador.  Then in the late 1850s Delany even traveled to Nigeria, negotiated a peace treaty with an African ethnic group in Niger, in what is today Nigeria for the transatlantic migration of African Americans back to Africa.  So, African Americans for two hundred years have imagined the possibility of a black state.  In the 1960s, the Republic of New Afrika led by Imari Obadele actually went to Mississippi to try to establish an all-black state.  They actually even held an informal plebiscite that involved nearly 100,000 people in the late '60s [1960s] or early '70s [1970s] to create a black state.  Medgar Evers who was thought of as a staunch integrationist was actually really black nationalist in his orientation.  If you talk with Myrlie, his widow, Myrlie Evers-Williams [Myrlie Evers], Medgar believed in the possibility for a time in the early '50s [1950s] of armed struggle and the development of a Mau Mau revolution by blacks in the Mississippi Delta against whites where there'd be wholesale violence and the use of weapons to kill thousands of white people to assert black people's rights to self-determination and to freedom to live without lynching.  So, there have been many--there are enumerable examples of African Americans who have imagined an all-black state in the United States or elsewhere.
Speaker 1: You know everything (laughter).
Story_ID: 579886
Speaker 1: Back to the '70s [1970s] when you and your career.  You said you'd, you were bouncing around jobs, you had not gotten to Colgate [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York], but you were on your way there.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I think that the employment--the most significant employment during that period was--actually lasted only a year, and it was at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: In 1982, '83 [1983].  I was hired in the spring of '82 [1982] to be the director of the Institute for Race Relations.  The Institute of Race Relations was founded originally in 1944 by Charles Spurgeon Johnson, Charles S. Johnson.  There was a large academic building at Fisk campus, but just on the other side of the, the famous Fisk Chapel [Fisk Memorial Chapel, Nashville, Tennessee] called Park Johnson Hall and my office was a suite of offices on the second floor.  It used to be Charles Johnson's office.  I took great pride in being in Charles S.'s office.  We held several conferences there in the span of only a year.  We did, The Arms Race versus Human Needs [The Arms Race versus Human Needs: National Dialogue], a conference that really looked at the impact of the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] arms buildup upon the social and economic needs of the black community.  I wrote a great deal, I wrote a great deal about it in the early and mid-'80s [1980s]; about the destructive impact of what now historians refer to as the Second Cold War, the destructive investment by the Reagan administration into building this massive arms buildup that really took away and destroyed real opportunities and helped to lead to the de, de-industrialization of our cities and the destruction of the social safety net.  All of the kinds of urban problems in the '80s [1980s] flowed out of that; of the urban mismanagement and just the reactionary Reagan administration.  The race relations institute had lapsed in the '60s [1960s], and the president, Walter Leonard [HistoryMaker Walter J. Leonard], wanted to revive it and I did.  And I loved Fisk dearly.  I loved teaching the students.  They were marvelous.  I loved being in the South.  I loved building black institution, but what I didn't love was that they didn't remit our payments for pensions to the pension management company, TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund] and did not inform the faculty, so we had no pensions.  They did not remit our payments that are, the deductions that are coming out of our payroll mon- on a monthly basis to the healthcare provider, and so we had no health insurance and I had three little children.
Speaker 1: Oh that's a problem.
Speaker 2: That was a problem, and that is, that's exactly why I had to leave because I was a father and I could not afford not to have healthcare and not to have a pension.  We had to do something.
Story_ID: 579887
Speaker 1: The opportunity to go to, to Colgate [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York] occurred in the spring of '83 [1983].  I did not want to leave Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], but I had no choice.  As it was, it was a fortunate relocation because it was at, well both at Fisk and at Colgate, but primarily Colgate, I was hired in the summer of '83 [1983] to create African American and Latino studies there.  So, I was the director, I was hired to create a program and over a course of three years from '83 [1983] to '86 [1986], I established the Africana and Hispanics studies program, developed a curriculum, did programming, learned how to run an interdisciplinary program in a liberal arts college, and all of those skill sets enhanced my vitae [curriculum vitae] which allowed me then in '87 [1987] to become and be hired as the chair of the largest black studies department in the United States at the time, which is, was at Ohio State University [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], when I was thirty-six. So all those things greatly accelerated my career. And I wrote at Colgate, in three years, three books, so I was tremendously productive--because you know you're in the middle of nowhere.  You're between Syracuse [New York] and Albany [New York]; you're snowed in half the year and there is absolutely nothing to do.
Story_ID: 579888
Speaker 1: So, when you arrive there [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York] in '83 [1983], that summer, that was the same year that Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] announced that he was going to run for president, wasn't it or thereabouts (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was--yeah that's right. And in fact although I learned that Jesse was interested in running for president on I believe New Year's Day, 1983, about nine or ten months before he announced, and I was stunned.
Speaker 1: Stunned because?
Speaker 2: In fact, I laughed so hard I almost fell out of my chair.  I was in the office that day at New Year's, which explains in part why I've been married, married twice (laughter).  I, I've been accused of being a workaholic.  I suppose if there's a word beyond that that's what I am.  I live for writing and so I wasn't a great husband the first time around, in that I devoted nearly all of my energy to intellectual production and not enough to other parts of life that are equally important.  But, my wife, first wife and I had a deal that I had to cook dinner, but I could get up as early as I wanted and go to work, so when I taught at Colgate or Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], I would get up at six a.m. or before six a.m. and by 6:30 I was in the office smoking my pipe, probably on the third cup of coffee by eight and I got a lot of writing done before noon. And I usually taught in the morning and was there always like twelve hours, also all day Saturday and usually most Sundays.
Speaker 1: But, you said you almost fell out of your chair when you heard that Jesse was running because?
Speaker 2: Because we forget Jesse's checkered history.  Perhaps you're too young to remember that when King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed Jesse was there and what was it, about twenty-four hours later he shows up in Chicago [Illinois] wearing a blood-stained shirt and he's staggering out on stage wailing about Martin's death.  A lot of people never forgave--including Coretta [Coretta Scott King], never forgave Jesse for this, this kind of you know incredible show to promote himself in the wake of Martin's assassination.  That's the way many people viewed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and still do.  In the 1970s, he began to champion a move from civil rights to silver rights.  Talked about corporate covenants.  He flirted with the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], with the Reagan administration even at some point for a short period of time, and so there were many things that led most black activists in my generation to see Jesse as something of a hustler or a person who was un- who was not a principled political leader like Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums] or like Harold Washington.  We saw those individuals as really being cutting edge, progressing within the Democratic Party.  Most people did not see Jesse that way, but the surprise was on us because historical moment--Jesse's great strength is that he is an inconsistent ideological weathervane for the black community.  As the black community moves, so moves Jesse.  His political antennae is far more acute than any other black politicians of his generation, and he anticipated the anger of the African American community and it was possible for a black person to run an independent style campaign against the Democratic Party, but within the Democratic Party primaries.  Jesse ran against Reagan and the neo-liberal politics represented by Walter Mondale and that it would have a mass base and that you could mobilize black churches to provide institutional support for a successful run.  Jesse did sense all that, and he seized the moment.
Story_ID: 579889
Speaker 1: Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] you were talking about his run for--you had no intentions of winning.
Speaker 2: Well, we have to qualify what we mean by winning.  Usually in American electoral politics to win means to be ushered into public office, but for African Americans, you must always keep in mind that the majority of African Americans voted in a presidential election for the first time in 1968. That the vast majority of our history in this country we have been relegated outside of electoral politics.  The democracy that is talked about in the Constitution was never extended to us.  It was only through our struggle, our collective fight for civil rights and social justice that we won the democratic right to vote that is casually given to white people without a struggle, simply by being white, in a racialized society.  And so our attitude about electoral politics must be somewhat different based on our unique history.  By the 1980s, it was very clear that the Democratic Party was not mounting an effective opposition to the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] regime and that black people had to push against Reaganism,  the only way they could, which was actually to push in the Democratic Party because we were already there. And the logical thing is to use the presidential primary apparatus to make a case for a--in European terms, a social democratic economic and social justice program, and that is what Jesse articulated very effectively and powerfully.  You have a strong black united front.  Everybody from the communist to Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] uniting behind Jesse Jackson.  It was an extraordinary event in '84 [1984] and in '88 [1988].  Jesse carried states either caucuses or primaries like Vermont and Alaska where there are virtually no African Americans.  So, if you look at say the '88 [1988] campaign, Jesse won 7 million votes.  Half of those were from African Americans, but the other half were from whites and Latinos and Asians.  So, this was not a monochromatic Rainbow Coalition, all black.  We knew that success had to be defined by two things.  One, the registration of hundreds of thousands of new voters brought into the political process, and two that all of those young campaign workers, especially in '84 [1984], who first learned how to do voter registration education, get out the vote, and to interface with elected officials and to push, who got involved in the political process.  By '88 [1988], by the late '80s [1980s] and throughout the '90s [1990s] and then into the 21st century, that became the core new generation of black elected official leadership, and Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] was a part of that generation, and you see literally thousands of people whose first engagement with politics was the Jackson campaign and that is why we embraced it.
Story_ID: 579890
Speaker 1: The mid-'80s [1980s] was an extraordinary time politically for black America because you have not only the Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] campaign, you have the most remarkable mayoral struggle that has occurred in American history, the, the victory of Harold Washington in 1983 and his reelection in '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  Eighty-eighty, to register more than 80 percent of the total black vote and to get 80 percent turnout.  It's unimaginable in any city in the United States, and that, that requires such a remarkable mobilization, and yet this was accomplished by African Americans.  An extraordinary victory and again it was not monochromatic because you had the overwhelming majority of Jewish voters, of Latino voters uniting behind Harold in a multiracial, multiclass coalition.
Speaker 2: Was the '80s [1980s] the first time that the country saw black leaders at the helm of big cities like Chicago?
Speaker 1: They had been, mayors of cities in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Mayors of cities in the '70s [1970s] okay.
Speaker 1: But it was first time that whites could begin to imagine the possibility of an African American being the chief executive of the country.  It was Jackson who really opened that door effectively in '88 [1988] with his very successful run.  Only Michael Dukakis stood in the way of Jackson winning the Democratic Party's nomination.  So that by the late '80s [1980s] that the racial ceiling that had always existed in electoral politics, up until the late '80s [1980s], no matter who the black person was running for office, regardless of her or his ideology they could be conservative, they could be liberal, radical, that white people no more than about 40, the max of 40 percent of all whites in whatever the polity was would vote for that person.  They just wouldn't vote, the majority of white people would not, could not vote for a black person, no matter how qualified, no matter how meritorious, the racial barrier kept them from voting in their own interest, supporting people who effectively advanced their interest simply because they were white and they couldn't overcome their racism.  That, that was shattered by the late '80s [1980s], and Jackson is more responsible for it than anybody else and so that by the late '80s [1980s] Doug Wilder [HistoryMaker L. Douglas Wilder] gets elected governor of Virginia of all things and that you have African Americans becoming head of the joint chiefs of staff like Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] and then secretary of state by the beginning of the 21st century that both in non-electoral and in electoral politics African Americans made tremendous gains.
Story_ID: 579891
Speaker 1: Some would argue, and there is some truth in this, that these gains, many of these gains are ephemeral, that they are types of symbolic representation.  Because by the late--by the '90s [1990s] you could no longer talk about a unified black community.  There were really not one black America, but really three.  There's a black middle professional managerial class of black elite doing remarkably well, two parent households, both people gone to college and gainfully employed is a tiny percentage of our community.  But, in terms of their, in terms of their salaries, their wages, they actually earn about the same, roughly the same or a little bit more than comparable white families.  That's because of labor force participation rates for black women have always been higher than for white women, and so black households in that category earn comparable salaries.  Their net wealth is much lower because of institutional racism and discrimination which we could talk about.  But, then you had the black working class that is losing ground, and then you have the truly disadvantaged, what some sociologists refer to as the underclass that is experiencing an economic and social holocaust.  The devastation, destruction, crack, the urban decay, like the film 'City of God' of Rio De Janeiro [Brazil].  You have that in South Bronx [Bronx, New York] and in east New York.
Speaker 2: Today?
Speaker 1: Today, Hough [Cleveland, Ohio] and, and in, in areas of the South Side and the West Side of Chicago [Illinois]. That--well I'm really talking about what happened in the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s]; in some of those neighborhoods, things have been turned around, but in other ways more fundamentally they have not been. Because today in 2005, 45 percent of the African American males in this city [New York, New York] are outside of--who are, who are between the ages of twenty-one to fifty-four years of age are outside of the traditional pay labor force.  They're unemployed, underemployed or simply not a part of the labor force, and so you're talking about widespread chronic unemployed and underemployment and you're talking about the decay and ruin of major huge urban tracks, dead cities, dead cities, and all of that occurred in the '80s [1980s] and under Reagan's [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] watch, which were allowed to decay and destroy.  Crack [crack cocaine] proliferating and with concomitant drugs under the Reagan and first Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] regimes and it dev- it was devastating to black activism by the '90s [1990s].
Story_ID: 579892
Speaker 1: So, in the '80s [1980s] you've sort of set the stage of what the country was like, which leads me to want to know about the three books you wrote.  What were you writing about in the '80s [1980s]?  And take me through all that.
Speaker 2: Sure, well that's simple.  The first book I wrote that a lot of people read and was instantly acclaimed and denounced was 'How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America' ['How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society,' Manning Marable].  It came out in January 1983, and I was thirty-two years old, and within a couple of weeks a lot of people had read it and either, and loved it or hated it.
Speaker 1: So, can you give me a brief synopsis of--
Speaker 2: It would have to be very brief 'cause--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I've written and edited twenty books, it's just one--
Speaker 1: Okay of that one yeah.
Speaker 2: --but, but that's, that's a book that even to this day I get letters from prisoners.  I get letters, I get several letters a week, every week from prisoners and one of the favorite books they like is 'How Capitalism'--people still teach it.  It's gone through I don't how many editions.  I did a revised edition in 2001 with--and, and about the twentieth anniversary edition and I critiqued the book in a very lengthy introduction, and I got emails and angry calls from people who were angry because I was critical of my own book (laughter).  Go figure, I mean, you know.  Books have a life of their own.  They're not quite like children, because children continue to evolve.  I always like to use, use the metaphor that my books are like children, but it's not true.  Your children grow and learn and modify their, their behavior toward you as they gain a sense of themselves.  Your book is, what it is, is what it is.
Speaker 1: So, can I ask you, I mean you can not answer it if you--but how did, can you tell me how capitalism underdeveloped black America or just some--?
Speaker 2: It would take too long.
Speaker 1: Too long, okay.
Speaker 2: The short answer to that is through what Leith Mullings refers to as accumulation through dispossession, that is black people are here as a product of their dispossession, that is their forcible removal from Africa, their relocation here to produce wealth for a group of people, a class, to accumulate out of the product of their labor power and that's the essence of it. And so the book describes how that occurs and the class stratification within the black community that was a result, and I describe--the book uses a kind of sociology that says there are basically two groups in the black community.  There's the black, the majority, the black majority and then there's a black elite.  The black majority are the working class, low income people, preponderantly woman and prisoners and people who are incarcerated in prison industrial complex.  And then there's black elite, and I describe political leadership and religious leadership and black businesses and entrepreneurship and their evolution, et cetera.  The sociology, the structure of this I now disagree with, and it would take much too long to explain why.  I mean people can read my intro to--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the new edition and find that, but the book itself was extremely influential for, from what I understand, for a generation of activists who came to maturity intellectually in the '80s [1980s] and people say it was their bible.  I've run into that a great deal.  I know encounter women and men who are in their forties--thirties and forties, who were raised on 'How Capitalism.'  Being only fifty-five myself, it's an odd feeling to have this kind of talmudic authority conferred upon one.  I wrote another book called 'Race Reform and Rebellion:  The Second Reconstruction in Black America' ['Race Reform and Rebellion:  The Second Reconstruction in Black America, 1945-1982,' Manning Marable] for--actually for Macmillan [Macmillan Press] in the UK [United Kingdom], for British O-level exams, but because the United States--our school systems are so bad, the book was ideal for college undergraduates in the United States (laughter) instead of British O-levels.  So, the book became a textbook for colleges teaching Afr- recent African American history, and it still sells to this day.  We did a second edition, we probably will do a third.  I wrote a massive book called 'Black American Politics' [Manning Marable] that I had to divide, and so two books were published.  'Black American Politics,' which focused on the United States and then, and it came out in '85 [1985], published in Verso, by Verso Press in London [England], and then in '87 [1987] 'African and Caribbean Politics' ['African and Caribbean Politics: From Kwame Nkrumah to Maurice Bishop,' Manning Marable] which looked at black politics outside of the U.S., in '87 [1987] it came out--and then in '86 [1986] I wrote 'W.E.B. Du Bois: Black Radical Democrat' [Manning Marable] for Twayne Publishers in Boston [Massachusetts].  So, those were the books I wrote during that, the mid-'80s [1980s].  It was a very productive time.
Story_ID: 579893
Speaker 1: So, what's happening, what happens to you in the late '80s [1980s], like '89 [1989], early '90s [1990] when we see--
Speaker 2: Okay, well my life changed when I accepted the job at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], and I was hired--I learned a very difficult lesson.  You never take a job where they're recruiting an outside chair to clean up a department.  My hair went from black to white in less than two years running that department.  It was, to just put gently, a nightmare.  But, nevertheless, I brought in quality faculty.  I was still productive intellectually, but most of my time was taken up with administrative matters.  It was a large--there were nineteen faculty in that department, and we had a community extension in the east side of Columbus [Ohio], historic black community there, and we did programming extensively.  The most important thing that came from the experience curiously was something that was unanticipated.  In my second year there, I decided to do a course entitled the Black, the Black commun- the History of Black Columbus.  The History of Black Columbus.  The idea was the put together a reader, and this was before contentious copyright laws and Napster and all, all that kind of rigmarole.  I put together a massive reader, a textbook, half of which included articles from scholarly publications by and about African Americans in Columbus, Ohio.  And the second part consisted of newspaper clippings, articles in the local Columbus, Ohio, press, black and white newspapers--
Speaker 1: What was the black newspaper called?
Speaker 2: The Call and Post.
Speaker 1: The Call and Post.
Speaker 2: It was published in Cleveland [Ohio], but they had an edition in Columbus.  Drawn from the Call and Post, drawn from Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier]. It sometimes covered events, things in Columbus with Chicago Defender, but material about Columbus, Ohio, that interrogated themes, race and criminal justice, public schools, healthcare, education, housing, et cetera, okay.  And so you have this you know massive reader, 500 or so, 400 or 500 pages.  So, every student has this reader and you have obligatory readers.  You have class twice a week.  I do a lecture on that theme, and then we take a little break and then have movie cameras, you have television cameras and you have cable access television and it turns into 'Oprah' ['The Oprah Winfrey Show'].  I become kind of like the Charlie Rose or the Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] or Phil Donahue.  I guess at that time in the mid-'80s [1980s] or late '80s [1980s], and I have a panel of representatives on that theme, say like a police captain or lieutenant who deals with problems of drug abuse in the black community.  You have a community organizer, or a social worker.  You have an expert, a social scientist on that topic, and you have the cable access television.  You have a television program, the students have already read the material, so they can ask intelligent questions to the panelists, and so there's a public dialogue of an hour that's videotaped and then showed on cable access.  So, you have a class, you develop a, you create a synthesized reader of archival as well as contemporary materials interrogating a site of the black community to preserve that history and you make that available to the whitest possible audience through television. And as primitive as it was, that became the prototype for the whole direction of the rest of my intellectual life.  I didn't know it at the time, but what I do now all grows out of that experience, living black history.  My theory of living history really goes back nearly twenty years to when I was the director, when I was the chair of black studies at Ohio State.
Story_ID: 579894
Speaker 1: So from '89 [1989] to '93 [1993] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From '89 [1989] to '93 [1993], I was at University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder] in Boulder [Colorado] where I was affiliated with the Center for Ethnic, for the Center for Race and Ethnicity in the Americas, CSERA, Center for Studies of Race and Ethnicity in the Americas [sic. Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in the Americas], and it was a great place to be.  I loved the mountains and all of that.  I went through a very difficult divorce.  It was difficult on a personal level, but, and I also think that during the early '90s [1990s] because of some challenges with my own health, it was a hard time for me and I was coming to terms with where was my work going.  I wanted to create a model of what African American studies could be, and in Colorado I couldn't do that.  I needed to be at a place where I could fashion for myself a unique program of African American studies that reflected what I later called transformat- a transformative or transformationist set of political and intellectual values.  African American history has been largely divided in a template between those who have favored racial integration or assimilation with the American mainstream, Frederick Douglass and Martin King [Revered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], versus those who have favored a more separatist and black nationalist orientation, Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, Elijah Muhammad, Martin R. Delany [Martin Delany], et cetera.  There's a third position, and the third position is what I call transformation.  By transformation I mean taking the position that suggests that it's not about integration or separation, it's about not civil rights, but human rights.  It should be about the restructuring or transformation of power relations between African Americans and the U.S. government and the political economy of power, that is the structure of who owns what to transform power relations, so that it is possible to sustain and to enrich the African American cultural heritage without sacrificing who we are, but, but, but creating a more advanced democracy in this country.  It's a position that Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] took, Paul Robeson.  It's a position that Malcolm took at the end of his life and Dr. King at the end of his life, so it really transcends that traditional divide of integration and separatism.  And I wanted to build a shop of outstanding scholars who were deeply committed to the black community that saw, that erased the barrier between university and community, that espoused a communiversity as it were and black studies that was our mission joining out of the intellectual legacy of Du Bois.  That is what I wanted to do, and in 1993 I was offered the position of creating black studies at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and that was my opportunity to do that.  It came at the right time, and for the next ten years I built the Institute for Research in African-American Studies [IRAAS].
Story_ID: 579895
Speaker 1: And the living history it's still living because it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you've done remarkable projects using that same template.
Speaker 2: I wanted--selfishly I wanted to remake the field in many ways because I felt that there was an intellectual impasse in black studies.  But in '90 [1990], late '90s [1990s], mid-'90s [1990s] it was very clear to me that there was increasingly a disconnect between the black intelligentsia and what I would call the professional managerial black elite, and the situation of the masses of our people and that black scholars had to intervene with a deep commitment to the empowerment and the full emancipation of the masses of our people.
Speaker 1: How are we breaking off?  What were the, I mean, how--
Speaker 2: You see it everywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean from bling, bling to the kind of predatory notions of how blackness can be manipulated and marketed, to the disturbing forms of denigration of African American women that are promoted within the reactionary current of hip hop.  I'm not one of these people that just denigrates all of, all of hip hop indiscriminately.  Much of hip hop is extraordinary and brilliant and de- and profoundly progressive.  There is a wing of it, that is.  Then there is part of hip hop that is also brilliant.  I guess for me the best hip hop, the most brilliant hip hop practitioner has to be Tupac Shakur, but the young brother was deeply divided.  Did brilliant great work and profoundly misogynistic, profoundly reactionary work as well, and then there's the gangster rap and the other element of it and then the more recent currents that are even more reactionary than gangster rap from the early '90s [1990s] was.  So, but--
Speaker 1: What year-- I'm sorry, but go ahead.
Speaker 2: The main thing that I have, when I came here to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] my goal was to create, recreate what Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] did in Atlanta [Georgia].  In the late 1890s, Du Bois once a year and for a number of years until around 1913 at the end, the last weekend of May held the Atlanta University conferences [Atlanta University studies] where you would take up an issue to explore that year and you would produce, bring a whole series of scholars to Atlanta, read papers, and then bind it together and produce a volume.  So, if you go to the library and you look for the Atlanta University series, there are these series of sterling volumes interrogating the Negro in business, the college (air quotes) bred Negro, I believe 1901, economics, education, all of those issues, healthcare, educ- you know, and Du Bois created the foundations of African American studies.  Everything we do rest on the foundation of Du Bois, and I wanted to build another scaffold, another floor of that for the 21st century, and so we too did conferences and brought in people.  We developed innovative conferences and courses and initiatives.  So, we have a course where we teach at Rikers Island [New York, New York], at Rikers High [Austin H. MacCormick Island Academy, New York, New York] with four, with fifteen, sixteen, seventeen-year-old black and Hispanic young men.  We successfully received seven hundred dollar, seven hundred thousand dollars from the George Soros foundation of the Open Society Institute [Open Society Foundations] to fund that.  We are engaged in a project trying to develop a black theory of justice.  I call it imagining justice.  It simply asks the question if black folk had justice what would it look like, you see 'cause we've never had it.  What would it look like?  And so my argument is, is that black people within our material culture, that is, our print culture and our manifestos and writings, over a period of two hundred years, we have devised a theory of justice.  It has to be gleaned from the print culture and then expressed as a theory.  Now as you know, any theory, a legal theory can be used in a court of law.  We have an alternative theory of the meaning of justice that can help shape law review articles, it can help shape an argument in court.  And so that's one of the projects that we're pursuing; the black theory of justice.
Story_ID: 579896
Speaker 1: I think I should probably talk briefly about my chronic illness.  That's I think important because it certainly had a profound impact upon my life.  I've written about it briefly in one of my favorite books, 'Beyond Black and White' ['Beyond Black and White: Rethinking Race in American Politics and Society,' Manning Marable], which came out in 1995.  The reason it's one of my favorite books is because I thought it would be my last book, and in the introduction I actually talk about my illness.  I have an illness called sarcoidosis.  Sarcoid is an illness that Afr- the preponderant, the majority of people who have it in the United States are African Americans or people of, of ethnic background associated with the Mediterranean or North Africa.  But, prepo- but preponderantly they are African Americans.  It's an illness that is a cousin of lupus, and you have the proliferation of white blood cells, and having too many white blood cells is almost, is nearly as bad as having no white blood cells and if you don't have any white blood cells or they're destroyed like in AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] you have an acquired immunodeficiency, then you have opportunistic diseases that can kill you.  In the reverse of that, which is what sarcoid is, you have too many white blood cells and they begin to attack healthy tissue, and that tends to be the lungs or the heart or other internal organs, the liver, it can be the brain, and the treatment of that in--it was diagnosed in January, 1986.  The treatment of that for ten years was, was through prednisone, which is a steroid.  That is, and trust me, that's worse than the illness.  And so for many years I was on a very high dose of prednisone.  I gained weight, and it has a profound impact on your personality.  It is very difficult for many people to concentrate.  It was a real struggle.  In the early '90s [1990s], it was a very difficult time for me.  In the mid-'90s [1990s], there was a point where in '94 [1994] and '95 [1995] I thought I was going to die, and I very nearly did.
Story_ID: 579897
Speaker 1: And then I met this remarkable woman who saved me in many ways.  She started life as a nurse, and this shows the power of social justice and civil rights movements.  She was a nurse finishing at Columbia Uni- Columbia hospital [New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York] and they had a fellowship, a full ride to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], the number one anthropology department in the, in the United States for people to go from nursing school to a Ph.D. program in anthropology and Leith [Leith Mullings] got it and went to the University of Chicago where she received her Ph.D. in cultural anthropology.  Leith Mullings grew up in Queens [New York].  She, but she was born in Jamaica, a family of extraordinary people, her siblings.  Her father was the, I believe the first or second CPA [certified public accountant], African American CPA in the State of New York.  Her three sisters are all attorneys.  One is the city commissioner or associate commissioner for taxis, I think.  Another is, her, her brother, her only brother is the CEO of a major hospital in Arizona.  Her, one of her sisters is on, is on the New York supreme court [Supreme Court of the State of New York] as a judge.  So, it's extraor- it's a typical West Indian family, a typical Jamaican family, extraordinary, all products of City University [City University of New York, New York, New York], and so she's deeply committed to public education and very hostile to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].  I--she was the person who was recruiting me to come to CUNY [City University of New York] instead of Columbia, and so there was a competition between the two institutions.  That's where we met.  So, I didn't go to CUNY, but three years later she, Leith and I got married.
Speaker 2: And what year did you marry?
Speaker 1: We married on June the 1st, 1996, very special day.  And I had read her work before. She's an extraordinary intellectual, but we had never met personally and Leith is my bright and morning star.
Story_ID: 579898
Speaker 1: She's [Marable's wife, Leith Mullings] the one who suggested that I didn't have to die, we're gonna fight this thing [sarcoidosis] before we got married, even before we fell in love, and she said, "You're too, you're too important for our people to let you die.  I'm not gonna let you die, we're gonna find a way to deal with this," and she went to all kinds of doctors.  She went to public health conferences on this issue and found resources and so the treatment to sustain my life and we went off prednisone, went to other, we went to a drug called Aralen [chloroquine].  Aralen has a lot of benefits, but it also has a drawback.  Prolonged use can destroy your retinal tissue.  To make a long story very short, I don't have--now my left eye is kind of, is kind of what, an ornament, but I lost my central vision in my left eye, so that's gone.  I read out of my right eye and see out of my right eye.  So, there have been a lot of health challenges for me, but I'm here and it's a good feeling to beat the odds, because a lot of black people succumb to this, and I've had it for nearly twenty years.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Story_ID: 579899
Speaker 1: Do they succumb because it's, because it's primarily black people that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they, they don't get good healthcare.
Speaker 1: They don't get good healthcare.
Speaker 2: You know 25 percent of all African Americans don't even have health insurance; that our people have substandard healthcare and even when we go into the hospital there are literally hundreds of studies that people like Jack Geiger [H. Jack Geiger] documented over six hundred individual studies of cases that show that black people having the identical health problem, identical health issue will be treated by physicians in fundamentally different ways.  Don't have the same kind of invasive techniques used, heart resuscitation, surgeries.  We don't get that stuff, even though we have insurance.  Even though we have the same diagnosis, we don't get the same healthcare and so our people die.  I mean why is it that a fourth of all young black kids who are five years old, who grow up, who were born and live in central Harlem [New York, New York], in east Harlem have asthma.  That's a product, not of some debilitating illness that is genetic to us, but that is socially derived, that is a product of the environmental racism that is allowed to flourish and tolerate in African American communities.  Why is that half of the waste products of the entire City of New York [New York] are processed in west Harlem, right adjacent to west Harlem community?  Is that an accident?  No, so that's why we die.  Why is that nearly 45 percent of all black men die before they collect social security?  At that rate, I should be collecting it right now, but you know racialized discrimination, accumulation through dispossession.  The fast majority of the African American people are dead before they reach the age of seventy-five, and the median age, the average age of death for a white woman in this country is eighty.  So, they collect long after we are dead and gone.
Story_ID: 579900
Speaker 1: Being in this position and seeing, and seeing the, you know being here at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and seeing the world or having a different look, I mean I guess I want to talk about now some of what your feelings have been and your colleagues have been towards big racial issues in the country, for example Rodney King.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that--.
Speaker 2: Why can't we all get along, just get along.
Speaker 1: Get along.  Rodney King is beat, we see the video tape (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --what did you think was going to happen to those police officers?  We know what happened to them. As a result of what happened to them, there was a riot.  How did your community react?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: And by that I mean the academic community.
Speaker 2: I anticipated that the police officers would at least have a symbolic slap on the wrist, but then in Simi Valley, California, literally all white neighborhood, they let the cops go.  They should have anticipated that there would be a racial conflagration.  I happened to be in London [England], landing in London at Heathrow [Heathrow Airport, Hillingdon, England] when the verdict was handed down and I only heard about, and I got on the tube to go into west London.  I normally stay either in Kensington [London, England], someplace in west London around Ken- near Kensington Gardens right or, or Knightsbridge [London, England] usually.  And I was on the way to the hotel and I heard about this and I said okay.  So, within twenty-four hours I was on BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation], BBC 1, BBC 2.  I was on Channel 4, Independent Television [ITV].  I was doing all kinds of international media, you know, Sky TV.
Speaker 1: Now when you're on TV, are you defending the riot, are you telling people why we are rioting?  What, what did they ask of you when you appear on TV or--?
Speaker 2: What is going, what explains this?
Speaker 1: What, what explains this is a great question.
Speaker 2: And I say well because Rodney King only, was kind of like the last straw.  You have to understand that very much like with the Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] crisis of 2005 that Katrina was what I call an unnatural disaster, not a natural, an unnatural disaster, because within a natural disaster there is a human tragedy that could have and should have been avoided. And so it was unnatural that it occurred this way.  Similarly with Rodney King.  It's an unnatural disaster because it was the product of racialized criminal, a racialized criminal justice system and process that allows police to beat, harass, and kill African Americans with impunity, and for the African American community, it was a breaking point. But the real damage was done not by this jury trial, but by years of neglect of the flight of capital from South Central [Los Angeles, California] and from Watts [Los Angeles, California], the, the destruction of economic opportunity, the weakness of public school education for our children, police harassment and neglect by the city administration, L.A. County [Los Angeles County, California].  So, all of those things went into the explosion that occurred and people felt frustrated and angry, not so much about Rodney King's beating, but about the circumstances of their own lives.  That's what I talked about.
Story_ID: 579901
Speaker 1: By the late '80s [1980s], I'd begun to do a great deal of media.  And I think one of the reasons I wanted to move to New York [New York] was it would be much easier.  I used to hate having to fly to do say Donahue ['The Phil Donahue Show'] or I think some of the early things I did with people like 'Charlie Rose' I would have to fly from Denver [Colorado] all the way to New York or Washington, D.C., do the thing and then have to fly back.  You would lose like two, you'd lose like three days doing one event.  It's easier getting in a cab and going to the east side in the 50s and doing Charlie Rose and coming home you know; it takes a couple of hours.  So, that was one of the concerns I had.  But, I think the other is that I wanted to position my work and make it more accessible to larger mainstream audiences and, but that took a little more work.  It really didn't happen--the breakthrough book was 'Beyond Black and White' ['Beyond Black and White: Rethinking Race in American Politics and Society,' Manning Marable].  Verso [Verso Press] promoted it extensively.  I travelled extensively, which was really remarkable considering how sick I was.  I think we spoke at twenty-two, twenty-one venues in the span of less than three months, which is a lot for like a book promotion and the book was heavily promoted and it was heavily reviewed, very positively reviewed for a collection of essays and it opened up avenues to mainstream publishers.  I did several books then with Columbia University Press [New York, New York].  'Black Leadership' [Manning Marable] got picked up by Penguin [Penguin Books] in 1999 and it allowed me to do other things which led to now this partnership.  I have now three books with Basic Books, Perseus [Perseus Book Group] and with Viking Press, Penguin [Penguin Random House], so there's a big difference between the work I do now, and its general accessibility to an international audience, to where it was about a decade ago and all--coming to New York meant all the difference, and I had tremendous frustration about that.

Speaker 1: We put on an enormous conference in Boulder [Colorado] around ninety, '92 [1992] called, the Colors of the Diasporas [Colors of the Diaspora: International Conference on Race and Ethnicity in Comparative Perspective], which looked at blacks, the diaspora of people of African descent; there's an Asian diaspora; there's the Indian diaspora, of Indian pe- like in the southern part of the continent in India, Southern Asian, being in the Caribbean, in Guyana and Trinidad, United States right, a million Indians live in the United States.  So, looking at those comparative colors of the diasporas, Salman Rushdie who was then there was a fatwa on him by the ayatollah [Ruhollah Khomeini] in Iran.  His first public address was at our conference in the United States.  And we had zip, we had zip media, nothing. And I spent a year working on this thing, and I said if we put this in New York [New York] we'd be in The Times [The New York Times], probably not above the fold or first, first page, but it would be in the arts and ideas sections if such a thing had existed at that time.  And you can do the same thing here and it becomes accessible.  We did a conference here last weekend interrogating the issue of affirmative action and the world of race in, in what was called--the scholar Ira Katznelson refers to 'When Affirmative Action was White' ['When Affirmative Action was White: An Untold History of Racial Inequality in Twentieth-Century America,' Ira Katznelson] that in '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s] white people benefited from affirmative action.  It was white.
Speaker 2: While you speak, you say affirmative, when affirmative action was white it makes me think of Clarence Thomas, and we haven't talked about him.
Speaker 1: Oh, we gotta move to that.  Anyway I was going to say that when we did this little conference we have C-SPAN coverage right, and that's a luxury you have being out of Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and being in the City of New York.  You know BET [Black Entertainment Television] roles in, and I do BET every other week, you know so it's--those are the things that help enhance--I'm just being objective--enhance your career so that, and it is unfair, and I know that, and it does trouble me.  This whole construction of public intellectuals and my entry into that kind of elite group and the public speaking I do--I speak now maybe sixty to eighty times a year.  It troubles me because there are so many gifted and talented inte- intellectuals of African descent, dedicated scholars whose work is not as widely read who deserve to be who don't have access to those resources or to that kind of extensive audience.

Speaker 1: --Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.], [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier, Michael Eric Dyson, Patricia Williams [Patricia J. Williams], over at our law school [Columbia Law School, New York, New York], Kimberle Crenshaw [Kimberle Williams Crenshaw] in our law school and at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California].  There is a cohort of about two dozen people in that group.
Speaker 2: What's the woman's name at Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] who wrote the 'The Wind Done Gone' [HistoryMaker Alice Randall]?  What is (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Never, never ask a question (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But there's a cohort of people who--Paul Gilroy, and people like that whose works are widely read out, you know beyond the narrow confines of their discipline and who are assigned as obligatory reading for colleges, hundreds of colleges throughout the United States, and by the time I was in my mid-forties, I fell into, I, I was in that group.
Speaker 2: So are the, do the usual suspects talk to one another?
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of us own houses in Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's Bell Hooks [Gloria Jean Watkins] who, who has a tiny house there and Skip has a larger house--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --and Lani is across--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the street from me and Ogle, [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree is about a mile away and we hang out, especially (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What do you talk about when you hang out?
Speaker 1: It's an extraordinary time in August where it's a space of our own, where people have book readings, conversations, poetry readings, plays are tried out. [HistoryMaker] Stanley Nelson has for several years shown the rough cuts of films he's working on.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: That's right. And we go over to Stanley's house, they have a gorgeous place, and Marcia [Marcia A. Smith] and--his wife--I know Marcia for years, we go over to the house, which is right on Ocean Park.  It looks out at the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean], Nantucket Sound; it's a gorgeous place, and we live about fifteen minutes away.

Speaker 1: My agent always says if you drop a bomb on Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts], you'd wipe out half of the Negro intellectuals in the United States (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).  So, but do--
Speaker 1: The Negrorati is, is what I said.
Speaker 2: Like the Negro intellectuals do, do you understand the plight of the common black people?  I mean like do you--
Speaker 1: The co- (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, let me just take that, let me--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --by that I mean do you, do you--like the riots in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] you see those angry people and burning down stuff and tearing up stuff do you, do you, like do you feel it the way they do, like in our hearts, like you understand it.  I know they're angry, I know they're made and part of me wants to say burn it down if though I know we're not gonna rebuild it and, and at the end of the day it's our own things, but, but I understand it, like really feel it.
Speaker 1: Right, some of us do because we live it, and that is what I mean by transformation, that black studies should be descriptive.  It should describe; the great cultural anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, uses the phrase thick description.  That's what I mean by descriptive.  It should be thickly or richly described, the substance of black life.  It should be corrective.  It should challenge racist assumptions, and it should be prescriptive.  It should be a praxis, theory and action, the Greek word for prax, for that is praxis.  It should be transformative so that you cannot study the prison industrial complex from being ensconced in the ivory tower.  You've gotta leave that ivory tower.  We can operate out of an ebony tower, but it can only be connect--it only works if you're connected with the masses of the people and there's pain and struggles.  So, I go into Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York] regularly and I lecture to prisoners in a master's degree program in Sing Sing that was founded in the early '80s [1980s] by Bill, Reverend Bill Webber [George W. Webber], that we teach in Rikers Island [New York, New York] and that's why I have my students make that connection that--we do voter education and registration.  This October, this month we're registering in the housing projects in the old Polo Grounds [New York, New York] this Friday, it's being covered by Channel 5 Fox News [WNYW-TV, New York, New York].  We're involved with the Doe Fund in prisoner reentry.  In Introduction to African American Studies, my kids are working with prisoner, former prisoners to help with their resume writing to get jobs, so that black studies cannot simply be--sit back from an ivory tower and celebrate blackness.  It has to embrace the pain and struggle of what that's about today and that's the kind of black intellectual agenda that I push and that makes it somewhat different I would say than a few of my friends, who shall remain nameless.
Speaker 2: Well said.
Story_ID: 579905
Speaker 1: Can we talk about affirmative action--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --because it's come up recently?
Speaker 2: Affirmative action is essentially a sha- a po- an approach to, of compensatory justice, that is that the state, the government, was constructed on a racial foundation; that the first law that was passed by the U.S. Congress in 1790 was the Naturalization Act [Naturalization Act of 1790] which said you could only be a ci- become a citizen by being a free white person.  So, black people were brought here to be exploited.  We were denied fundamental constitutional and democratic rights.  We lived in a country where after the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendment, [U.S.] Constitution was just words on paper.  For us, we didn't have the right to vote in the presidential election for decades.  You had the widespread disenfran- disenfranchisement in this country then and increasingly now, because of felony disenfranchisement laws and reque- and regressive voter laws throughout the country.  So, the policy of affirmative action seeks to redress the discrimination that occurs in the job market and in other aspects of life because of racialized discrimination, and the state has an obligation to intercede and to create avenues of opportunities for those who merit, and the emphasis on merit, jobs and advancement and that's what it was designed originally to do.  It is not a legal regime.  It is--affirmative action was a series of eclectic presidential executive orders all going all the way back to 1941 with Executive Order 8802 by [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt which said that there could be no racial discrimination in hiring policies in defense plants during--just--it occurred just before War World II [WWII].  But, that was only precipitated by A. Philip Randolph and the Negro march on Washington and the protest that forced Roosevelt to capitulate and do that.  So, affirmative action was never designed, the architecture of it, to address most American workers.  It was only, only a minority of workers, roughly 25 percent or less, were ever affected by affirmative action, these legal initiatives by executive, presidential executive order.  More deeply, affirmative action, its limitation, was never designed to transfer wealth from one racial group to another.  Ron Walters [HistoryMaker Ronald Walters], my friend, great political scientist at University of Maryland, College Park [Maryland], describes affirmative action as paycheck equality; that is, it gave us access to jobs we had been denied for decades that we should have had and we had merit to.  Only gave us access to those jobs, but it did not transfer wealth from white households to black households.  So, when you look throughout the country today in 2005 the average African American household has less than one-tenth the net wealth of the average white household; that a third of all black households actually have a negative net wealth, a negative net wealth, and that's hard to do.  You owe, you owe more money than you actually have in the form of where you live, your clothes, your house, et cetera.  And so those kinds of realities put us in a hole that we can never get out of, and so some strategy of compensatory justice like affirmative action, as weak as it was and is, still must be defended, but in the limited amount of time we have since the Gratz v. Bo [Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003], and Grutter v. Bollinger [2003] decision, the bulk of affirmative action has largely been wiped out and in hundreds of schools, universities, and colleges throughout the United States in 2003 and '04 [2004] we've seen minority affairs programs being shut down and literally wiped out and tens of thousands of young black people were denied, are being denied access to higher education because of a retreat from diversity and racial justice.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So in '83 [1983] when you arrive at Colgate [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York].
Speaker 2: Well, just prior to my arrival at Colgate University in Upstate New York in Hamilton, New York, a congressman of--from Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] South Side, Harold Washington, was persuaded much against his will and better judgment to challenge the nation's most entrenched and corrupt political machine, the Cook County Democratic Organization [Cook County Democratic Party].  Much to everyone's utter amazement, including Harold's, himself, he won and became the first black mayor of Chicago, and there was a tremendous--in the mid and late 1980s, a tremendous ferment among young African Americans and, and hundreds of thousands of Latinos and young white people, a renewed sense of activism and militancy that in many ways parallel the 1960s.  Harold Washington's victory, the fact that he could register nearly 80 percent of all African Americans, adults in that city, and get to turn out 80 percent of that vote is astonishing because it showed you kind of a mass mobilization of democratic antiracist forces.  I wrote extensively about that.  I visited and spoke in Chicago during that period of time, and it was tremendously hopeful during a period of reaction and Reaganism and reaction.
Story_ID: 579907
Speaker 1: Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  He may have been loved by the vast majority of black Amer- of white Americans, but black folk despised him and for good reason.  His anti-affirmative action, his anti-civil rights, his anti-labor politics were an anathema to the black community.  And many of us in '83 [1983] as I relocated to Upstate New York [to Colgate University, Hamilton, New York], were debating what can we do to make a statement against the Reagan administration and the milquetoast, moderate response by the Democratic leadership in [U.S.] Congress to the reactionary Reagan agenda.  It occurred to many of us that we really need is a black presidential candidacy, a campaign to challenge both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.  But, the best way to devise that strat- that campaign was to run someone in the Democratic Party primaries.  But who would the candidate be?  There was intense speculation and debate.  My favorite candidate was Ron Dellums [HistoryMaker Ronald Dellums], congressman from Berkeley [California], Oakland, California.  But, through a variety of circumstances, nearly everyone who we considered refused to do it, and Dellums came under scrutiny and I'm convinced, FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] and Reagan administration assaults and attacks in '83 [1983] to get his name and to push Dellums out of that process.  The only person who could have run, who stepped forward was Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], the country preacher.  We had a lot of reservations about Jesse because he had dabbled with conservatives, he pushed forward a kind of you know, a kind of pro-corporate agenda and he was, let's, let's put it mildly, was a deep egotist (laughter) and deeply self-centered and you know what they used to say about Theodore Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.] that he wants to be the bride at every wedding and he wants to be the corpse at every funeral, well that's Jesse.  Nevertheless, when Jesse announced and really built a campaign, he proved an extraordinarily effective spokesperson for the dispossessed and those who were disadvantage, most disadvantaged.  And he reached out astutely to Latinos, to white Americans, to Asian Pacific Island Americans, and to working people and built a very powerful campaign.
Story_ID: 579908
Speaker 1: So, during that period of time, I was teaching at Colgate University [Hamilton, New York] and one of the wonderful things about being Upstate New York, away from a major city is that there is nothing to do except to write. And so in quick--in a very short period, in three years, I wrote three books.  I completed, I wrote and completed 'Black American Politics' [Manning Marable], which was published by Verso [Verso Press] in 1985, my book on Du Bois, W.E.B. Du Bois, 'Black Radical Democrat' ['W.E.B. Du Bois: Black Radical Democrat,' Manning Marable], published in 1986 and 'African and Caribbean Politics' ['African and Caribbean Politics: From Kwame Nkrumah to Maurice Bishop,' Manning Marable], again published by Verso in 1987.  All of those were the product of a very short period of time, and I loved being in Upstate New York.  It's extraordinary, although I despise the weather.  It's gray and there's snow on the ground half the year, but it was a very intense period of time for research and writing for me.
Story_ID: 579909
Speaker 1: So, because of Jesse Jackson's [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] candidacy and because you said of, of Washington [Harold Washington] in Chicago [Illinois], you were seeing somewhat of a, a renaissance and, and, and black people in the '80s [1980s] that you had not seen before.  What was happening and, and what was happening in academia to reflect what was happening with us in the real world?
Speaker 2: Oh that's easy.  Give you a very concrete example.  Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] gets elected with 61 percent of the, 60 percent of the vote.  Whites vote 2:1 in favor of Reagan.  Black vote over ninety to ten against Reagan, so blacks, once again the outliers in American democracy.  What are we to do?  Well of course as you know, Reagan loves South Africa.  That was, you know the old apartheid regime of white minority rule; he loved it.  And he had a policy called constructive engagement where the U.S. would help assist South Africa's coast guard, help businesses there, et cetera.  It occurred to a group of us led by Randall Robinson, the head of TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica] and Mary Frances Berry of the civil rights commission [U.S. Commission on Civil Rights] that perhaps a revival of nonviolent civil disobedience to disrupt the South African embassy, which is what Mary Frances and Randall did in late 1984.  That sparked, that gave way to the rise of a massive nonviolent protest movement against South Africa and the United States.  Perhaps a Free South Africa Movement, we argued was a way to get at the Reagan administration and to help free Nelson Mandela, who was then on Robben Island off of the coast of South Africa, off of Cape Town [South Africa], as well as the other sisters and brothers to be free and rule their own country. And so all--many of us got involved in this. On the campus, students began to protest against what they called the--they called for divestment, which was corporations and univers- corporations that invest in South Africa; if universities owned stocks in these corporations, they needed to pull their money out of those stocks and invest in others that were not tied to the apartheid regime.  On my campus at Colgate [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York], the students got involved.  I spoke and the students said let's go and take over the administration building, tell the administration what they want.  So, everybody looked and blamed me for paralyzing the campus for two solid weeks and for the kids taking over the administration business, but it was fun because it forced a degree, a new kind of discussion about structural racism trans-nationally, and what was the responsibility of American institutions to address our complicity in, in an illegal, immoral regime that was murdering thousands of black people every year.  What's our response?  And it put the Reagan administration on the defensive. And his position was unsustainable and a divestment, and a whole thing, a campaign for U.S. cutting the link with apartheid went through [U.S.] Congress; Reagan vetoed it; but we override that veto, and so South Africa had to change internally.  It set up an entire dynamic where internally the corporate community in South Africa by the late '80s [1980s] said we have to get rid of this minority regime crap.  We need to move toward a democratic society, and then political leadership began to reflect that and by 1994 Nelson Mandela was president of South Africa.  And so all of that showed that through principle struggle, through dedicated effort that democratic antiracist change is possible.  It was a tremendous time for thousands of young activists.  And then in '88 [1988], Jesse's second campaign generated over 7 million votes, half of which were cast by whites.  You know the Rainbow Coalition was not mano- monochromatically black the way it's sometimes portrayed.  Jesse carried states like Vermont, Alaska where there are barely, there couldn't be a thousand blacks literally, so that you know all of those kinds of changes that occurred in the mid-'80s [1980s] bringing out hund- literally thousands of new African Americans into the political process, people like Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] who now ended up in the U.S. Senate.  So, during that period of time in my writing, popular writing in newspapers and my column, Along the Color Line, and in my academic writing I was trying to document and capture the essence of those struggles and what was occurring, what was transpiring and, and trying to theorize from that and how do we sustain those, those struggles.
Story_ID: 579910
Speaker 1: So, in the mid to late '80s [1980s] you decided to leave Colgate [Colgate University, Hamilton, New York] and to go to Ohio [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Actually there was a stop in between; it was very short.  I was offered a position at Purdue University [West Lafayette, Indiana].  I accepted it and went there in the fall of '86 [1986], but within a year I was offered what I felt was an extraordinary opportunity to become the director of the largest black studies department in the United States, which was at--then at Ohio State University, Columbus.  It was also in some degree, some measure, returning home. My parents [June Morehead Marable and James Marable, Sr.] lived in Dayton, Ohio, and I was very familiar with Ohio State and the program there.  They had nineteen full-time faculty.  They had a functioning community center on the east side of Columbus, Ohio, in the African American historic black community where my [maternal] grandfather [Jack W. Morehead] had once lived.  So, it was a real challenge and that's why I went there and I learned many things in that job.  My hair went from (laughter) from black to gray in less than a year, and it aged me enormously.
Speaker 1: Because?
Speaker 2: Because in part, whenever departments in a university--and this may be true actually in business--whenever you search for someone who is outside of a structure when you already have senior faculty who were there in a department who can, who should be able to become chair and, and you skip over them and you go to the outside, you probably have a problem internally that you want solved and you have to reach on the outside to bring someone in to solve your problem.  I didn't realize that.  I was only thirty-seven.  I know that now at fifty-five, after running programs like this throughout most of my adult life now.  Ohio State had a series of problems.  They hired a number of faculty who were incompetent, who were--lacked academic substance.  William Nelson [William E. Nelson, Jr.] who had been the director of the program while a strong scholar himself, was insecure intellectually and inept administratively, and so he hired people who he knew to be incompetent, but who could easily be controlled by him administratively and that's what he did and as a result some of those people got tenured.  And you had a real difficult time because you have a very weak group of scholar, of non-scholars who are in the structure who are also like in their thirties and forties and have no place to go.  They're not gonna leave.  They're gonna stay there forever, and so you are handicapped.  I managed to bring in several strong scholars.  I recruited Abiola Irele [F. Abiola Irele], a great scholar, African scholar.  I recruited Ali Mazrui, and Melba Joyce Boyd and brought them in, but that was due to my relationship to them rather than being pulled in by the magnetism of the scholarly community that was already there.  Remaking a bad department is not easy, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you did it.
Speaker 2: I began to do it, but it, it took a toll.  It took a toll on me, and there was also one other factor that came into play that until many years later I didn't tell anyone about, and that was my chronic illness, being diagnosed in January, 1986 with sarcoidosis, sarcoid.
Story_ID: 579911
Speaker 1: Sarcoid is a chronic illness that disproportionately impacts African Americans and whites of Mediterranean descent, Italians and North Africans.  It is a, it's, it's an illness that in a way is like a reverse AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in that instead of having your white blood cells destroyed, this is an illness where they proliferate widely.  You have too many white blood cells, which is almost as bad as not having any.  When you have too many white blood cells, they begin to attack vital organs, healthy tissue, most prominently your lungs, your heart, your liver, and even at times your brain, spine.  The way it's controlled primarily until very recently was through prednisone, through a steroid, and that's worse than the illness.  Anybody who has been on prednisone can tell you.  And there were times I was on prednisone for nearly a decade, for nine years, and at times up to fifty milligrams a day for months at a time, but generally usually about twenty milligrams.  It is very hard to be on prednisone for a month, but when you're on it for nine years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nine years.
Speaker 1: --and I survived. That was very, very hard. And so that's what made the, the job at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] in part so difficult because I had this private battle with my health.
Speaker 2: All that you were having to keep to yourself.
Speaker 1: That I kept to myself; that no one knew about except my wife [Leith Mullings], that I had to deal with at the same time as dealing with a very daunting administrative issue.
Story_ID: 579912
Speaker 1: Something big happens in the world in '89 [1989] and you also changed jobs.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I wanna just throw in that the, the re- reunification of Germany.
Speaker 2: That happened.
Speaker 1: That happens.  You also left Ohio [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And you go to-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to Colorado, and there's a funny story about that.  Gordan Gee [E. Gordon Gee], who was the president of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] in 1989 left, and he became president of Ohio State.  I left Ohio State and I moved for a prominent professorship at the University of Colorado, and the people in Colorado said they got the better of the deal (laughter), and after about a year of Gordan Gee, people at Ohio State said we got the worst of the deal.  The people in Boulder [Colorado] offered me a position of, of professor of ethnic studies and history and political science, and it was an opportunity for me in a way to kind of focus on my own writing and sort out where I wanted to go intellectually.  I didn't think that Boulder would be a place I would stay for more than five years, and I ended up leaving after four, but while I, while I was there I had a wonderful time.  I, I loved the environment, the Rockies [Rocky Mountains] are just extraordinarily beautiful.
Story_ID: 579913
Speaker 1: But nationwide it was a time of great challenge for African Americans.  In 1989, for reasons Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] only knows himself, Jesse pulled the plug on the Rainbow Coalition by dismantling the independent structure of his own organization.  There had been tens of thousands of people who had galvanized behind the rainbow and wanted to build a mass organization similar to the Moral Majority of Jerry Falwell or the Christian Coalition of the 1990s, an independent structure that could play a role in the Democratic Party, but could mobilize people outside of it, that blacks would control, but would be in coalition with whites and Latinos and Asians, that would be anchored around working class issues that could run people for independent office.  But, to make it real you have to have elected leadership at the state and local level.  Jesse insisted that he would hand pick local leaders, not that they would be, there would be no democratic election of them.  Well, when you do that you turn people off, because why should they invest time and energy into something that doesn't actually reflect the democratic opinion or the choices locally and, and statewide.
Speaker 2: Or in the democratic process.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  It restricts democracy, and so many of us felt--activists, intellectuals who were part of that process, felt Jesse was either deliberately trying to dismantle this organization or he had made simply a fatal ego-driven mistake that if he didn't determine personally who the local leaders were, then you know he wasn't gonna work with them.  But, for whatever reason the rainbow collapsed as, as a mass organization.  It still exists, but in, it's, it's a weak shell of its former self.  Black leadership was in crisis in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  This was the tail end of the period where Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was running the NAACP frankly into the ground, into debt, into disillusion. Young people disconnected from the organization.  It was--it wasn't really speaking to them.
Story_ID: 579914
Speaker 1: I just want--I wanna know from you why did young people disconnect from the organization [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)] at that time?  Why, why were we disconnected?
Speaker 2: Because in part in the '80s [1980s] you had the emergence of hip hop.  You have a very different kind of culture among young African Americans and young Latinos where their frame of reference and how they understood their own lives is informed by a deep urban crisis.  If you listen to Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's message where there is a graphic description of the poverty, the pain, the violence of life in the central city and you compare "Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge, I'm trying not to lose my head" ['The Message'] with 'How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America' ['How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society,' Manning Marable], my analytic description of the political economy of racism in class and equality in the crisis of the cities, it is exactly what Grandmaster Flash was speaking about; that Afrika Bambaataa, that old school hip hop is really talking a new kind of sensibility; Kool Herc [DJ Kool Herc] and others; that black petit bourgeoisie, older Negro leadership was just out of touch with what was going down in our, in our cities.  They were out of touch with the urban crisis and, and where young people, where their sensibilities were.  They took advantage and supported the anti-apartheid movement, but really did not understand that that youth rebellion that was occurring, driving that on the campuses had to express itself independently of mainstream traditional black leadership; and I, I really think that there, there grew a real chasm, just a disconnect that has never fully been healed between traditional groups like the NAACP and the hip hop generation, the generation that emerged after the boomers [baby boomers], which is my generation really, those people born between 1946 to 1964.  People born after, from '65 [1965] to roughly 1980, that generation came into political maturity--the young--the older people in that cohort in the mid and late '80s [1980s], and they did not feel that traditional black middle class leadership was listening to them. And so by the early '90s [1990s] you get the, the emergence like somebody like a Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], who, whatever you wanna say about him, did understand the relationship between politics and culture and spoke to it effectively.  And so he reached out to the Five Percenters, right, and began to express--as well as other elements within the hip hop community--and began to incorporate an outreach to hip hop that the NAACP and the Urban League [National Urban League] simply didn't do.  When by '94 [1994], the NAACP nearly self-destructed around the debate around Benjamin Chavis [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.], Farrakhan steps in and says let's call for a Million Man March to mobilize as black men to be responsible to their families, their wives, their children.  It mobilizes the African American community, it calls for black-owned businesses, it calls for us to atone.  Because of the relative absence, the vacuum of black leadership, a million people turned out.  So, whatever you wanna say about the minister and I have written very critical things about Farrakhan through--over the last twenty-five years.  If you read 'Black Leadership' [Manning Marable], you read, there is a staunch and harsh critique of his anti-Semitism, the homophobia, the misogynistic aspects deeply rooted within the Nation of Islam and that whole perspective of what I call black fundamentalism.  Yet, at the same time, you have to recognize that the call for the march captured the imagination of millions of black people and that people were searching for a way of building black unity and to assert pride and self-respect within that community.  So, I think that this was an interesting period to live through, and it's a real tragedy that unfortunately the Nation of Islam was not prepared to build upon the very success of the thing that they started.

Speaker 1: In '89 [1989] you were saying that Mr. Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was running NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] into the ground (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --it was looking for new leadership.
Speaker 2: And that's why I was hopeful that there would be a leadership forthcoming from Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and the Rainbow Coalition, but there was a failure Jesse destroyed his own organization.  And if you read some of the pieces I wrote at the time I said there's a changing of the guard.  We need a new kind of leadership and it is not forthcoming.  Now, the hip hop generation was interesting.  They had to reach back.  In '90 [1990], '91 [1991], '92 [1992], there was renaissance of Malcolm [Malcolm X]--there was Malcolm mania.  You'd get Malcolm's image in hip hop and, you know, all of that.
Speaker 1: The Spike Lee movie ['Malcolm X'].
Speaker 2: With the Spike Lee movie.
Speaker 1: We, we started to read the book ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley] again.
Speaker 2: Public Enemy, N.W.A. [Niggaz Wit Attitudes], a variety of then, new school hip hop, but the golden age of hip hop during that period of time from roughly--the golden age was roughly '87 [1987] to about '93 [1993], '94 [1994], really saw Malcolm--Malcolm was really the cultural symbol of it, and they had to reach back in time because no one was effectively articulating their rage with the urban crisis, the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic that was devastating the lives of millions of black and Latino young people all over this country and our leadership was not effectively speaking to it.  In fact, there was a deep denial.  There's a wonderful book ['The Boundaries of Blackness: AIDS and the Breakdown of Black Politics'] by Cathy Cohen on the black community's response or lack thereof to the crack, to the crisis of AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  There was just deep denial by most black leadership and media about the devastation of AIDS.  Nobody wanted to speak to it.  Black churches put their head in the sand.  So, we needed a new, more aggressive, effective black leadership to speak to the hip hop community and we just, and there was just a failure of vision and leadership and that had to be spoken to, I think.
Story_ID: 579916
Speaker 1: So much of what the tragedy of black America in terms of the growth of structural poverty and the millions of black people who have, whose lives have been destroyed by the prison industrial complex really goes back to events of the mid-1980s with the emergence and the invention of crack cocaine.  The crack epidemic actually begins in Harlem [New York, New York] and in South Bronx [Bronx, New York] in the mid-1980s, and actually a pretty good film on this is 'New Jack City' with Wesley Snipes, that crack began to proliferate in the mid and late '80s [1980s] across the United States, and it impacted black working class and low income black and brown neighborhoods in central cities first.  It was a highly addictive form of cocaine, so much so that it just destroyed people's lives.  I can barely think in my own personal life, of any black family, either, not just the nuclear family, but either-- if not in your own household then a cousin, a nephew, a niece, someone you knew and who you were related to genetically, biologically, that whose life was destroyed by it, by crack.  You know, you're talking about, you know, literally hundreds of thousands of people.  The crack epidemic also created the context for the rise of urban street gangs and those gangs that preexisted crack's rise like the Crips and the Bloods, they became monsters because of it.  You had markets, urban markets that were highly lucrative.  You began seeing gunshots proliferate within the African American community in the 1980s and early and mid-1990s.  'Boyz n the Hood' is a fine film on this and the soliloquy given by Tre's father [Furious Styles] is quite appropriate and very true, that African Americans don't have the ships and the planes to, to fly to Colombia and Venz [Venezuela], to bring in the crack co- to bring in the cocaine.  We don't have structures to finance and market it.  There's a whole bevy, whole group of banks that were marginal and barely existed in the '80s [1980s] who now if you walk around New York [New York], you see them.  I won't give their names, but, you know, these were money laundering institutions basically for international cartels--that the whole political economy of it.  None of that brought money into the African American community.  It was only used to destroy it.  Now the state responded to the growth--by 1989, it's a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year, the illegal narcotics traffic estimated that year.
Story_ID: 579917
Speaker 1: So, what does, what does the government do?  Well, their response is very simple.  Nancy Reagan just said, said just say no, just say no, right.  Perhaps that works with some middle class people I suppose, but was it wasn't an effective response.  Public health response was to quarantine the black community, not to combat illegal drugs in the black community, but to keep it out of the white suburbs, and so don't really have an effective response in terms of public health community. And that certainly was true in Harlem [New York, New York], it was true in hundreds of black communities all over this country.  And so our children were dying and what do you do?  Well, let's build more prisons.  In New York State from 1817, when I believe Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York] was bui- constructed to 1981, you had the construction of thirty-three state prisons.  From 1981 to 2001 you had thirty-eight state prisons built here.  More in twenty years than in the previous two centuries.  In California, you had a similar dynamic. In '79 [1979] before the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic, you had about 20,000 people in California prisons and jails.  By 2000, you had 160,000 prisoners, an extraordinary eight times the number in only two decades.  A lot of that was crack and the violence that it engendered, but a lot of that was--most of that was how the government responded through what, mandatory minimums, so that in New York State if you were found--the Rockefeller Drug Laws were passed.  If you were found guilty of possession of four ounces of crack or you sold two ounces or more of crack, you got fifteen years to life for the first conviction, fifteen years to life for the first conviction. And of course the feds said there's a difference between powdered cocaine and crack cocaine.  And according to the federal government's anti-drug laws, that if you were found guilty of powdered cocaine possession versus crack, the penalty was a hundred times more severe for crack than it was for powdered cocaine.  Why is this, because whites tended to use powdered cocaine, not crack, and blacks and Latinos tended to use the hard crack substance cocaine and so the penalty becomes significantly worse.  So what happens? Well, in 1983--and you can see I know this by heart because of the work I've done around criminal justice over the last decade--there were 600,000 people in prison, when I wrote 'How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America' ['How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society,' Manning Marable].  By the year 1990, there were one million Americans in prison, half black.  By the year 2001, two million Americans in prison, about 45 percent black.  Who's imprisoned in this country today? You're talking about counting the people who are on probation, parole, and awaiting trial, you're talking five to six million people a year at any given moment are either in prison, probation, parole, or awaiting trial.  You have one in every six Americans who now has a criminal record.  You have millions of Americans who have lost the right to vote for life or temporarily because they have a felony conviction.  Eight hundred thousand people in Florida in the 2000 election, disproportionately of course black, weren't able to vote, even though they're citizens and they pay taxes, because of a felony conviction.  We have seen the destruction of democracy take place because of the prison industrial complex and now the privatization of prisons, corporations running prisons all over this country means the destruction of our civil and human rights inside of these, inside of these jails.  So, it is a very different American now than it was twenty-five years ago, and all of that has transpired all around us and neither Democrats or the Republicans in [U.S.] Congress have done nothing to stop it.
Story_ID: 579918
Speaker 1: In that timeline, the late '80s [1980s], '90 [1990], '91 [1991]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is when you write 'Race, Reform, and Rebellion' ['Race Reform and Rebellion:  The Second Reconstruction in Black America, 1945-1982,' Manning Marable].
Speaker 2: That's right.  Well no, I actually had written that book in eighty--I wrote it at Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '82 [1982], '83 [1983]; '82 [1982], '83 [1983] I wrote the book--actually believe it or not I wrote it in about six weeks.  I was very precocious.  It was in the summer just before I started teaching at Fisk; I wrote that book, and we revised it in '91 [1991] and this, this year in 2006 coming up, I'll revise it again and it will come out in 2007, the third edition.
Speaker 1: Was that a response to Nancy Reagan's just say no (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think, I don't think so.  But, I think that I was really--in the early '90s [1990s], two things were happening to me.  One, my first marriage was coming apart, and I think that like a lot of people, men and women, who are in their early forties, it's a period of kind of reassessing life 'cause half your life is over, and you begin to think about well what do you really want to do. And part of it was a sense of frustration.  I had in my head an idea of what African American studies ought to look like, but I never really had affo- had been afforded the opportunity to build my own shop from the ground up and I was looking to see if that was possible because of-- what I had in mind was a revival of Du Bois' [W.E.B. Du Bois] Atlanta ins- university institutes [Atlanta University studies].  Du Bois between 1897 to about 1910 every summer did an Atlanta University institute bringing together the best scholars from all over the world to discuss a single issue and to dissect it and to produce works that emanating out of those conferences.  And you go to the library today those books are still there.  That's the foundation of black studies.  Could I replicate that?  Could I build a shop of scholarship grounded in the best intellectual tradition of our people, but that addressed also real issues that were impacting our community. A link between theory and practice, the way Dr. Du Bois envisioned activist scholarship be.
Story_ID: 579919
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to do, and I couldn't do it in Colorado [at University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] even though I was personally happy there and very comfortable.  I used to say that I had the best study in America because when we purchased this house the, we built a study for me on top of the garage on the second story of the house with a glass wall on the western exposure facing the front face of the Rockies [Rocky Mountains] and it was magnificent.  You'd go in and just be in awe of how beautiful it was, especially when the sun descended behind the Rockies and you finally learned what the meaning of purple mountain majesty is.  It's incredible when you see it and you never get tired of it.  It's extraordinarily beautiful.  But, I gave up the best study in America when in 1992 I was approached by two universities, City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] to take Leonard Jeffries' job, which I turned down in about a microsecond.  Len Jeffries was the head of black studies, and he was under fire for some statements which many felt were anti-Semitic and quite controversial.  I had learned at Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], it's not a good idea to go into a situation where there's a problem already.  My proposal to City University [City University of New York, New York, New York] was to be based at the Graduate Center rather than at City College and to try to orchestrate black studies system wide, and there was some resistance to that at first, but my conversation continued.  Then I was approached secondly by Eric Foner, prominent professor at Columbia University [New York, New York], to become a candidate for the directorship of what would be a new--what would be African American studies.  Columbia University has been around since 1754.  It was founded as King's College of the colonies, the American colonies by George the II and since that time, and since the late 1890s it has been located between 100th and 120th Street in Upper Manhattan [New York, New York].  Now, we're about eight minutes as we are taping this, from the Apollo Theater [New York, New York].  You can walk there in about eight minutes. Now the way I judge it, we're in Harlem [New York, New York], we're at 119th and Amsterdam Avenue.  The Apollo is right down the hill at 125th.  Yet Columbia is a school that is in institutional denial as to where it is.  They have a fictive history calling this little hill we're on, Morningside Heights [New York, New York].  Langston Hughes wrote poetry about it, about the school of the heights and us far below, right. Well, you know we're in Harlem and yet this school had never developed a black studies department, had no African American studies institute, did not have programming that dealt with black culture and heritage and history and we're adjacent to the most famous black community on earth.  The search was held for a new direct--for a director.  They did not have a program, and I received the offer. And I said--I was given three faculty slots.  I could hire, bring in three more people.  I said four more--I said let's cash in one of those jobs, give me so programming money.  I wanna start an institute for research in African American studies.  We will create core faculty, and we will do programming that links the university with the community.  And the very first thing I insisted upon is that we have conferences that addressed real issues that impacted black people's daily lives.  In short, the Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] intellectual agenda for the late 20th century, in the 21st century, and that's why I took the job, to create something different in the field.
Story_ID: 579920
Speaker 1: And so at age forty-two, my life changed.  It changed fundamentally because I was not a person--I'd grown up in the Midwest.  I had never lived in a major city.  Columbus [Ohio] is not a major city.  It may be major to the folk in Ohio and the state capitol, but it's not a major city; New York [New York] is.  And to make that transition from Boulder [Colorado] was a major personal transition.  I was going through a divorce that was very painful and very difficult unfortunately.  I was also battling my health because the sarcoidosis flared up and became much, much worse.
Speaker 2: Because of the stress?
Speaker 1: Perhaps.
Speaker 2: Perhaps.
Speaker 1: By '94 [1994], I had lost about a third of my lung capacity, and I was on fifty milligrams of prednisone a day.  The--and so there were real challenges.  On the positive side, my life took a very interesting turn, one that was entirely unexpected.  My own feeling was that I was coming here to work, and that romance and love were something that was a part of my life years ago, but that was it, that was over with.  I was here to build something new and different, or at least if I could I was going to try to.  On the 1st of February 1993 when I was still involved in negotiations, Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] had offered me this job; City University [City University of New York, New York, New York] came back to me belatedly and said okay we could agree to your terms, will you do this job talk.  I came and I did, and I met a faculty member, a sister who was at the Graduate Center, named Leith Mullings.  She's an anthropologist.  I'd read some of her work.  We'd never met. And she was at the reception with the president and then she said you know she was essentially assigned to convince me to come to City University and to turn down the Columbia offer and to see you know what kinds of terms I would accept with City.  Make a long story short, I didn't take the job at City, but three years later we got married, and the job interview turned into a marriage, which was interesting.  Leith is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is Leith still an anthropologist?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, oh yes, Leith is the most extraordinary person I have ever met in my life without any reservation.  She is an extraordinary gem.  She is the light of my life.  Leith is--she's a sister who was born in Jamaica. Parents were, came to this country when she was about three.  Her father had been born in the United States, and their entire family, without getting into the kinds of stereotypes of, of West Indian households, about how everybody holds eighteen different jobs and everybody is very proficient and successful. Well look at this family.  Her sister is on the New York supreme court [Supreme Court of the State of New York], is a judge, so she's a supreme.  The other two sisters are lawyers.  One's a law- one's a professor.  The other one is like a city commissioner.  Her brother is the CFO or the CEO at a major hospital in Phoenix [Arizona], and the my wife is the presidential professor of anthropology at City, at the graduate school of City University, all in the same family.
Speaker 2: And that's just the type of family you needed (laughter).
Speaker 1: All in the same family.  My wife is--spent about two and a half years doing field research in Ghana, wrote a brilliant book on traditional healing in Ghana ['Therapy, Ideology and Social Change: Mental Healing in Urban Ghana,' Leith Mullings].  Passionately committed to social justice; social justice and civil rights activist all her life.  Strong feminist; has written on her own terms, feminist, anthropology, anthropological work; has written different kinds of books; led a Centers for Disease Control [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] research project studying black women's health issues in central Harlem [New York, New York] lasting for five years that produced a co-authored work, stress and resilience on black--why is it that despite, that black women's babies lower birth weight babies, explained wha- what it is, explains black women's high rates of mortality during pregnancies, et cetera, during birth and--the kind of work she does is extraordinary.
Story_ID: 579921
Speaker 1: She [Marable's wife, Leith Mullings] and I began a dialogue.  We began to date, and she took an interest I think in me in keeping [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable around because she said my people need you then because I was perhaps husband material, I don't know. And it was Leith who found a way to get me off of prednisone and, and so we've, in '95 [1995] I transferred over to a drug called chloroquine, and its brand name is Aralen, which is an anti-malarial, it's what you take before you go to Africa, you know an anti-malarial you know so you don't get malaria when you're there.  So, that controlled the sarcoid.  Now, it has a bad side effect.  If you're on it a long time, it can mess up your eyes, so there's another phase of the story, which I'll get to in a couple of minutes, right.  But, I was no longer on the prednisone and that's the good story.
Story_ID: 579922
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, I'm building and starting this new institute [Institute for Research in African-American Studies, Columbia University, New York, New York] during the environment of the Million Man March.
Speaker 2: What year is this exactly?
Speaker 1: This is like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ninety--
Speaker 1: --ninety-four [1994]--
Speaker 2: Ninety-four [1994], '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: --ninety-five [1995], '96 [1996], in the mid-'90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: In the mid--okay, so around the time of 'Beyond Black and White' ['Beyond Black and White: Rethinking Race in American Politics and Society,' Manning Marable].
Speaker 1: That's right and 'Beyond Black and White' was, I used to say, was my favorite book because I wrote 'Beyond Black and White' at a time when I thought that it would probably be my last book.  I thought I was gonna die, and we were really in a battle for my life, and it was really Leith [Marable's wife, Leith Mullings] who helped turn it around.  It was kind of touch and go, but--so I'm here so you know she must be good for me.  So, I wrote about 'Beyond Black and White,' and a lot of people--it was the first book I wrote that had--well that's not true, the book I wrote 'How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America' ['How Capitalism Underdeveloped Black America: Problems in Race, Political Economy, and Society,' Manning Marable] became kind of like a cult, not a cult classic, but like there's, there's a huge corps of folk who to this day read, stop me on the street; not a week goes by that somebody doesn't tell me how this book changed their lives.  People loved it or hated it, and were very intense about it, and so there was this huge constituency.  Prisoners like loved this book and activists on the street loved the book and all of that.  'Beyond Black and White' was the first book I wrote that actually had a mainstream, I kind of like reached a larger, it was like kind of my version of Ray, Ray Charles' 'I Can't Stop Loving You' where you move from gospel and R and B to something like the mainstream, you know, Denzel [Denzel Washington].  I don't know what the equivalent would, would have been for Denzel, but for me it was 'Beyond Black and White' that a lot of white people read.  And maybe it was the title, maybe it was the way that I framed the issue, but I began to be very conscious of writing.  What really generated this was a conversation I had with the great West Indian intellectual C.L.R. James in the late '80s [1980s] just before he died.  It was in London [England] in James' apartment in Brixton [London, England].  And I asked him is there anything in your life that you regret.  He said sure, one thing, I wish I had written my--I'd done my writing in a way that was more, especially early writing, before I was like fifty years old, that was more accessible to a larger audience.  I wish I had crafted my language that was not so politically framed in obscurant ways for a specific kind of narrow political group, but rather a language that was accessible to a larger number of people, and I, I really--that had a big impact on me and even though I wrote for masses of folk, the column [From the Grassroots] was read by millions of people every month in hundreds of black newspapers all over the United States, so it's not like I wasn't reaching large numbers of people, but the kind of academic writing I did was still framed too narrowly.
Story_ID: 579923
Speaker 1: And 'Beyond Black and White' ['Beyond Black and White: Rethinking Race in American Politics and Society,' Manning Marable] reached a large segment of new people and I saw this especially with white liberals in the faith-based community that I began to do workshops for United church--for the General Board of Missions [General Board of Global Ministries] for, for the United Methodist church, the Episcopal church, liberal and more moderate event organizations, being invited to speak to Asian American groups that I never really made contact with.  And in Colorado I began, prior to even coming here [New York, New York], reaching out to Latinos in California and so that here that kind of natural connection continued and expanded, and so whole new audiences became familiar with my work.  And so if you look at say 'Black Leadership' [Manning Marable], which was written in the late, in the mid to late '90s [1990s] and published first by Columbia [Columbia University Press, New York, New York] in '98 [1998] and then by Penguin [Penguin Books] in '99 [1999], you see that there's a shift in publishers so that I'm going from say South End [South End Press] or you know Verso [Verso Press], which is a Marxist press, kind of a socialist press to Penguin and by the beginning of the 20th, 21st century, Basic Books, right, so that you can work into a Barnes and Nobles and find things I've written over the last ten years.  There's a real change by the late--by '95 [1995]--with 'Beyond Black and White' I then actually began to be on national television and do a lot of national media.
Speaker 2: NBC, ABC, CBS.
Speaker 1: Doing dozens of these things every year and doing say like on C-SPAN their morning program with Brian Lamb.  By the late '90s [1990s], I was on like two to three times a year.  'Charlie Rose' I was on with 'Beyond Black and White', and now I'm on every--about once a year.  None of that existed prior to that, and all of that opened up with 'Beyond Black and White.'
Story_ID: 579924
Speaker 1: Sometimes in life timing is everything.  I'm flying to London [England] and it's the end of April, 1992 and when I arrive, I learn at the airport that an urban rebellion has erupted in Los Angeles [California] on the wake of a response by this jury of not guilty to four cops who had beaten Rodney King, and so the L.A. riots [Los Angeles, California] that occur in April, May of 1992 just--this urban conflagration were a product in L.A.'s terms, of a political economy of racist injustice from police brutality, to high rates of unemployment, horrific schools, of urban poverty that was not substantively being addressed.  What was significant about that urban uprising, one of the things was that actually a majority of the people arrested in the uprising were not black.  They were Latinos.  They were Mexican Americans.  They were Mexicans who had just, who were recent immigrants.  They were Guatemalans.  They were El Salvadorians and African Americans, okay.  So, it was not black, it was people of color who had experienced discrimination and police brutality, and they sought to fight back.  So, I arrive and willy-nilly I'm the interpreter and interlocutor on the BBC [British Broadcasting Corporation] and on ITV and on, you know Independent TV, for what is going on in the United States.
Speaker 2: How could you explain what they were seeing on TV?
Speaker 1: I explained it by talking about institutional racism, and the kind of prison industrial complex that existed and the failure of the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] administrations to substantially address what was occurring; the, the destruction of our central cities during the crack epidemic and mandatory minimum sentencing did not effectively speak to the, the poverty and the unemployment and the inequality experienced by mar- marginalized minorities and that's what I said to the British public.  It's ironic, and I started with that because almost like three years later I'm back in the UK [United Kingdom] and I arrive during the Mill- just before the Million Man March and so I end up doing the same kind of thing, explaining to people what is occurring, you know what exactly is the nature of things.
Speaker 2: And, and, that's interesting because that, those are two events that are on the opposite end of the spectrum.  I mean, we were empowering ourselves during the Million Man March.
Speaker 1: Or at least that was, that was what the hope was.
Speaker 2: The perception--.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Or that was--okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes that was the hope.  So, in '92 [1992] there is this uprising and I mention it also because it also spurred me, I just said hey you know as much as I love being in Colorado [at the University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] it was like being on a four-year sabbatical.  You have to be ba- you have be in the thick of it, and I had to find a way to build something new, but to be based in a major city and that's when these two things came up and that's why I decided to go [to Columbia University, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 579925
Speaker 1: You wrote a lot of books in the '90s [1990s], 'Black Leadership' [Manning Marable]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'Black Liberation in Conservative America' [Manning Marable], 'Speaking Truth to Black Power' ['Speaking Truth to Power: Essays on Race, Resistance, and Radicalism,' Manning Marable].
Speaker 2: Yes, actually as I think back on it yes I did, but I did and I didn't.  There's a difference between writing a book that is part of a sustained intellectual research project versus writing a collection of essays that are different topics, but around the same, but around a general theme and the latter is possible when you're an administrator.  The former is almost impossible because you do not have sustained space and time to do serious research projects when you're trying to build an institute or department or a school.  I was from '93 [1993] to '03 [2003] the director of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies [IRAAS].  My job didn't stop when I left Columbia University [New York, New York].  I lived my job.  My job was 24/7.  I had, I was--since Columbia did not have what it does now, a vice president for diversity, I was the de facto, kind of vice president for the diversity without portfolio.  I was the person people contacted.  When we opened up shop before I had a secretary, sisters and brothers would come up from 125th Street here to 119th [Street] go into the office and look for Marable [HistoryMaker Manning Marable], you know.  My co- I started writing.  Some of the stuff got picked up in the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].  My critique of Dinkins' [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] failure to win reelection, why Dinkins lost, so it sparked serious debate in the Harlem [New York, New York] community, which was good.  I was on news, what news--Channel 1 [NY1, New York, New York], which had just started in New York City [New York, New York], an all-news channel and frequently in the mid and late '90s [1990s] I was on News 1 all the time, you know on Dominic's [Dominic Carter] show.
Speaker 1: Dominic, I love Dominic, he's fantastic.
Speaker 2: He is fantastic (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let--
Story_ID: 579926
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let me ask you, so in the late '90s [1990s] when, when an athlete like Tiger Woods becomes the first African American to win the Masters [Masters Golf Tournament, Augusta, Georgia] title does that say we are moving in the direction?  What does that say?
Speaker 2: I would call that symbolic representation; that is that black people have historically been so removed from power, that any crumbs, any symbolic empowerment of, of even one black person is taken as a moral victory for us all.  So when someone who looks like us has a successful event or a product or a victory, then we are all symbolically empowered.  That's what I mean by symbolic representation.  But, the problem with symbolic representation is that it only works if there is a sense of shared or linked fate between that representative and the masses of people.  And what happened in the 1990s is the class polarization and stratification of the African American community that by the, by the middle of the '90s [1990s] what you see clearly is not one black America, but really three, and I talked about this previously.  A black professional managerial middle class that is growing and doing remarkably well.  A black working class that is steadily losing ground, the destruction of unions, gentrification of central cities, the destruction of pensions and healthcare benefits, et cetera, the criminal justice system ensnaring your children, black one class families, and then the black so called underclass, the truly disadvantaged in Bill Wilson, William Julius Wilson's phrase, that are experiencing a holocaust, just being wiped out by crack [crack cocaine], by prisons, by crime, drug addiction, all of those things.  Those black Americans are increasingly delinked.  They're delinked by geography.
Speaker 1: From one another?
Speaker 2: From one another.  As hundreds of thousands of blacks who are stable working class families or black middle class people in the cities, cities like Detroit [Michigan] and Washington, D.C. simply leave the city.  So, there are more black people who live in the suburbs of D.C. as you know this, in P.G. County [Prince George's County, Maryland], than there are in D.C. right.  This is new.  This is, this was not the way it was in the '60s [1960s].  It is now.
Speaker 1: It's called Chocolate City.
Speaker 2: That's right, it is now, and so you're going to live to see within about twenty something years the racial, the, the black denomination of the population of D.C. shift--
Speaker 1: But it seems--
Speaker 2: --and you're gonna see a majority white city within say about thirty years.
Story_ID: 579927
Speaker 1: But it seems that although we have these three different distinct groups of African Americans that we all still share the same ideology no matter--it seem--or, or there's some common thread like you're still black no matter--in that broader world no matter how high you climb.
Speaker 2: That's changing.  You have to remember that race is, is simultaneous, racism, race, a sense of race, race categories are imposed from without, but also constructed from within; that is, race has a construct, as a concept was invented not by black people.  It was imposed on us.  Nowhere in Africa were there any people prior to the transatlantic slave trade did anybody call themselves black, nobody.  They were African people.  They were, they had their own languages, their own religions, but blackness only makes sense in relationship to something else.  That something else is called white.  See what I mean?  If everybody is black, and nobody calls themselves black, it has no meaning.  Blackness is an adjective.  It's not a known, right.  It was a descriptor of inequality, Negroes, right, people who are unlike ourselves.  So, whiteness is an invention too.  There weren't white people before about 1600.  Whiteness is invented.  It's a, it is a racial category which means that you're privileged, and if you're black you're not, right.  It's like instead of saying like I'm okay, you're okay, I'm okay, you're still black, which means you're the one who is stigmatized, you're the one who is not gonna own property, you're the one who is not gonna vote, and you're the one who is going to suffer the indignities of daily life every day, and I describe that process actually at the beginning of a book I did that I'm very proud of called 'The Great Wells of Democracy:  The Meaning Of Race In American Life' [Manning Marable], but I'm getting ahead of my story.  By the '90s [1990s], these divergences grew so much that a common racial ideology in response to white authority and white power became increasingly difficult to construct, and you had the emergence not just of black neoconservatives, but a kind of black professional managerial elite that increasingly had conservative values and material interests that were at odds with the masses of black people.  So, a Condi Rice [Condoleezza Rice] and a Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell] and those black Republicans who were seen as really odd characters, maybe thirty years ago or whatever are not, they are no, no longer outliers.  They represent a significant share of black middle class that favor physical conservatism.  They don't want to see their tax money going to support low income people who are in favor of, who are against the interest of trade unions, who, you know, et cetera, all the kind of traditional things that black people have fought for or against 'cause it's in their class interest.  So, a racial ideology in and of itself it doesn't recognize class divergences.  The class divergences are real, so it raises some interesting questions about what is the future of African American politics, which we can get into.
Story_ID: 579928
Speaker 1: I'm writing about all these kinds of things that are occurring, and in the Million Man March my criticism of the march was really twofold, that, well clearly because of the exclusion of women and the misogynistic and homophobic statements of many of the organizers.  I had deep criticisms of all that.  But, the second thing is, is that I felt that it was important for the progressive voice, the radical black perspective to reemerge, to help shape the discourse, the discussion, and how do we help that along.  Well, a group of people who I'd worked with for many years and some people who I'd known for a while began to have conversations in '96 [1996] and '97 [1997], '96 [1996], Bill Fletcher [HistoryMaker William Gerald Fletcher, Jr.] who's now the head of TransAfrica [TransAfrica Forum; TransAfrica], [HistoryMaker] Barbara Ransby who was a prominent historian, the author of a wonderful, just elegant biography of Ella Baker ['Ella Baker and the Black Freedom Movement: A Radical Democratic Vision,' Barbara Ransby], civil rights leader, Leith Mullings, and other people, began to call for--create, a process we call the Black Radical Congress, BRC.  And the idea of the BRC is a network of black activists, feminists, gays, and lesbians, Marxists, revolutionary nationalists, activists of all types, peace activists who could work together to build resistance to the kinds of economic destruction of the central cities, to fight for full employment, healthcare, and against the prison industrial complex, against mandatory and minimum sentences, Rockefeller Drug Laws, things like that, and privatizations that were being debated and occurring in our community.  So, we organized a conference in the summer of '97 [1997] at University of Illinois Chicago [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], and much to our amazement over 2,000 black people showed up.  It was a tremendous thing.  I was kind of forced to be the finance officer of this, so I wrote grants and things and we generated about $100,000 that help to fund this thing.  Then, in the next several years, I chaired, I guess for five years, the Black Radical Congress chapter, United New York here in Harlem [New York, New York] until I believe until '93 [sic. 2003].  So, for five years I chaired the local.  We were very involved in police brutality issues.  I marched and my wife [Leith Mullings] got arrested in the Amadou Diallo mobilization, in the civil disobedience and the nonviolent direct action campaign we launched against the NYPD [New York Police Department], the Street Crimes Unit was murdering our kids.  We became involved in the fight against privatization when Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani] wanted to sell off public schools to the Edison Project, and we mobilized people against that in knocking on doors and phoning, just hundreds of parents to fight against that and help defeat that.  So, I'm very proud of the work we did.
Story_ID: 579929
Speaker 1: Also in the '90s [1990s] we saw Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] come into office.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Did we benefit from that as African Americans?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: He has his office in Harlem [New York, New York], which is right here, he shares the neighborhood with you.
Speaker 2: Yes, he's just right around the corner.  Well, as I said yes and no.  Bill certainly was an advance over Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] and Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], and there were many things that Bill sought and that his administration represented that were real positives for the African American community.  I think that it was very commendable after his reelection in '96 [1996], that he sought to initiate a new conversation about race, but I am much more critical of the Clinton administration than most black intellectuals are.  I'm critical for a number of reasons: one, you could start with criminal justice.  Under his watch, 700,000 additional prisoners were added to federal and state prisons.  It was his administration that passed the 1995 crime bill [sic. Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994] that helped to generate hundreds of thousands more black people in prison, incarcerated, ruining thousands of, tens, hundreds of thousands of black people's lives.  It was Clinton that passed the welfare act [Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996] and dismantled welfare.  Now I know there are big debates about this.  You've seen a precipitous decline in the number of African American, African American households on what was AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] now TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families].  On the other hand, you've also seen you know the growth in real numbers of people who are below the poverty line who don't have the kind of substantive support that should be provided in terms of education, housing, healthcare, and it shortens people's lives, it ruins families.  All of that was ushered in by Clinton.  Despite that smile and the biting of the lower lip, despite his African American, his, his awareness of African American culture and rhythm, he, he had all of that down pat, but I think that our treatment and our relationship to Clinton was really misplaced.  I think a lot of people supported Clinton because during the mid and late '90s [1990s] you had an economic boom and, and that for millions of black households there was an upturn and so it coincided with Clinton being in the White House.  Clinton took credit and benefitted for that.  Things changed after 2000, right, in a big way with Bush [President George Walker Bush], Bush coming into power, but during the period of the '90s [1990s] I, I have a lot of criticisms of the Clinton administration.  His, his, his lack of courage and support of African American women he nominated for positions.  You can start with [HistoryMaker] Lani Guinier and then he pulled the plug on her for being the head of civil rights [Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice]; or Joycelyn Elders--
Speaker 1: Elders yeah.
Speaker 2: --who he knew from Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Who's fantastic, yeah.
Speaker 2: Who's fantastic and he refused to fight for her.  Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] who had, whose name had been floated to be a secretary, to be a member of the Clinton administration, secretary of education and he backed off her because she was supposedly too progressive.  You know Clinton was gutless, and that's what undermined his administration.  So, no I'm no defender or proponent of Clinton at all.  There're too many things I have a problem with--
Story_ID: 579930
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the turn of the century, I mean when we moved from '99 [1999] to 2000 here recently and the gentrification of 125th Street [New York, New York].  You walk down 125th Street now, there's a Magic Johnson theater [AMC Magic Johnson Harlem 9, New York, New York], there's a H&M, there's a Gap, there's Old Navy, there's Starbucks.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It looks like Times Square [New York, New York] or Disney World [Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida], but that was really--the turning point occurred with the purge of the vendors in 1995 by Giuliani [Rudy Giuliani].  When Giuliani got--back in when I arrived in, in Harlem [New York, New York] in '93 [1993] there were thousands of mostly African and Caribbean vendors that would sell goods, whatever on the street on 125th Street and it was known worldwide for the vendors, right.  The businesses that existed there and the corporations that were considering placing their corporations there wanted the vendors out because they took business away from, from the larger enterprises on the street, and so Giuliani complied and so you had a purging of the vendors and the development of an economic strategy of gentrification.  When I first moved to New York [New York] in 1993, brownstones that had been reposed by the City of New York, they would give you a brownstone for free, literally a brownstone, right.  Today a brownstone in central Harlem costs a million dollars, right; that's gentrification.  So, what happened is the crack [crack cocaine] epidemic destroys thousands of families, thousands more who hold their families together move out, right, and so you have block after block after block that's vacated.  City absorbs, takes over the property, people don't pay basically property taxes, city takes over the property.  City sells off the property to whoever will buy it.  Real estate speculators, corporations take over the property.  They begin to invest block by block, push up the hi- hike up and take over properties that now are rent controlled, right, have better properties, hike up the rents, rents overall in the community hike up dramatically.  Here in Harlem between 2002 and 2004 rents have gone up, median rent has gone up 40 percent in two years right, so that drives out more people and now increasingly if you take the subway to Harlem, whites who--all the whites who used to get off at 96th Street now they keep riding, keep riding.  And so increasingly, white middle, upper middle class people and black elites, buppies are moving to Harlem and working families are moved out.
Story_ID: 579931
Speaker 1: So, all of those are changes that were part of gentrification and globalization, the development of large corporations that invest heavily, and in fact the corporations have, have a strong multicultural interest.  They believe that it's, it's--and it's interesting because I actually--this is one, one of the few things I was prescient about, if you read 'Beyond Black and White' ['Beyond Black and White: Rethinking Race in American Politics and Society,' Manning Marable] an essay I wrote in that book back in 1992, that first appeared in '92 [1992] is on I, I kind of coin the phrase, corporate multiculturalism, celebrate everybody, criticize nobody, so that large corporations had a vested interest in diversity.  They needed diversity in part because of capitalist markets, that is choice or taste in the selection of a product is informed by culture.  Black people use products of all types, differently than white people do. Something like half of all grape soda in the United States is consumed by blacks.  A third of all orange soda is consumed.  Blacks are more desire of fruit flavored soda soft drinks; whites don't.  Blacks use products of all types differently than white people so that you, you know and there are a lot of market studies that show that.  So, to take advantage of markets that are informed by culture, you must be multicultural.  You must be discursive with diversity and if you have a corporation like Walmart [Walmart Stores, Inc.] that is bigger than a hundred and fifty countries in terms of its GDP, its gross domestic product.  I mean we live now--by the beginning of the 21st century if you think about countries and corporations based on what they produce, their gross domestic product, of all the, of the hundred largest economic units in the world, fifty-one are corporations and forty-nine are countries okay.  Is a corporate, it is a cor- multicultural corporations, these transnational global structures that are defining the economic realities of everyone.  And so a new word has emerged in the '90s [1990s] to inform a kind of philosophy that captures that.  It's called neoliberalism, and the basic idea is, is that the government should reduce its expenditures for guarantees for everyone and that individuals themselves are responsible for getting things like pension, old age, health, things like that.  We're living in a brave new world and black politics has not adequately adjusted or spoken to those new realities of globalization and neoliberalism.  I felt that during the late '90s [1990s] we needed new vehicles to analyze these new forces and that's why I came up with Souls, this journal.
Story_ID: 579932
Speaker 1: Life is filled with transitions, and they come sometimes at very unexpected times.  I can mark one very definitively, 1996.  The Reverend Bill Webber [George W. Webber], who founded in 1983, I believe, the M.A. program in theology at New York Theological Seminary [New York, New York] for a program that was offered in Sing Sing prison [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York] for prisoners, invited me to speak in Sing Sing.  I went, changed my life.  Until you go to Sing Sing and you spend half a day with prisoners, you really don't understand the--both the evil that is represented, the demon that is destroying the humanity of our people and the power of redemption and the power of, and the strength that people can draw from unknown, untapped sources to resist until you go to Sing Sing.  And then I began going more frequently, learning from these brothers of remarkable courage and remarkable dignity.  We had to look for a new generation of leadership from the prisons. I began to realize and from the dispossessed and the most oppressed sectors of our community, folk who everybody had written off;  but, that's where a new kind of leadership would emerge.  So, when there was a racial uprising several years later in Cincinnati [Ohio] in the Over-the-Rhine community, I was one of the few black intellectuals who actually went to Over-the-Rhine talking with local people, speaking to black organizations, and I wrote this up--part of this experience in 'The Great Wells of Democracy: Race in American Life' ['The Great Wells of Democracy: The Meaning of Race in American Life,' Manning Marable] published in 2003.  So, one of the things that I began to perceive by the late '90s [1990s], and this was also during a time I was doing the work in this network, the Black Radical Congress [BRC], was a new black leadership had to be forged and would have to come from the truly disadvantaged.
Story_ID: 579933
Speaker 1: And the second insight is that a new critical intellectual conversation about black studies had to be engaged, and I wanted to start a journal to do that.  And so in January 1999, Souls began, a critical journal of black politics, culture, and society.  It has now been published for seven years.  Our eighth year begins in January 2006, and we have done special issues on race and revolution in Cuba and Assata Shakur permitted us to grace our cover with, with her picture, beautiful picture.  We did a wonderful issue on South Africa after apartheid of politics in Jamaica, our Jamaica issue, Asians and blacks.  We organized at the Institute for Research in African-American Studies [Columbia University, New York, New York], I believe the first academic conference perhaps exploring the connections and discontinuities between Asian Americans and African Americans, and that was expressed by the, the theme of one of our issues.  We tackled--we also did issues that explore, you know, issues like who owns black art.  The whole debate about what is happening in the field of black culture and art of both paintings and performance art and how is that being reshaped by corporations and by the interest of capitalist markets.  So, Souls became a vehicle to do some interesting things and to push the envelope intellectually.
Story_ID: 579934
Speaker 1: In the middle of all of this creativity and all these things that were occurring, two things happened to shift the ground I was on in a basic way.  One was 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  In the summer of '01 [2001], I, along with about fifteen hundred other African Americans, flew to Durban, South Africa to attend the antiracist conference--racism [anti-racism] conference, which was an extraordinary experience.  I was--I spoke at a rally of anti-privatization and mobilization out in the streets as well as I spoke for, I was invited to speak by a social science center in Geneva [Switzerland] of the United Nations [UN] at a, at one of the official conferences, so I got a taste of both the official and the grassroots activists at the conference.  The newspapers, The New York Times had noted that I'd been invited to speak and so alumni began to protest that I, that I had attended this radical, racist, anti-Semitic conference that was organized by the UN and so the provost, Jonathan Cole [Jonathan R. Cole] stopped me on the steps of Low Library [Low Memorial Library, New York, New York] on Monday afternoon, late afternoon, September the 10th.  I'd just come back that weekend and school had just started, and he chided me and he said, "You know for years I've been getting e-mails and letters saying I'd like, why don't you fire that son of a bitch, Edward Said?  Why don't you fire that son of a bitch Edward Said?"  He said, "But now I'm getting why don't you fire that son of a bitch [HistoryMaker] Manning Marable (laughter) for going to that U.N. conference," and we both laughed.  The next day I woke up and I had to speak to a group of faculty.  The thing I'm most proud of that I've accomplished at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] is forcing the university to create in '95 [1995] a faculty advisory committee to the dean of the grad school, for diversity.  And I successfully, after a number of years, pushed to eliminate the recruitment of black and Hispanic students to the grad school who were un-funded.  When I arrived here, the majority of black and Latino grad students did not receive fellowships.  So, they would come and pay for their own way or the graduate school did not adequately provide support.  All of that has now changed.  Every black person receives five years full funding when they come, when they're admitted to Columbia in twenty-eight departments and I feel that even more than creating African American studies that was the greatest victory I achieved here.  Anyway, but I didn't want to rest on my laurels; I mean I had to focus, I focused on ensuring that diversity is meaningful institutionally. And so the morning of 9/11 I was meeting with department chairs talking about how should they approach the issue of minority student recruitment and retention.  I'd just seen stats that, you know, that there was clearly still a disconnect from these guys about the kind of attention they had to have with support for black and Latino grad students, doctoral students.
Story_ID: 579935
Speaker 1: I'm waiting to go inside the meeting and I hear on the radio that two planes have crashed into the World Trade Center [New York, New York].  I went in, gave my talk, and I said you know, it reminded me of Orson Welles' "War of the Worlds," ["The War of the Worlds" on 'The Mercury Theatre on the Air'] and I said I don't want to cause a panic here, but this is what I've just been told and people were stunned, right. So I kept my remarks brief and the dean said well maybe we should you know disperse the meeting.  I get back to the office and I found out that one, that one of the World Trade towers has collapsed.  It's hard to even imagine anyone who ever stood below the World Trade towers and that the second was collapsing.  And then somebody had struck the Pentagon [Washington, D.C.], so the whole world changes.  And I said to myself what does it all mean for black folk.  And what it meant was a rise of intolerance and bigotry and it meant war, and none of that in the long run is good for African American people even if we were not the ones stigmatized.  Those who were stigmatized were overwhelmingly immigrants and Muslims and yet any form of bigotry or, or intolerance when unleashed you know eventually comes back to the fundamental outsider of American democracy and you know who that is.  Like Chris Rock said, the train's never late.  So, by 2002 and '03 [2003], the whole mobilization to keep us out of war and I was writing about this, talking about it, but then I had a second kind of transition.
Story_ID: 579936
Speaker 1: The Aralen [chloroquine] that I was on, I had begun to experience blurry, blurry vision as early as actually 2000, and the doctors told me it was nothing wrong, dah, dah, dah, dah.  Make a long story short, by 2003, early 2003, I experienced absence of clarity of vision and so making a long story very short the Aralen had destroyed part of my retina in both eyes, impaired both eyes, but in my left eye I can no longer see.  But, I can see with my right eye, which is enough.  So, you know, we go through things in life; everybody does and bad things happen to people who try to be good every single day.  It depends on how you deal with the problems, and I don't let anything stop me from what has to be done intellectually or politically.  We're here for a purpose, and the time we have is very short and you have to actually live out your commitments in the real world every day for them to have any meaning and for your life to have meaning, so nothing stops me.
Story_ID: 579937
Speaker 1: Something you said that flashed in my head, you said that you were meeting with the men, the prisoners in, at Sing Sing [Sing Sing Correctional Facility, Ossining, New York] and you said to yourself that a new leader must come from these, this underprivileged group.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's where it has to come from.
Speaker 1: That's where it has to come from.  Is that--was that how Malcolm X developed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was that, is that a parallel for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for his rise?
Speaker 2: There is a parallel yes, but you know I developed this as a theory, as a theme in my book 'The Great Wells of Democracy: Race in American Life' ['The Great Wells of Democracy: The Meaning of Race in American Life,' Manning Marable], but I think that, I--in order to write a biography of Malcolm I had to understand the context in which his leadership emerged and that is in prison, so that, that is part of what the impetus was for going into Sing Sing.  I've had in mind writing a biography of Malcolm since '87 [1987] and began--in Colorado did a great deal of research on the book and had to stop writing it when I came here [Columbia University, New York, New York] in 1993.  So, it was only in 2001 toward the end of my tenure as director of the institute [Institute for Research in African-American Studies] that I was able to turn back to it seriously and began a, a real effort to collect material and interview people who knew Malcolm and worked with him.  Over the last four yea- five years, I've worked very hard on the book and collected an extraordinary amount of material.  We have, I think, probably one of the best archives of Malcolm material that exists, every, pretty much every article every published in English on him in the English language.  We have interviewed scores of people, eyewitnesses to his assassination.  Some, some of this material is on our website.  We're developing in early, hopefully in early '06 [2006], a Malcolm X blog, and we will place digitized material on that.  I've reached an agreement with Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], and he's permitted me to have access to audiotapes of Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad's speeches that no one has ever heard outside of the Nation of Islam.  I believe it's the first time the Nation has ever given these kinds of rare documents or materials to a non-member, and we're transcribing that.  So, it's an extraordinary breakthrough.  We discovered unredacted FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] on the murder and developed a theory, an alternative theory of the murder of Malcolm X and obtained as well the transcripts to the grand jury testimony, which have allowed me to find discrepancies and develop an approach toward how Malcolm X should be interpreted.  So, all of those will be in the book, and it will come out in 2009 hopefully.
Speaker 1: Two thousand nine [2009]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we recently signed a contract with Viking Penguin [Viking Press], so--.
Speaker 1: Congratulations.
Speaker 2: Thank you, so a lot of people will read it.  It's called 'Malcolm X:  A Life of Reinvention' [Manning Marable].  He was a man who reinvented himself many times, many times.
Speaker 1: Because he evolved?  Because he needed to be--.
Speaker 2: Because he understood that any successful politics requires leaps of imagination and it provides I think, it presents, what I hope it's really, the comp- the true complexity of an extraordinary genius, a man who was absolutely remarkable.  A, a leader of a new type who could have revolutionized this country, and that's why the state and that's why the FBI were so fearful of him because they sensed all of that, all of that.

Speaker 1: So, where I am in my own writing right now is, in 2002 I created the Center for Contemporary Black History [Columbia University, New York, New York], which is my little shop.  It's a fancy title for my stuff as I put it.  So, my stuff is Souls, my journal, the Malcolm X project ['Malcolm X:  A Life of Reinvention,' Manning Marable].
Speaker 2: Can you just hold up one of these so we can get a--
Speaker 1: Oh sure, sure.
Speaker 2: --so we can see Souls.

The third project is what we call ACJP, Africana Criminal Justice [Africana Criminal Justice Project].  In 2002, the George Soros foundation, the Open Society Institute [Open Society Foundations]--
Speaker 2: And, yeah you were--
Speaker 1: --gave me $200,000 to do a project on race, crime, and justice, and so the project we did we launched a course in Rikers Island high school [Austin H. MacCormick Island Academy, New York, New York] where we worked with young black and Hispanic males, 15, 16, 17 years old using hip hop in spoken word as a way of getting them to interrogate and interpret and understand the meaning of the criminal justice system in their lives and what they have gone and what they are going through, right.  Hip hop is the cultural template for their generation.  We offered courses on disfranchisement in politics of prisons.
Speaker 2: Did HBO do a documentary on that Rikers high school?
Speaker 1: They sure did.
Speaker 2: Okay, were you involved in that documentary?
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: No, but it was great that they did that.  It was very good.
Speaker 2: Right, okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: We also do public programming.  We have events and lectures and things like that, and we do a lot of stuff with, with information technology, digital knowledge.  In nin- in '01 [2001] and in--from '01 [2001] to 2004, we constructed a multimedia web-based version of 'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Malcolm X and Alex Haley] that Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] internally funded for $750,000, and I use it to teach with and some of the material is on my website.  The, so we do--I've built several different e-courses, one on Malcolm, one on Dr. Du Bois.  So, we do a lot of multimedia stuff, and I became very interested in visual culture, so my wife [Leith Mullings] and I put together an extraordinary book called 'Freedom' ['Freedom: A Photographic History of the African American Struggle,' Manning Marable and Leith Mullings], which is this big coffee table book that documents the visual images of African American, in fact this is kind of what it looks like.  It's as big as a small child right.  The history of the black freedom struggle from the invention of photography in the late 1840s through looking at daguerreotype all the way to 2002.  So, my life has been very productive.  I'm fifty-five, I don't have any plan to retire any time soon.  After 'Malcolm' I'm envisioning a book called 'Imagining Justice', and it seeks to answer the question, if black people had justice, what would it look like, 'cause we've never had it and the best example of that is Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] (scoffs).

Speaker 1: You have this catastrophic event that is a natural disaster that is turned into an unnatural disaster by racism and by class inequality.  You look at New Orleans [Louisiana], a city of a half million.  You have 200,000 houses in that city, 120,000 of the 200,000 have been damaged to some greater or lesser extent by the flood, but the areas of the greatest loss are, not surprisingly, the lowest ground in the city, not surprisingly, is nearly completely black.  So, you're talking about the removal, permanent removal--they're not estimating at about eighty to a hundred thousand of the two hundred thousand homes.  Disproportionately overwhelming the lion's share are African Americans and if they're white, they're low to middle income, right, lower income.  So, poor people and black people get moved out.  You're gonna have the gentrification of the downtown area.  City planners who've wanted to remove black people from downtown New Orleans for years now have a golden opportunity, and there, and there is a political benefit because by very narrow margins statewide, Democrats, since the turn of the century have been winning that state, you know, and for sen- senate races.  The removal of ten--even just 10,000 black folks, you know, much less 150,000 is going to turn that state into a Republican bashing for decades to come.  And so the ineptitude of the government aside there is a method to their madness, the destruction of thousands, tens of thousands of black homes, the elimination of tens of thousands if not several hundred thousand black votes permanently from that state, the failure of FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] to address issues of pain and suffering in black and poor people's communities.  It even forced, opened the question for me in my own writing is there something necessary about the punishment of the black body, of black death?  Is that necessary for the preservation of white institutions in America?  That's a question that black people have to ponder given what our history is, because that's what we saw, the bloated dead black bodies floating in New Orleans are really a testimony to the pain and suffering of four centuries that our people have experienced in this nation.  What we have fought for is not something narrowly for ourselves, but it is for everyone, that is, a genuine democratic society that is pluralistic and open and where there is genuine justice where the law is applied equally to all, regardless of color or class.  This is not too much to ask for and yet it is a dream deferred.  And yet the fight continues, and despite reverses, despite Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], the struggle can be won.  You know Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], said, "The moral arc of the universe is long, but it bends towards justice."  I really believe that.  But, it only bends towards justice if you make it so, and if you're willing to as they used to say in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] to place your body on the line and so with the one eye and the half lung I place my body on the line where I can and that as a writer try to make a difference and as a speaker try to make a difference in black people's and in people's lives and I try to write now for everyone.  And in that I'm often encouraged by the e-mails I receive by people who've been inspired by my work, and I gain strength from how people, especially young people, can take ideas I have and carry them in new and valuable directions that I hadn't anticipated intellectually.
Story_ID: 579940
Speaker 1: So, the very last question and we have looks like about four minutes, but I kind of wanted to end on an up note, and I want to ask you to reflect on how far we've come up from slavery as black people?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the wonderful thing about our book 'Freedom' ['Freedom: A Photographic History of the African American Struggle,' Manning Marable and Leith Mullings] that what Leith [Leith Mullings] and I discovered, rediscovered 'cause we've always known it, is that all of the sacrifices, all of the deaths, all of the agony that we've experienced through enslavement, the rape, the murder, the struggles to overturn Jim Crow, the death of Medgar [Medgar Evers], Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Malcolm [Malcolm X], all those deaths were meaning, did have meaning and value in helping to redefine this country.  And they're--you know for young people who are in Generation X, you know beyond the hip hop generation, now you got Generation X, Y, and Y, but, right, sometimes they don't have, they don't have a sense of that.  I do, I do.  When I was a kid, I couldn't try on a cap or a pair of pants in a clothing store in the South.  You couldn't sit down and eat, go to a restaurant or sit in a restroom if you were black.  I remember that stuff.  If you live through that, you never forget it any, any time in your life.  So, I've seen in my life that through struggle and through resistance to oppression that what we gain, we can gain freedom, but freedom is dialectical, it continues out here.  And so without struggle as Fred Douglass [Frederick Douglass] said there is no progress.  And the progress that we have made has been monumental and yet the distance we have still to overcome still remains a daunting challenge, but it is only through the faith we have. As we said as, as Rosamond [J. Rosamond Johnson] and James Weldon Johnson said, in God of our weary years, God of our silent tears, true to our God, true to our native land, in the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'] that continues to inspire me.  We fight because we stand on the shoulders of, of great women and men.
Speaker 1: Rosa Parks died, I should--we should, yeah.
Speaker 2: Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And yes, Rosa just passed away.  And the courage of a Rosa or Septima Clark [Septima Poinsette Clark], Ella Baker, Mrs. Hamer [Fannie Lou Hamer], Brother Malcolm, Dr. Du Bois, how can we do otherwise?  The struggle is ours because that is our heritage, and the goal is freedom for everyone.
Speaker 1: Thank you Dr. Marable [HistoryMaker Manning Marable], Dr. Marable (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
