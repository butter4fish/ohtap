Story_ID: 22825
Speaker 1: All right. Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as sort of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay. And should I be looking at you or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, at me.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And, well, the first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, I suppose.  (Laughter) I love pasta.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like orange, brownish colors, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I love the springtime, spring and early summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Wow, there're so many interesting places in the world, it's hard to pick a favorite (laughter).  But, yeah, I love American West, American West, California, it'd be nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Boy, these are tough questions (laughter).  You said that these would be easy (laughter), tough.  Favorite phrase or saying?  I'll think of one.  I'm sure I have one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Story_ID: 22826
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  Now, I'm, I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately.  And then we'll put 'em together.  So can you give us your mother's full, full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Delores Kerrick.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell--
Speaker 2: D-O-L-O-R-E-S, and last name, K-E-R-R-I-C-K. All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: Wow, yeah, I'd have to back calculate.  She passed away when I was young, so, but she--in about 1976, she was about forty-three, and so that would make it, '33, 1933.
Speaker 2: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 1: She was born in Annapolis, Maryland.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, now is, is Kerrick her maiden name or--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  All right, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 1: I knew my mom's father very well.  He ran a funeral home in Annapolis, Maryland, and we used to go down to his place and play around on his boat.  We'd go crabbing with chicken legs and catch the blue crabs and have a great crab fry afterwards.  And he had a number of sisters and cousins in the area that I knew very well.  And they were, various aunts to us and just really a wonderful group of people.  And, yeah, and they all, my grand-her, her dad, whose name was Vernon--that's where my middle name comes from.
Speaker 2: So this is Vernon Kerrick?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He passed away--he was a Jehovah's Witness and passed away as a result of refusing to take a blood transfusion.  That was one of the tenets of the, of the faith, not to take transfusions.  And so, that was sad.  I mean I think he--that was probably in the early '80s [1980s], but very fond memories of that side of my mom's family.  And we'd drive down there from New York and, and see them.
Speaker 2: Okay, did is, now, did any of the family members talk about, you know, where they--was the family history, did the family history reside in Annapolis as far back as anybody remembered or what?
Speaker 1: Wow.  There was, it, they--the whole family had been from that area, D.C. [District of Columbia] area, and beyond that though, not much is known.  I'd love to learn more about it.  We actually had a family reunion of sorts, just this summer in August in New York City [New York].  And, actually, it was mostly from my dad's side of the family there, but we had a little family tree, and it was really, really fascinating.  But, yeah, my mom's dad was sort of the generation that I got to know best.
Speaker 2: How far back can that side of the family be traced?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: You know, that side of the family, I wouldn't know.  Really my grandfather is, is--that's the limit of my knowledge right now.  So, but it probably could be traced farther back.
Speaker 2: Now, did your grandfather inherit the funeral home or did he, did he start it himself, or--?
Speaker 1: I think he was a, I think he may have started it himself, and he had, you know, a bunch of hearses and small staff there.  And so he was quite successful, very successful.  You know, he had a big boat that you could sleep on and just a big motorboat.  And that always was very impressive to me.  He was, and he was a very, very confident guy, had a great sense of humor and he loved his, loved his grandkids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, usually funeral directors do fairly well, you know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --so I'm just wondering if he--do you know where he went to school?
Speaker 1: No, no, I mean he, he may well have had, you know, a high school education.  He was really more of a self-made man.  It's not as if he, you know, went to college and higher education and then used that.  I think he really used his, his own personal skills to get ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay, I know you have to go and get certified to be a funeral director (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sure, sure.
Speaker 2: But, okay, so was, was he born in Annapolis [Maryland] as far as you know?
Speaker 1: As far as I'm aware, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what about your grandmother?
Speaker 1: My grandmother, I didn't know that well.  Vernon remarried at one point when I was very young and married a really wonderful lady.  And we got to know her quite well, but my original grandmother, I really don't know that much about.
Speaker 2: Was she still alive when you were coming up?
Speaker 1: I don't recall meeting her.  And so she may well have passed away when I was very young.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's interesting.  Well, you know, it's unusual that your mother would not have a, you know, a strong relationship with her mother.  I mean I'm just kind of--
Speaker 1: Right, right, you know I've, I, I, I really--the, the, women on that side of the family were really these aunts and siblings of Vernon.  And so for, for some reason, my maternal grandmother doesn't loom large in my memory.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay. Do you know her name? No.
Story_ID: 22827
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, now, did your mother, I know she died when you were young, but did, did she have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she, eventually, before she died, actually went to law school in New York City and was working in a, a law firm around Central Park South in Manhattan.  And I used to drive with my dad to drop her off, and I was very impressed.  It was near this big building with a very curved slope in it on Central Park South.  And it was very impressive to me that she--she spent several years studying in law school.  And she had a little make-shift desk in the basement of our house.  It wasn't, (laughter) it wasn't the most elegant office for her, but down there with the clothes washer and dryer (laughter).  But she had her books there and her, her light and her desk, and she made her way through law school.  That was after quite a gap, and she, you know, after graduating from college, wasn't in school for a long time.  But it must have been when I was maybe seven or eight that she went back to, to law school.  And she went to Northfield Mount Herman for college and really enjoyed it there, and I, I think she really valued the sort of small, academic community there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, what law school did she attend?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I'm thinking it may have been Hunter [Hunter College, New York] or Fordham [Fordham University, New York], but I would need to check that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it she grew up in Annapolis too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, well-- Okay, I was just asking about your mother's law school experience.  So she practiced as a lawyer then for a while--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if she was an actual lawyer.  I mean she may have been a law assistant or something.  I, I just don't know.  But she certainly worked in a big office building, and, you know, that wasn't for very long.  I mean she may have been working for, boy, two years at most, before she passed away.  So, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what did--was she ill or?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had some sort of leukemia, cancer of the blood.  And she would get ill and then she'd seem to get better, and then she'd get ill again.  And then, yeah, when I was, in 1976, she passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22828
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Adrian Lamos Edwards.  That's A-D-R-I-A-N, L-A-M-O-S, E-D-W-A-R-D-S.
Speaker 1: Well, is there a story behind Lamos?
Speaker 2: Well, Lamos was the, sort of family name of my dad's uncles.  And they ultimately traced back to Jamaica.  And one particular uncle, whom we called Uncle Adrian, was very formative.  He was a very successful doctor in Brooklyn [New York].  He lived in this very big house, which, in fact, I saw a few years ago a big picture of it in the 'New York Times'.  Apparently, it was up for sale.  It was sort of a multi-, big multi-unit house.  I'm sure it was built in the 1800s some time.  And so my dad's family really traces back to Jamaica.  We don't know much about my dad's parents.  In fact, at this reunion we had just a few months ago in New York, we passed around some pictures, really ones I'd seen, some of which I'd seen for the first time, of my dad's mom, whom I never met.  And my dad's dad, who was born in Jamaica, really, the family doesn't know much about him.  And there's some controversies as to, I think he was in Brooklyn for several years, but then was sent back to Jamaica for some, some transgression, some issue that arose.  And so it's, he's a bit of a shadowy figure.  But there were a number of, of siblings and what not in Jamaica.  And we actually as children went to Jamaica several times and saw some of the haunts around Kingston and some of the property owned by my dad's side of the family.
Speaker 1: So now this is interesting.  So, let me try to recapitulate this.  So your father came, I mean your grandfather came to the United States from Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then conceived your father, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then he was sent back for some transgression, and he, he never came back to the--
Speaker 2: Never came back.
Speaker 1: And Uncle Adrian, this is your--
Speaker 2: Raised my dad. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for whom your dad was named.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: His great uncle?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I mean your great uncle, rather.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Your dad's uncle was the doctor?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Did, did he raise your--so he raised your father?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he, there was also a number of, of, well, Uncle Adrian's brother, his name was Spencer, Spencer Lamos, he had a number of daughters, all of whom were sort of part of the family mix in Brooklyn.  And so, and some of them, several of them are, are still alive.  There's Alice in Chicago [Illinois] who was at this reunion in New York, and Gwen, who's still very close.  She lives in Queens [New York].  So, and Spencer, I remember quite well.  We'd get together for holidays and Thanksgiving and what not.  He was a big, imposing figure, very dark skinned and very, very impressive.  Actually, both of, both him and Adrian were, were very impressive.  And it was clear that Uncle Adrian had, was a very successful physician and had, you know, had a lot of, of humor, but also you could tell he took life pretty seriously, worked hard.
Speaker 1: You know where he went to medical school?
Speaker 2: You know, I think it was, it may have been--it was in Brooklyn.  But, yeah, I'm not sure of the exact medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he came up, let's see.  So if your, your great uncle probably--now, your father's birthday is--he was born in the '30s [1930s] too, I take it or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, his birthday is May 5th, 1933.
Speaker 1: '33 [1933]. Okay, so I'm thinking your, I'm thinking your great uncle probably was up, up before him, of course.  So he probably--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --I'd say, place him maybe ten years ahead of him in terms of--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: --or more?
Speaker 2: I think, I think more, yeah, because, you know, when dad was in his thirties, forties, you know, Adrian was, you know, sort of a young senior, you might say.  I don't know, maybe in his late fifties or sixties.  And so, yeah, there was quite a lot of years between them.
Speaker 1: So he was born maybe around 1910 or something would you say?
Speaker 2: That would be my guess- No, that may be--well, no, maybe 1900 (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, let me see.  I mean he passed away in the '80s [1980s].  And so it probably was early 1900s, yeah, or 1910s, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, so your, your grandmother was a Lamos, then, right, I mean, no, I mean she wasn't.  Well, what was your, your grandmother's name on that side?
Speaker 1: On my--
Speaker 2: Your father's side?
Speaker 1: Wow, I just saw my first picture of her about two months ago.  What was her name?  I think it was, it was Edith, or, sorry, Enid, Enid, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, E-N-I-D.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, and do you know her last name, what, what her maiden was?
Speaker 1: That's a good question.  Again, I never, I never met her and so, but I could, could certainly dig that up.
Story_ID: 22829
Speaker 1: Okay, so your dad was, he was raised in Brooklyn?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, now, did your dad go, go, go to--did he have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he went to school in Brooklyn, high school and what not, and went to medical school at Brooklyn Medical School.   And he then had various posts as an Army doctor.  He had an opportunity to go to Hawaii in the early '60s [1960s] as, as an Army doctor, and, in fact, he even made a brief trip to Korea at one point.  He had, he went over to Korea partly in the Vietnam War era to help with some, setting up some make-shift hospitals and what not.  But he really enjoyed his time in Hawaii.  And, in fact, that's where both my brother and I were born.  And we only lived there for maybe, I think I lived there for just a year.  My brother was probably there for two years or two and a half years.  But, but yeah, that's, he--then my dad, we moved for a few years to-that--I was born in Triple Army Hospital in Honolulu [Hawaii].  And then we moved for a few years to Colorado Springs in Colorado where there was another Army base where my dad served as a physician.  And then when I was probably about four, we made our way to Manhattan [New York], which is where I grew up.  And there, my dad was working in New York Hospital which is on East 70th Street, and we lived in a big apartment building on various floors with double digits, and he would, it was actually connected to the New York Hospital underground.  And so I would sometimes follow my dad to the hospital rooms, taking this tunnel under, I think it was York Avenue.  So--.
Story_ID: 22830
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: A story about how they met?  That's a good question.  I don't know of any specific story.  There are, there are some early photos, and they look like a very happy couple.  And I think my mom [Delores Kerrick] really felt going to Hawaii was sort of the exotic and a nice place to live too, I mean, interesting.
Speaker 1: So did they get married just before he, he was shipped to Hawaii, or--?
Speaker 2: I think they were, yeah, they probably had been married a few years before they went out to Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were born in Hawaii.  Now, can you--do you have a birth certificate to prove you're (laughter)--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how funny that is.  I know there have been maybe two or three times now in the last year where people have made that joke when they're introducing me for a talk, and I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  It's a--
Speaker 1: It's pretty sad.  It is a sad state of affairs.  But you were born in Hawaii.  Now, you're a little younger than President Obama, I believe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you didn't know him there, I don't think.
Speaker 2: No, I mean I read, yeah, I read his, his, his first book, and I don't--no, I don't think we crossed paths at all.  I mean I didn't go to school in Hawaii or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Right, and you were a little kid in Hawaii.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do, do, do you have memories of Hawaii at all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  I mean there's some pictures, but I mean we moved when I was one, and I just, I'm not one of the kids with the memory going back into the womb.  And so, but, yeah, the pictures I've seen, you know, it looks, it's idyllic, you know.  It had just become a state.  I'm sure there was a lot of optimism in the air and stuff.
Story_ID: 22831
Speaker 1: Right, so, when you think about your parents' individual personalities and mannerisms, their dispositions, their habits, how they looked, how they moved, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) according to my wife, Beth, I'm a carbon copy of my dad [Adrian Edwards] (laughter).  So, and I supposed that's, that makes sense.  I mean I probably, I look like him, and we're about the same height, and the same sort of build and stuff.  So--.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was easy (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, no, I don't think there's any question there.  My, my, my brother is, I think more like my mom [Delores Kerrick].
Speaker 1: Okay, is it just you and your brother?
Speaker 2: I've got a sister as well, yeah.  She lives in Seattle [Washington] now.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of name them and give us where you fit in the lineup, in the--
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm the middle child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so my brother is maybe two years older than I am, and Tracy is maybe, almost two years younger, a year and a half younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Let's see.  Now, what was your mother's personality like as far as you can remember?
Speaker 2: She was very, very patient, very, loving, very curious.  She really raised us well, I think, and, you know, I only remember her once getting upset about just life and the pressures, only once did I see her kind of shout out or just, you know, fall apart.  So she was always very, just very agreeable, very positive, really, nurtured her kids and encouraged them to follow their own paths, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and your father, what was his personality--well, he's still around, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, he's retired in New Mexico now.  And, oh no, he was great.  He loved to take us out camping when we were really young.  So I have, do have some memories of Colorado and driving around in this Volkswagen bus.  You know, he, he's a private person, I would say.  It's, you know, I think it was obviously very tough for him when, when mom died, and, but you know, he wasn't one to really talk about it a lot.  But he was, he expected a lot from you, grades, working hard in school, that was the most important thing and placed a huge value on education.  And now, you know, he really, really just loves hearing what we're up to.  He, I think can take pride in having raised, you know, three really wonderful, really, you know, successful children.  And he's, you know, social, but not too social.  You know, he really valued home life. I, you know, eating together at dinner was sort of an institution.  And I don't think he, he's, he's informal.  I mean he doesn't like the glittery highlife.  He very much gravitates towards just more informal collegial gatherings.  So, you know, he, he, I think he could be stern occasionally, and he really depended on--he has sort if a, certain--he expected the family to work together towards common goals.  And so, you know, I--we spent a lot of time, when we moved up, up to Riverdale in the Bronx [New York] from Manhattan, probably when I was six or seven, he, you know, we spent a lot of time working in the garden.  We helped with chores.  And so I think that was really formative, you know.  I think it's a good thing, yeah.
Story_ID: 22832
Speaker 1: Now, now, what, what kind of a practice was your father involved in?  What was he--
Speaker 2: He [Edwards' father, Adrian Edwards] was a cardiologist and, and a general practitioner.  He didn't do a lot of surgery, per se, mostly diagnosis and referral.  And he had an office on the Upper East Side, 73rd Street in Manhattan [New York].  And, yeah, he would sort of shuttle between there and New York Hospital [in Manhattan, New York].  And he had some very, very prestigious patients.  Former mayor, David Dinkins, was one of his patients.  And so he certainly had access to, you could call them the elite, I suppose, of New York.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay, he was, so he had a pretty, he had a good practice going.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, successful.
Speaker 2: Very successful, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22833
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, where were you raised?  I mean what was the neighborhood.  I mean were you raised in Manhattan?
Speaker 2: I spent probably between, maybe, between ages four and, three and a half, four and seven in Manhattan.  And then we moved to a community called Riverdale in the Bronx [New York] which is in the very northwest corner of the Bronx, actually one of the few parts of the city that (laughter) really was quite rural.  I mean there were a lot of trees there.  The area where we moved was, very few houses had been built there, and so it was different.  You would never guess it was New York City from there.  And so that was, yeah, that was very much suburban, fairly close to the Hudson River, and just a spectacular place to, to grow up, really, really nice.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a, you know, I guess in those days, there weren't many black people living there, right?
Speaker 2: No, I mean, you know, there was a--another black family that actually didn't, that lived pretty much in the same area which was interesting.  We were friends with them, and we knew their, their daughters.  And so, yeah, in that sense, I wouldn't at any--I wouldn't call it a black enclave at all, but we, we actually weren't the only ones there which was, which was kind of gratifying.
Story_ID: 22834
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, well, we always ask this question like this.  Whoa, I didn't ask the other question first?  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest childhood memory was actually in Colorado when I remember riding in a sort of a, kind of a kid's seat on the back of a bicycle.  So I wasn't riding the bicycle but my, my dad [Adrian Edwards] probably was.  And I distinctly remember coming around this curve, we must have been in a hilly area, and looking down and seeing this pasture full of cows.  And I'm, I'm sure, you know, my memory says that we were probably three miles up, although I'm sure the reality was it was just a (laughter), looking down a small slope.  But it was, I have the, you know, a bit intimidating looking down so far to these cattle, but, but I do remember very, you know, green fields and sort of a herd of cattle down there.
Story_ID: 22835
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this is a question we always ask, that I started asking and aborted, well, what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of my childhood?  I would say playing in the dirt.  In our neighborhood in Riverdale [New York], there were new houses going up in the area, and as they were being built, there was, it was like a little boy's, you know, perfect, you know, array of tunnels and ditches and like a little battlefield.  And so we would be throwing dirt bombs at each other a lot in this sort of--once all the grass and stuff was cleared.  Yeah, I think, you know, I, we lived in Riverdale, but I actually went to school in, in Manhattan, so it was kind of this dual world.  And smells, I'll have to think about that, but, yeah, I do have this vivid memory of kind of transitioning from a very urban Manhattan [New York] where I was in school to a much more rural and country-like area, where we lived at home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I guess the sounds were a lot diff-, different in a rural --
Speaker 2: Yeah, for sure, absolutely.  I mean I didn't start, you know, bird watching probably till I was in sixth or seventh grade, but, yeah, definitely, much, much quieter.  You know, I'd take the garbage up the hill--we lived down at the bottom of this little, our driveway came down a hill.  And so I'd have to take the garbage up so the garbage man could take it.  And I'd often do that at night after dinner and, yeah, I remember just very quiet, very dark, not a lot of city lights, very safe.  So that was, that was interesting, yeah. Were there any places to explore when you were growing up in your neighborhood?
Speaker 1: Lots of places to explore.  Yeah, spent, you know, a good bit of time on my own just, you know, getting up early and looking around and, yeah, there were a lot of places to explore down closer to the river.  There were railroad tracks, lots of undeveloped lots with just woods on 'em.  And, yeah, I would say it was, it was a good place for that, just to walk around and see what was around.  We did a lot of bicycling too.  We'd set up these ramps and, you know, I had one of these banana-seat bikes, and we'd, you know, Evil Knievel-style, we'd, you know, go airborne on these things.  And we also had just an extraordinary sledding hill.  So when it snowed in wintertime, this hill was just, just perfect.  I mean you would, it was actually, it was actually a road (laughter).  It was the driveway coming up to this community, and I mean we were lucky, you know, we didn't have any head-on collisions with cars, but perfect pitch, at the end there was this, you know, 180 degree turn that you had to take with ultimate skill, so it was really, really fun that way.
Story_ID: 22836
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, you say, you went to school in Manhattan, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, okay, what was the name of your, your first school?
Speaker 2: Buckley School was my grade school.  That was on the Upper East Side, probably about 72nd, 73rd Street, very close actually to my dad's [Adrian Edwards] office.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Buckley.  Now, is this a private school?
Speaker 2: Private school, and I was, you know, the only black kid in my class and probably one of maybe two or three black kids in the school.  It went between first grade and eighth grade.  And, you know, rig-,rigorous education.  I felt, you know, I learned a lot, learned how to study, I think, great kids, great teachers.  You know, I think it may, looking at it now, it, it may not have evolved with the times in terms of diversity and getting a diverse group of students.  But, you know, my brother and I went there, and I think it got us off to a good start.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so your brother was there, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With your brother, it would make--now, he's older than you, right --
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --by--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's here in Boston actually. Okay. Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's like a year older than you or two years?
Speaker 2: About a year and a half--
Speaker 1: Year and a half, okay.
Speaker 2: --I'd say, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, Buckley School, is it, was it named--do you know who it was named for?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (laughter).
Speaker 1: The reason, I keep thinking of William F. Buckley, you know, he's--
Speaker 2: No, yeah, I--
Speaker 1: But I know it's not him.
Speaker 2: --it may have been a relative.  Yeah, there is a Mr. Hubble was the headmaster when I, the principal when I started there.  And, yeah, very nice man.  My, my dad describes interviewing with him initially, and, you know, I think he was, he, he kind of wanted the best for his kids, the best that he could afford.  And I think he was concerned about, you know, having his kids be the only black kids, but he was reassured, I think, by Mr. Hubble that we'd be taken care of, and we'd, you know, have a positive experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your parents both worked in Manhattan, so was that, you know, a convenience factor too for them, you know, to--
Speaker 2: I imagine.  I mean, yeah, we, there were also good schools in Riverdale, for example.  And we never discussed transitioning, and I think it certainly was convenient because, I mean I could get, my brother and I could get dropped off very, and then we'd be, my dad would be close to his office.  And so, yeah, I, it's hard to know whether it was convenience or quality that attracted them.  But they kind of both came together.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so would your parents take you to school in the mornings or, from--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  We'd drive in.  It was often half an hour, and, yeah, and then I'd get dropped off at school.  You know, when I got older, I would pretty regularly take a bus home, and that worked well.  I think it cost two dollars and dropped me off maybe, you know, five or six blocks from our house.  Yeah, so I think it was, I think it was very convenient.  I would often go, after school I'd go over to my dad's office, hang out there till he was done, and then, you know, we'd drive home together, so.

Speaker 1: Now, did you have any scientific interests as an, as an elementary school student at Buckley? You know, I think I always enjoyed science.  We, I remember very clearly, it must have been a sixth or seventh grade project, where we had to kind of describe all the life and goings on in a patch of green somewhere in our backyard or our house or whatever.  And I remember that assignment very vividly, just drawing in detail this whole garden plot and the way the light changed throughout the day over it.  I also remember occasionally getting a chance to look at, you know, some pond water or some other, you know, scum that I (laughter) found some place under my dad's microscope that he would use for medical stuff.  And that was really extraordinary for me.  I mean the, it was a very good microscope and just seeing the amazing, you know, unicellular animals, amoebas and stuff.  I mean it was, paramecium, I mean, it was just like dinosaurs, you know, I could rattle off their, their names (laughter).  And that was very impressive to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, that's, that's good.  And you had the use of a microscope.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean in school, we did as well, but I just remembered my dad's being particularly clear.  I mean it was like, wow, this is sort of a whole new world.  And so, yeah, it's, it's really, it was amazing to me that you could find so much in just a tiny, you know, in a cup of soil, there'd be just this whole world in there.
Speaker 2: So did you spend much time in the office, I mean, was that kind of a regular part of life?
Speaker 1: I remember, yeah, you'd go hang out there, you know, sort of your, you know, home away from home when you had to wait for dad to get finished or whatever.  He used to eat his sandwich, you know, homemade sandwich in this little room.  It was just a, you know, couldn't have been more than four feet by three feet, just a tiny little, sort of lunch area.  And, yeah, it was a very comfortable place.  He'd have the magazines in the front office where the patients would read and, you know, he definitely, he'd put me to work.  He'd have me filing stuff or, you know, putting the checks in alphabetical order and all kinds of crazy stuff.  And his office was sort of the, you know, the inner-sanctum.  You'd kind of catch glimpses of him in there, but you'd, you know, you'd see him interviewing a patient or something and, yeah, it was very impressive.
Speaker 2: I think you'd, there'd be a lot of things to learn in a doctor's office.
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah, absolutely, yeah.  Yeah, and I think it, it was a side of my dad (laughter), you know, I'd -- you didn't really appreciate.  At home he was, you know, much more relaxed, and you wouldn't, you'd sort of, then you'd see the sort of technical side which was very impressive.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm just thinking.  So many people never see what their parents do at work, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, really, yeah.  You've found that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, sure, because somebody, I mean especially at the lower income level, hardly anybody ever goes with their father to work.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And they don't know what they do.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, no, yeah.
Speaker 2: And if he was a lawyer even, you wouldn't, you know, probably --
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --hang out as much with him, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, I felt my dad's office was pretty welcoming.  I never felt like I couldn't go in there or anything.  He always had nice secretaries (laughter).
Speaker 2: Did he have a, you know, I know some doctor's offices have a skeleton--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and, I mean different charts about it, and I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he definitely had the, you know, charts of the, you know, gastrointestinal system or whatever.  You, you kind of stare at 'em, and, yeah, there was definitely some.  I don't remember an actual 3-D [three dimensional] skeleton, but I'm sure he had a poster of some kind.
Speaker 2: And as a cardiologist, I guess he would have a, some kind of a--
Speaker 1: The heart.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a heart.
Speaker 1: Absolutely, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I've been, I've seen the 3-D kind that you can pull apart and look at the valves--
Speaker 1: Right, okay, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, there's, there was probably some of that.  I mean, yeah, it wasn't like a menagerie.  I mean it wasn't, it was, it was a fairly, you know, a simple office with not a lot of visual stuff, but, but there was definitely enough to keep a, a little kid curious.
Story_ID: 22838
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's see, now were there any--now, you were at Buckley School through eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Through eighth grade, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were there any particular teachers there that, that provided like a role model or mentorship for you in some way?
Speaker 2: You know, most of my, I hones-, I don't recall really my science teachers, per se.  I do recall a number of, of teachers.  My music teacher, Mr. Rotella (ph.) was--. I as in the Glee Club, along with, with my brother.  And, yeah, that was, that was a trip.  I mean, you know, you could imagine trying to keep thirty or forty boys singing, you know, try to keep them in line and, you know, we would, you know, we would have our fair share of laughs and jokes and chuckles and throwing spit bombs without the teacher trying to see.  He could be very stern, but he had this amazing passion for music, which, you know, and I really feel fortunate to have been in the Glee Club.  It was just a good release.  I mean everyone should get a chance to sing, I think.
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Mr. Rotella.
Speaker 1: Okay, Rotella, okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I remember, I have a very, very fond memories of a French teacher.  I, I don't recall her name, but she had a kind of unconventional style.  She would, for about five minutes at the beginning of each class, she would turn out the lights and have us all sit quietly and close our eyes and just practically meditate.  And I, you know, obviously, it made an impression on me.  I, I still remember it.  And I think she was probably just trying to calm us down.  But I, I, I sort of valued that time.  I remember she'd say, you know, "Feel the weight of the clothes on your body."  I mean it's like, okay, you know, this (laughter), this is trying to increase your awareness, your sensitivity to other sorts of, to, of the external environment.  And I had, I had really good Latin teachers.  Sports was a big deal.  I played some basketball, a lot of soccer, and I have very, very fond memories of, of several of the coaches there and a lot of the students.  I mean just the, we had some extraordinary students, with athletic prowess that was just, just amazing.  And so, yeah, I'll actually be getting together with some of them next week, and most of whom I haven't seen, you know, since that time. So I'm, I'm looking forward to that, seeing how everyone's changed.
Story_ID: 22839
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were growing up, you would have been about nine, I guess, when the Knicks won the NBA [National Basketball Association] Championship--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My dad [Adrian Edwards] was a huge Knicks [New York Knicks, professional basketball team, NBA] fan, still is, although, you know, it's hard, had to keep (laughter) the faith that long,  But, yeah, oh, yeah, the Knicks were a big part of home life for sure.  Didn't go to that many games, but definitely watched 'em on the T.V.  And, yeah, it's, I, it's, it's fun, I think to play a sport and then see, you know, the real deal on the tube.  That, that's a really interesting connection to make.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was not a big part of our world.  We, we said grace when I was young.  We would say grace.  "God is great, God is good, and we thank him for our food," that sort of thing.  But we never routinely went to church.  Yeah, it never was a big, big part--and again, this may have been, you know, the fact that my, I think my dad sort of valued family life more than community life.  I mean he, he valued, you know, being at home and didn't feel the need to have a broad swath of friends through some place like a church.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your, now, your mother, you said her father was a Jehovah's Witness, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  So, yeah, and I suppose my mom [Delores Kerrick]  may have been a bit more religious, and certainly when relatives came to visit, you know, they'd sprinkle these Jehovah's Witness' booklets all over the house.  But, yeah, it was, and I, I don't know whether-I, I can't imagine she got a lot of pushback from her dad.  But I, it was never a, a big issue.
Speaker 1: So she didn't practice the Jehovah's Witness?
Speaker 2: No, no, I mean at least, I mean, I, I certainly didn't sense that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, now were you involved in the Boy Scouts or--
Speaker 2: No, I did not do Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Most of our sports would be after school.  We'd go to Randall's Island in the East River, near Manhattan and have our practice there.  Then we'd come back to school, and I'd get a ride home with, with, with dad.  I didn't--and the weekends were blissfully free.  I, I don't, we didn't have a lot of activities, which is time to kind of roam around.  Of course, you had homework and stuff, but, yeah, I never, I did go to day camps.  At first, went to, and sleep-away camps, and so I suppose that was sort of my Boy Scouts, went to a couple of camps at upstate New York for short periods.  And I went to--
Speaker 1: Summer camp, right.
Speaker 2: Sorry?
Speaker 1: These are summer camps, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And went to a very enjoyable camp for at least two seasons called Cape Cod Sea Camps out on Cape Cod [Massachusetts].  That's where I learned how to sail.  And so, that, yeah, and I really enjoyed that a lot, but, yeah, I never had a kind of uniforms or regimented Boy Scout-like activity.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it seemed like you had enough, you know, some significant outdoor time?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I think so, yeah, for sure.
Story_ID: 22840
Speaker 1: And you said you got interested in bird-watching when you were in the sixth or seventh grade?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it wasn't the kind of thing that you shared easily with your sixth grade colleagues.  You can imagine, bird-watching doesn't have the kind of ring that, you know, weight-lifting or motorcycle riding would have.  But, yeah, a neighbor, a neighbor took me bird-watching, probably when I was, you know, nine, ten, eleven.  And, yeah, I just really, it, it really clicked.  I was amazed at all of the stuff you could see right in the backyard.  That neighbor has probably long since stopped bird-watching (laughter).  And so it's just funny, this sort of chance encounter.  But I was really impressed with, you know, when you get a, you know, you can look, see something clearly through the binoculars, it really clicks and you can see the picture of what you're looking at in your field guide.  That's a really interesting experience because it's sort of like you can see, knowledge accumulating in real time.  I mean this is, okay, I've identified this species that I never knew was there.
Speaker 1: So is, did it kind of like open up a hidden world to you?
Speaker 2: I think it did.  I mean, you know, I quickly became a, you know, a devout, sort of a devout bird-watcher.  I would wake up six o'clock, you know, get out of the house, walk around the neighborhood, see what was around, keep notes as to what I saw.  You know, it's very, I, I think a lot of, of young boys in particular, are kind of attracted to this sort of activity.  I mean it's kinda like stamp collecting or collecting of anything.  It's, you can sort of tick things off your list and so that was, that sort of, that pattern, I would say settled in pretty early on.  Again, it wasn't something I readily shared with my grade school friends, but I did eventually find a, sort of a community in New York City that kind of validated (laughter) this, this sort of, this sort of behavior.  So I realized I wasn't, I wasn't crazy.
Speaker 1: Okay, what birds were you surprised to find in your neighborhood that you didn't know were there?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a very vivid memory of this bird called, it was, at the time called the Yellow-shafted Flicker.  It's now called the Northern Flicker.  It's a type of woodpecker.  And it looks, for all practical purposes, like a clown.  It's got spots on the breast.  It's got a black, sort of mustache.  It's got this sort of red chevron on the back of the neck, and it's just something like patched together, like, you know, what kind of, what kind of collage is this?  And I was really, you know, it's one of these birds that you see in the field guide, and you're like, well, I'm never gonna see that.  It's, it's too rare, it's too gaudy, it's too crazy looking, gotta go somewhere else to see it.  And then when you actually see it in your backyard, that's pretty extraordinary.  And so that was a very vivid memory.  We had a, had a couple feeders around the house, and occasionally, would get some really interesting stuff.  I mean Evening Grosbeaks, which is this big finch that has a big conical bill, only come around in wintertime.  And that's, I think today, even more so, it'd be a pretty special bird for sort of northern New York City.  And so you had the sense of what was common, what was rare, and, you know, it was very clear that the more you looked, the more you would see.  And so, you know, that's sort of how it got started.
Story_ID: 22841
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so now how were your grades in school?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think my grades were pretty good.  I suspect they were a little better than my brother's.  He'll probably kill me for saying that, but, yeah, no, I definitely, I definitely studied hard.  It was really in, I think, about fourth grade that I kind of, just the whole logic of actually studying for stuff kind of clicked, and I realized, you know, if you read over the book and remember stuff, you can spit it back out on the test.  And so I, I think I did, I think I did pretty well.  And we'd have the, you'd get the report-card in the mail.  You know, dad would call you into his office and sort of the moment of truth.  And I, I remember emerging from those very brief, but intense meetings, usually feeling pretty, like I'd done okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22842
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now did you and your brother hang out a lot?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you were growing up?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, we hung out a lot, got in a lot of trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, did your brother engage in bird watching too?
Speaker 2: You know, not regularly, you know.  When I was sort of getting into it, he was probably getting more interested in the girls (laughter) and so.  But later in life, we have definitely bonded over bird watching.  He's all, he's definitely above average awareness of what's around and he now tells stories about the birds coming to his feeder right in front of his bedroom which he can watch, watch, watch from his bedroom.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, what was he interested in growing up, similar things or different things or--
Speaker 2: He was interested in lots, he, he, he loved to organize things.  He was always on the student events committee or he loved to organize concerts and dances and all that sort of thing.  And so he was probably a little more people oriented than I was.  And in college he majored in government, but he actually took time off, at least once, maybe twice during college to start a business he had.  And that business was focused on making films and videos for educational institutions.  Initially, it was sort of a, a documentary type of film business that he started with a high school buddy.  But it quickly morphed into a much more ambitious company for facilitating all manner of activities at, at higher educational schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your sister, now, you, you have a sister that's, she's right behind you, right--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --in terms of order.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she's living out in Seattle now.  She also went to school in Manhattan, and was more, again, perhaps a little more people oriented.  I mean she majored in anthropology in college.  We, all three of us went to Harvard, and my brother was a gov[ernment] major, my sister was an anthro[pology] major, and then she went to Wharton Business School [at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], after a couple years' break.  And now, she's working with Microsoft in Seattle, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just thought I'd ask about 'em, you know, 'cause sometimes we do these interviews, and we don't even, you know, you've got like brothers and sisters in the same household.  And you know they're interacting and doing things, but it never comes up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--
Speaker 1: --here, how they interacted.
Speaker 2: --my brother and I were the typical kind of hecklers.  I owe my sister a lifelong apology (laughter) for, but, but we, we, we survived.
Story_ID: 22843
Speaker 1: Okay, now, okay, so when you were, I guess about in the eighth grade, as you're finishing elementary school, your, your mother [Delores Kerrick] passed away, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  Yeah, so it was seventy--I think I was twelve.  And, yeah, yeah, very, very tough.  She [Edwards' mother, Delores Kerrick] was always very encouraging to me, and, yeah, it was just, it seemed like this, part of your life just got ripped, ripped out too early.  It was really, very sad.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's just--the household is your father and you and your siblings and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We--you know, my brother and I, my brother was actually off to boarding school.  All three of us went to Phillips Exeter Academy which is a boarding school in New Hampshire.  And so, in some ways I think my sister may have had it the hardest because she was at home, you know, having to, you know, do a lot of what mom had done before that.  But it was, I think mitigated a little bit by going away to school at an early age.  So, you know, both my brother and I were out of the house by the time we were thirteen, fourteen.  And, and, you know, I think that was probably challenging for my dad [Adrian Edwards], but, but he felt this was, you know, the best he could do for his kids in terms of education.  And, and I feel very, very fortunate to have attended Exeter.  It's just a fabulous, fabulous school.
Speaker 1: Now, Phillips Exeter is in, where was it?
Speaker 2: It's in Exeter, New Hampshire--
Speaker 1: Exeter, New Hampshire, okay.
Speaker 2: --which is about, just an hour north of here.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah, it's, in a pretty rural part of the state, and it just really appealed to me. Great friends, great environment.
Story_ID: 22844
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so this is your high school experience.  Now, were there, I heard, now, I have a note here that your high school biology teacher was important.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Rich Aronnian (ph.).
Speaker 2: That's right, okay.  Yeah, how did you know that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  They have it here.  And he was a Birder.
Speaker 2: That's right, and he's still around.  In fact, I teamed up with him for a Christmas bird count last Christmas, and so he's still teaching at Exeter.  And he's been up here to see the collection, and to learn about what I do.  He's brought teachers up here.  So it's been really fun to get back together with him.  And he was very inspiring when I was a student.  I actually didn't take his ornithology class.  I think it had to do when it was offered, and I actually graduated early.  I graduated in January of my senior year and went back home [to Riverdale, in the Bronx, New York].  But I did take biology from him, and, yeah, very, very inspiring, just really, really, very fortunate to have interacted with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you drawn to other subjects, other fields of study in high school? Did you have any idea that you were gonna pursue like biology or ornithology?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I loved just reading and learning about different subjects.  I don't think I was particularly hardcore science.  I mean I really enjoyed--I was taking Latin, a lot of that time.  I really enjoyed history and literature, especially.  I had a very formative english teacher, Claudia Gallant, who really opened up a whole world for me in terms of reading and, and interpreting the text, and I really owe her a lot of thanks for making me realize there's this whole layer below the everyday life that is probably very important for all of us.  And so I wasn't focused particularly on science, although I kind of took the physics and chemistry and what not.  And most of that was required.  And then when I got to college, I actually started majoring in history of science.  And so we were reading about Darwin and Ernst Haeckel, some of his intellectual descendants, and took courses in the role of science in society, nuclear power, things like that.  And it was only after I--I actually took a year off after sophomore year and then got some field experience and kind of figured out what it was that biologists actually did.  But that's when I switched to biology.  And it had been, you know, it had been in the back of my mind to become a doctor, absolutely.  I took all the prerequisites for it, and I think was, at least toying with it as a possible option up through sophomore year.  But when I came back from my year off and started junior year, I, I knew that it, it wasn't gonna be a doctor.  It was, it was gonna be something involving natural science.
Story_ID: 22845
Speaker 1: Now, okay, let me go back to high school for a minute.  And, now, what was the experience, well, you said it was a good experience at Phillips Exeter [Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire], but most people don't get a chance to go there, so what was it, what was it like, I mean really, as opposed to--
Speaker 2: Well, it's [Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire] a boarding school, so you're kind of up there on your own.  You know, and not on your own.  You've got a great community, but, you know, you live in, in, the first couple years, lived in a big dorm; second couple years, lived in a very small dorm, just twelve of us, and this really formed some very close bonds.  I'm probably more in touch with my high school buddies than I am with my college or grade school buddies.  And it's just, it's in a, a beautiful part of the state.  It's very rural.  There's the river running close to campus, and you have the seasons, of course, and it's just a really, very--I feel very, very fortunate to have had the sort of independence and just to get away from home and to be able to kind of think for yourself and, and, and you know, you know, have to kind of call your own shots to a certain extent.  That was, I think, really important.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you think that that atmosphere provided more freedom than say another experience, say if you were going to an inner-city school or going to a Catholic school or in --
Speaker 2: I'm sure it did--
Speaker 1: --New York.
Speaker 2: --if only because, you know, your, your parents were away. Yeah, and I think, it was not as if we had to, you know, (laughter) cook our own food and, you know, clean our clothes.  There was, in some ways, you know, some would argue we were coddled in, in a way.  But I do think that it, one, exposed you to a lot of different kinds of students.  I mean there were students from all over the country, and many from other countries.  And also, just the way in which you learned there, in small groups sitting around a, a table.  It wasn't the type of environment where you could hide.  You couldn't get away with not having done the reading.  I mean you were right there and had to perform.  And I thought that was really valuable.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at the school, and I don't wanna zoom past this.  Now, you're just having a class around a table.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Not fifty students--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --at desks, looking towards somebody in the front--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --but a classroom around a table.
Speaker 2: That's right, even the science classes were like that.  I mean we had labs and what not, but that sort of, I think that's what Exeter really prides itself on is this small group learning environment.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the relationship with the teacher is close.  It's gotta be close.
Speaker 2: Very close, yeah, some teachers were actually, you know, head of particular dorms, and they would have their apartments and their families right there.  And so you made some very close connections with your dorm master, and, you know, they'd have you down for milk and cookies and this sort of thing.  But, yeah, it was very, very much an extended family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, very many African American students there?
Speaker 2: More, and I think now, there's, you know, even more.  I mean it's sort of hyper-diverse now.  There were definitely other African Americans, and I felt, you know, you had this sense that you were lucky to be there.  But you really didn't have a sense that everyone was sort of privileged and had grown up with a silver spoon.  I mean it was lots of different backgrounds, many kids, locally from New Hampshire.  And so that was, that was really important.  And I mean Exeter, I would say more so than a lot of schools, has really taken the time and resources to really diversify their student body.  It's very, very gratifying.  I mean, you go there now, it's like a mini-United Nations.  I mean it's just crazy.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right, now, this is 19--you graduated in 1982.
Speaker 2: I think, well, right.  You know, no, 'cause I entered college, I entered college in fall of '81 [1981], so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I graduated probably in January of '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay, it's 1981.  So this is, the country's, this is the beginning of the Reagan [President Ronald Reagan] years, I guess. (Laughter) I guess.
Speaker 2: And so, all right, so was there any, anything particularly notable about graduation from Phillips Exeter?
Speaker 1: My graduation was, I ended up coming back for the ceremony in June, but I actually graduated in January of that year.  I'm not sure why.  I think I was, I had done all my requirements, and I was just kind of ready to do something on my own.  And so I actually went home [to Riverdale, in the Bronx, New York] and worked in a local environmental center called 'Wave Hill', which was a really fabulous experience.  And I did come back in June and went through the graduation ceremony which was a lot of fun.  But it was hard, you know, I, to this day, I guess, I guess I just didn't feel like, I felt like doing something outside of school would be more exciting, although I definitely missed my friends and sort was scratching my head, you know, why am I, why am I leaving this great place?  But in the end, I think it was a good decision.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22846
Speaker 1: All right.  So the, the place you worked was called what, Wave--
Speaker 2: Wave Hill, yes.
Speaker 1: Wave Hill, okay.
Speaker 2: It's an environmental center in Riverdale [in the Bronx, New York], fairly close to where I grew up.  And they conduct a variety of different environmental programs, taking people on bird walks.  In my case, I got an opportunity to do some research on the local ornithology that actually had been conducted in Riverdale, and for that I had to go down occasionally to the Museum of Natural History in Manhattan and look at old photographs and old notes and stuff.  And it was just a really fun experience 'cause I kind of felt I could bring a little bit of my own expertise to this project, and that it was actually useful for something.  And it was in conjunction with an exhibit that was actually put up at the time of bird paintings, and, by many famous U.S. artists.  And so my little booklet that came out was researched as part of this exhibit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what book-, booklet is this? I actually have a copy of it if you wanna see it, but it was called 'Second Sightings: A History of Ornithology in Riverdale, New York'.  As a colleague told me many years later, it was probably widely unread (laughter), but it was a, a small book that kind of compared the abundances of different bird species over the decades, in Riverdale.  It turns out there was a couple key individuals who had left a lot of notes on birds in different decades, and so, for example, this guy, Eugene Bicknell, who, after whom Bicknell's Thrush has been named, this is a thrush that lives up in the mountains in New England, he took a lot of notes and published a lot on Riverdale birds from the 1880s.  And later on, a guy named Ludlow Griscom wrote a lot about Riverdale, Riverdale birds, more from the 1950s.  And so it was just fascinating to kind of compare what these naturalists were observing at different times.  And, yeah, I mean Riverdale must be one of the best documented avifaunas in that sense.  I mean you had some really, really impression ornithologists working there over a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So, so you wrote this book, you know, that, that, during the period that you--after you graduated in January, I mean--
Speaker 1: Right, and I hesitate to call it a book.  I mean I think it was all of, maybe sixteen pages (laughter).  But it did require a lot of research, and, yeah, and it was, yeah, I was very, very proud of it.  I mean I felt like, it was just a great opportunity to, to be able to do this.
Speaker 2: Now, this is something that hadn't been done before, right?  No one had taken time to write--
Speaker 1: No one, I don't think had taken that particular angle.  I'm still hoping some smart, college student will come and do their senior thesis or who knows, maybe even a dissertation on it.  I'm not sure it ranks up there in terms of, you know, gripping world events anymore.  But, but it really is, it's fascinating.  There's so much local history.  And you also learn that New York City, you know, you might think of it as being sort of a concrete jungle, very little wildlife, but, in fact, there's amazing wildlife in different corners of the city.  And that really came to life as part of this research.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22847
Speaker 1: So all right, so, now, was there a question about where you were going to school because your brother was already at Harvard, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I applied to a bunch of different schools, mostly in New England, and honestly, I think if it had been up to me, I probably would have gone to Cornell [Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York].  I knew at the time that, even though I didn't really, I was not making a beeline for ornithology, I knew that Cornell had a great ornithology program.  And I went up there and was really, had a great interview.  I liked the fact that it as in a very rural setting up in upstate New York.  But it was not to be.  My dad said, "Son, you're going to Harvard," and again, I, and, you know, in his infinite wisdom, it's, it proved to be the right place in the long run.  But, but, yeah, it's, I, it was, I do remember being somewhat ambivalent about starting here, but it quickly became a good, a good place for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, at, now, you say you majored first in the history of science?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So after having written a little book about the history of ornithology, bird watching--
Speaker 2: Yeah. --and ornithology, and--
Speaker 1: There may have been some connection there, yeah.  I'm sure there was.  You know it sort of gave you another dimension.  I mean science was interesting, but learning about the sort of intellectual development of different periods, I mean, where did Charles Darwin get his ideas?  Who was thinking about evolution before him?  I found that really, really fascinating.
Speaker 2: And there's still the articles.  I saw something about Lamarck, who's that, the, the Frenchman--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --Lamarck--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --yeah, who had a different theory of evolution?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  Well, you know, of course, if you go to Paris [France], and you go to the zoological park, it's really, you'd, you'd think that it was Lamarck [French naturalist, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck] actually who invented evolution.  That's the, sort of their patron saint.  And so, yeah, it's, it's really fascinating to, I mean especially in a place like Harvard where there's so much in the way of libraries and books and old documents and stuff.  It's really interesting.
Speaker 2: I think we started, before we started I was quoting what I, a line I'd seen on the 'Simpson's'--old biology.  It's a disproof theory that ontogeny--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: -- recapitulates phylogeny or something like that.
Speaker 1: That's right, well, no, that's like, we were saying, that's heady stuff.  Yeah, well, Ernst Haeckel was a German biologist.  He, I think coined that phrase, and, or at least contributed to it, and, yeah, no, it's fascinating stuff, really, I was really drawn to these, the history, the development of this thought about evolutionary biology.
Speaker 2: What were some of the different ways that people looked at evolution before?  I know we always hear the, the creationists, you know --
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --their theory of how life developed.  But what were some of the competing theories?
Speaker 1: You know, there was, of course, there was Buffon [Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon], the famous French comparative anatomist.  And he would see the similarities between, you know, big ungulates, you know, rhinoceros, giraffes and sort of see the common bones between them.  People like Richard Owen, who was also a comparative anatomist in England.  He actually coined the term dinosaur, and again, remarkable ability to see the, what we now call homologies between species, similar bones.  Like our femur is homologous to the, our leg bone is homologous to the leg bones of dinosaurs and other, other groups.  But, of course, he didn't believe in, in evolution.  So it was this weird combination of seeing these similarities between species, but not going any farther than that.  And then there was Lamarck, like you mentioned, and these crazy crackpots.  This guy wrote a book called the, 'The Vestiges of Creation'.  I think it was written anonymously, but crazy mechanisms for how evolution worked, and, you know, Darwin had his influences and predecessors, but he really kind of hit the nail on the head in terms of getting the mechanism for evolutionary change.
Speaker 2: Now, correct if I'm wrong, but I think Lamarck, his theory is that there's some sort of ancestral memory or something that's carried over, I mean species will need to do something.  And then they'll remember it, and the next generation will have (laughter)--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.
Speaker 2: --will be able to think about it, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's more of a willful evolution--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like this giraffe wants to eat those leaves on the top of the tree.  Therefore, it'll just will itself up there.  And, yeah, I mean, but, you know, some, you know, research goes on.  And apparently, he also had some very Darwinian ideas as well.  And so, you could im--it's interesting to me that this question of origin of species was just such a hot topic.  I mean it obviously hadn't been explained--it was something that scientists knew, hey, if I can crack this, I could, I could, I could be famous.  And that's exactly what Darwin did.
Story_ID: 22848
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you, in researching this history, did you find any other, did you find any African American scientists in the historical record who were trying to, working on these problems and we might not know anything about today?
Speaker 2: You know, not a lot in the way of African Americans.  I mean there's definitely, I think a proud history of contributions by African Americans to biology and to science.  In, you know, and also in agriculture, for example.  And so, I mean there wasn't a lot of, I think that would, I mean there's, there's dissertations galore, I think, in that area.  There's a lot of really interesting stuff.  And, yeah, eventually, while, you know, the few years I majored in the history of science, I was sort of, I think understandably, focusing on, like the greatest hits and the ones that really made a big mark.  But I think there's, there's a lot there that should be brought out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, at some point at Harvard, and I think there was something that stressed you out and you, you took, you took a year off--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --I read that it was a, it was some interview with you that said that something happened, a test you took or something stressed you out.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Where, I'm curious where you got all these (laughter), these tidbits.  Yeah, it was organic chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tough course, you know, pre-meds chomping at the bit.  And I think that was my only 'C' during college, you know.  It just was not, for me, it just was not inspiring.  And so, yeah, it was a good pretext, I suppose to say, I wanna look, I wanna explore the, the world and take some time off.  Of course, you know, my dad [Adrian Edwards], I think understandably, was worried that I'd even come back to college.  He had had this similar experience with my brother who also took some time off.  And he, he did return.  And so, yeah, and when I showed my dad a, a letter I got from a curator at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institute, Washington, District of Columbia], saying I'd like to welcome Scott to work with us and volunteer in the ornithology division, that's when he kind of stood up and said, okay, I see you're not just gonna be twiddling your thumbs.  You'll actually be doing something substantive.  And I think he bought into it at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then you, you moved to D.C. for six months?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, and I stayed with, with some of my aunts in the D.C. area.  That was actually huge because, you know, I didn't have to pay for rent.  That said, I, I had a sort of a part-time job at the Georgetown Bagelry, which, I don't know, I would imagine is probably still there.  But I would work there a couple days a week and the go over to the Smithsonian on other days.  And so it was sort of this triangle between my aunt's place, the Bagelry, and the museum.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So how'd you like working at the Bagelry (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, (laughter), no, I think, you know, I think, it's a good experience to have.  I probably enjoyed being in the back washing dishes than sort of dealing with, you know, irate customers (laughter) and what not.  Making bagels is impressive.  I didn't do a lot of the actual making of the bagels, although I, I did help.  I mean they'd throw 'em in these big vats of boiling water and stuff.  And, yeah, I distinctly, I, I was happy to retire to the backroom and, and sort of keep the place going that way, rather than dealing with the customers 'cause, you know, you always, I, I just--you know, yeah, you know, they can be persnickety and, you know, rub you the wrong way, and so, but, but, no, it's a great, it was, I really value the experience.  I met a good buddy who, you know, was always showing me around, you know, D.C. and stuff. And so it's a good way to, I think, to hook up with the community.
Story_ID: 22849
Speaker 1: Well, now, tell us what you did at the Smithsonian?  This would have been in, what, the summer of--
Speaker 2: It was fall of '82 [1982], I think, and is that right?  Yeah, it was after sophomore year, and so it was, I believe fall of '82 [1982] or '83 [1983].  Anyway--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, so I was literally numbering bones of specimens.  You know, museums have to put catalog numbers on all the bones which required a very steady hand and small writing and just helping out with odd jobs.  I got a chance to help do some research for a exhibit that went on, it was an exhibit on the U.S. exploring expedition, which was a, a famous expedition that went out between 1838 and 1843.  It was sort of America's first foray into the age of discovery.  And that had been dominated by Europe.  And it was fascinating.  You know, we, I, I had to dig through old archives and, you know, I found this sheaf of papers with all these amazing drawings of fish that had been drawn by naturalists on that expedition.  And apparently, this collection of papers had been lost or it hadn't been really seen for decades.  And so my mentor there, a guy named George Watson was, was very impressed, and, you know, said, this, wow, this is--I can't believe we found these, these papers.  So it was a mix of different things.  And George, I remember, spent a lot of time with me.  You know, it's, you get these green college students sort of wanting to do something, and, you know, you have to think of stuff for them to do.  And George, I remember, was just very generous with his time.  And, yeah, we went over to the, the rare book division outside the Natural History Museum, and I just was so impressed with these extraordinary, beautiful volumes, you know, Audubon's [National Audubon Society] drawings, drawings from this U.S. exploring expedition.  You know, these are just priceless, and it was just, the quality of the way in which they were cared for was just very, really impressive to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, the connection you made with the Smithsonian, and did you know George Watson before or did someone at Howard [University] recommend, I mean at Harvard [University] recommend--?
Speaker 2: I, you know, I don't, I know I wrote to George probably as a, in the spring of my sophomore year.  And I don't know whether I got his name from someone here, possibly, or whether I wrote to just the ornithology department in general.  But he was the one that answered, yeah, and it was, you know, it was very impressive, to get a typewritten letter on Smithsonian [Institution] letterhead.  And so, yeah, that was, that was great.  I had a, definitely a very healthy habit of writing letters.  I think even in my freshman year, I was just bombarding the community with letters, asking about, what do you need to study going in this particular area of study?  I was writing to people at the American Museum [of Natural History, in New York], just curious about different sightings, and different questions and so I wish I had some of those letters.  I'm sure they were, you know, naive and humorous, and by, different turns.  But, you know, and, of course, maybe one out of twenty people would actually respond.  But that's, that's the whole point, right, you know, just sort of cast the net wide and (laughter) see who responds.
Speaker 1: Now, does the Smithsonian have the largest collection of bird specimens in the country or--
Speaker 2: It's, you know, I think it's not the largest in the country.  No, it's--or the world.  I mean it's a very impressive collection.  It's, I believe it's got the second largest, after the American Museum [of Natural History] in New York.  So, but it's, you know, even then it was just a global resource, and you can just walk the aisles there and just see any species you'd want.  And it was really impressive to me to, you know, there were serious people working on specimens, skeletons.  It wasn't some sort of dilettantish thing.  I mean these were really, there were pressing questions that people wanted to answer.  And that, that was really impressive to me.
Story_ID: 22850
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the trip to Hawaii, now, now, what did you do in, I mean how was that set up and why did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, so I was born in Hawaii, in Honolulu, and, yeah, I was very curious to see Hawaii and, and Hawaiian birds.  I mean you could imagine it sounded, having developed an interest in ornithology, it sounded really exotic.  And so I wrote to a guy named C. J. Ralph, who had published an article in the magazine, 'Natural History', published by the American Museum [of Natural History, in New York].  And it had amazing photos of Hawaiian forest birds, and I wrote to him saying, hey, can I come study these forest birds with you?  So the letter went to Hawaii, but it actually came back from California.  He had moved to California.  And, but nonetheless, he gave me some contacts, and I ended up, after about six months at the Smithsonian [Institute; National Museum of Natural History, in Washington, District of Columbia], flying out to Hawaii and working in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island of Hawaii.  And that was a truly transformative experience.  It was, I was living in a, a simple dorm setting.  We were at about 4,000 feet, and it sort of blew apart all my myths about what Hawaii was like.  You might imagine Hawaii as, you know, beaches and palm trees and that sort of--very tropical.  Well, this was a cold and foggy and forest that looked, you know, very un-palm tree like.  And within a week of arriving, we were, we were placed on the top--at 10,000 feet, on the top of this mountain called Mauna Kea, and we were instructed to do surveys of a particular bird called the Palila, a sort of a finch-like species.  And this was, this was it.  I mean this was amazing.  This was the kind of thing you read about in 'National Geographic' magazine.  It's an extraordinary view from up there at 10,000 feet, very interesting forests, very tight connection between the birds and the flowers and the, the, the pods that grew on these flowers.  And so, it was, again, really the first experience with outdoor field work and trying to quantify populations out of nature.  And that was really, really extraordinary for me.  A guy named Chuck Stone, sort of took me under his wing and, yeah, he, he gave me some extraordinary opportunities.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there for five months, you said?
Speaker 2: I was there for about, yeah, it must have been February to June or so.  I was, yeah, in the, on the Big Island, doing a variety of different things.  We were, we had, we were radio-tagging these big pigs to find out where they were running around in the forest.  We went over to Maui briefly.  And then, literally, a few hours before I was going to go down the hill for my flight back to California, I saw a notice on a bulletin board that was looking for a volunteer to help out with studies of seabirds on a remote Hawaiian island called French Frigate Shoals, Tern Island, which was well beyond the main eight Hawaiian islands.  It's, it's on the chain of islands leading up to Midway, where the famous World War II battle was fought.  And I talked to this guy on the phone, a guy named Bruce Ailer (ph.), who was sort of the manager out there.  And I just said, this, I can't pass this up.  This sounds amazing.  I mean they were, they were gonna fly me out there for free, spend five weeks, helping to run the place.  And so I, basically, postponed my travel and was able to visit this really remarkable refuge.  And that was, again, a really remarkable experience that still has affected my own research today.  So I finally made it to California, probably in June of that year and did additional research there which was really, really amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 22851
Speaker 1: Now, let's see, okay.  So you earned your Bachelors of Science degree from Harvard in '86 [1986], and it's in, was it in biology?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and with the emphasis on ornithology or did they have that?
Speaker 2: Not so, yeah, not so much an emphasis.  I did a senior thesis on, actually, it was on mammals, and it was sort of trying to understand the genealogical tree for a group of mammals that, a group of rodents that lived in Africa.  This was work that my mentor, at the time, a guy named Rodney Honeycutt, was conducting.  And so, so, yeah, I think, I, I, you could say my emphasis was in evolutionary biology, not necessarily ornithology in particular.
Speaker 1: Okay, you said, you mentioned Rodney Honeycutt as a mentor basically.  So he, he was your main advisor in undergraduate school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, sort of my thesis advisor.  And he had just come from the University of Michigan [in Ann Arbor, Michigan] and from Australia.  And actually, I got a tip from a guy in California at UC-Berkley [University of California, Berkeley, California], about who, at Harvard [University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts] was doing exciting research.  And so Rodney was, was there when I got back, and, yeah, it was really a fun connection to make there.
Story_ID: 22852
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, you had, you went to UC-Berkley [University of California, Berkeley, California], next, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: In '86 [1986].  So did you kind of arrange that when you were out in the, or did--I mean how, did you make connections?
Speaker 2: You know, I did, I did.  I stopped by the Museum of Urban Zoology during my travels in, in California.  I actually rode my bike from Arcadia, California down to San Francisco [California].  It took about a week, it was just fantastic.  And, yeah, I met a guy there named Jim Patton, who's very much an inspiration.  And he, he told me about Rodney [Honeycutt].  And, so I sort of had a direction to go when I got back to Harvard [University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts], and that was really, really helpful.  I mean you couldn't, I think it's pretty easy to spin your wheels a lot as an undergraduate, if you don't know which direction to go.  And so this was really, really helpful.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, so UC-Berkley.  So you start in '86 [1986].  Now, did you--a lot of the scientists we interview just go straight through for the Ph.D.  They don't really stop to even look at the master's degree, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean did you do that?  I mean did you get a master's first and--
Speaker 2: No, no, I went straight through, although I, I will say I have this real strong desire to not be in a classroom setting.  You know, after two years of, two more years of college, I applied to grad school directly from there, and the prospect was of, you know, starting another year of, you know, classes and research, just after that summer.  And I, I just didn't wanna do that.  And so, again, with Jim's help, I was able to essentially enroll as a graduate student, but I actually ended up spending most of that year in the southern hemisphere in New Guinea and Australia.  And, again, I just feel very fortunate to have done that.  It's, you know, the, at that point in my life, the world was a big place, and there was lots to see.  And I knew I would get more insight from being out there than being in a classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that sounds like, like an exciting thing to do.  So you went to New Guinea?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.  You know, New Guinea is kind of the, the Mecca for ornithology in some ways.  The famous groups of birds, like the birds of paradise are there and a lot of famous ornithologists had kind of put it on the map, people like Ernst Mayr and Jared Diamond, you know, these people worked in New Guinea.  And it, it, it really can't be surpassed in terms of just the ultimate exotic jungle experience.  And so I had to check this out, and I originally applied for a fellowship to do that through Harvard, didn't get it, ended up getting another opportunity to volunteer on a study, studying birds of paradise in New Guinea, and it as just, I was just on cloud nine.  I mean this, it couldn't get much better than this.  And so--
Speaker 1: Now, this is a bird that some people may have seen on Nova [science documentary series].  I saw it once, but a lot of people don't know what it is.  What is the bird of paradise, and--
Speaker 2: Right, so it's a group of sort of crow-like birds.  There're about forty species and nearly all of them are on the island of New Guinea.  There's a few in Australia and islands of Indonesia.  Yeah, and they're just incredibly gaudy.  I mean I can show you some in the collection here if you want.  They're, they've got extraordinary plumes.  They do these remarkable displays.  They build cleared areas in the forests, we call them lax (ph.), so they can attract females.  They're just an extraordinary example of what we call exaggerated traits, plumages, colors, feather structures that are just, clearly not for survival, much more for attracting females.  So it's a process that we call sexual selection where they're trying to basically impress the females and show their health and vigor.  And the birds of paradise have just taken this to extraordinary extreme.  And so, yeah, it's, I think many people would say that, you can die happy once you've seen a bird of paradise (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, the natives of New Guinea wear the feathers, and I've seen--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  Yeah, and I've got some old, yeah, some old pictures of--they call them sing-sings, these dances that tribes do that use these bird of paradise feathers.  It's clear that they really revere these things, very much a part of the culture.  And, yeah, it's, culturally, I mean as well, New Guineas is just, just off the map.
Speaker 1: Now, interestingly, the people of New Guinea are black--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or they, they resemble African Americans more than they resemble--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 1: --Europeans.  And you would resemble them more than any, probably any scientists that had been down there, I guess?
Speaker 2: That's true, yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: So how did they take to you?  How did you, how did you interact with them though?
Speaker 2: No, it was really interesting.  I mean, you know, if I wasn't wearing my back pack, which you normally wouldn't see a big back pack among the locals, and was just kind of minding my own business, I, I could be passed off for a New Guinean.  I mean their hair is very similar.  Many of 'em have beards.  So, in fact, many New Guineans actually thought I was from an area of New Guinea called the Markham Valley which is near the City of Lae because the people happen to be very tall there.  And so it was a really, really interesting experience.  Of course, I couldn't maintain my cover for very long.  I did learn the, the local trade language, New Guinea pidgin.  It's fairly easy to pick up.  And that opened a lot of doors for me.  Yeah, and it was really, I found it really gratifying to kind of, it definitely created a rapport that I think many Westerners wouldn't have.  I think there was definitely probably an element of trust that can develop just through the similarity of the way we looked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I thought that might be a connection there that would be interesting, that perhaps other scientists would not have.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22853
Speaker 1: In that regard too, I know you were quoted as saying at some point that they were, the black evolutionary scientists, you could count 'em on two hands or--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --or one hand maybe.  You know, there aren't that many.
Speaker 2: No, there're not that many.  I've got a, a good colleague, Paul Turner, whom I assume you'll be interviewing at some point.  He's at Yale [University, in Hartford, Connecticut] now.  And, and there are, there're, there're, there're several others.  There's, and, and I would say several in the area of zoology or behavioral ecology.  But the whole area of kind of animals and their environment, simply has not been a big magnet for African Americans.  And I think, I don't know why.  I mean I, it's, it may be similar for other areas of science as well.  But, yeah, it's, I think in environmental science, in particular, we really have a very acute problem.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you, do you run into, or do you, do you come in contact with very many African Americans who actually believe in evolution?
Speaker 2: You know, I haven't really taken stock of that too much.  I mean my dad [Adrian Edwards] and my family certainly does.  I can imagine there's perhaps a little more skepticism about evolution given the strong, you know, religious background that a lot of African Americans have grown up in.  So, it's not something I'm eager to kind of force down people's throats, but I do think it, it's, it's helpful in a lot of ways.  And it drives home the point that we're, we're in charge of this planet (laughter).  It's not, we won't, we won't have--no breaks for us because of the Big Guy upstairs, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I've always been surprised at the resistance to the idea from-though, though it's not like the fundamental, the white fundamental Christians where they actually campaign actively to, to get evolution, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --removed from the classroom.  But many black teachers in which the, probably the highest percentage of black professionals, you know, this isn't scientific, just observationally, they don't seem to really embrace it or they're ambivalent about it.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: They feel, you know, like it's not, you know, something they should necessarily embrace.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, and, you know, there's a lot of--in many ways evolution was turned against them for decades, you know.  So, in that sense it's understandable they would have an aversion to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, what's that book, 'The Negro A Beast', written--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the turn of the century by a pseudo-scientist.  And--
Speaker 2: And 'The Mismeasure of Man', that's a famous book by Stephen Jay Gould, yeah, I mean--
Speaker 1: --where he chronicles that, that type of, yeah,--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --he chronicles that type of--
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, it's, yeah.  There's a lot of forces, I think, that are conspiring to keep African Americans less accepting of evolution.
Speaker 1: And science for many years was turned in that direction. That's right, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, now, you would have to read some of the, I guess the old, you know, biological texts and anthropological texts, I know and old encyclopedias, their descriptions of black people that are just--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's, and, you know, (laughter) remarkably, in some areas, I would say of modern science, particularly evolutionary--, this field called evolutionary psychology, I think there's some remarkably naive interpretations of the African American experience.  So in various forms, it's, it's, it's still with us in some ways.  And so the challenge, of course, is to get people to kind of accept the theory and the structure it provides, and, rather than the specific examples or interpretations that people put on it.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, is there, as far as you know, is there any African American-based organization even that deals with, that talks about evolution and, and natural science and--
Speaker 1: Well, there's ABRCMS [Annual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students] which is the, sort of a national society for biomedical science for minorities.  And they don't focus on evolution by any means.  They're much more focused towards biomedicine.  But they do, they do--evolutionary studies figure in the meetings that they have.  And I would, I'm almost certain that they would endorse evolution.  I mean you pretty much have to as a biologist.
Story_ID: 22854
Speaker 1: Would it, could we have modern medicine without a belief in evolution?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, I think, I think great strides have been made that weren't necessarily--for which evolution wasn't required.  But now we're realizing that there's a lot of modern problems and issues that really can't be solved without evolution.  So, for example, these bacterial strains that suddenly grow to be resistant to antibacterial compounds.  I mean it's, it's evolution that's causing that process, and it's gonna be comparative evolutionary studies that help us understand how to control it.  And so, it, different domains of biology can get away with ignoring evolution to different extents, I think.  But particularly, when some phenomenon involves populations or spread of new adaptations that might arise, often in, in microorganisms, that's when you pretty much have to think in evolutionary terms to make any headway there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, just thought I'd ask about that.
Story_ID: 22855
Speaker 1: And so, now, UC-Berkley, now, what did you focus on for your dissertation?
Speaker 2: I, I studied [at the University of California, Berkeley, California] a group of song birds in Australia, actually, called babblers, and so my dissertation was a population genetics study--part of a new field that was called phylogeography.  And that's where we use genetic markers, DNA [deoxyribonucleic acid] markers, to trace the movement of individuals and populations over the landscape.  And so my dissertation involved a number of field trips to collect samples for analysis, and it also involved a lot of lab work, sequencing DNA which was really a, a very new thing at the time.  There'd just been, new methods for rapidly sequencing DNA had just arisen and, yeah, so it was a very exciting time to apply these new approaches to, excuse me, to an interesting geographical problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear)--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, these birds are also great in the field.  They, they run around in groups.  They're very social.  And--
Speaker 1: Is that why they're called 'babblers'?
Speaker 2: Babblers, yeah, they talk a lot.  And so, yeah, and again, that was a tip from an ornithologist that I met at a meeting in, I think '86 [1986].  And I sort of asked him, hey, what's, give me a group of birds that's fairly common, easy to find, but has an interesting geographic distribution.  And Babblers were the trick.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so were you studying babblers in New Guinea when you were there?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: I know you did a bird of paradise study when you--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --got there.  So did you go, you didn't, you didn't go back to study the Babblers or--
Speaker 2: I did.  I, after I worked with the birds of paradise, I was able to travel around a bit.  There's only one species, it turns out, of babbler in New Guinea.  And I didn't see it.  And I've actually never seen it.  But I did go to Australia after New Guinea, and, and got my start collecting samples and, really sort of doing field work on my own.  And that was, that was really important.  And then later on in my dissertation, I, I did return to New Guinea, not to look at this one endemic species, but it turns out the very widespread Australian species actually has a population in southern New Guinea, and so we were looking at that.  And so, so, yeah, those were actually my only two trips to New Guinea.  I, I, I hope to return soon, but it's, it was a really, really great opportunity for a dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22856
Speaker 1: Now, how does evolutionary biology work?
Speaker 2: Evolutionary biology is a very diverse field.  You know, its basic question is how did the diversity of life on earth arise?  That's a pretty tall order, you know.  You're talking, what, twelve million species maybe and, so, but it's basically focused on the mechanisms by which new species arise, the mechanisms by which animals and plants and fungi and other things come to have the appearance that they do, what we call the phenotype.  And it combines a wide diversity of tools, everything from molecular biology to field studies, to physiology and anatomy.  It's a very multi-disciplinary field.  Much of evolutionary biology takes place outside of museums, but there's also a lot of evolutionary research done in museums.  And so, this museum, you know, called the Museum of Comparative Zoology [at Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts] is--that word 'comparative' really tells you that its main focus is evolutionary biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22857
Speaker 1: And there's a question here, how does one prepare to be an evolutionary biologist?
Speaker 2: There's lots of different routes.  I think the challenge is to pick out your favorite sub-discipline, within that to get your studies started.  Evolutionary biology rests very much on the basic sciences, so everything from physics and chemistry to basic biology.  It's also a very close cousin to ecology, and so I think to become an evolutionary biologist, you wanna get a, a very broad background in biological sciences.  These days, you know, there's a lot of work to be done by computer scientists who are studying evolutionary biology through the computer.  So, if you actually, if you happen to have a good background in computer science, you would be welcome to any number of labs that are studying evolutionary biology.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22858
Speaker 1: All right.  I asked, we mentioned before the book, 'The Mismeasure of Man,' and I was asked to ask you about that, in specific, because of its implications, its racial implications.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yeah, I mean it's, you know, you'd like to think we were beyond that, that period, although remarkably, it, it still raises its ugly head in various forms.  I mean what was this book, called the, 'The Bell Curve'--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --you know, published by a Harvard psychologist.  So everyone's always trying to focus on the, the--and interpret the differences between humans.  But evolutionary biology is, I think, exciting because a lot of it is focused on the similarities.  I mean what makes us similar.  And so, you know, a lot of people would be surprised to learn that humans as a species are genetically very similar to each other, even Africans versus Asians, versus Caucasians from Europe.  I mean we have so few genetic differences.  I can go into the backyard, and any backyard snake or rat will have far more genetic diversity than humans would.  And so I think evolutionary biology for me is exciting in that way, and we tend, we often focus on the similarities between individuals and species rather than the differences.  Of course, the differences are, are what makes it exciting, but it's, you know, and it's very challenging to--you know, I would say defining the characteristics of an organism that you wanna study.  That's in some ways the most challenging part.  How do you define intelligence?  I mean I would say it's, it's a very difficult thing to do.  And so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I even hear with, well, animal intelligence, I know they're constantly redefining where that is because, you know, they, at one time I heard that a pig was smarter than another animal--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then, you know, and a dog was way down on the list-- Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: --and, you know, but when humans interact with animals, it's usually a dog. Right, exactly (laughter).
Speaker 1: And the chimp is closer to us, but, and yet, chimps don't respond well to human beings--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 1: --you know, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, well, I don't know if intelligence is necessarily a, it shouldn't necessarily be a human-centric trait, right?  I mean there's all sorts of intelligence out there, and, you know, the fact is most species on the planet have been here a lot longer than the human species has, and so maybe just persistence time is the best measure of intelligence (laughter), you know.  If we're lucky enough not to extinguish ourselves, then maybe we can be considered intelligent (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it's a subjective measurement, I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I mean I'm not a psychologist, but you can't, I'm very skeptical of certain universal measures of intelligence, I would say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would have to be, you'd have establish a standard based on something that, you know--I mean that's the only way to qualify it, I guess--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you'd have to say, well, intelligence based on this--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --factor or that factor.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And, you know, so, yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean it's, it's, yeah, it's just, it's just very difficult to characterize mental and, you know, to sort of (unclear) of behavioral traits.  I mean it's not, not impossible.  I mean you can measure how much an animal moves or how deep a burrow it can dig or how, whether it migrates or not.  Those are things that you can quantify, but I think one of the things about evolutionary biology and, and sort of science in general that I like is that, you know, you have to, you can't speculate based on a little bit of data.  You have to interpret the facts that you collect in a way that's commensurate with those facts.  You can't just begin to speculate.  And so what you can talk about in terms of a conclusion of a study is dependent on what you measure and, and, and what you can confidently measure.  And so, in that sense, you know, there's some characteristic of animals which I would say are much easier to talk about and discuss than others.
Story_ID: 22859
Speaker 1: And what, what does race mean to an evolutionary biologist? Well, that's a great question.  I think race is, you know, the defining characteristic of human diversity in, in some ways.  Now, many evolutionary biologists today would say that race is a social construct.  It's something that doesn't necessarily exist there, but it's sort of a tool that we use to categorize humans.  And you can think of race as the, you know, social dimensions, political dimensions.  I tend to think of it in terms of biological dimensions.  And I think that race is, is, is a fascinating aspect of, of the human phenotype.  I do believe that racial differences exist in humans.  I mean I think, you know, different populations look different.  Now, you know, the issue becomes, well, how different are they?  Is it their differences that are bigger than their similarities?  Those are other questions, I would say.  But race is, it's a, it's a hot topic.  I mean how did human diversity come about?  I think many Americans and, and Westerners would be surprised, you know, if you told them that, you know, humans originated in Africa and then spread across the globe.  I'm, I'm not sure, I don't have a good sense of how widely accepted that is by the general public.  But I just think it's, it's just a slam dunk in terms of, you know, an interesting story, kind of turning the tables, if you will, on, you know, the priorities in human history.  I think it's very, it should make us proud, I think, as African Americans, that humanity originated in Africa.  And it's, although I'm not sure that, that fact would necessarily be pleasing to, to everyone (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, now, is race, are racial traits analogous to differences in say, wobblers or something or, you know, in terms of color and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You know, if you think of race as, one aspect of race, you know, being skin color, or, you know, morphology, shape, size of different human populations, I would say absolutely.  There's, we can look at any species of animal or plant and see that individuals differ across geography.  Now, you know, I think there's lots of other dimensions of race, that that particular line of study doesn't address.  But, and there's also the important that, you know, genetics doesn't necessarily map onto race, in a one-to-one fashion.  In other words, it's not as if all the genetic variations in Africans is distinct from the genetic differentiation, genetic diversity in Caucasians or Asians or whatever.  So this mapping of genetic diversity to racial differences is not precise by any means.  But, you know, I know this, this may sound demeaning, but, you know, humans differ across geography in many of the same ways that we see in other organisms.  And that makes it all the more interesting.  You know, anthropology kind of developed in many ways as sort of a separate science outside of evolutionary biology.  It was, you had zoology departments and you had anthropology departments.  And, you know, even, you know, obviously we treat the study of humans, you know, I think appropriately as a special area of study.  But, it's also clear that, you know, you can study humans in many of the exactly the same ways that we study other species.  And I actually think humans become more interesting when we comp--especially compare them to other species and ask how, how we're different and how we're similar.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now, the, I know creationist argue for the special, that humans are special, and then there're all the rest of the animals.  But in what ways are human different, I mean from the rest of the biological world?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we've, we, we have an extraordinary record of constructing our own environment.  I mean, just look around you, buildings, agriculture, cities.  You know, we've modified the surface of the earth more so than any species really.  We're obviously special in terms of the degree to which we can cooperate, armies, governments, sports, you know, the, the exquisite detail with which we can work together towards a common end I think is, is pretty unprecedented.  And, you know, the question really is, is this a question of, you know, a qualitative difference or just a question of degree.  And I, I, I probably couldn't answer that, but there's no question that humans are extraordinary in, in many, many respects.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 22860
Speaker 1: So after your dissertation, UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]--I mean UC-Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley] in the [San Francisco] Bay Area, now, you did a post-doctoral, a post-doc at, you're a post-doctoral fellow for the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in, at University of Florida [in Gainesville, Florida].
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1992?
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that was a, that was a really fun, interlude.  By then I had met my wife-to-be, Beth, and we, we met at Berkeley, and so we drove out to, from Berkeley to Florida, all the way across the country.  And we lived in a very comfortable, little, low-slung house.  It was on about seven acres of land.  We were paying [$]500 a month for this, and a swimming pool thrown in.  I mean it was just, it was like eye-opening after how expensive California was to have this sort of rural luxury.  And so it was a very formative two years, worked with some great people.  You know, not without its, it was, it's definitely a, a different culture, I would say than the west or the northeast.  You know, you saw your fair share of confederate flags hanging.  But, overall, people were extraordinarily nice.  We never had any problems at all, either me as an African American, or us as an interracial couple, just, yeah, interesting place, interesting food and customs.  And, but never, never, never any negative relationships, any negative incidents.
Story_ID: 22861
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what kind of work were you working on?
Speaker 2: Well, there, yeah, I was, I had become intrigued with a group of genes that are very variable.  Their, and their main role is to defend ourselves against disease.  And so when we get infected by a bacterium, these genes, they're called major histocompatibility genes.  They all basically encode these receptors, and these receptors will bind onto fragments of a bacteria when they infect you.  And when they're bound, then that's when your immune system can start to combat them.  And so, I was really, really intrigued by how variable these genes were and their role in disease resistance, and it turns out they also had been suggested to actually play a role in how animals choose their mates.  And so, some studies by the people I worked with had shown that female mice would tend to choose mates, tend to choose male mice that were different from them at these particular genes.  And you might ask, well, why would, why would that be?  And it turns out that the more variable individuals are at these genes, the better they can combat disease.  And so it might make sense then for a female to choose a male that was different because their offspring then would be quite different.  And so, just this whole connection between the, the genes and the behavior and the ecology was really, really fascinating to me, quite--it was a big change from what I did my dissertation on.  It was made even more so because I, my post-doc was at a medical school.  I mean it was a very different culture.  But it was still a very, very enlightening place to work.
Speaker 1: So, so, so you were working in the University of Florida Medical School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was in a small center called the Center for Mammalian Genetics-
Story_ID: 22862
Speaker 1: So, it [Edwards' post-doctoral fellowship at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, Florida] was in a medical school, and, yeah, it was a very different culture, and very different environment.  But they knew stuff, a lot of stuff that I didn't know, and so I learned a lot from, from them.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, you worked with Wayne Potts and Ward Wakeland?
Speaker 1: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and I still keep in touch with them.
Speaker 2: Were they M.D.s or biology--?
Speaker 1: Ward Wakeland, I'm pretty sure he was an M.D.  He's probably an M.D., Ph.D.  Wayne was a Ph.D.  And he was sort of working closely with Ward Wakeland.  And so, yeah, it was a really, really great combination of advisors.
Story_ID: 22863
Speaker 1: Okay. And the, the land that you were on.  That sounds like it would be a great place for a biologist to be, you know, in Florida, you know, on seven acres?
Speaker 2: I know, oh, it was fantastic.  We had all manner of cool wildlife on the property and woods and lots of, you know, cycads and weird plants and stuff.  So, yeah, northern Florida is a really interesting place.  You know, there are dugongs running around and--
Speaker 1: A dugong is like a porpoise or something, right, similar--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's sort of like a cow relative that feeds on sea grass, and, yeah, it's a, yeah.  And so, you know, fascinating to be canoeing in these slow-moving rivers where the dugongs spend the winter and, yeah, just really, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, I mean manatees is probably the name that is more, yeah, more used for the Florida, the Florida species.  But very similar to dugongs.  They're just, you know, they're the representative in the southern hemisphere.
Speaker 1: Okay, those are animals that hardly anybody else would be able to see--
Speaker 2: Sorry?
Speaker 1: Now, those are animals that none of us would be able to see unless we're in Florida, right, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, they're pretty easy to see.  I'm sure they have lots of tours to take, and you can, you know, and you can see them in the marine areas off the beach, or in the wintertime, you can see them in, more of the sheltered areas inland, but, yeah, really, and they're big.  You know, they're six, eight feet, yeah, really big animals.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, would Florida have more bird species, say than New York?
Speaker 2: Lots of birds down there, yep.  Yep, amazing wildlife refuges with herons and egrets and spoon bills, and, you know, lots of really interesting species that we wouldn't get up North for sure.
Story_ID: 22864
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you left in 1994 and became Assistant Professor of Zoology at the University of Washington [in Seattle, Washington], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And the Curator of Genetic Resources at the university's Burke Museum.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, now, well, tell us about the Burke Museum?  That's, it's, it's a unique place from what I understand. It's a great place, yeah.  It sort of specializes in northwest coast, Native American life, cultural life, and also biology.  And, yeah, it was a really great opportunity to, to move to that part of the country.  I never lived there before, and it's a really unique part of the country, just the environment and the wildlife there and, yeah, the Burke [Museum] was a very great place to begin a research program.  They've got extraordinary collections, and they've, they also had a world-class zoology department which later turned into a biology department.  And so, and just an extraordinary group of faculty there, lots of very prominent areas like fisheries and oceanography that you might not get on a lot of campuses.  So there is a--very much an orientation outdoors, I mean the, in the northwest environment, there's just so many interesting things to, that bring you out, looking at the external environment.
Speaker 2: So you were there about, about nine years, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: It went by quickly.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this like set the tone for the job you have now, I mean as a professor and as a curator?
Speaker 1: Yes, absolutely, yeah.  I've always tried to stay close to a, a collection.  I think collections are really, really important as sort of historical records of species, but also then environments and habitats.  And so it was a great, it really kept--the Burke really kept my connection to museums there.  And I think it was really helpful in, in moving to Harvard [University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts] as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22865
Speaker 1: All right, now you did, you came to Harvard [University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts] in 2003--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and assumed a position as Professor in Organismic and Evolutionary Biology.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's a mouthful.
Speaker 1: Organismic (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right, in evolutionary biology as well as the curator of ornithology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology-- That's right.
Speaker 2: --where we are.
Speaker 1: That's right, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, how do you divide your time, pretty much?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, like every professor, I, I do a lot of teaching.  So I'll teach both undergraduates and graduate students.  This semester, we're doing a class in the area of biology called comparative genomics, which, again, how do we compare different species by looking at their, their genomes and their DNA?  And when I'm not teaching, I'm doing research, helping students with their research.  Lately, I've been spending a lot of time just on a lot of external committees, different kinds of government panels and conferences and doing quite a lot of, of traveling.  But, yeah, so it's, and, of course, there's a lot of stuff going on at Harvard [University] in terms of mentoring students, helping with programs to promote diversity in the sciences.  It's a very dynamic place, and there's, there's lots to, lots to do.
Story_ID: 22866
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what are some of the, what are some of the, I guess, curiosities in some way, in the collections.  There are some things that, you have some objects that belonged to Charles Darwin here, and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --some--
Speaker 2: I think we might have a few, we may have a few specimens from Darwin.  We certainly have famous specimens by people like John James Audubon, Jared Diamond, Ernst Mayr, people like that.  Yeah, it's, there's certainly a lot of curiosities, but I think it's important to mention that collections are really about variation and about history.  And so, this collection in particular, I think is pretty important for the many individuals will often have from the same species.  And so, again, we were talking about human races before.  We've got lots of examples of what we call geographic variation within any number of species.  And so, for example, the American Robin.  Everyone's seen a robin.  You know, they'll breed from sea level all the way up above, to 8,000 feet in the mountains of the Rockies.  And so there's a lot of variation that you see that accompanies that, the environmental variation, and so--
Speaker 1: So the robins will look different?
Speaker 2: Oh, they look different, yeah.  They're bigger, darker, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are they bigger in the mountains than they are at lower--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.  They tend to, there's a lot of morphological variation.  You know, we also see patterns like in, sort of more human environments, like, you know, the Pacific Northwest or, or a forested area, you tend to get much darker and more melanistic individuals than you would say in a desert area.  And it's an old rule called Gloger's Rule and scientists don't really understand why it happens yet.  And I think there's a lot of exciting opportunities for using modern technology to look at some of these century-old questions out there.
Speaker 1: It would seem to me if you were colorful in the desert, you'd stand out more (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's certainly, that's, that, that's a good, excuse me, that's the adaptive explanation.  But what's the mechanism?  I mean how do populations become lighter and darker?  That's, I think, an equally interesting problem.  And even so, you know, evolutionary biologists are very, sort of a skeptical group.  If you glibly try to explain that matching through, say, camouflage or getting away from predators, trust me, there's probably five other explanations that you really would have to rule out before you could say, this is why I think it's happening.

Speaker 1: Okay, oh, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about this.  In terms of skin color, what, what is the evolutionary motive force behind skin, skin color?  What, what, why are some people darker than others?
Speaker 2: I mean there's issues of vitamin D uptake.  There's issues of ultra violet protection, and, you know, I think we'd like to think that everything about humans is sort of ordained.  But, you know, through most of our history we had to struggle to survive just like every other lowly animal and plant.  And so, you know, I think there are solid adaptive explanations for a lot of human phenotypic diversity.  Now, what those traits are doing now, in this very changed and, you know, in many ways, human-constructed world, is an interesting question.  Is there--is the force of natural selection being relaxed on modern human populations?  Well, it very well, may well be, but that, too, is a really fascinating area of study, 'cause we can--with humans, you know, we can study these things in such detail 'cause we have all, the entire sequence of letters in your genome.  We can really look at these things with, with a laser light.
Speaker 1: Okay.
