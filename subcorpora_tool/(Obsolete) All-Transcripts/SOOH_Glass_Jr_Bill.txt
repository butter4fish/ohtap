 Little Thunder  Glass  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday,  February 16,  2011 . I   m interviewing Bill Glass for the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project, which is sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral  Histories Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re  outside of Locust Grove in Bill   s house. Bill, you originally became  known for your beautifully glazed pottery and ceramic sculpture. You   re  now moving in some new directions. You   ve been designated a Living  Treasure by the Cherokee Nation, and I want to thank you for taking the  time to speak with me.  Thank you.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tahlequah. At the time, my dad worked with the Bureau of  Indian Affairs, but he was a welding instructor at Haskell  Indian  Nations University in Lawrence, Kansas . So we lived at Haskell for  about eight years after I was born. Then he wanted to follow the chain  and try to get promotions through the Bureau, so we went to Fort  Defiance,  Arizona , stayed there for a couple years, then we went to  Flagstaff, and stayed there for about four years. Then we went to  Tohatchi, New Mexico, and I went to high school and junior high in  Gallup. We came back and he ended his career at Concho Boarding  School outside of El Reno, OK.  Living different places in and out of state, what are your earliest  memories of art?  My earliest memories were my mom doing things. She was kind of the  artist of the family. She could draw and do things for church. Posters.  She was very creative. She could sew and she was the one that inspired  me to be creative. I think that   s the deal   you get your creative bug. I  feel like it   s also a gift. When you   re born, you kind of get something  5  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  and then you realize it. At some point, you realize it.  When did that realization happen for you?  Well, I was in college at Central State University there in Edmond, and I  got involved in some art classes as electives. I was in the ceramics  department in the drawing part. Then T.C. Cannon and Sherman  Chaddlesone came and enrolled down there. And once I saw their  work   they were leaving the Institute to get their degrees at Central  State   and once I saw what they were doing, I decided that I   d go to the  Institute. So  I   m  kind of a late bloomer, really, because I was already  in my twenties, early twenties. After I saw what they were doing, after  leaving the Institute, I decided to go from Central State to the Institute.  I want to back up just a minute, and then we   ll come back to the  Institute. What kind of art experiences did you have in public school, in  the primary and secondary schools?  None.  No classes at all?  No.  Were you interested in drawing at that point?  I was always a doodler, and I always could kind of do things with my  hands, too. But I wasn   t really thinking about art. I wasn   t really  thinking about much of an art career at that time. I wasn   t concentrating  on it.  When did you see your first example of Indian art? Would it have been  with T.C.?  No, my first example I remember was when we lived out at Fort  Defiance. We   d go to the tribal fair, Navajo Tribal Fair at Window  Rock. I remember one time   I was still fairly young   and I remember  walking into the exhibition building and seeing a huge Navajo rug  hanging on the end of that building. It almost took the whole end of that  building to display it. And it was just overpowering to think that  somebody could actually make that. I think that was my first time  where I really thought,    Man, somebody made something that beautiful  and with that much intricacy.    I still remember that. In my mind, that  probably was the very first thing that I remember as artwork.  I read that when you went to Central State, you were planning to go into  6  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  computers, and you ended up taking a ceramics class. Was that the class  that Sherman and T.C. Cannon were taking?  No, they weren   t taking any of the classes I was taking. They were just  coming down there, right at the end of a semester. And I had to decide  what I wanted to do, either to stay there or move on. I told one of my  professors that I was starting to have inclinations into art, and he said  that maybe I should consider the Institute, and I started checking it out.  Then I made that decision to go. Connie   s cousin was working for IBM  at the time, and this is back when IBM was still punch cards and all that.  But early on, I had a job interview. So, I had to decide. Do I want to  jump in here and try to do this? Or do I want to become an artist? So, I  chose art. I don   t know. I   m glad now, but that was a big choice.   Were  you and Connie already married?  We were already married and had our daughter, Tara. She was with us  when we went to the Institute.  What was that when you first got there?  Back in that time, Rhode Island School of Design was managing it, was  in charge of it. And I never realized what the art profession really could  be, or being around a bunch of artists could be like. I just enjoyed it. It  was the student body and friends you made. But they knew they only  had you for two years. That was a two-year deal, so they were there to  try to let you find your own direction is what they always said.    Develop  your own style.    They knew they just had you for a short span, so they  wanted you to try to work towards some style if you could. That was the  goal. I always felt I was lucky to get there before Allan Houser retired.  And I got to be a student of his while I was there, so that was good  fortune for me.  You took sculpture from Allan?  Yes, and my ceramics teacher was named Ralph Pardington. The two  studios were close to each other, just next door to each other. So, that  was real convenient, too.  Were those the areas that you gravitated towards from the beginning,  ceramics and sculpture?  Yes, and I took some drawing classes, some basic design things that  most of us do. But at that time, too, you could just do studio all day. You  didn   t have to have other classes if you didn   t want. You could be in the  ceramics studio or the sculpture studio all day. I thought that was cool,  7  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  because coming from a college setting where you had to take  requirements, there was very few requirements, because they knew they  just had you for that short time. They wanted to let you get connected  with your medium. So, it was really nice.  You mentioned good friendships that you made. Who were some of the  friends you made while you were at the Institute?  Well, I was lucky in that part, too. Mike Romero, he   s a Santa Clara,  Taos guy. He   s a good painter. Mike Zillioux, he   s from Gila River. So  they were painters, and then Doug Hyde happened to still be there.  Clifford Fragua, he was a classmate, and Earl Biss was there. Just  happened that when I got there, there was still some older guys,  because I was a little older, too. I wasn   t just an eighteen year old guy.  There was some older guys my own age and everybody kind of fit in.  After that first semester, after that first year, those older guys had to  leave, some of them did. They were just hanging on and wanting to be  artists, so they kind of got rid of some of them.  You  had  spent some time in New Mexico previously. Did you consider  staying there after you graduated?  I did. I thought about that for a while, and I just   I think Connie wanted  to get back to Oklahoma. I could have probably enjoyed staying around  there, and a lot of the student body did stay, and became the next group  of artists to come through.  When you came back to Oklahoma, the Indian art scene was starting to  take off. Do you remember what it was like? When did you leave the  Institute?  I left the Institute in    75, and then I came back and I worked for the  Cherokee Nation for about two years, or two and a half years, as a field  worker out in the Cherokee community, setting up arts and crafts  classes. I did that, but then I felt like I was drawn back to my own work,  instead of working for somebody. I wanted to do my own artwork. So in  about    78, I became a full time artist. That was still at the end of what  I   d call the turquoise craze when turquoise jewelry was popular, so that  kind of helped. When you   d go to the art shows, there was a good  following at that time. It was a good time to try to break in because you  could make some sales and stuff. There still was a nice popularity for  Indian art.  When you were working for Cherokee Nation, you weren   t necessarily  just teaching ceramics or sculpture     8  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  No. The community could   I gave them a list of classes they could take  or could request. Whatever they requested, I   d provide the teacher and  the materials, and we   d set up a six-week class for them. Basketry and  beading. We even had leather making, leather tooling.  Do you remember when you sold your first, what you   d consider a major  piece? Were you selling a little bit after you graduated from the  Institute?  Actually, my first sale of what I   d consider a major piece was while I  was still a student at the Institute. I entered the Heard  Museum  show,  and they bought one for their permanent collection. The next year, I  entered at Philbrook and they bought a nice piece. It got first place in  sculpture and it sold. Those were two pieces that I did while I was still a  student at the Institute. One was a stone carving, one was a ceramic. I  thought it was going to be a nice occupation, because I didn   t know   much about the ups and downs .  A great auspicious beginning.  Yeah. (Laughter)  So once you decided to make that transition to doing art full time, did  you look for a number of galleries to represent you, did you do a  combination of galleries/booth shows?  At first I did mostly galleries, and probably like a lot of people,  showed  with  Doris Littrell in Oklahoma City and then Linda Greever in Tulsa.  They were always just extremely good to the artist. I just can   t say  enough about those two ladies. They   ve helped countless artists get  started. I tell you, every time I was just  about broke and  didn   t know  what to do, I   d go see one of them and they   d always help me get  through a lean time. They did it for a lot of artists. Those two ladies, I  think, were the two main ones in Oklahoma.  Some of those early shows were fun, too, weren   t they?  Oh, yeah. They were the best. I remember one time, we were at Doris   s,  and there was   who   s that guy, Wright? What   s his name? The  architect?  Frank Lloyd Wright?  Yeah,  a  Frank Lloyd Wright chair at Doris   s. And we were sitting  there. Ben Harjo was sitting there, and Connie was sitting there and me.  And that chair broke. One of the legs broke off, and that chair slid down  9  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  this way. I was sitting on the end. When I heard that thing break, I  jumped up, but when I did, it tilted and Ben, he just laid his head over  like  Gestures . (Laughter) And everybody was there, all the artists were  there. Man, that was funny. I jumped up and he was just leaning on  Connie   s shoulder. Times like that are what you remember.  How early in your career were you looking to the Mound building  cultures and ancient Southeastern designs for inspiration?  Well, after leaving the Institute, researching there, I was going to come  back to Cherokee country and get around my people. I had hoped that by  doing this field work, I   d run across things and be able to do more  research, even out in the field. But  I  found that there was really very  few people that was doing the Southeast style, and that kind of amazed  me. Anna Mitchell, Cecil Dick were the two key people that I remember  that were trying to promote more of a Southeast style, but people were  just going their own way. The basketry was always traditional, but some  of the beadwork designs and things like that were off a little.  Not many people were doing pottery aside from Anna Mitchell.  No. There wasn   t a lot of potters at that time, either. But at that point, I  just tried to get the people that I was in contact with to research more  Southeast, because that   s our cultural  heritage    from Removal times,  that   s where we were located. From then, I took it on into my own work  and  I   ve  been doing that theme ever since.  Did it involve book research or were you traveling to some places?  Book research and visits to mound sites and things like that.  I was wondering   and you   ve kind of answered that about Cecil Dick      about   other people exploring some of those designs.  Yeah, getting to talk with those guys, actually talk with them and visit  with them and have a drink with them. I live in this town, Locust Grove.  This is the home of Willard Stone. Getting to go over and see Willard.  They were always  people or ones  who I looked up  to  as the  generation before me. Those guys were always really open to helping  you and doing what they could to encourage you, and that was a good  thing. They were good people.  So you would go and visit Willard Stone fairly often. You guys had a  friendship?  Yeah, I   d stop in and visit and he always had a good joke     10  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Were you doing any ceramic sculpture yet? Had he seen any of your  sculpture pieces?  Yeah, I was still trying to do some of my own work and stuff, but he had  kind of an open door policy for artists. They could stop by and visit him  and see what he was up to. Or just go and visit. Usually  he   d just  talk  about gardening, and like I said, he always had a joke. He   d start off the  conversation with a good joke. Then you   d look around, see what he was  doing. By visiting him, I kind of learned how to do the eyes on my  sculpture. I studied his wood carvings and that helped me. I was kind of  stuck on the eyes and he helped me   I figured it out from looking at his  work.  I know  eyes are  a challenge in painting. I hadn   t even thought about  sculpture     Yeah, he   s really good. You know that show at Gilcrease this last year?  That was excellent. The most Willard Stone pieces that I   d seen.  You and Connie and Demos went?  Yes. It was a nice show, nice show.  Were you doing both pottery and ceramic sculpture from the beginning,  or did you start with pottery?  I was always doing both. There at the Institute, I took a different  approach to ceramics from some of the other traditional people. I always  used a potter   s wheel. And I use an electric kiln. I got a little bit of  training before I went to the Institute in ceramics. Frank Simons taught  us about glaze recipes and things at Central State. So, I, at least, knew  how to mix formulas and stuff. I wanted to put color into my work. I   ve  got some formulas of my own that I mixed up and     You went on to experiment with those glaze formulas at the Institute?  Yes. And developed new ones all through my career. I   ve developed  more and more.  What kinds of subjects were you doing early on in ceramics? Were you  exploring more male figures, female    Basically what you do now?  Basically, the same. Male and female both. Mother and child has always  been good   probably for any artist. Seated, standing. Now, I   ve noticed  my work  is  more refined and I   m happy with it. An artist will go  11  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  through  a phase  where he develops. I   ve come to the point where I   m  not really afraid to tackle much now in the ceramics media. I know its  limitations. Truth of materials. There   s limits to every material, but it  doesn   t scare me. It doesn   t make me back away from, shy away from  some odd projects. So, I like that. I   ve just done it long enough, I think.  For a while, I think I remember at Trail of Tears Art Show, people didn   t  know what to do with ceramic sculpture in competitive shows, sometimes  it would get put in the wrong category. Did that ever happen to you in  the early days?  Well, what I   ve seen is   take the word    ceramics.    When you say     ceramics,    people automatically vision in their head these little molds  associated with old ladies making these little ceramic chickens or  whatever. And casting them. Really, the term    ceramics    just means  anything to do with clay. Mine are one-of-a-kind, hand-built. Or not  hand-built. I use machines to make some of the  parts , but a lot of it is  by hand. It   s a mixture with me. I use the machines I have in different  ways, techniques. But there   s a lot of hand work involved, and I use an  electric kiln. So, I   m a contemporary ceramicist, is all I can say. I   m on  the contemporary side.  When did you start doing Indian Market?  Right after I left the Institute, I went back and I did Indian Market for  about five years. Then I waited a few years, maybe six or seven years,  didn   t go. Then I went back in for another stretch, for about five or six  years. And right now I   m not going. I   m just kind of hanging out here in  Oklahoma.  You   re busy enough. Do you remember some of your awards?  I think I got a few awards there. I don   t think anything major. Third  place or something a couple times. There too, at that time, contemporary  ceramics, you   re going to get beat by traditional pottery. That   s their  tradition. And it   s  the  Southwest, so it   s okay. At least I was maybe  able to open doors for other artists that want to go on to contemporary  art.  They   re much more careful about their categories now.  Yeah. I kind of see myself as being able to let other people go in any  direction they want in ceramics, really.  What kinds of changes did you see in the Oklahoma Indian art scene  during the    80s?  12  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Once that turquoise boom ended, it got harder times. Really harder  times. And that   s where I think people like Doris and Linda were able,  as professional gallery people, to get their clientele to collect your work  and help you survive. That   s how it worked for me, anyway. I had to  depend on them to draw in the clientele. Then I started doing more  independent booth shows where I   d rent my own booth and retail my  own work.  What were some of the shows you did?  I did Red Earth for, oh, I don   t know, ten, twelve years in a row. And  then I was going to  Indian  Market every now and then, during that  little stretch. Really, whatever fit into my schedule, my production.  Whenever I could produce enough work, I   d start looking for a show.  So, relying more on the galleries in the    80s was a change. How about  the 1990s? Do you remember some of the adjustments in terms of the  Indian art scene?  Just the struggle, I think. Just keep plugging. A lot of ups and downs. It  culled out a lot of artists is what I remember. It kind of separated men  from the boys, almost. If you were really going to do it, you   d hang in,  and if you were going to pass it off, you   d have to pass it off. That   s how  I remember that.  Also, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed in 1990, requiring  artists to provide proof of enrollment or be certified by their tribes. Do  you remember the impact of that bill on galleries and individual artists?  Well, how I remember that is, it really divided our tribe, because there  was a lot of guys that had been doing art for twenty, thirty years that I  come to find out weren   t recognized, or weren   t on the Dawes  rolls .  That   s the whole fallacy of the deal in our tribe. That Dawes roll was a  flawed system of trying to register. And they could have kept registering  after that, even, and try to make corrections, but the Cherokees didn   t do  it that way. And I think some of the best artists got kind of shunned out,  and I believe they   re Indian. To this day, I still believe they were Indian  people. They just weren   t on the Dawes roll, so it was a big mess for me.  Your work has traveled abroad to different collections. Have you done  any traveling outside of the country with your artwork?  No. Shirley Wells took a show once to London, wasn   t it?  I think it was France.  13  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  France, yeah, Shirley. Other than that, I haven   t participated in anything  outside of the United States.  The last ten years or so, you   ve been moving in the direction of larger  works and public art, and your son, Demos, is a sculptor who focuses on  metal and wood. Can you talk about how it came about that you and  Demos first started collaborating? Were you already looking towards  doing bigger pieces, or did that come out of the collaboration?  Well, one of the last things, when I left the Institute, Allan Houser told  me,    Try to think towards doing monumental-scale works.    He said,     It   s going to come about in Oklahoma, too. Try to start thinking about  that.    All those years, I kind of felt like I was just surviving as an artist.  But I was also honing my skills and my ideas. I always had that in the  back of my head to do something larger. So when Demos got a wrestling  scholarship   he wrestled  at  Southern Illinois University at  Edwardsville  and majored in Fine Arts . But when he left school, he  came back. I   d always told him if he wanted to come back here and  become an artist that I   d expand the studio, and we   d share this studio  together. And he finally made that decision. When he did, that helped  me go to the next scale size because he was able to build armature  systems out of metal, and I was able to fill in spaces with my ceramics,  and that helped me go to my monumental- sized works.  Did Demos get any formal art training or was it mainly from watching  you work?  I kept him around as much as I could in the studio. He went through his  athletic phase. He was out playing ball and doing things like that, but  pretty much, yeah, I was hoping   I didn   t know whether to throw him in  the fire or not, but I was kind of hoping. (Laughter)  Can you talk about the public art commission that you did for the city of  Chattanooga, Tennessee?  That was our first one, the first thing. Luckily, we had our facility  enlarged, our studio was enlarged to handle a bigger job like that. The  RFP, the Request for Proposal, wanted you to develop an art team. They  were looking for Cherokees or Creeks because right there was the point  of embarkment for the Trail of Tears journey. Right there at that site was  a swing ferry, and they used that to swing across the river, and then they  had to start walking on the Trail of Tears   it had a historical reference.  So, we came up with our plans. I developed a team: Robbie McMurtry,  Ken Foster, Gary Allen, myself, Demos and Wade Bennett. Knokovtee  Scott, too, was on there. Then we went down and went through the  14  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  process. And they selected. We went for an interview and explained our  project, and they chose us. We got the job and started working.  What was your part of the project?  I was kind of like the manager. And the head ceramicist.  And what ultimately ended up being installed on the Riverwalk was     We did seven, six-foot stainless steel rings with clay insets in them.  We   d never seen anybody do that before, but that was my vision. We  had to go and do some research with the kind of adhesives that they use  on skyscrapers, that the construction industry uses on their outdoor     like for window panes. We used that kind of caulking and those kinds of  industrial glues and things to set the ceramics in, because it was going to  be outdoors. But through it, we developed a process of attaching clay to  stainless and now, we still use that technique that we developed in my  own work, so it was kind of cool.  Wonderful breakthrough. And the ceramic pieces are bas-relief. Is that  right?  Yeah. I   d purchased an extruder and I never got to use it much. And  finally, on that job, I really used that piece of equipment.  Were they mainly symbolic designs?  Yeah, we did a time period thing. The earliest down to the last one to  disappear from that region, the last shell-type of work. And different  symbols along the wall. So, that was the timeline.  Have you been back since the  installation ?  I   ve been back a few times. The engineers hadn   t stabilized one of the  walls that our work was hanging on, so a year ago, we had to go down  there and remove our artwork, and they went back in and fixed the  problems that they had encountered. Then we went back last year and re-installed  again. But I   ve been back times in between, and one of the  things I remember is, that   s the place where the board rack guys like to  go. The skateboarders. At night, I would go down there, and they   d be  there coming through there with their boards and stuff, but I   d notice  they   d stop and look at them and admire them and treat them  respectfully. So, I would talk to them. I   d say,    Hey, watch out for these  at night when nobody   s around. You guys are here. You guys help take  care of the artwork for me, because I live in Oklahoma.       Yeah, we will,  we will.    And we haven   t had any problem with damage or anything.  15  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  The people have really taken our work and taken care of it. That   s nice  for an artist to feel.  Yes. You received a commission from the American Indian Cultural  Center in Oklahoma City, and we have a little model of it that we   re  going to talk about. You also are working on a commission from the  Cherokee Casino in Siloam Springs. Tell me what you   re doing for that.  Right now we   re making a Little People village. I   m sculpting some  small figures and Demos has helped me do some of the sculpture work,  too, but really, his job is to build the cave. When I have a cave, we   re  going to sculpt the rocks and everything and build a scene like a diorama  for a Little People   s village. They   ll be doing different activities inside  this cave.  There are a number of tribes that have Little People traditions. Can you  explain the Cherokee tradition?  Oh, probably like a lot of them, they   re mischievous and will trick you a  little bit, maybe take things   things get lost. But what I researched on  ours is that they   re really beautiful. That was one of the things, they   re  really beautiful people. They   re really pretty, and they have even got an  iridescence to their skin, a little bit of a sheen to them. They   re miniature  people, but really pretty, supposed to be. I like that idea. That   s one  thing that attracts you, that makes you want to follow them.  Moving into your philosophies and art practices a bit, have you  experimented with different types of clay?  I read  you found your  source pretty early.  Yeah, I was lucky. I just happened to be doing a workshop there at  Macon, Georgia, at that Mound. There was a Creek girl who was a tour  guide, and she told me about this clay outside of town. I went out there  and got some and experimented with it, and I   ve been using Lizella clay  from Lizella, Georgia, for thirty years now. It   s an alluvial clay. It was  washed down during the glaciers. The glaciers pushed this clay down,  formed  it  into clay, so that   s what I use.   That   s  especially neat because of that connection with Cherokee  homelands and that older tradition with pottery.  And at the temperatures I fire it, what I like is, I don   t have to do  anything to it. It comes out skin-colored without anything added to it. It  comes out a nice red/orange, perfect for Indian skin.  You talked about both using a machine but also hand coiling pots and  16  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  sculptures. Does it just depend on the form which approach you take?  Yes.  It   s  like using the different equipment to build you a shape or  something, but then you   ve always got the option to change that shape.  One thing I like about clay is you can manipulate it with your fingers.  You get to be really hands-on and do things with your hands and change  its shape without any tools   just all hands. I like that. It   s always  amazing to me that you can take something that   s easy to manipulate,  and then when you fire it and put your glazes and colors on, at the end it  comes out something hard and durable. It goes through that  metamorphic change process. And that still is like Christmas when I  open that kiln up. It   s just like,    Oh, man, I made it.     That   s a wonderful point, too, because it is unpredictable during firing.  Do you remember losing a really important piece or a competition  piece?  That   s part of being a potter. You lose   but not so much anymore. I did  before but I   m getting better.  I looked at a little turn table and you mentioned you like to do your  figurative work on turn tables     Yeah, I always heard   I   m not the one that said it, one of the old   sculptors  Michelangelo or somewhere way back said that sculpture has  got eight views.  There   s  eight different views of a sculpture. That   s  something that Allan  Houser  taught us, too. He said,    Work around the  piece. Don   t get tied up in one area. Don   t just do the face or the hands.  Work around the piece and let the piece finish itself at the end. It   ll all  start to come together and get finished toward the end.    But that way  you can make adjustments from each one of those views to keep it in the  shape that you   re looking for.  Without giving away any trade secrets, I wonder if you can talk just a  little bit more about how you deal with the eyes of figurative pieces and  sculpture.  Shadows. Shadows, mainly. Instead of the eyeball coming out like a real  eyeball, that can be a backwards cut. That would create a shadow to  make that pupil look  like an eye , so it   s shadows, mostly.  I read that the outer limit of a pot is about two feet tall, and I was trying  to think, your early clay ceramic figures probably were about two feet  tall. Is that a rule of thumb for you?  I think my kiln is twenty-two inches   my big kiln. Twenty-two inches  17  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  in height. I can stack some bricks on top of it and get another four  inches, but I don   t know. I like to keep it around twenty-two. That would  be my maximum, but by Demos building me armature systems, what I  do is, I puzzle pieces together. I can make sections and fit them together.  That   s how I can go twenty-two inches, and then puzzle it together and  come out with six foot. It   s like a little puzzle.  How much pottery are you doing these days?  Right now I   m not doing any. I   m more of a sculptor right now. I was a  potter for quite some time, mostly pots. But now I   m doing mostly  sculpture. And when you   re a potter, for me, anyway, I would throw the  pots on the potter   s wheel. But then, that was like my canvas. I   d go in  and design and put my paints in, not paints, my glazes, and then fire. So,  it was like I was creating a canvas for my designs to go on.  What I always loved about your design work was it always offered you  something but it never got overly busy, it never got to be too much.  Well, I liked that comment you made one time on some kind of press  release. You said that it was like Indian Art Nouveau. I hate to  categorize, but it wasn   t traditional pottery.  Let   s talk a little bit about your glazes. Everybody associates a  particular shade of blue glaze with your work. Have you always liked  blues?  Blues are just easy. I   ve got probably four or five different blues. That   s  one of the simplest glazes, because cobalt just will make a fantastic blue.  I   ve been able to make them from glossy, to matte, to Engobes, on  down, so I   ve got a nice little selection of blues.  And how about blacks? Do you have also a selection of those?  Yes. I   ve got a matte, like an Engobe matte, it   s a rough-finish matte.  And then I   ve got a nice glossy black, and it   s an Albany slip glaze.  Albany slip   it   s been completely mined out. They mined out all the  Albany clay, and it   s gone. They used it way back in turn-of-the-century  pottery, and it   s depleted. So, I   ve got a couple hundred pounds, or about  a hundred pounds that I   m hanging on to. Anybody that   s got a black pot  of mine, that   s the end of them at some point. It   s coming around at  some point, because I can   t get the material to make the glaze.  After that Chattanooga Passage deal, two years after that, my son and I  entered the competition for the BOK  Bank of Oklahoma  Arena in  Tulsa, and we were chosen through the competition process. Our role  18  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  was to design four twenty-two foot medallions to go on the floor.  It was a national competition, right? It wasn   t just a state competition.  Right. So that  was  our assignment. We went up to   Cesar Pelli was  the architect. He   s one of the top ten in the world, the top-ten list. We  went up to their offices at New Haven and got to go tour their model  facility there. But that was our assignment to design these floor  medallions. And our concept on that was to do   people always hear  about the four directions, but also, Cherokee way, there   s three other  directions   there   s up, middle, and lower, too. So, that comes out to  seven. Our concept was to do the design that would represent up above.  And then the middle, where the people and animals reside. The lower is  where the, kind of, bad guys  reside . They say it   s like we   re caught  like a turbulent sea. Down here these creatures can make it turbulent for  us in the middle. But then, these guys from above can come down and  steady us, too. Sometimes these guys are more in power, and sometimes  these guys are in more power. So, we   re kind of caught in the middle.  And we did symbolism to represent that.  That   s wonderful that they chose two Oklahoma artists that are  outstanding. Let   s talk about your creative process from start to finish.  Usually something just kind of sticks in my head. Like right now, I  would like to do a really tall, slender female with flowing lines. I kind of  have something in the back of my mind, and sometimes I   ll start it with  a sketch. Sometimes I   ll just jump right in there and start to manipulate  the clay and do the movement with my hands. So, I bounce around.  You don   t feel the need to write everything down if you have an idea.  You just kind of carry it in your head?  I   ll make a quick thumbnail sketch in a sketchbook so I don   t lose it,  forget about it. I   ve got probably a lot of them in there that I haven   t  come to use yet. I try to get them down, even if it   s in the middle of the  night. Sometimes you dream them, so you just have be sure to get out of  bed and go over there and draw for a while. And go back to sleep.  Research. How is it different for a public artwork? How is it different for  these larger commission pieces?  You assign somebody to be your researcher. I   ve got so many duties,  usually, that I   m tied up. But I   ve got a good friend that can speak  Cherokee and will research for me. And then, you always know  everybody. If you   re out living in a place like this, you know a few  people to ask questions, traditional people that you can check with and  19  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  find out little stories. They   re sharing, so it   s not too hard. It   s fun.  And for the installation piece at the American Indian Cultural Center.  You go out to the site before you make a proposal? You did that in  Tennessee, as well?  We went for a visit. They showed us the site, as they were working on it,  and I got a good idea. We made a scale model here at the shop from their  architectural drawings. That   s one thing that I   ve developed through  dealing with monumental pieces. I   ve learned more about how to read  architectural drawings and how to use the ruler, the proper equipment to  develop scale. So, once we complete something, we   re on track. Because  you   ve got to work with an engineer and architects along the way to  make sure everything fits at the end.  You   ve pretty much stuck to Cherokee subject matter. Is that a conscious  commitment to represent your own tribe?  It is  as Cherokees were a part of the Southeast Ceremonial Complex .  You also have some people that you are able to hire with larger projects  because it   s more than a two person job. What are the challenges there?  Usually the main challenge is meeting the deadline at the end, because  once you   re contracted, you   ve got to try to get there on time, because  they like to plan the opening. The Chattanooga deal, we finished like  half a day before they were ready to start the big hoorah.  Talk about sweating it   I know. The construction guys, too. They got flooded down there and it  put them   they lost time. Another good story is when we went there,  those guys were really under pressure. The construction guys were under  pressure, and they were irritable. So, here we came, and I think they  thought that artists were a bunch of sissy guys. We came down there     we about had to fight them a couple times, but we got our work done in  four days and left. And we covered the  artwork . I went back in two  weeks to put in a little bit more with Robbie, and those guys, they had  taken the covers off. Or the covers had come down. And that had  changed those guys    attitude about art. That was refreshing, as an artist,  to see how art can speak across cultural boundaries. Visually, through  art, you can cross those boundaries, and they were just,    What can I do  for you?       How can I help you?    That was neat. I really felt moved by  that, by those hardnosed construction guys being so polite   changing  how it was before.  20  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  An artist   s partner always plays a large role in their success. What roles  has Connie played in your art throughout the years?  She   s always there to help set up the table and load the truck and  sometimes drive me there. And feed my crews if we   re working, feed  the people. You   ve got hundreds of jobs that the artist can   t do because  he   s kind of off in his own zone a lot of times, trying to finish up this or  touch up that. And it just takes two.  I think it   s so neat, you were ready to move in this new direction,  and   Demos joining you moved you there faster. What   s it like working with  your son?  I live kind of far out here. And while he was in college, I just felt kind of  isolated, not to be around artists enough. I appreciated going to the  shows and seeing artists then, but a lot of times I was just out there by  myself. Now I   ve got somebody to talk art with. We don   t always agree.  We have our little differences of opinion, but we can talk them out and  reach a good medium. He   s the next generation artist, too. I think that   s  good for Indian people to have generations of artists. You hear about the  Southwest Pueblos having eight generations of potters and stuff. And  hopefully the grandson will   I don   t know. I can   t predict that, but  we   re trying on him, too.  What   s your creative routine, aside from getting up in the middle of the  night to make a note if you need to?  Usually when I get really busy, I switch to the night shift. I start working  at night and sleep up until maybe ten or eleven. It just depends on how  late I work, but I go into the night routine. Just peaceful. I like to use the  day for the sunlight, to get light. But mid-afternoon into the late is when  I get more work done.  Looking back on your career so far, what is one of those pivotal  moments when you might have gone down one road, but took another  instead?  I think it was right then, when I made my commitment to go to the  Institute. I had, probably, a pretty good job, a chance to work my way  up. Not that I was going to start at a good job, but a chance to start at a  ground level and work my way up. Because it was just the beginning of  the computer age, and I was going to get to work for IBM, and that was  the pivotal deal. I said,    No, I   m going to be an artist.    That guy said,     You   ve got to get your hair cut.    At the end of the interview, he said,     You   ve got to get your hair cut.    And that   s what I think made my  decision. I was like,    Nah. I think I   m going to go be an artist.    And that  21  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  was that. (Laughter)  What has been one of the high points in your career?  I like that job we did at the Passage, as far as artwork. Because that was  our first one and it pushed us to develop, like I said, a new technique.  And I had a nice crew of guys working with me. Some days, we   d do so  much work there   d be nothing but clay pieces in that whole studio just  stacked   there wasn   t room to walk. So, you   ve got thrilling    And  seven days a week, long hours, twelve-hour, fourteen-hour days, and  you just work until exhaustion. Whenever you do something like that,  it   s not just you. You kind of feel like there   s somebody above you  helping, too, and so you do a lot of praying and things like that, too, are  associated with times like that. So, that was very moving to me.  What   s been one of the low points in your career?  Probably  being  headed for Oklahoma City and not having hardly any  money in your pocket and knowing that you   ve got to make a payment  here and there, and if you don   t make this sale,    What do I do next?  We   ve got to try another gallery, and it   s a maybe.    And that   s where  people like Doris, she   d come through. And I   d be able to survive for  another month. Many of those, though.  A lot of artists can relate to those.  Yeah. Many times, too. And it still can be that way. Our profession is  not very stable. We have to work.  How much of your time do you spend making proposals? Is that still a  pretty small percentage?  Yeah. So, far I   ve been lucky. I   ve got four jobs, nice jobs like this but  they   re about two years apart, so     Gives you something to look forward to and plenty of time     Well, about the time you   re finishing one   it   s not a fast process. It   s a  slow process. You put something together and it might take the  committee six months to eight months, maybe even a year to decide who  they   re going to choose. It   s a slow process to work through. I   m always  looking to do some  project  though. I just like working in that scale.  The larger scale is really intriguing right now.  What advice would you have for a young Indian artist today?  22  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  Little Thunder  Glass  I   d say,    You   ve got to really soul search and decide. You   ve got to  throw your hat over the fence and go get it.    If they   re really young, if  they   re young enough, go to the Institute. If they want to stay here in  Oklahoma, maybe go to Bacone or OU or something, but try to get  somewhere where you can feel comfortable. I liked the Institute because  the student body is Indians, and everybody made each other feel  comfortable there.  Supportive environment. Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to talk  about or anything you   d like to add?  No, I think I   m about talked out.   Let   s have a look  at some of your pieces.  This is the model for the piece that   s going to be at the American Indian  Art and Culture Museum there in Oklahoma City. This is stainless steel.  This is 13   6    from here to here.  Gestures  And this is ten foot wide  from here to here. This model came out so clean. I was going to put  some ceramics work on here, but Demos did such a nice job, and to me  showed, it was just too nice to add color to it. So, basically, I helped  design the piece but Demos was the guy that was the artist. The head  artist. And that happens out here sometimes. Sometimes he   s the head  guy and sometimes I am.  This is going to go in the entrance, right?  Yeah, it   s going to be right in front of the Welcoming Center. There  between the parking lot and the Welcoming Center. This is something  that   s going to be coming out in the future. We   ve got it built and we   re  just holding it, waiting for the landscaping to take place. So there   s that  piece. Here   s one of my pieces. Like I said, I   m a bit on the  contemporary side.  Do you title all your pieces?  Yeah. I think this is called    War Bird.    The peregrine falcon was the  warrior bird symbol for Southeast tribes. This is just like an abstracted  version of a silhouette of a peregrine falcon. I tried to use my glazes, but  then I got spatial things that  pointing . I   m hoping to take this one and  get it may be cast into bronze. I think it   ll look actually better in metal.  So that   s my goal on this.  It   s wonderful in ceramic, too, and even the tongue is textured, there.  This is just kind of a contemporary side to some of my work here. I call  23  Little Thunder  Glass  it    Sky   s Portal.    This is kind of like a snake design here, then this goes  into a sun design. I envision this to represent rain, and then it   s got some  eye symbols to represent above. And it   s just got some hand symbols  down here. If I have an idea, it seems like I have to get it out of my  system so I can move on to the next one.  Right. Well, Bill, thank you so much for your time today.  Thank you, Julie.  -------  -------
