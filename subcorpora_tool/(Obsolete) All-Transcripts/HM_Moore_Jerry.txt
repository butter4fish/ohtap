Lean not to your own understanding and he shall bring it to pass [Proverbs 3:5-6].
Speaker 1: Yes he will.
Story_ID: 484781

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Dallas, Texas.  I want to correct that.  I'm wrong.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in Marshall, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, is this where she grew up?
Speaker 2: She grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know much about her background and her growing up?
Speaker 2: What I know is what comes to me by oral tradition.  I knew none of my grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born on a farm owned by her father [David Abner (ph.)] who owned approximately three hundred acres of land.  Her father was a slave and was released and he acquired this property after Emancipation Proclamation, and he farmed on it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you described your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was a teacher for forty years of the first grade.  And, was, I am told, an excellent teacher.  She was my first teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, taught me how to read and write.  And, in her later years, the state board of education cited her as a model teacher for all of the other first grade teachers in the parish where we lived [Webster Parish, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what time period that might have been?  The years that might have been when she was doing that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I do not know the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did she share any stories with you about how she grew up?
Speaker 2: She grew up as an average girl.  Her mother was named Molly [Molly Abner (ph.)], and she had to take her place in the usual activities that girls performed around a farm house.  And, she went to school, and graduated from whatever school that was that were around there, high school.  And, there was nothing unusual about her life.  She had several brothers and they seemed too been rather prankish at times, and there was always something going on.
Speaker 1: Do you know which college she graduated from?
Speaker 2: She graduated from Southern University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Story_ID: 484782
Speaker 1: What do you know about your father?  Who's your father?  What is his name?
Speaker 2: My father was named Jerry Alexander Moore, Sr. [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born at Heflin, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, this is where he grew up?
Speaker 2: He grew up on a farm with his father [Henry Moore] and mother [Catherine Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he tell you anything about his background and his growing up as he was--as a young man?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know anything about his growing up as a child.  But, later on, at what age I don't know, he attended Bishop College at Marshall, Texas.  And, took what you call a B.T.H degree, bachelor of theology degree.  And, he became a pastor out there in Texas in his early life, and he was married to my mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore].  And, eventually, he returned to Louisiana, and the rest of his career was there in the parish [Webster Parish, Louisiana] where we lived.
Story_ID: 484783
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents [Mae Dee Abner Moore and Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How would you describe your, your father?
Speaker 2: My father was a very gentle man, but very positive.  He never raised his voice.  But, what he said, he meant, and you knew he meant it.  He was a public servant.  In those days, it was nothing unusual for a minister to pastor more than one church.  My father pastored three at the same time.  The custom was, say you give this church one Sunday; the next one, one Sunday; and, maybe the other one, two Sundays.  Or, sometimes, they gave each church one Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the disciplinarian in the family?
Speaker 2: My mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was a very strict disciplinarian.  She kept us children in line.  My father, except at night, was very seldom home because he was supervisor of colored schools in Webster Parish [Louisiana] where we lived.  Keep in mind, that in Louisiana they are called parishes as opposed to counties.
Story_ID: 484784
Speaker 1: Do have any idea how many schools might have been in that area?  How many schools he might have been supervising?
Speaker 2: In the parish where we lived [Webster Parish, Louisiana], there were no schools in the beginning except there were private schools.  There was one called the Normal School [Minden Normal School and Business College, Minden, Louisiana] supported by the Baptist convention of the, of the parish.  And, then there was another one.  All I remember about that schools, it was called the Old Red Building [ph.].  I don't know how that school was sponsored.  But, I remember this from a very small boy.  Other than that, there were no schools for blacks.  Now, when my father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] became the supervisor of colored schools, his first order of business was to build schools.  See that they were built.  And, he circulated in the communities and encouraged the farmers to set aside a portion of their land to raise cotton on.  And, the, from the sale of that cotton, they bought lumber from a lumberyard.  And, the lumberyard contributed lumber on their own.  And, they built one and two teacher schools.  I do remember, eventually, there were two schools that had more than two rooms.  And, they were called consolidated schools.  And, 'cause my father saw to it that about thirty-seven schools were built in the rural areas for colored people, as we were called at that time.
Speaker 1: So, did the farmers in that area, did they help build the schools that--?
Speaker 2: They were not carpenters.  Maybe, one or two might have been.  But, usually, I don't know who did--built the building.  The superintendent of education, through his mechanism saw to it that the workmen were provided to build the schools.  It doesn't take a lot of 'em to build a one teacher school; a one room school.  And, they put those schools up and most of the labor was free.  And, of course, after they built them up, an interesting thing occurred here that you might be interested in knowing.  There weren't, there weren't a lot of people prepared to teach.  There were a lot of illiterate people around; hangovers from slavery.  So, if you had, let's say, a fifth grade certificate, you could teach the first grade.  What occurred was that they raised the level of requirement for your ability to teacher if you finished the first grade, of course, you had to go to second.  So, if you finished sixth grade, you could teach the second grade.  So, that kept those who had a little education continually trying to improve their credentials for teaching.  Until, over a period of years, it raised up to the twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you had to have a college degree to teach the twelfth grade.  And, so, I have lived with this as a growing child because my father was the supervisor of colored schools.  And, interestingly enough, I saw him give teachers checks for twenty-five dollars for a month's work.  Now, you have to understand circumstances.  We were still segregated.  We was still looked upon as second class citizens.   And, the kind of education that we were being offered was the type of education that did not help you to progress very far in life.  It was mostly reading and writing.
Story_ID: 484785
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: I can trace them back to slavery.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Both of my grandparents were slaves.  My father's [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] father owned a farm, a farm.  He obtained that farm after slavery through some act of [U.S.] Congress.  They passed some type of bill that prepared, that permitted rather, you to live on the land, let's say for five years and cultivate it.  And, at the end of that time, they gave you a deed to it.  He has that, he had, that's the way he got his land.  That land is still in the family today.  We have the deed to it.  The original deed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that was in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: That's was given to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For that land.  My sister and I don't live there.  But, we keep it for history's sake.
Speaker 1: Did you actual know either one of your grandparents personally (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not know either one.  They both, all of them had died, but one, when I was born and that one died the year I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember the names of your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could I get those?
Speaker 2: My father's father was named Henry [Henry Moore], and his wife was named Catherine [Catherine Moore].  My mother's [Mae Dee Abner Moore] father was named David [David Abner (ph.)], and his wife's name was Molly [Molly Abner (ph.)].
Story_ID: 484786
Speaker 1: Were there any other relatives around that might have influenced you in any way when you were growing up, that might have been in the area?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] and mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] were among the very few people in our community [in Minden, Louisiana] who had the opportunity to get an education.  And, as a child, I guess influences come into your life that you don't really understand.  I did a number of little things when I was a boy growing up, like selling garden seed.  I'd order them from a company and walk around town, sell 'em for a nickel a package.  Say we used to sell because most people raised their vegetables.  And, I met a lot of people in my effort to sell the seed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause they knew my father, who was a preacher, and also knew he was supervisor of schools and somehow people had the habit of treating those parish children differently than they treat their own (laughter).  And, I supposed I was always given a little preferential treatment.
Story_ID: 484787
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?  Your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my memories goes back to my teenagers--teenage years.  I finished high school [Minden Union School, Minden, Louisiana].  Well, it goes back further than that actually.  It goes back to pre-elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's talk about that.
Speaker 2: But, my mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] taught school in those days you didn't have babysitters.  And, places, nice places where you could take your babies.  I grew up in a classroom.  My mother, in the school where she taught in the country, one of the school my father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] built.  My father was the principal.  My mother taught the first through the fourth grade.  My father taught the fifth through seventh grade.  I had a pallet over in the corner where, that was my area, while my mother taught.  And, when came time for--old enough to go to school, I knew my ABCs and I could read; couldn't write, but I could read.  'Cause in those days they called 'em blackboards.  And, she was going through her exercises with flash cards and putting the alphabets on the board and all of that.  I didn't have anything else to do, so I just learned.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, when it came time for me to go to school, at the age of, they didn't allow you to start 'til you were six.  I could already read.  I could already identify all my alphabets.  All these things I already knew.  But, my mother insisted that I start in the first grade.  And, that's where I started, in the first grade.  All I was sitting in there all--I knew already what she'd been teaching all this time.
Story_ID: 484788
Speaker 1: What was your family life like?  Well like, say 'bout--do you remember any holidays or special events that went on in your family?
Speaker 2: Well, in those days, you have to kind of cast it all over against the backdrop of segregation.  Now, while you would have considered my father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] a prominent man because of his position, then controlling the economics for a lot of people in that parish 'cause the biggest job you could get was teaching school, and, he had control of that.  That meant that the money came through him to pay them.  Now, being the wife of a prominent man, naturally my mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] was well respected also.  I mentioned the fact that children were treated a little different than other children because of the prominence of their parents.  And, now in growing up in that environment, my mother tried to be very careful of her children. And, she taught in the school where I attended.  And, consequently, I had to make my own opportunities to misbehave.  Now, when you say misbehave in the--that circumstance is not easy to interpret--misinterp- being mis- being a person who committed a misdemeanor just something--meant you infracted some rule.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: The rule didn't have to do with right or wrong at all, but they had rules, and you supposed to keep 'em.  Well, as a boy growing up, I didn't keep 'em all.  And, I got punished once or twice on campus for infracting the rule.  And, as I recall, my father had a talk with the principal.  My father's office was on that campus and he saw me out there raking the yard.  That was my punishment.  And, after that discussion, I was never bothered again.  I knew my father had talked to him but I don't know what they talked about.  But, I was never challenged after that.  So, I grew up and finished school.  Now, this is an interesting fact, it was called, the school was called the Webster Parish Training School [Webster Parish Training School for Negroes, Minden, Louisiana].  I did not know that I was trained, being trained to be a farmer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was trained in how to raise corn, peanuts, cottons, whatever else in that area you raise on a farm.  I was trained in animal husbandry; hogs, and cows, chickens, and all that kind of stuff.  I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And, I had a good time learning it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, on the other side of the town was the white high school [Minden Academy, Minden, Louisiana].  And, they were being trained, taking courses that led to becoming doctors, and lawyers, governors, legislators.  I didn't know that until after I left home.
Story_ID: 484789
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a little bit about your, get back to your family just a little bit.  Did you have siblings; brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you give me their names in the birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: My oldest sister is Mildred Dee Clark [Mildred Moore Clark].  That's her married name.  My brother, David H. Moore [David Moore].  My sister, my youngest sister, Abner Mae Moore Lewis [Abner Moore Lewis].  And, then myself, Jerry A. Moore, Jr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], and, then there was another child who died in infancy, Catherine Moore [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that order.
Speaker 1: In that order, okay.
Story_ID: 484790
Speaker 1: Sort of describe the area that you lived in, you were on a farm?  You lived (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did not grow up on the farm in the sense that I lived there.  I grew up in town [Minden, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: In town.
Speaker 2: A little country town.
Speaker 1: Describe that for me.
Speaker 2: Well, I describe it as a hillbilly town.  Small town, nine thousand people, was its peak population.  And, it had the usual general store.  Stores where farmers came in and did their trading.  And, they had a lot for, they called 'em hitching posts.  'Cause farmers came down in the wagons, on their mules, on their horses.  And, this lot, great big square, were where they had hitching posts.  And, you hitch your team while you went off shopping.  The atmosp- had a front street and a back street.  I didn't even know they had names until after I was grown.  But, it was north Broadway [Street] and south Broadway.  On North Broadway, that's where the principle stores were.  On South Broadway, well, let me put it this way, this is where the people who came in from the farm congregated; the colored people.  And, there was Lebanese by the name of Dowe [ph.] who had a general store on South Street.  And, that's where the majority of the colored people came in and did their trading.  And, other than that, they wondered up and down the street.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't go on North Street, the north side at all?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  They would go on north Broadway, they didn't--evidently they didn't feel comfortable up there.  There was one store there, a Mr. Riend [ph.] who ran a general store where you could buy most anything.  One of the most ridiculous things I saw as a child, setting papers, the paper was call The Shreveport Sun.  You didn't throw 'em, you sold 'em.  I went in the Riend mercantile store one day, and this poor, illiterate fellow came in and said in effect, "Well, Mr. Riend I'd like to get a side of bacon and some flour and baking powder," so forth.  It was--the weather was cold.  They had a big potbelly stove sitting there in the place.  But, it was almost red hot.  And, white fellow sitting around the stove.  In those days, what they did, they expect (unclear) right on the stove.  Because that hot stove would, let's say, fry that (unclear).  And, so, they made this Negro bow over, and they took turns kicking him.  Bow over, hold his ankles, while they kicked him.  And, they had fun kicking him.  And, when they got through with that fun, Mr. Riend said, "Now, you go back there and get yourself a side of bacon and get one of them little sacks of flour and some baking powder, put it in that sack and get out of here."  Well, I was--couldn't been more than ten or twelve years old at the time.  But, it left a profound effect on me to see another human being treated that way.
Story_ID: 484791
Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], you were talking about the experience of seeing this man getting beaten in the store [in Minden, Louisiana].  Can you continue that?
Speaker 2: Well, once this poor fellow, he had gotten what he was told he could get and left the store.  They had a system of what they called putting it on the book, the cost of your purchase.  You must recall here that these people couldn't read nor write.  So, they don't know what the man put on the book.  Now, there's another phase tied to that.  This was prior to the Great Depression.  Now, when the Great Depression came, many of these farmers owned their land.  And, so, what those white merchants did and some others, was they simply walked over to the courthouse and foreclosed on these farmers and took their land.  Now, you may not have owned more than one hundred dollars or a quarter, something like that.  You couldn't read.  You couldn't write.  You don't know what he put on the book.  Man could put anything on the book.  Now, they had a habit of saying when you brought your produce in, or whatever you were bring in for sale, mostly cotton, let's say you had 450 pound bail of cotton.  Cotton was selling, I'm just giving example, let's say a percent of twenty cents a pound.  You multiply twenty times four hundred; that was the price you got for your cotton.  Now, you're buying your produce from this man.  He looked at his book, "Well Sam, you almost made it out this year.  You worked a little harder, you'll make it out next year."  Now, this was a standard statement.  You never made it out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, he was taking your cotton.  Now, he's taking your land.  Claiming that you owed him, you see.  And, this was a way a lot of the land was accumulated down there that these colored people had accum- had gotten a hold of as a result of having been slaves and living on the land and getting a deed to the land, from the government, and slip from their hands into white hands.
Speaker 1: Once these folk lost their property, what did they do?
Speaker 2: Well, that began the Great Migration.  What occurred in part was, they moved into the little towns, and they moved to California.  They moved to Texas.  They moved to St. Louis [Missouri].  They moved to Chicago [Illinois].  And, they moved to New York [New York], and perhaps some other places.  But, these were the principal places they moved to.
Story_ID: 484792
Speaker 1: When you think of your town [Minden, Louisiana], what sights or sounds, smells remind you of growing up in your tone--in your town?
Speaker 2: Well, hot tamales was great food at that time.  And, there were vendors who walked the street with a bucket or package filled with hot tamales.  And, you could buy hot tamales and eat them.  I supposed the biggest thing I remember is the catfish; fried catfish.  And, that was a delicacy that many people like.  I like it.  Still like it 'til this day.  And, this was something you could look forward to.  Most of the other stuff was controlled by other people.  You could take a fishing pole, walk down to the creek and catch your fish (laughter).  That wasn't discriminated.  But, you had to be careful when you, around the other group.  How you talk.  How you conducted yourself.  There was one way you conducted yourself there, and there was another way you conducted yourself when you were with your own people.
Story_ID: 484793
Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?  Elementary school?
Speaker 2: Elementary; Webster Parish Training School [Webster Parish Training School for Negroes, Minden, Louisiana] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was Webster.  So, that was, that was elementary and high school?  You went straight through?
Speaker 2: I went straight through.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Other than your mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] as a teacher, were there any other teacher there that might have influenced you?
Speaker 2: Well, there were other teachers there.  I supposed there was woman by the name of Mrs. Calvin [ph.] who greatly influenced me.  I was never a good mathematician.  Somehow numbers confused me.  And, I don't think that they took the time to find out what was my problem.  And, so, I didn't pass a course in math when I was in seventh grade.  In those years, you had to repeat the whole grade over if you flunked one subject.  So, the following year I had Mrs. Calvin, Miss Calvin, and I think Miss Calvin understood me.  And, she helped me considerably on, on math, and I was able to master some math.  And, I still don't like math 'til this day.  But, Miss Calvin had a great impact on me.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was just an average student.  I didn't see the need for superior scholarship.  I guess I had a get by attitude.
Story_ID: 484794
Speaker 1: What kind of child were you?  Were you well-mannered?  Were you mischievous?
Speaker 2: Accordingly, as I have earlier stated, my mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] was a strict disciplinarian as she taught on the campus [of the Webster Parish Training School for Negroes, Minden, Louisiana].  It wasn't--my father's [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] office was on the campus there wasn't else, anything much else for me to do but toe the line.
Speaker 1: As a young boy, did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: No.  All I wanted to do is live, and be let alone.
Story_ID: 484795
Speaker 1: Where did your family attend church?
Speaker 2: My mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] attended the St. Rest Baptist Church [Minden, Louisiana] which was about three doors from our house, 'cause my father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] was the pastor of three churches and he was gone all the time.
Speaker 1: So, he was not the pa- was he, was he the pastor of St. Rest?
Speaker 2: He was the pastor at one time in his early ministry.  I think that was before I was born.  He was a pastor of that church.  But, the pastor under whom I was taught, grew up, and baptized was named Reverend Casper [ph.].  He was a commuter.  He came down from Arkansas and did his work and he spent most of his time in Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Did you have church every Sunday?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--Mr.--Reverend Casper's time, I'm not sure whether we had church every Sunday or not, but I think we did.  I know I went to Sunday school every Sunday.  But, Casper was a trained man.  A very pedantic little fella.  And, whatever happened to him, I never knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any activities that you did at church, such as Vacation Bible School, or did you got to, did they have revivals?  Things of that nature.
Speaker 2: Vacation Bible School had not been conceived when I was a child.  We had what was called Sunshine Band.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: That is one of the agencies of the educational system of the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.  Now, in the Sunshine Band, it was a group that had a leader, and that leader was a trainer of these young people.  You ask me, why did I go to Sunshine Band?  There was lady by the name of Mrs. Jennings [ph.] who was the director, and she made good lemonade and wonderful cookies.  I went to Sunshine Band for the lemonade and the cookies (laughter).  But, I enjoyed it.  And, what--if I learned anything it was, it was not the main reason why I was there.  Now, also that was called the Baptist Training Union.  Now, this was a training union, a training division for young people.  That's where we learned the Bible, and the books of the Bible, how to find passages in the Bible.  And, we had drills, and all of that type of thing that would help you learn.  Brother Will Holmes [ph.] was the man who directed this activity in my time.  And, he would take his Bible and they had a formula that you went through.  For instance, you hold your Bible in your hand, he tell you to draw (unclear), you raise your Bible up.  I've forgotten all the formula now but eventually they get to the place where, you had to open your Bible, let's say to Mark [Gospel of Mark] and such and such and chapter and verse.  And, of course, the first one to get to it, won the contest.
Speaker 1: That's sounds inte- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, we learned the Bible that way.
Story_ID: 484796
Speaker 1: Did you have friends growing up, that you--the boys that you played with (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had some boyfriends.  W.D. Booker, his father was a Methodist minister.  We were very good friends.  And, Columbus Brice [ph.] was a very good friend.  I don't know what became of him, but in little towns like that as we all spread out going other places.  I know he went to California.  Both of them went to California.  But, what became of Columbus, I never knew.

Speaker 1: Around 1931, I think you were probably about, maybe around thirteen years old, there was a fire that destroyed a lot of the downtown area.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Not in Minden [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about, I know, do you remember about 1933 there was a tornado?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Very 1st, April, I mean, May 1, 1933.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Four-thirty p.m. in the afternoon.  I never shall forget it.  I was a little boy.  I know I did not know anything about a tornado.  I don't know that I'd ever heard of one.  I was out in the backyard playing with a friend of mine.  And, I look up in the sky and I saw all of this paper, these boards, and saw a cow up there.  I wonder how in earth did that get up there.  And, the sky was getting blacker and blacker.  My mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] ran to the door and called me in.  Told my friend to run home as fast as he could.  Well, the tornado came through a certain section of the town and blew it away.  Torn up a lot of house, killed several people, others got injured.  And, early on, I was asked about the First Baptist Church [Minden, Louisiana].  The First Baptist Church came to a lot of people's rescue.  They had an armory there.  The armory became the hospital and somehow another, they got a lot of cots.  And, people were given cots and blankets, warm food, and they were attended to.  I know, my mother went down there and volunteered to work with people who were injured.  Yes, I remember that tornado very well (laughter).

Speaker 1: Let's go back to your school days.  You were around fourteen when you entered, when you started high school [Minden Union School, Minden, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: About so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Describe your high school experience.  Who was, what was some of the things--?
Speaker 2: It was just a normal experience.  The classes that you took were prescribed by the state board of education.  I supposed the teacher that had the greatest impact upon my life was Tessie McGee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm gonna ask you about her.
Speaker 2: Tessie McGee taught history.  The United States history was prescribed as a book that we were to study.  In that book, there were two references to colored people.  One, when they were brought in 1619 and put in slavery.  The other one, near the end of the book was about a black solider who in World War I [WWI] got hold of a .45 revolver and shot up a lot of Germans.  Now, that was the extent of my knowledge from that book about my own people.  But, Tessie McGee, where she learned it, I don't know.  But, she had gotten a hold of a book by Carter G. Woodson that told a great deal about the history of black people.  And, she would put that book on the table, next to her United States history.  And, have her lesson line, outlined right in front of it, which was a requirement.  And, she would read to us from this book (cough) about black people.  Such people as Carter G. Woodson, the then president [Robert Russa Moton] of Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  That's where a list, I found the Booker T. Washington, and Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune], and a lot of others.  Which I found to be most interesting.  And, I developed desire in my heart, if I could just meet some of these people.  Never knew that eventually I would.  But, I've always blessed her for teaching me what state board of education never intended for me to learn.
Speaker 1: What do you think would have happened if the state board knew that she was teaching you this black history?
Speaker 2: They would've fired her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yes indeed.  How did you spend your time in, while you were in high school?  Did you have a favorite subject that you had?  What extracurricular activities did you do?
Speaker 2: I've always been a history buff.  And, that's why I appreciate what Tessie McGee did so much in teaching me about black people.  And, I'm a prolific reader.  I still am.  I read a lot of history and I read a lot of magazines.  But, there was no particular subject other than history in which I took a deep interest when I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Did your high school library have any black history books at all?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  The, the catalog of books was small.  And, they had a little house there that they built for a library.  Now, you wouldn't believe this, but I read every book in there except the encyclopedia.  And, some of 'em, they wasn't fit for library books.  I did not know that at that time.  Because the books that I read about black people were very demeaning.  I never shall forget one called 'Red Bean Row' [R. Emmet Kennedy]. It was just disgusting, even to me as a teenager.  Now, the library downtown, which was primarily for white people, the only way you could get a book out of there, you had to request it through the library that they had down there for on the campus for Negroes.  And, you could request it and they might let you have it and they might not let you have it.
Speaker 1: Well, most of the books that you had in school were they the hand-me-downs from the, from the white schools?
Speaker 2: No.  At school, we had new books.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: We didn't have hand-me-down books.
Story_ID: 484799
Speaker 1: Did you belong to any clubs, organizations when you were in school [Minden Union School, Minden, Louisiana]?  Did they--did you play a sport?
Speaker 2: There were two units I associated with.  One was the thrift club, learning how to handle money.  The other one was a branch of the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] called the Hi-Y.  And, I participated in both of those.  In the thrift club, we were encouraged to, to save money.  There wasn't much to save but, I as of early I indicated I had a little business of my own, selling seed and newspapers.  In the summertime, we had large gardens.  And, my father taught us how to plant these gardens and he would let us sell the produce.  We had a fruit orchard and he would allow us to sell the fruit.  And, always had money.  I don't know exactly how the other children saved theirs but I had a Prince Albert cigar, Prince Albert tobacco can, and I put my little change in the can.  And, the school had made arrangement with the bank.  Of course, this helps the banks too; to encourage us to deposit our money.  And, I deposited my money in the bank.  And, so, I always had money.
Speaker 1: Were you able to do what you wanted with, with your money?  Spend it the way you wanted to?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My parents [Mae Dee Abner Moore and Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] never bothered me about what I did with it.  And, by the time I was eighteen, I was buying my own clothes, taking care of myself.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the Hi-Y club that you belonged to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Hi-Y was a branch of the YMCA.
Speaker 1: Tell me about graduation, when you graduated from high school [Minden Union School, Minden, Louisiana].  Do you know--where there--how many children were in your class?
Speaker 2: I do not remember how many there were in the class.  I didn't participate in the things that the other children did.  It just didn't suit me.  My parents [Mae Dee Abner Moore and Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] knew I was buying my own clothes so I didn't buy any graduation clothes.  So, I wasn't included in what they were doing, which I didn't care.  And, you know, a little town like that, it's only so much you could do.  And, the kind of things they were gonna do, I knew that I was not allowed to do.  Now, I participated in the school choir and sang with them.  There was a lady there by the name of Venie Luke [ph.] who took charge of me and taught me how to sing little songs.  And, I sang solos that I, you know, like that.  But, it was about all I wanted to do.  I lost my voice now after I had the stroke, but I've had many years of professional singing after that.
Story_ID: 484800
Speaker 1: Did you go straight to college from high school [Minden Union School, Minden, Louisiana] or did you work a bit?
Speaker 2: I went straight to a college after high school.  I went down to Dillard to enroll in Dillard University in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And, I was there one day.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, it was freshmen week.  This was the first time I'd been away from home on my own for an extended time.  And, I got registered in school and I was walking around what little campus they had then.  And, finally, I sat down on the steps behind the building.  And, I'm just sitting there trying to figure out what to do with myself.  I didn't know anybody.  I was trying to figure out how to meet somebody, and the door opened behind me.  And, this fellow [William Stuart Nelson] said, "Young man, would you mind getting up and going somewhere else, we're about to have a meeting in here?"  Now, they didn't have air condition in those days and they'd opened the door to get some air.  I looked up at him, he had on pinstriped breeches, a swatch tailcoat, a high starched collar, and a little fancy tie.  I said to myself, "I bet that's the president."  I got up.  I moved.  I said, "But, if that guy is the president, I don't wanna go to this school."  He bound to know this is freshmen week.  He didn't even introduce himself.  He didn't do anything but ask me to leave.  I left.  I went straight to the, to the treasurer's office, asked for my money back, got it, next morning I was on my way to Atlanta, Georgia (laughter).
Story_ID: 484801
Speaker 1: When did you know you wanted to go to college?
Speaker 2: I guess, that was sort of a growth idea.  A little town like that, you're a long way from anything.  And, you're not exposed to a great amount of stuff.  My parents [Mae Dee Abner Moore and Jerry A. Moore, Sr.], my mother especially, like any mother should have, she had great dreams for her children.  But, whatever advantage that she could expose us to, she did it.  I remember that she took me to hear Roland Hayes, who's a great tenor singer.  She took me to hear the Fisk Jubilee Singers.  Whatever there was of cultural advantage she tried to exposure us to it.  Now, these things didn't take place in Minden [Louisiana], they took place in Shreveport [Louisiana], which was a very large city.  And, we would drive over there and attend these functions.  Now, my--she sent my oldest sister [Mildred Moore Clark] to Spelman preparatory school [Atlanta, Georgia] in the sixth grade.  Later on, she sent my youngest sister to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was my younger sister [Abner Moore Lewis] who acquainted me with Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia].  I didn't know one earthly thing about it.  I didn't even know it existed.  And, she finally convinced me all to go there, and that's why I went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After I departed from Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  My, my reason for being at Dillard, I was the last child and expenses had been very heavy on my mother and my father for these and my--looking after the other three children.  Now, if I went to Dillard I could live with my sister.  That would not cost anything.  And, I was trying to lessen the burden on them.  Consequently, with my disallowing Dillard as a part of my educational venture, I went on to Morehouse and determined I could make it for myself.
Story_ID: 484802
Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], let's go back to Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] for a little bit.  You said that you think that gentlemen that told you to move was the president [William Stuart Nelson].  Do you know who that president was?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I know who he was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you like to say a little bit about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't want to demean people.  I tell--probably, call his name as part of the story at Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All righty.  So, you went--you left Dillard and went on to Atlanta, Georgia, and decided to go to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yes, I matriculated at Morehouse.
Speaker 1: What was some of the classes that you took?
Speaker 2: Well, as you know, when you enter college, your first classes are more general than anything else.  You don't get to really concentrate until you decide a major.  I had English, economics, chemistry, those are some of the classes I remember.  Now, believe it or not, the majority of my classes was over at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].  The schools that entered into a, arrangement whereby I could take classes over there and I would get credit to Morehouse.  So, I had classes in literature mostly.  And, I was in the music department.  I studied voice under Willis Laurence James and under a lady by the name of Mrs. Mays [ph.], whose name I have forgotten now; first name.  So, I studied drama.  I had fifteen years of dramatic experience.  I played on the stage.  I sang with the glee club.  I was principal soloist for the Morehouse College Glee Club.  And, time to time I did solo work with the Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] choir.  I thought that I wanted to be an artist.  And, I took all of this drama and this literature and this music.  Preparatory to doing that, I was, eventually, admitted to the Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  I never did go because that time--by that time, my life turned the corner.  Although, all the training I received joyfully.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) so, what was your major at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: I majored in English (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In English.
Speaker 2: And, minored in music.
Speaker 1: In music, okay.
Story_ID: 484803
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers there?  Do you remember any of the teachers at, at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, you had B.T. Harvey [Burwell Towns Harvey], who taught math and chemistry.  He was head of the athletic department.  Back in those days, we didn't have a great cadre of teachers.  As a teachers, I had to be able to teach more than one thing as opposed to the way they do it now.  He's the only one that I, at this late date that I just really remember.  Ed Jones [Edward Allen Jones] who was the French teacher.  We used to call him "Joe Louis" Jones because he fooled around and got into a boxing match with one of the athletic boys.  And, boy knocked him out, so.  And, I studied French under him. Had a Mr. Lewis [ph.], don't recall his first name, but he taught Bible.  These are the ones I remember off handedly.
Story_ID: 484804
Speaker 1: Do you remember who was president at the time that you were at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: When I matriculated, they had a president who died [sic. resigned, Samuel Howard Archer] six months after I got there.  And, then they had an acting president with the remainder of, remaining portion of my college career, Hubert [Charles Dubois Hubert].  Dr. Hubert was the pastor of the Greensferry Baptist church [Providence Missionary Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] where I attended while I was a student there.  But, it's Dr. Hubert I remember best because he was with me and I worked for him as a chauffeur and butler and all that kind of thing as I said earlier, I went on to Morehouse.  I had determined that I was gonna make it for myself.  And, I did, doing various odd jobs.  Got a little scholarship as a window washer.  They have a hall there named Sale Hall.  Another named Graves Hall.  I lived in Graves Hall and I think I washed every window in (laughter) Graves Hall.  It was a three story building.  But, that's what I had to do to maintain my scholarship.  And, that help, that, that paid for my board.  I managed to do other things to take care of my room.  My mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] sent me a little money.  But, I was determined to make it for myself.
Speaker 1: Was your sisters in the need of--was your sister [Mildred Moore Clark] still in the Atlanta [Georgia] area when you came there?
Speaker 2: No.  She was graduated [from Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and went back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you do when you gradu- you graduated in 1940?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With a B.A. degree?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your, what was the degree in again, English?
Speaker 2: I majored in English (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) English, right.
Speaker 2: And, minored in music.
Speaker 1: In music.  Okay.
Story_ID: 484805
Speaker 1: Why did you chose English as your major?
Speaker 2: The intelligent thing to do is, that I didn't know any better.  Since I was majoring, I was in drama as an actor, I thought English would be a qualifying thing for the future if I was going on to be an actor.  I indicated that I had many courses in literature and I knew Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] backwards and forward.  I decided the, the only way I could get a degree was to get it in English if I was going into this field.  And, all these courses were in the fie- in the English department.  And, so, I decided to major in English, minor in music.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned the Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  Was that an offer that was given to you while you were still at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't offered.  I applied.
Speaker 1: You applied.
Speaker 2: And, was accepted.  I never went, but I was accepted.
Speaker 1: Was that while you were still at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My senior year.
Speaker 1: Your senior year, okay.  Why did you not, decide not to go?
Speaker 2: Well, when I finished college, actually, the best jobs that a colored person could get in those days was teaching job.  My father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] was a teacher.  My mother [Mae Dee Abner Moore] was a teacher.  My--the other sister [Abner Moore Lewis] was a teacher.  My oldest sister [Mildred Moore Clarke] was a social worker.  My brother [David Moore] was a teacher.  I did not want to be a teacher.  And, besides, they wasn't paying anything.  Well, I could make more money than that bumming around.  Now, from a children up, from the age from seven--about ten years old, I had been an apprentice in a painting business, and I learned to paint.  I learned the trade from the ground up.  Now, I could go out on a Saturday and make myself fifty dollars.  You see, back in those days, you didn't go to the store a buy paint any color you want.  They got machines over there, electronic machines over there that matches colors and all that stuff.  You had to know how to make 'em.  And, I learned all that.  How to make colors, shades of colors.  I, I could do it all.
Speaker 1: Who taught you how to do that?
Speaker 2: This fellow I mentioned earlier, Will Holmes [ph.], who was head of the BTU department, Baptist Training Union department [at St. Rest Baptist Church, Minden, Louisiana], was a painter by trade.  That was his trade.  And, also, I had learned to hang wallpaper.  He was a wallpaper hanger.  And, I had both these trades un- I knew how to do it.  And, so, I didn't need to be a teacher when I could go out and making money in the craft, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 484806
Speaker 1: So, when you came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No--you see, I was living in the president's house, Dr. Hubert [Charles Dubois Hubert] was acting president.  He lived in the acting president's house which was on campus [of Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The president [Samuel Howard Archer] had died [sic. resigned], and that house was vacant.  And, they put me in there as a scholarship to watch the house and I lived there.  The board of trustees called a new president, Dr. Benjamin Elijah Mays [Benjamin Mays].  And, he came to look at the house and I happened to be in the house when he came in there.  And, he asked me, "What was I going to do?"  When he ascertained that I was a college graduate.  And, I told him that, I was not sure.  That I thought the Lord had called me to preach and I wanted to go to a seminary.  I didn't know one to go to and I was just sitting there trying to figure it out.  And, he said, "What if I offer you a scholarship to come to school of religion at Howard University [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?"  I didn't even know there was a school of religion.  That was the only and the best offer I had.  So, I took him up on it.  These rest is history.
Speaker 1: How long after you graduated did you, did it take you to get to Howard?  Was that right away when you, after you met--?
Speaker 2: That was that fall.
Speaker 1: That fall, okay.
Story_ID: 484807
Speaker 1: When you said you think you were called to preach, what, what made you know that you were called to preach?
Speaker 2: Well, I was just an average boy, I put it that way.  I think I had the strength to--good times.  I could play a saxophone, clarinet, violin, all these instruments.  In those days, colored people didn't have anywhere to summer for their little parties except in their basement.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: In those days, it was popular to get a combo to come to your house to play for the little party.  I had a combo.  I could sing, play an instrument, and I get a guy with a guitar.  I know a guy (laughter), with a drum.  And, we get over in the corner, play for the little parties.  And, the dancing would go on and so forth and on.  We didn't get much money.  You might get five dollars, you might get ten.  But, that was nice.  And, so, that I did this to make extra money.  And, that helped me get through college [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I also played in the college band and the college orchestra.
Speaker 1: What instruments?
Speaker 2: I played the violin, second violin in the orchestra.  It was a symphony orchestra.  In the band I played the saxophone.
Speaker 1: How did you learn to play all these musical instruments?
Speaker 2: I taught myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before we lea- who was the act- who was the president that died [sic. resigned, Samuel Howard Archer] at, before Dr. Hubert [Charles Dubois Hubert] became acting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I've been trying to think of his name, and it just doesn't come to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 484808
Speaker 1: So, right after you get out of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], you matriculate on to Howard University [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: That fall, yes.  At the invitation of Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays].
Speaker 1: Now, you were in the bachelor program there to get a bachelor of divinity?
Speaker 2: I matriculated in the program for bachelor of divinity which now they have converted to a master of divinity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you remember what year you came to, to Howard?
Speaker 2: I came in 1940, 1940.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All righty.  What was it like at Howard at that time when you came?  And, what was, where was the school of religion located on the campus?
Speaker 2: When I came to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] it was sort of a clash type thing arrangement on the campus.  Unfortunately, the light-skinned students didn't have much to do with the real dark-skinned students.  This students of parents who weren't professional class didn't have a whole lot to do with either class (laughter).  They kind of shut off to themselves.  Now, the school of religion was located in the old Carnegie Library on 6th Street, which is now where the dean of the chapel has his office.  And, I think there are some other offices in there.  I'm not quite sure what they do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the dean of school of religion when you, when you came?  Was, was William Stuart Nelson still there?
Speaker 2: The school actually didn't have a dean 'cause Dr. Mays was just leaving.  Now, we come to the part, Dr. William Stuart Nelson was the president of the Dill- the university [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And, Dr. Mordecai Wyatt Johnson [Mordecai Johnson] was the president of Howard University and he made Dr. William Stuart Nelson the dean of the school of religion.  Dr. Nelson was president when I matriculated at Dillard (laughter).  Now, here I am, and matriculated in the School of Divinity, I'm under him, I didn't know that he'd been made the dean.  I joined the university choir out (unclear) university choir.  And, behold the first Sunday we sang, who was--who should I look up there and see as speaker but Dr. William Stuart Nelson.  Now, as I said, that's an interesting little story because I was trying to get away from him and I couldn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was, did you have any other action with Benjamin Mays, Dr. Mays?
Speaker 2: No.  Nothing but just to know him.
Story_ID: 484809
Speaker 1: Before we go any further, let's go back a little bit and talk about, when you talked about the class divisions there; the light and the dark.  How did that affect most students?  Now, did--it was just something commonplace?
Speaker 2: Well, really I didn't pay much attention to it, you know, being a good old southern boy.  I thought it was very silly.  Of course, down home, you mix with everybody.  I just didn't--I ignored it.  The other side of it was I was too busy trying to make my living and go to school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] 'cause I had to support myself.  And, I didn't join any of them--that type of thing 'cause I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, that's what it, it was sort of a class society at that time.
Story_ID: 484810
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that were at, in the divinity school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] at that time?  Was Howard Thurman still there?
Speaker 2: Howard Thurman was still there.  I had a class under Howard Thurman.  You had Dr. Farmer [James Farmer, Sr.] the father of the organizer or one of the organizers the, of the, what is that, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].  Yeah, James Farmer, Jr. [James Farmer].  You had a Dr. Carrington [William Orlando Carrington], who was very good in Christian education; Dr. E.C. Smith who taught church administration; pastor, Metropolitan Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].  Those were--and Dr. Nelson [William Stuart Nelson] taught also.  And, the faculty was small.  There were one or two other fellows there whose names I've forgotten.  You had Dr. Bell [William Yancey Bell], a Bishop Bell who taught Old Testament history.  The other fellow who was from Czechoslovakia who taught Old Testament for a while.  I could never understand what he was saying.  'Cause, he's, you know, hadn't learned the language well.  But, those were some of the principle teachers.
Speaker 1: What was your impression of President Mordecai Wyatt Johnson [Mordecai Johnson]?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any contact with him, to tell you the truth, at that time.  As I said, my business was just trying to get a theological education.  I would, I'd come to class and leave the class and I had to go to work.
Story_ID: 484811
Speaker 1: What type of work were you doing?
Speaker 2: Whatever I could find to do.
Speaker 1: Did you have a scholar--?
Speaker 2: At first I was a, first job I had I believe was an elevator operator.  Later on, I gave it up because I didn't like the arrangement and I became a cook.  We had a student cooperative among ourselves where we paid in a certain amount and I had to go buy the food and cook it; breakfast and dinner.  And, one fellow got his food free 'cause he washed the dishes.  But, we had, you can make an arrangement.
Speaker 1: Did you stay on campus [of the Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never lived--I only stayed on the campus for one night.  They used to have a building up there where the auditorium is called Clark Hall.  When I first came, I was put in a room in Clark Hall for one night with the understanding that I had to be out the next day.  But, I stayed out in the city.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where were you an oper- an elevator operator?
Speaker 2: I was an elevator operator in an apartment for Hispanic women mostly.  And, the reason I didn't like the job was because these women would go out on the town and some of 'em would get liquored up.  And, my job, when they came in in a cab all liquored up was to get 'em out the cab, onto the elevator, take 'em up to their room, opened the door and put 'em in there.  Well, they were sort of messy.  And, they wanted to hang all over me and all this kind of stuff, you know.  I tried to put 'em in the room, they want me to come in the room with them.  I didn't wanna do that.  So, I told the lady, this just wasn't consistent with the kind of life I wanted to life, and I appreciated the job.  But, I couldn't afford to do what I was doing; I quit.
Story_ID: 484812
Speaker 1: As a divinity student, did you have to do anything, what we would call a practice teaching or internships at a church or anything like that, as you were coming through?
Speaker 2: I was assigned to Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].  In those days, they had a program going asking judges to take theological student as a student understudy.  At first, I was sent to Florida Avenue [Florida Avenue Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.].  But, I was only there one Sunday.  And, then I was assigned to Nineteenth Street as a student minister.  And, where I remained, eventually was called as pastor and where I spent the next fifty-odd years of my life.
Story_ID: 484813
Speaker 1: Since President Johnson [Mordecai Johnson] was a, was a pastor as well, did he ever speak to your--on the campus to you?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: President (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. Johnson?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember having contact with him on this--on campus.  Now, it was after he retired that I had contact.  He lived next door here.  The university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] bought that house and put him in it after he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With his wife [Anna Gardner Johnson].  And, we talk from time to time, you know, across the fence.  He's very talkative gentleman.  And, but, be quite extended in his remarks if you would stand and listen to him.  But, we became good neighbors.
Speaker 1: Now, as a student, you had to go to chapel?
Speaker 2: At Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], yes.  We had to attend chapel every day except Saturday.
Speaker 1: What about, about Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, went twice on Thursday.  Prayer meeting on Thursday night to make up for Saturday.
Speaker 1: How about Howard?  Did you have to go to chapel?
Speaker 2: No.  They had chapel.  But, it wasn't mandatory.  You go if you wanted to go.
Speaker 1: The school of religion had a, they used to have an annual convocation.  Do you remember any of those?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They still do.  They have a convocation in, I forgot whether it's October or November right now.  But, that convocation still exists.  That, I might indicate that was instituted under Dr. Ellison [Constance M. Ellison].
Story_ID: 484814
Speaker 1: Did you, at that time, participate in any, any community active--campus activities or organizations?  Or, were you basically busy trying to get through school?
Speaker 2: I really didn't have time.  Because I came here, the United States had just ended World War II [WWII].  I was trying to be self-sufficient and look after myself, make my own living, and go to school [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.].  They were on the quarter semester system.  And, I took fifteen hours per quarter, which meant that if I had to work I didn't have any spare time.  I had to study on the bus, at the job, anywhere, anytime I could in order to keep up.  So, I didn't have time for campus activities.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  How far did you live from campus?
Speaker 2: I never lived very far.  I lived in U Street in the 300 block when I, the first residence I had.  I lived at 3026 Park Place, right above the university [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  The next room I had on 26 [Street]; that address doesn't exist anymore.  And, then I lived at 2702 Georgia Avenue, right across the street from the university; the last residence I had before I married [Ettyce Hill Moore].
Story_ID: 484815
Speaker 1: You mentioned while you were Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] that World War II [WWII] was, you know.
Speaker 2: World War II had just begun.  What they did was had a provision in the law that permitted theological students to register as IV-D [ministers of religion], which exempted them from [U.S.] military service.  Now, while I was exempt, I had to support myself.  Eventually, I believe it was my senior year, I got a job in the Civil Service Commission working at night.  So, trying to do eight hours on a job and fulfill all the requirements for graduation was quite a strenuous activity.  Thank god I made it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did 'em all.
Speaker 1: Were many students drafted from the campus?  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the undergraduate level, yes.  Not from the school of divinity.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were IV-D (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And we weren't drafted.
Story_ID: 484816
Speaker 1: What did you do right after graduation [from Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: After I finished, got my bachelor of divinity in theology, I returned to New Orleans [Louisiana].  And, I secured a job as program director and vice director of the park district USO [United Service Organizations].  At that time many soldiers were coming and going to training camps which meant that these soldiers rotated through the USO.
Speaker 1: Now, what is the USO?  What was, what was the US--?
Speaker 2: United Service Organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, there were two USO's actually, one for white and one for black.  It was black soldiers that rotated through the park district USO.  And, I had to provide entertainment for them.  Programs, keep something in their minds.  Something that they could look forward to 'cause they were very short-term.  They might be on their way to a camp in Texas, or one in Louisiana, or they might be on (unclear) on their way to some other camp.  So, you'd have to have something for them.  They stayed out at what was called Camp Harahan [Louisiana] mostly, when they were in transition like that.  And, so, sometimes I had a supply of army trucks coming in and I had to have a cadre of young women to take out to the camp where they could dance and socialize.  And, then I had to haul 'em back in town.  And, so they could get home.  So, I was involved in a variety of promotions during that period at the USO.
Speaker 1: And, where did you go from the USO?  How long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: My stay there was brief.  I went over to the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] as a boys who work secretary.  Now, my principle job there was to organize Hi-Ys in public schools.  Every school had a number, like McDonogh Number 10[McDonogh No. 10, New Orleans, Louisiana], McDonogh Number 11[McDonogh No. 11, New Orleans, Louisiana], McDonogh Number 12[McDonogh No. 12, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And, so, I organized these groups in these schools, plus carried on limited activities at the YMCA headquarters.  Which consisted of different kinds of games, sometime athletic events, that type of thing.
Story_ID: 484817
Speaker 1: When did you decide to come back to Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I was working in the Port of Embarkation [New Orleans Port of Embarkation, New Orleans, Louisiana] at the time as a counselor.  And, I found this to be a very disagreeable situation because they wanted me to do what I would do under no circumstance.  (Sneezes) My thoughts were on I'm trying to advance my people.  The confidant called me in one day and gave me a lecturer on integration.  Which I respectfully listened to because I'd always been taught to be respectful to the people who are in charge of me.  But, after he got through talking about that none of this was going to happen during the war [World War II, WWII].  We had to win the war and then we'll get around to that.  Get around to the subject of integration.  I thanked him for the job, thanked him for the amount of money that I was earning, thanked him for the opportunity.  But, very firmly let him know that I didn't agree.  And, that I was resigning as of now.  And, I walked out the Port of Embarkation back to where I lived.  And, there was a telegram there from the lady who is now my wife [Ettyce Hill Moore], saying that the gentlemen who assist to the pastor has accepted other employment and they wanted me to come back to Nineteenth Street [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.].  I'd been there three years and they knew me.  And, I accepted this invitation to come back and went back to Wash- came back to Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this was 1946?
Speaker 2: That was in 1946.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that was when you married your wife?
Speaker 2: I married her in 1946.  In error saying 1946.  It was 1944.  And, I served as assistant pastor to the pastor.  He died.  And, I became acting pastor, and I served in that capacity.  And, then the church called me as pastor--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1946.
Speaker 1: In 1946.
Speaker 2: But, that was a big year.  I received a pastorate.  I was married.  And, I had my first baby [Jerry A. Moore III].  Almost more than I can handle.
Story_ID: 484818
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your courtship.  Did you know her before you came back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: When you was in--
Speaker 2: She was a member.
Speaker 1: --in church?  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You knew her before you left Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I knew her.  I met her when I was assigned to Nineteenth Street [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, she was Sunday school pupil, and I met her.  It was interesting how I really met her.  The Sunday school wanted to have a talent show.  And, I had just arrived at the church, and didn't know anybody really.  The superintendent approached me out of courtesy more than anything else and asked me would I like to participate in the talent show.  And, I told her, "Yes, I'd participate."  Well, she said, "What would you like to do?"  I said, "Well, I'll sing a song if I had a pi- if somebody would play."  And, so, she called my present--my wife over who was not my wife then, and introduced us.  And, she agreed that if I came to her house and brought the music so she could practice it, that she would play.
Speaker 1: What is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Ettyce [Ettyce Hill Moore].
Speaker 1: What was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Hill.
Speaker 1: Hill, okay.
Speaker 2: And, so, I went to her house to practice the song and the rest of the story is history.
Speaker 1: Was your wedding there at, at Nineteenth Street?
Speaker 2: It was at Nineteenth Street.  It was a big wedding, formal wedding.  We were married, had our honeymoon, came back, started out as a young couple without any money, and returned to war [World War II, WWII].  I had trouble getting a hold of a bed and all the things we needed to make a little apartment.  And, so, we finally got some things together and started our lives out.  And, I, as I've said, I spent the next fifty or more years at the church.
Speaker 1: Did your wife know what she was getting into when, when she married you, and knew you were getting ready to be pastor?
Speaker 2: I think love blinded both of us.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Neither one of us knew.  We were just so much in love and just going along.
Story_ID: 484819
Speaker 1: Nineteenth Street [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] was one of the real prominent churches in the area during that time.  Tell me a little bit about the pastor who passed away, Walter Brooks [Walter Henderson Brooks].
Speaker 2: Dr. Walter Brooks was a former slave.  He was about fourteen years old when slavery was over.  But, he managed to obtain an education.  Took a master's degree from Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  Became pastor of Nineteenth Street in his early career, came up from New Orleans [Louisiana] where he was a missionary took--and to Richmond [Virginia] and he pastored there.  And, was called from his church in Richmond [Second African Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] to Nineteenth Street where he spent the next sixty-three years.  He was a very eloquent man, in looks and in speech.  A very severe man in a sense, could very, could be very kind.  But, he could be very, very severe with the congregation.  I remember one story they told on him.  He had this couple in his church that claimed that they had never had a disagreement.  And, Dr. Brooks, once in the morning told about them and that they never had a disagreement.  Now, he was, Dr. Brooks was about 6'3" or something like that.  So, he pulled himself up his height, he always pointed when he wanted to make a point.  So, he says, "Now, I want that couple to stand up."  They stood up, smiling.  And, he says, "Now, I want you to look at the two biggest liars in this congregation," (laughter).  He'd been married three times.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And, he knew better than that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, he was a very fine pastor.  In those days, you were required, the biggest requirement I should say, was your preaching ability.  And, he was a masterful preacher.  Now, so far his organization, he didn't bother with that.  But, he was an eloquent preacher.
Story_ID: 484820
Speaker 1: As a young man, you came there, you were probably around maybe twenty-eight something like that, when you came back as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was twenty-seven--
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven.
Speaker 2: When I became pastor [at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did the congregation take to such a young pastor?
Speaker 2: Well, they just looked at me as a boy.  Which I had boy's features.  I had--some men hold their boy's features for a long time, and I still had boy's features.  They just referred to me as, "That boy."  And, they always treated me nice and everything.  And, I was trying to get done what I was called to do.
Speaker 1: What was some of the programs you think that you had--were in charge of doing while you were, when you first came there?
Speaker 2: Well, there were no programs except those programs run by the auxiliaries.  Every auxiliary was deciding what it was gonna do.  Now, I tried to encourage them in what they were doing.  They had good programs.  For instance, there was one club that had had about four hundred members.  And, they fed the hungry and clothed the naked, made visits to prisons, and they looked after senior citizens.  What they now call senior citizen's homes, down at Blue Plains [Washington, D.C.], they had the Home for the Aging [Washington Home for the Aged and Infirm, Washington, D.C.].  Which was run mostly voluntarily.  And, this club used to haul food down there.  I've carried many of bag of potatoes and, crates of oranges, and onions on my back, down there at that time to try to help these people.  So, I mostly encouraged those groups that were trying to do good.  Now, in addition to that, I began to try to institute programs that I knew there should be.  For instance, the Vacation Bible School, that was a new concept back then.  I had the first one upon black churches.  I don't know about the white ones.  But, I had the first Vacation Bible School.  I remember with what vigor many of the older members thought I shouldn't be doing this, but I did it anyhow.  And, now many ministers have Vacation Bible Schools.  I instituted the lenten service that is still evoked today, every Wednesday during Lent.  Many, many people of all denominations come to this service.  And, that was the (unclear) of the church.  I instituted a youth camp that was named after my wife, Camp Mo-Tyce.  They take these children out to a location and run a camp for children.
Story_ID: 484821
Speaker 1: One of the biggest things I felt almost from the time I became pastor was the Lord wanted me to move the church.  Gentrification was taking place in the neighborhood.  I was aware--Campbell Johnson [Campbell Carrington Johnson] was the trustee there and he was, came to Howard school of religion [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] and he taught a course and on the college, on the college here.  And, I came to know that the movement of the business part of the city was moving west.  I also came to know that George Washington University [Washington, D.C.] wanted to encompass that whole area between 19th [Street] and 22nd Street; Virginia Avenue and Pennsylvania Avenue.  I knew that.  And, I knew there was gonna be a big fight.  I also knew that Chestnut Farms Dairy [Chestnut Farms Chevy Chase Dairy, Washington, D.C.] which had a facility back there on 24th Street was going to have to move, get out of there, going out of business.  I also became aware that in order for these things to take place that they had to purchase the land.  Now, who lived on the land?  The majority of them were colored folks (laughter).
Speaker 2: Let's go back just a little bit, I'm a get--
Speaker 1: And, they were members of Nineteenth Street [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteenth Street.
Story_ID: 484822
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit because that was a good little while after, when the, when the church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] moved.  Let me take you back just a little to--back to when you first came there.  Who was some of the people that were attending your church at that time?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I understand Duke Ellington was a member at one time.
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't.
Speaker 1: He wasn't a member?
Speaker 2: He was a member of John Wesley [Metropolitan Wesley African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His mother--
Speaker 1: His mother went to--
Speaker 2: His mother-in-law, his wife [Edna Thompson], were members of there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had two children but they weren't by his wife [sic.].  He was living in New York [New York] at that time.  But, I baptized his children.  Now, Rayford Logan's mother was the last of the old shouters.  Rayford left, didn't join.  But, his mother came regular.  He brought her and sat there with her.  But, she would get up and shout.  And, she would move across the front of the church, get her little shout and go back and sit down.  You had a good little group of people there.  You had Dr. Houston who was a general practitioner, Charles Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston].  Oh, no, not Charles, I done forgot his first name.  Charles Houston was the first judge, colored judge on the, I forget what kind of court you call it then.  But, this was his brother [William Houston].  I don't, I just don't--you asked me so suddenly I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay.  No problem.
Speaker 2: --pull up the names.  But, he had a professional group, a cadre of professional people--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there.  Teachers, principals, Martha Winston, was there who was principal of that school out there on Benning Road.  Now, that elementary school [Charles Young Platoon School, Washington, D.C.], can't think of the name of it now.  But, that was a good little group of them there; decent, struggling, striving, black people.  And, then you had the domestic class, were proud, you never know they were domestic by the way the carried themselves.  But, they were fine people.  And, they were the kind of people I always said that I cut my teeth on, who made me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Had a woman by the name of Miss Randolph [ph.] who was an English teacher, who kept tabs on my speech.  Coming from Louisiana, from that Creole influence, I thought I was speaking beautifully.  But, I didn't realize that I was tainted.  And, on Mondays come around, I get this little blue envelope, where she had detailed all the missed pronounced words, that is good English.  And, I was angry, why she should be punishing me like this.  But, I, she made a very good speaker out of me.  Getting my lang- get my, getting the, you know, these Creole phrases and all these things that I had been pronouncing they would understand them at home.  But, they wouldn't understand them here.  So, she did--got that outta me.  And I thank God for all 'em.
Story_ID: 484823
Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], tell me about your children. Mrs. Moore [Ettyce Hill Moore] and I have two children, two boys.  The first one is Jerry A. Moore III; named after his father. He's a lawyer in a law firm, a partner at a law firm.  He is the chairman of the Washington area Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.].  The second one is name Juran Dwayne Moore, Sr. [Juran D. Moore, Sr.].  He is retired.  He is a minister.  And, he lives in Florida, Palm Coast, Florida.  They are both good boys.  The oldest boy has just entered the senior citizens rank.  And, the youngest boy is right on the doorsteps of being a senior citizen.
Speaker 2: And, do you have grandchildren?
Speaker 1: I have grandchildren.  Two grandsons [Juran D. Moore, II and Percy T. Moore], and a granddaughter [Sydni M. Williams].  And, I have grand--great-grandchildren.  I usually put it this way, I have five I know about (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 484824
Speaker 1: Coming into the '50s [1950s] now, we need to talk a little bit about Civil Rights Movement.  One of the things that really happened was the Brown v. Board of Education, 1954 [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  And, there was one case here Bolling v. Sharpe [Bolling v. Sharpe, 1954] that was part of that.  Were, did, any, did you have anything to do with that, or did any of the members (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had nothing to do with either case.  I did know the attorney, one of the attorney's, Charlie Houston [Charles Hamilton Houston], who was a part of that case.  I should say two, and E.C. Hayes [George E.C. Hayes] while he was a (unclear) out front.  Charlie Houston and E.C. Hayes, and [U.S.] Supreme Court justice--
Speaker 1: Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 2: From Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Thurgood Marshall.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Thurgood Marshall.  All these fellows worked together.  I knew them all.  Thurgood well.  But, I had nothing to do with that at all.  At that particular period, the School of Law at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] became actively engaged in civil rights issues.  And, it was cases like this that Marshall and Hayes and Houston prosecuted as well as other lawyers.
Story_ID: 484825
Speaker 1: What was going on in the community at that time?  What--around U Street, the Howard Theatre [Washington, D.C.], LeDroit Park [Washington, D.C.], what was going on in the '50s [1950s] in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The Howard Theatre was the live entertainment center for black people.  Your great bands, your great singers, came through there and performed at the Howard Theatre.  Now, U Street was the center of activity for black people.  You had the Booker T. Washington Theatre  [Booker T. Theatre, Washington, D.C.] down there, the Lincoln Theatre [Washington, D.C.], and one other one I've forgotten about right now.  But, this street constituted the center of activity for black people.  Say for instance, on Easter, you would have an Easter parade, and people would dress their finest, especially young people, and parade up and down U Street.  Of course, there were eating establishments on U Street where they could stop in and get something to eat.  Now, some of those establishments have gone out of business.  But some, I guess, the Chili Bowl [Ben's Chili Bowl, Washington, D.C.] is the only one that I know that has a long history of remaining in place.  The others have gone out of business and been replaced by Ethiopians or Asians and other people.  I don't know about them.  But, I do know about the early (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was a segregated city?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: What about some of the demonstrations that had taken place like, I know Peoples Drug Store [Peoples Drug Store, Inc., Washington, D.C.], they would--demonstrated because they would not serve?
Speaker 2: Well, that is true.
Story_ID: 484826
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about segregation in Washington [D.C.].  Did the church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] participate in any kinds of demonstrations that might have been taking place?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You had what was called Thompson's Restaurant [Washington, D.C.].  And, like other white establishments it was segregated.  Now, Dr. Jernagin, J.H. Jernagin [sic. William H. Jernagin], pastor of Mount Carmel Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], and Miss Terrell [Mary Church Terrell], and Dr. Brooks  [ph.] of the Congregational church went and sat-in at Thompson's Restaurant.  Of course, they were denied service.  They took their case to court, all the way to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, and they ruled that this was unconstitutional.  They found what was called the laws, I believe, of 1876, which were a part of the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] laws at that time.  When the laws of the District of Columbia were re-codified, somehow these got left out.  And, the court ruled that these laws were still valid.  But, consequently, segregation in restaurants, theaters, and other public places disappeared in the District of Columbia.
Story_ID: 484827
Speaker 1: During this time, you went back to Howard [Howard University School of Divinity, Washington, D.C.] and earned your master's degree.  What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: And, the degree was?
Speaker 2: Master of Arts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, this is in religious education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, then after that, you became the Baptist chaplain for Howard University?
Speaker 2: I became the Baptist chaplain to Baptist students and Baptist faculty at Howard University.  There were other chaplains there also, like Episcopal, and Methodist, Catholic, they were chaplain to their constituents.
Story_ID: 484828
Speaker 1: As we move into the '60s [1960s], let's talk about the March on Washington.  The 1963 march and the famous, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], I Have a Dream speech.  Were you, were you at the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] that day?
Speaker 2: I was at the Mall that day.
Speaker 1: Tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: I'll begin it this way.  I was a board member of the Baptist Royal Alliance [sic. Baptist World Alliance].  I was attending a board meeting in Waco, Texas, at Baylor University.  I took a plane back to Washington [D.C.] for that March.  I arrived just in time to walk from Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.], which was located at 19th [Street] and Ash Street at that time, down to Constitution Avenue, 19th and Constitution Avenue just as the march was one block away at 18th [Street] and Constitution Avenue.  I was able to join the front of the march as we marched up to the monument.  People were line up from the monument, around the Reflecting Pool [Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, Washington, D.C.], all the way back up the Mall to 7th Street.  Martin Luther King gave his famous, I Have a Dream speech on that occasion.  It was quite a day.
Story_ID: 484829
Speaker 1: One of the other things that was going on in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] was the D.C. residents not being able to vote.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I participated in the early effort.  They gave us, some of us, cards to go around from door to door asking people to sign it saying they wanted to vote.  I was living on 21st Street NE at that time.  I walked all over that neighborhood with my cards asking people to sign them saying they wanted to vote.  Now, you would be surprised how many black people refused to sign the card, which in effect meant that they weren't really interested in a vote.  So, that was way back in the '50s [1950s] when we were trying to get something going.  And, it just hadn't caught on at that time.  People didn't seem to be interested.  After thinking about it, many of these people were in the lowest paying jobs in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] and the adjacent region which had not grown up as it has today.  They worked for white people.  And, the temperament was to be very careful about what you did.  Because if it get back to the boss, you just might not have a job.  So, they were very timid.  It was hard to get people to cooperate back then in those kinds of ventures.
Story_ID: 484830
Speaker 1: You also became an instructor at the Washington Baptist Seminary [Washington, D.C.].  That was in--around 1964?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you teach?
Speaker 2: I taught biblical interpretation.  I remember I had one class, very fine group, they were grown people.  People who had never had the opportunity to go to a seminary, and many of them had not finished the fifth grade.  But, the effort was to try to transmit something to them that would help them be better pastors of their people.  In this particular class I had a fellow and I was teach a course on creation.  And I said, "Now, every religion has a creation story."  It's--all of 'em don't have the same ones in the Bible.  I said, "Now, in fact, (unclear) there's two of 'em in the Bible. It's just a matter of what you wanna believe."  This fellow hadn't heard that there were more than one creation story.  He jumped up and said, "Ain't but one episode.  Ain't but one episode."  And, stumped out the class.  It was two weeks before I could get him back in there (laughter), to continue teaching him.  I will say that he became a very fine pastor, and built a church, and has a very fine congregation.  But that was a start.
Story_ID: 484831
Speaker 1: Also, in the '60s [1960s], getting back to politics.  That was when Mayor Washington [Walter Washington] was appointed, around '60 [1960], I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, around--
Speaker 1: --as mayor-commissioner--
Speaker 2: Around that time.  Maybe, no, he was appointed mayor.  It was a fellow who was before him that was appointed mayor-commissioner [sic.].  I'll trying to think of his name; forgot his name.
Speaker 1: And, Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was the one that appointed him, him mayor.  Speak to that, and what that meant for D.C. [Washington, D.C.]
Speaker 2: It was a beginning.  It was a little ray of hope.  We had three commissioner before that.  A commissioner who was in charge of educations.  A commissioner who was in charge of engineering.  A commissioner who was in charge of architecture and that kind of stuff.  Each one of them had division of what they were supposed to be responsible for.  With the demise of the commissioner form came the mayor-commissioner form of government.  And, then came the (background noise) commiss- I mean, the, the mayor under Walter Washington and, the appointed council.  The formula was party in office controlled nine seats and the party out of office had three seats.  And, so, there were Johnson was the Democrat so, he had six seats for Democrats and three seats for Republicans.

Speaker 1: We'll move on to 1968 and of course, that was the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]   And, there were lots of riots here in the D.C. [Washington, D.C.] area.  Can you talk to, speak to that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My wife [Ettyce Hill Moore] and I, and the head of one of our units in the church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] were having dinner at the corner of 14th [Street] and Quincy Street.  And, when we came out of the establishment, I looked up the street, we saw all of this smoke.  And, we saw people running up the street with televisions, with shoes, anything they could grab, they had it, going north on 14th Street.  And, then the news came through that the riots were out.  And, that's where, this fellow [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture], I forgot his name, was running around talking about, "Burn, baby burn."  You know, he eventually, fled to Africa and stayed over there a long time before he came back.  But, he was a student at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  The riots were on then.  They burned up a great deal of the area up there on 14th Street around the Irving [Street], along through there.  Well, I was a councilman by then, and they invited me and some of the activist, invited me to come up there and speak to 'em.  I knew them, some of 'em.  And, they knew me very well.  And, they knew what I would more or less take up for anybody, you know, try to help 'em out.  So, I went up there that night to speak to them.  And, the meeting got along very well 'til they got to me.  And, I got up and said, "Now, fellows you got to understand that whoever owns this land, still owns it.  They got to deed to it.  Now, you'll never get a hold of it."  I said, "It'll be just a matter of time before they, the owners, will make some disposition one way or the other to sell it to somebody else, or put something on it themselves."  I said, "Now, burning down this stuff, you're fighting a losing cause."  They picked me up and threw me out on 14th bodily (laughter).  Being the kind of stubborn fellow I am, I got up and brushed myself off and walked back in there.  And, I told 'em, I said, "Now, y'all can throw me out again if you want to.  But, I'm telling you like it is.  You don't own it.  You don't have any money to buy it.  You're never own it.  You better make peace with somebody."  Now, shortly, it wasn't many years after that, I became chaplain at the D.C. jail [D.C. Central Detention Facility, Washington, D.C.].  'Lo and behold here some of these brothers was sitting up in the jailhouse.  I said, "What you doing in here?  I thought you were going up there and grab the land."  "Well, I can't get no land in here."  I said, "I told you, you wasn't gonna get it."  Well, anyway, we became good friends 'cause I did a lot of nice things for 'em while they were in jail.  But, some of the fellows who were protesting in those days, I was able to turn them around to become another type of activist.  I tried to show them how economically they needed to start demonstration to get people with money and know how to come in and redevelop the land.
Story_ID: 484833
Speaker 1: Very interesting story 'cause they burnt down 8th--parts of 8th Street also.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, the interesting thing about it, I had been up there on 14th Street, those five-and-tens during the cold weather carrying placards and parading along with other demonstration to get colored folks jobs in the five-and-ten cent stores.  And, finally, they broke and employed colored women.  So, I dressed myself one day, I'm going up here and see my sisters.  And, I went up to the store and I walked up one aisle, down the other, and all over the place.  They all look white to me.  So, I saw somebody I thought must've been the manager.  And, I went up to him, I said, "Where the colored folks that you hired?"  He pointed them out.  They got the fairest colored women they could find (laughter).  I look him straight in the eye and said, "We, want some black folks in here.  So, you'll know 'em when you see 'em," (laughter).  So, they integrated all right, but, they integrated with light-skinned colored women.
Speaker 2: The person that you talked about that's a student at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], was that Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] that was doing the "Burn, baby burn"?
Speaker 1: Stokely Carmichael, that's the guy, "Burn baby burn."
Speaker 2: "Burn, baby burn."
Speaker 1: And, his next thing was, "Grab the land, grab the land."  That's where I took exception.  'Cause these people owned that land, owned this land outright.  And, they had the deed to it, they wasn't gonna give it to 'em.
Story_ID: 484834
Speaker 1: You spoke about you becoming a council member.  How did you get into Republican politics?
Speaker 2: Well, back when [U.S.] Congress was deliberating, on first just giving us to vote for presidential election.  The presidential candidates, Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] was one of 'em, I forgot the other one.  I think it was Rockefeller [Nelson Rockefeller].  I'm not sure right now.  But, they were around trying to solicit votes.  And, they're trying to get colored people to join their party.  All the black folks that I knew were running and jumping in the Democratic Party.  I said, "Now, you can't put too many crabs in a tub 'cause the tub a run over.  I'm gonna looking around here and see where nobody's going."  And, I looked at the Republican Party and they had all these vacancies.  I said, "That's where I'm going."  'Cause all these folks can't get nothing in the Democratic Party.  I'm going over there where they need somebody.  I was think turning my own political future because since Democrats, let's say they had a dozen slots, well, a thousand people can't fill a dozen spots.  Over there in the Republican Party, let's say they had ten positions and no colored people, so, I could pick my own.  And, that's what I did (laughter).
Story_ID: 484835
Speaker 1: Explain to me what, you were a member-at-large, explain what that entailed.
Speaker 2: Under the charter that [U.S.] Congress issued to the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.], I might say, the charter giving the District limited home rule, two seats were reserved for minority parties.  The Republican Party is a minority party in the District of Columbia.  So, I ran to be a councilman-at-large.  That's what it means.  All over the city instead of a ward.  By that time, I conceived politically.  I had established enough identity and performed enough service in the District of Columbia, be known by a good percentage of the people everywhere.  And, so, I ran on that platform that I wanted to be a council member-at-large.  And, I won.
Speaker 1: Did you get much backlash from, since this is a Democratic city basically, from black who were Democrats?
Speaker 2: I got wonderful cooperation.  Many of them changed their party to vote for me.  That is in the primary.  And, then they switched back so they could vote in their party in the final.
Speaker 1: What was some of the committees that you worked on as a council member?
Speaker 2: I was assigned to the committee on public works [Committee on Public Works and Transportation].  That's--and, I reminded there for the entire period of my council-matic activity.  Public works included all the streets, all the alleys in the District of Columbia.  It included the air, the water, the garbage, sewerage, everything that affects the environment I had that under by charge.  Now, I was appointed.  Centered also included transportation, I was appointed to the Metro board [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority].
Story_ID: 484836
Speaker 1: Around 1970, we finally get a D., a D.C. [Washington, D.C.] representative in [U.S.] Congress.  Could you talk to that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, when Congress first granted permission to have representative in congress it was non-voting representation.  Interestingly enough, Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] ran.  This was before I ran for council [Council of the District of Columbia].  I also ran for that.  Fauntroy beat me by two votes (laughter).  And, he became the non-voting representative to Congress.  And, he served there until he retired from that service.  Later, I ran for the council, and I won that.  Now, with the--as a non-voting representative, you could go to meetings, you could talk.  But, when the, if a bill came to the floor, you couldn't vote.  So, your effectiveness was not always obvious.
Story_ID: 484837
Speaker 1: Also, during that time, you helped found the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials [COMTO] at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Why did you do that and what did the conference do?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story.  I was appointed to the Metro board [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority], and I, attending as a representative, a transit meeting in Mexico City [Mexico] under the auspices of APTA.  At that time, you had divisions of transportation representation agencies.  APTA became the overall agency.
Speaker 1: Do you know what that stood for?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What did APTA stand for?
Speaker 2: American Public Transit Association [American Public Transportation Association].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, this was supposed to be an international meeting with representatives from Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  There were five hundred of us there.  There were only eight black people out of five hundred.  We had nothing to do but sit and listen.  We weren't assigned to a committee at all.  We resented it.  I raised the issue, and we created a noise at the convention that eventually caused them to elect one black to head a committee.  She looked like a white woman.  You didn't know she wasn't black, or that she wasn't white.  She was out of Chicago [Illinois].  But, anyway, there was a fellow who was heading the [U.S.] Department of Transportation at that time, who was a Hispanic.   As fate would have it, I went down to the little breakfast room in the hotel, sat down beside this nice plump little lady at the counter and just began to engage in conversation with her.  A few minutes later, a fellow came down and sat down on the other side of her.  And, he reached across his wife and introduced himself.  He said, "I'm Federico [Federico Pena].  I'm secretary of transportation."  I said, "Thank you, Jesus."  And, I brought up my complaint to him.  He says, "I think," he said, "I think something ought to be done about this."  He said, "When I get back to Washington [D.C.], have my staff investigate the number of minorities who are holding any relevant positions in transportation in the cities."  Now it so happened that there was a minority division in the Department of Transportation at the time.  And, a fellow by the name of Harold Williams was heading that division.  And, he has that sensor system, a lady.  And, he assigned her to dig up this information, and they found twenty-one people that the Department of Trans- that they paid the expenses to Washington to a meeting at Howard University.  And, that's when COMTO was born, as a result of that.
Story_ID: 484838
Speaker 1: You may have heard of the lady who was head of Metro [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority] at one time, that's the lady.  Trying to think of her name, it just didn't come to me.
Speaker 2: So, it was a black lady?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Carmen Turner [Carmen E. Turner]?
Speaker 1: Carmen Turner.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I recommended her as the CEO of COMTO [Conference of Minority Transportation Officials].  I was on the nominating committee and I nominated her for the chairman.  And, you could've heard a pin drop in that room.  And, all of a sudden the meeting recessed.  And, all these others run to, to the telephone to find out from their jurisdiction what to do (laughter).  But, anyway, they came back and she was unanimously approved as a CEO of the company.  And, she turned out to be one of the best they ever had.  So, that's the way COMTO was born.  It had a rough journey getting to where it is today because when you're trying to sail uncharted waters, it's hard.  But, we have thirty-five chapters throughout the United States now.  And, I think there're about thirty some transit systems today that are headed by minorities in the principle cities of this country.  When I made my complaint there were none.  We're meeting in Miami, Florida in the latter part of June for our national convention.  That system is headed by a minority and I, when I'm using a federal definition of minority.  Unfortunately, they just let him out.  He's a Hispanic.  But--
Speaker 2: So, you're still active in this organization?
Speaker 1: I, in a way, yes.  I go to all the national meetings.  I guess, I'm a relic.  And, they paid my expenses and look after me while I'm there at the convention.
Story_ID: 484839
Speaker 1: Did you wanna say anything else about that transportation--?
Speaker 2: No.  I think that's the summary of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we're getting to the, as we're getting into the '70s [1970s], [U.S.] Congress in '73 [1973] passed the District of Columbia Home Rule Act [District of Columbia Home Rule Act, 1973].  Could you talk to that?
Speaker 2: The Home Rule Act was the result of a, many years of lobbying to bring us to that point.  Now, what we have is limited home rule.  For instance, every bill passed by the council [Council of the District of Columbia] and signed by the mayor has to be approved by Congress.  They have thirty days.  It lays on the table in Congress for thirty days.  Any objection, that bill is of non-effect.  Now, they did not give us the privilege of electing our judges.  They are still nominated by the president, confirmed by the [U.S.] Senate.  They did not give us the final authority over our budget.  The Congress still decides the budget.  Sometime, they have to have a continuing act bill.  That is, they don't get around to approving the budget at the certain time.  And, so, they pass a bill that allows you to continue to operate under the old budget until they get around to voting on a new budget.  So, we don't have control over some very important things here.  The people who sends us the deal, we don't decide whose gonna do that.  Congress decides it.  We don't have full representation in Congress.  We have the privilege of electing non-voting delegate to Congress.  Now, we have two shadow senators and two shadow representatives.  They are nonpaid people.  That's fear right there in itself.  That's powerlessness.  Now, Congress still through--dictates a lot of things that goes on, go on in the district.  We can only tax land in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.] outside the federal district.  So, it limits the income to those who are supposed to be the diminutions here.  For instance, we don't own the majority of the land.  United States government sits on the majority of it, and we can't tax that.  And, so, the district only has income from limited resources; from the land, and from fees.  Those are the two sources that we get our money from.  Now, you have the federal appropriation.  The federal appropriation is supposed to take care of the federal part; education, public safety, certainly health services, and the like.  Now, they determine who much that's gonna be.  So, they give us that money to take care of their business.  All these parades that come here, what do you call 'em, demonstrations, we have to pay for it.  If Congress doesn't cough up the money to pay for all the mess a lot of people make when they come here to demonstrate.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We have to cough up the money.
Story_ID: 484840
Speaker 1: Who are the key blacks that are trying to get things changed?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say the non-voting representative, Eleanor Holmes Norton, is one of those.  There are certain committees, the name of which I cannot immediately call, that are quietly working behind the scenes trying to get things changed.  You see, every congressman who comes here, his first responsibility is to represent his district (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And, he is not much concerned about what's gonna happen to people in District [Washington, D.C.].  He's gotta watch out for home base or he won't be back.  He or she won't be back.  So, when you consider, now, the Council of One Hundred [sic. Committee of 100 on the Federal City], it's a rare privilege to be on the Council of One Hundred.  A lot of people don't understand that the Council of One Hundred, plus some factions of the Council of Governments [Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments] that actually determine what's going on.  The rest follow suit.
Story_ID: 484841
Speaker 1: All this time that you are busy in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] politics, you were still pastor of Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: All right.  In 1975 is when you made your move.  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] appointed me to the council.  This was before the elected council [Council of the District of Columbia].  I managed to get that appointment to the council under the old formula of six and three.  And, they had six Republicans and three Democrats at that time because the Republicans were the ruling party.  Now, when we got the charter, home rule, I ran.  I was elected a councilman-at-large by the people.  And, I was their representative.  Now, what happens in a situation like that, you will find that in the district budget, the Department of Public Works [D.C. Department of Public Works] receives so much money from the D.C. budget.  In order to supplement that budget, there are congressional appropriations.  If you're going to apply for one of those grants, it also means you have to be in a position to equal that grant, match that grant.  If you don't have the money to match it, you're not gonna get it.  Now, I was often criticized for the amount of money that was left up there.  But, the people didn't understand I couldn't get it 'cause there was no money to get it with.  So, that meant the city had to go wanting in that area for something that could've been done if we could have--had the money to match the grant.
Speaker 1: How did this affect Nineteenth Street?
Speaker 2: I don't think it affected them at all 'cause I made it perfectly clear, whenever I'm due at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, don't look for me.  I never missed a meeting.  I never missed a Sunday.  I never started a service late.  I always kept myself in a position, whoever wanted to see me, didn't have to wait 'til tomorrow to do it.  I saw that it was done immediately.
Story_ID: 484842
Speaker 1: So in 1975, Nineteenth Street [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] moves to 16th Street?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, it didn't make any difference that this was a historic landmark?
Speaker 2: In the mind of certain people, yes.  There were some who didn't wanna go; thought we outta stay down there, but when you see the colleges of the city, at what's happening and what's gonna take place, you know you gonna be out of business if you stay where you are.  And, so, I knew these things.  And, it took me twenty years to do it.  But, I felt that this is what the Lord wanted me to do.  And, so, I put myself to the task of doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the surrounding property was being brought up by commercial ventures.  So, they were sort of moving other--everything out at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  General, oh, not general, PEPCO [Potomac Electric Power Company] wanted that property.  They wanted to expand.  George Washington University [Washington, D.C.] wanted to expand.  Other interested, wanted to have big holdings down there.  Now, they were buying up the property where my members live.  They were moving uptown.  Their children, after they had grown up, had lived from down there.  The populations itself was just dwindling that--the one I could depend on.  If I stayed down there, I'd been out of business.  But, how you gonna get somebody whose grandma was raised in that church, and who's great-grandma was baptized in that church, and whose uncles and aunts were married in that church, to see that.  All they could see was history.  They couldn't envision the future.  Yes, I had a, a tide to move against.  But, thank God Almighty, God provided me the way.
Story_ID: 484843
Speaker 1: Now 1976, the rapid tran- the Metro rapid transit system opened, and you were part of the Metro board [Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority].  Talk to me about that.
Speaker 2: The construction of a rapid rail system began at Judiciary Square [Washington, D.C.].  That's where the first hole was dug.  First, it was planned to build the line going out into Anacostia [Washington, D.C.].  Unfortunately, we couldn't get the people together on the alignment.  The way it works, an appropriation only lasts for one year.  And, if you don't use that money, it reverts back to the budget.  Now, time was running out.  I was conducting the hearing.  I conducted the hearing on every Metro station in alignment in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] And, I just couldn't get your people together.  Everybody knew where the line ran--should run, but the engineers (laughter).  So, in order not to lose that money, the bills aligned, we switched it over to a line from Rhode Island Avenue over to Connecticut [Avenue].  And, that's how that line, that's the first line that was built.  And, of course, we took the money that was gonna build a line going to Anacostia to build that line.  So, that left the alignment in place but there was no money to build it.  So, that's how the first line got built, from Rhode Island Avenue over to Connecticut.  It was easy to do because get agreement from the people.
Story_ID: 484844
Speaker 1: In 1984, you leave the city council [Council of the District of Columbia], were there any things that you felt that you, were left undone when you came out of office?
Speaker 2: Truthfully speaking, I think I accomplished the major things that I had the capacity to accomplish in my tenure.  I don't think I left anything undone.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five [1985], you became, you were part of the Home Mission Board.  Can you talk about that?  That was part of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I served as executive secretary of the Home Mission Board with the National Baptist Convention, Incorporated for twelve years.  I have 5 million people under my supervision and about thirty-seven thousand judges.  Now, the number sounds big but the problems of our people were larger.  At that time, there was increasing homelessness.  There was age, which is a new thing that we didn't know about, and was trying to find out about.  You had the questions of economic empowerment that we wasn't really getting on track to get any money and own something.  And, so, my venture, I turned out to be a writer.  I wrote literature on this subject for churches; lots of it.  And, passed it out to them because a new period in our existence had come about.  And, I felt it was my job to give direction to it as best I could.  Also, we had a series of earthquakes out on the West Coast.  We had hurricanes in Florida, and there was great need for relief.  And, I set out to produce money from sister churches to funnel into these areas to give relief to the people who were afflec- affected by these nature disasters of nature (background noise).   So, those were my biggest efforts at that time to try to turn a few things around.
Story_ID: 484845
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-nine [1989], you were nominated as an ambassador to Lesotho by President Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush].  Talk to me about that.
Speaker 2: That was a surprise.  I happened to been home one day, sitting up there in my reading room, and the phone rang.  Lo and behold who should it be, but President Bush, and just says, said it very simple, "Jerry [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], I'd like for you to be my ambassador out to Lesotho."  I'd never heard of Lesotho.  I didn't know what Lesotho was (laughter).  I didn't know whether it was on this plant, or some other plant (laughter).  I was shocked, 'cause I wasn't seeking anything on a national, on a, you know, national political level; didn't want anything.  I just wanted to help get the man elected.  But, I told him, "I need to discuss it with my wife [Ettyce Hill Moore] and my church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.]," and da da da.  That I just have, I would have to get back to him.  It was just too sudden.  Anyway, I talked to my wife.  I talked to other people.  I talked to my church.  They all left it up to me.  Eventually, I told him I'll do it.  I called him, found him somewhere on an airplane.  He was, had been somewhere to make a speech and this, you know how they, these communication systems they could hook him up.  And, I got him on an airplane and told him I'll do it.  I went to school for a whole year.  Their form of school is, you go around to the various agencies that deal with foreign affairs and you are briefed.  Well, I went through all of this.  I went to the state department [U.S. Department of State] every day.  I had a supervisor there who was supposed to be training me in something.  I found out she didn't know as much as I did.  But, anyway, I never told her that.  So, the only people in this house were my wife, my mother-in-law, and me.  My mother-in-law was very aged at the time, and she got down ill.  My wife was working.  I was the one with--could determine my, the use of my time.  So, I called the president and told him, I had sickness in my home, I couldn't afford to go and leave my wife alone.  And I thanked him very much but declined to go.
Story_ID: 484846
Speaker 1: You know, met the leadership of Lesotho.  They had a king [Letsie III of Lesotho] at that time.  And, I met him.  He was expecting me to come and I had a tutor teaching me how to speak the language.  All of that.  But, the interesting thing about it was this, that Lesotho was one of the poorest nations on the face of the earth.  They didn't export anything.  They imported what they needed to survive.  They were completely surrounded by South Africa.  And, the majority of the men worked in the mines in South Africa; gold mines, and diamond mines.  And, they were gone from home anywhere from four to six months at a time.  The women ran the house.  If the husband wanted to know anything, he had to ask his wife (laughter).  Now, they imported their staples from South Africa, which meant that the mine--the money they earned in those mines was spent on goods from South Africa.  And, which meant it went right back to South Africa.  I thought about that.  I said, "Now, why do rich people get these plum appointments to England, to France, to Germany, to Italy," so forth and so on.  And, I thought about old man Kennedy [Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.].  Old man Kennedy was a rum runner.  When he got enough money to make the proper kind of contributions to get himself appointed ambassador to London [England], or to get into England, he out the franchise on gin; Gordon's dry gin.  That became the basis, part of the basis, for his wealth.  And, he put up a ten thousand dollar trust fund for each one of his children.  I said, now, I thought about some other ambassador that I knew the story about.  I said, "And, these guys can get the franchise."  By that time, I'd been to Taiwan the first time.  And, I was in a hotel, I was over there as a government representative on a goodwill mission.  And, I went downstairs to the breakfast room one morning, and lo and who?  Lo and behold, who would be sitting in there but Goldwater, Jr. [Barry Goldwater, Jr.] (laughter).  And, he was at a table by himself.  Being as impulsive as I am, I got up and walked over to his table and sat down.  I just asked him point blank, "What are you doing over here?"  He says, "I'm collecting franchises."  And, "I'm going on Cambodia, oh, not Cambodia, Thailand tomorrow and I'm gonna get some more.  And, then I'm going home and I'm a sit down and wait on my money to come in," (laughter).  And, I thought about that Lesotho; wasn't nothing over there to get.  I couldn't get no franchise.  I said, "I'll be stone broke when this thing is over. 'Cause I'll have to pay my own bills."  It dawned on me then, why are these rich people--were getting these important ambassador jobs, ambassadorships and they were collecting these franchises and they come home and sit down and wait on their money.
Story_ID: 484847
Speaker 1: In 1996, you retired from the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].  Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I have a theory in mind, still have it.  You should never stay anywhere, until you break down.  I thought about traditional black Baptist pastors; why they stayed so long.  I thought about my predecessor [Walter Henderson Brooks].  They didn't have a retirement system where they would get an income to sustain them during those years of retirement.  I wanted to retire while I was strong, moving around, can still do other things, and let some younger man come in there and run the race.  So, I voluntarily resigned, to retire on that theory.  I, I just don't believe you should stay forever.  Now, I'd been there fifty years.  It was time to quit.

Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], how did you incorporate religion, politics, community service?
Speaker 2: You look at it as if it's a whole.  What is the meaning of your life?  What is the purpose of your life?  You got, I proceeded from the point, you got to give it to something.  Give it to people.  Now, if you give your life to people, it doesn't mean that you have to involve yourself in all the irregularities that go on.  They go on in every phase of life.  You got rascally preachers, you got judges putting 'em out every day because of their conduct.  You got rascally politicians.  You read the paper, they up on some kind of charge all the time.  You see, you have to decide for yourself.  If I give my life to people, I can't let greed be a part of it.  I can't let unfortunate acts be a part of my conduct.  So, I just gave my life to people to do good, try to love 'em, and let them know that they are loved.  That I'm out here, whatever I have, is yours.  I never saw any difference.  I just looked at it as a whole.  When I was in the council office, I had more people beating that path to my office, not because they were looking for a political favor, because they were looking for personal help to get them over the bridge.  Even the mayor of the city [Washington, D.C.] was often around there, asking me to pray of him.  Just give your life to people, that's all.

Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], we're getting, getting ready to finish up here.  You mentioned something as we were talking.  You said you got a Ph.D.  When was that and what did you do it in?
Speaker 2: I have a Ph.D. degree in family relations.  That primarily counseling troubled people, which I like to feel that I'm very good at.  Now, I didn't get the Ph.D. degree because I needed for career advancement.  All these things like being a pastor, serving on many boards, being a teacher.  I didn't have to have a degree to do that.  I'd already done that.  I just got it because it was something I wanted since I was in my twenties.  I had never, just had never had time to get it.  So, one day I decided, if it's out there, if you need a mind, and the time to do it, I've got 'em both.
Speaker 1: Where did you graduate from?
Speaker 2: La Salle University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 484850
Speaker 1: What have you been doing in your retirement?  I know that you not been sitting at home.
Speaker 2: Well, I taught for nine years.  I taught at the School of Divinity at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And, I put in about eight years at Southeastern University [Washington, D.C.] teaching in the field of business administration.  Mostly, human relations and ethics.
Speaker 1: What do you do for recreations now?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you, I pitter around the house doing whatever I feel like doing.  I like to grow things.  I didn't mention the fact that for many years, I had a big garden over there behind the church [Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] about a half acre of land.
Speaker 1: What did you grow?
Speaker 2: All kinds of vegetables.  And, I just love working in the soil.  Now, I borrow my neighbors' yard.  I sold the garden to the church for a parking lot.  Then, I borrowed my neighbors' yard so, I grow stuff in there.  I like to pitter.  I can't eat all the stuff I produce.  I give it away.  And, I did that when I had the big garden over there.  Just grow it to see it grow and then give it to folks.  Let 'em have it.

Speaker 1: One more political question before we get to the last questions.  The House [U.S. House of Representatives] just passed a D.C. Voting Rights Act [District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007], and which will provide us with full voting rights in the House.  What do you think about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to fall back on the rights of man.  You should never deprive me of a right that you enjoy yourself.  Now, if you have the right to vote for whatever and, at the same time tell me I'm free and don't allow me the right to vote, whether I do it or not, I don't like that, you see.  Earlier on I used the illustrations of collecting taxes.  You put a paved road down in front of your house and paved walk and I'm living on the other side of the town on a muddy street and you got my money building yourself a road.  That's not right.  I should have the same right as you.
Story_ID: 484852
Speaker 1: Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], is there anything else that you'd like to add that we didn't ask today?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't mention the Baptist World Alliance.  That is the aggregate of Baptists all over the world.  At the time that I was serving there were 30 some million of us.  And, I was on the administrative, the nine-member administrative committee that divides policy and direct for all the Baptists of the world.  Now, that mission took me all over the world, except to Australia.  I just didn't go down there.  But, I was frequently in Japan, Hong Kong, Cambodia, or somewhere in the world to (unclear), out in Denmark.  It just took me everywhere.
Story_ID: 484853
Speaker 1: Why did you want to tell your story?
Speaker 2: Well, oftentimes in my mind, biting off this be (unclear), black people don't know what they can do.  You never know until you try.  And, one of our biggest focus is liquor say from slavery.  And, we got a bad case of, I can't.  Well, I never let anybody tell me I can't do anything.  I think I can.  You get out there and try, you'd be surprised what you can do.  So, I never had any money to start anything.  I just started it.  Somebody gonna hear, and somebody will listen, and somebody will join you.  If you can't get 'em to join, then do it yourself.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) How do you feel about the way you lived your life?  And, what's important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, I have no reservations about the way I've lived my life.  I think I've done rather consistently what the Lord has advised me to do.  I've had many occasions when I was pastoring when deacons would tell me that, "You should do this, or you should do that, or like that."  I say, "Well, now, let me tell you something.  I'm doing what the Lord told me to do.  I have no intention of doing what he told you to do.  Now, if you think it ought to be done, you go do it.  But, I'm gonna stay on the job that I know best.  The one that I got the plan for."

Speaker 1: For those going into the ministry and, or politics, what suggestions would you have?
Speaker 2: I would say to live humbly.  Never flaunt yourself around.  I've said this, I've got a lot of degrees, but I'm not an ostentatious person.  I never wear any symbol on me that would let you know I have 'em.  I think what little information I got a hold of in all these schools I went to was meant to serve people.  And, I should use it as an instrument to try to make life better for somebody.
Speaker 1: If you had it to do over, would you choose a different career path?
Speaker 2: No. There's nothing more beautiful than a ministerial career. Now, I wanna interpret ministerial career for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe in whatever profession you engage yourself, you are a minister if you are a Christian.  You are a minister of what the Lord wants you to do.  Many of times people think that a degree is the symbolic of life to make money.  I've never thought that.  I could've made a lot of money over my career doing some other things.  But, I never have asked anybody for any money.  I pastored for fifty years [at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] and more and never asked anybody to raise my salary.  Never asked for more money.  I know some of these ministers get handsome salaries.  I never wanted one.  I just wanna be a free spirit to do what the Lord told me to do.  That's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You can't pay me for that.
Story_ID: 484855
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you haven't done yet?
Speaker 2: I have dreamed of going into the Near East.  There's a country over there called Kazakhstan.  Another one called, I'm trying to think of the name of 'em.  But, they're all called the -stan countries; Uzbekistan.  Those were formerly a part of the Soviet Union [Russia]; all four of 'em.  After the breakup of (background noise) the Soviet Union, these countries have come (background noise) independent by electing their own leadership. I could speak more thoroughly of Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We're gonna pause for--
Speaker 2: Kazakhstan is the ninth largest country in the world.  It has a population of better than 15 million people.  It is rich in natural resources; oil, gas, other minerals.  They are striving mightily to develop their country.  Now, I would just like to go there, to that country.
Speaker 1: If there was anything you could do differently, what would it be?  Would you do anything differently than you did?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any regrets?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't have any regrets.
Story_ID: 484856
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns for African Americans is just simply this.  That we will learn how to get out from under the new bondage in which we find ourselves.  Now, that requires some interpretation.  We are in economic bondage.  You take the recent development of this city [Washington, D.C.].  All those big buildings we see downtown, office buildings, condominiums, what have you.  These are owned by out of town corporations.  They are centers of employment.  They control the economy of this city.  For the simple reason, they pay the greatest taxes.  Now, you can't tell them what to do.  That's economic bondage.  The only job you can get is the one they offer you.  Whether it's shining windows, or cleaning floors (background noise).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Pausing tape.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: We're no better off than we were at another stage of our progress.  If it was progress at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When somebody else controls your destiny.  We must learn to develop a destiny of our own.  Mold it and shape it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until we can contend with the giants.
Story_ID: 484857
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I would put it this way, I've lived a long time.  I've known a lot of great people.  Every person has formed his own opinion about the person if they knew him or her.  I leave it up to the individual to determine what he or she would have as a history of me.

Speaker 1: What message or lesson would you like to leave for your children, your grandchildren, and for people of the world?
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to teach 'em as best I could, how to be men.  These babies that are around here in these pictures, all they can do is look at the tape like the one you are making.  Or, listen to their parents talk about their grandparents as I talk about mine.  I'm very proud of my grandparents because I think they accomplished something.  My mother's father [David Abner (ph.)] did such.  Some of 'em became college presidents, some of 'em were doctors, some of 'em are headed national organization like the women of America.  Now, my father [Jerry A. Moore, Sr.] is a, my father became a supervisor of schools, teacher, preacher.  I followed in his footsteps.  And, I just like for my children [Jerry A. Moore III and Juran D. Moore, Sr.] to follow in my footsteps.

Speaker 1: What would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I loved people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Reverend Moore [HistoryMaker Reverend Jerry A. Moore, Jr.], we would like to thank you for being a part of The HistoryMakers interview today, and you are truly a HistoryMaker.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you and it's been an extraordinary pleasure to be interviewed by you.  And, to have this opportunity to tell the story.

Speaker 1: The photograph was taken at a meeting of the camera club, black camera club at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].  I attended that meeting one night and a young man there insisted on taking that picture.  Now, that was when I was interim pastor of Faith Moravian Church of the Nation's Capital [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Now, about what year was that, or what decade?
Speaker 1: That was approximately 1998.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Thank you, sir.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Nineteenth Street Baptist Church located at 4606 16th Street NW.  It is the little building into which we moved and it serves the congregation very well.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: What we have here is the building of the oldest Baptist church in the District of Columbia [Washington, D.C.].  It was established in eight--ninth--1839 at the corner of 19th [Street] and Ash Street NW, Washington [D.C.].  And, this is where the congregation, many of whom was slaves, worshipped until the church moved to a new location at 4606 16th Street NW.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This picture was made by a professional photographer.  The same photographer that made a picture of President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson]--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you know the photographer's name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember his name.  I--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year, or era, or decade, was this taken?
Speaker 2: This was taken in 1990.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Great.  Next photo please.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Now, tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: This' a picture of my wife [Ettyce Hill Moore] and me.  We were attending some functions at a caterer's place.  I don't remember the function now.  But, they had a professional photographer there and he took this picture of my wife and me.
Speaker 1: What year is it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very glamorous.  About what time was that?  What--
Speaker 1: What year was it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Time period was that?
Speaker 1: That was about in 1985, I believe.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's about right.  Okay, great.  Next.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This photograph is of our two sons when they were children.  The one sitting down with his suspenders on his shoulders and the little bow tie, is the oldest boy, Jerry A. Moore III.  The one sitting up with his feet dangling is Juron Dwayne Moore, Sr. [Juran D. Moore, Sr.]. It's interesting that if you see him today, he weighs about three hundred pounds.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Very good.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  What do we have here?
Speaker 1: When we moved into our new church at 16th and Crittenden Street, the next street below it would be Buchanan Street.  We had to clean up the premises to suit ourselves.  And, this is a group of men that I got together to help me clean up the premises.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I love that shot.  Okay.  What's next?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I don't remember that picture at all.  I had not start wearing a wig at that time.  You can see my head is bald.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Would that have been in the '70s [1970s], or the--
Speaker 2: That was probably taken in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next please.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is--I'm just out inspecting--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: --the garden premises.  I had a garden behind the church in a triangle back there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And, this is it, right?
Speaker 2: This is the garden area.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Behind you, okay--
Speaker 2: And, I'm just inspecting it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Next.  What about this one?
Speaker 1: This picture is taken with my wife and Reverend Walter A. Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] who was the first elected non-voting representative to [U.S.] Congress.  This is at one of the receptions given at Nineteenth Street Baptist Church on my anniversary.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And, that would've been about what date, or what decade, or?
Speaker 1: That would've been somewhere in the 1960s.  I don't know--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: --the date.
