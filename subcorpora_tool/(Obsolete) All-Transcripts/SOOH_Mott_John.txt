 Wilson  Mott  Today is April 20, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Commerce, Oklahoma, today at the home of  John Mott. John lived in Picher, Oklahoma, for seven decades?  Well, I missed four years. In 1929 when the crash hit Picher, my father  and my grandfather had a wholesale house in Picher. They started it in  1917 when Picher started. My father was fifteen when he moved to  Picher. He worked in that wholesale house until    29, and they shut it  down, so we went to California. We went out there with tobacco roads,  and we took our old Model A car, new Model A Ford. We went to  California with a rack on top and had a box on the back. We   d drive  along, and when we stopped to eat, Mom would let that gate down, and  had a table there and a stove and everything. We just went to California  with that in    29.  What year were you born?  In    27.  And where were you born?  In Picher.  Were you born in the hospital?  No. In 1925, my dad was working in this wholesale house. Him and my  mother got married in    20. My mother was eighteen, and she was a  junior in high school. She couldn   t go to school if she was married, so  they kept it a secret for a year and a half. When she graduated as  valedictorian in    23 at Picher High School   I   ve got all the annuals from     23 until they quit.  5  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  How did your parents meet?  There was a Christmas program at the Union Church in Picher. That was  the only church in Picher for a long time. My grandfather was the  minister. Him and another minister started that church in    17. That was  the first school in Picher. My grandfather was the minister, and he also  managed that wholesale house. They had big doings at this church. Of  course, my mother   s folks went to the church, too. I was so lucky. When  I grew up, my grandparents lived right next door to each other, so when  I went to see one, I saw the other one. That   s just the way it was all my  life until all four of them died.  What was your dad   s profession?  Grocery man.  At the wholesale     At the wholesale level. Well, when we went to California, he got a job  working for Safeway Company. There   s another company he worked  with a little bit, but he started off as an investigator for the Safeway  Company. When they had a store that was in the red, he would go in as a  worker. In two weeks, he found out what was the matter with it and why  it wasn   t making any money. Then he had the authority to fire, and, man,  he fired a lot of those managers that were doing things wrong. They was  making the money for theirself. He did that for about a year in  California, and they moved us every two weeks. They   d rent us a home  or a motel until Dad got   they   d give him two weeks to get it lined out.  He had about fourteen stores he took care of the first year.  In California?  Yes. We ended up in Chico, California. He started at Fresno, California,  and then all over there. They had stores everywhere. When they had a  problem, he   d go in and find out. We might live there two weeks or  anything. Of course, I grew up   I was six, and I started school in Chico.  We   d been out there four and a half years.  Did you have any negative feedback from Californians, being from  Oklahoma?  No. Oh, no. Of course, I wasn   t old enough. I was two and a half when I  went out there, and I was six when I come back. I started school out  there and went about September, October, November. In August that  year, I had a baby brother. He was born on the twelfth of August. My  6  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  dad   s birthday was the seventh of August. My mom got homesick, and  so dad just sold out out there, and we come back to Picher. We come  back the same way, with that Model A and the grub box on the back of it  and a rack on top.  What caused you to move in the first place? Were a lot of people moving  to California?  Well, yes. The wholesale company that he worked for shut this  wholesale house down because Picher was slowing down in the    29  crash. Of course, his job just disappeared, so he didn   t mess around. The  next week, we went to California because my dad was a hustler.  Anyway, in    25 when he was working at that wholesale house, he  bought a big Model T truck, a ton-and-a-half truck. They were having,  down by Twin Bridges   you know where Twin Bridges is, here? Well,  it   s down by the Neosho River, a state park, now.  Anyway, they had four or five big strawberry farms. My dad saw a  chance to make some money, so he bought this big truck, and he was  working at night. Wholesale house in the daytime, and then he   d drive  the   he was hauling strawberries to Joplin. They had a siding down  there, and he would take a big truck, two or three tons of strawberries,  and take them to Joplin. They   d unload them out of his truck into a  boxcar. They had four people there, and they had several trucks  working. They was hauling those strawberries to New York City. They  went to Brooklyn, New York. He did that all during strawberry season.  He made enough money that year to build a new home. He built a home  right there in Picher, right close to the wholesale house, and I was born  in that new house.  What was the address? Do you remember?  316 Alta Street. My grandmother lived there all my life. I was married in  the doorway to that bedroom where I was born. My grandfather, both  grandfathers, I had a talk with them and found out which one was going  to marry me because one of them was a preacher and the other one was a  justice of the peace. (Laughter) My mother   s father, Jennings, was a  justice of the peace. My grandfather that was a preacher said,    Mr.  Jennings, you marry them because I   d have to go over to the courthouse  and bring my marriage licenses up to date,    where he could do it. He  says,    I don   t want to do that. I   d rather you marry them.    So my  grandfather said,    Well, mine   s up to date.     So what year did you get married?  Forty-five.  7  Wilson  Mott  Was your wife from Picher?  Oh, yes. We grew up together. She was a junior, and I was starting my  senior year, September 20. I don   t forget dates like that. We was going  to school, and I was sitting out on the lawn under a tree, reading a book.  Her and her girlfriend come up to me and said,    John, we   re having a        this other girl, her and her boyfriend were going on a hayride, and she  wanted Shirley to go with her. It was her girlfriend at school. Shirley  was just sixteen. I always told them, I said,    There   s nothing worse than  a sixteen-year-old girl,    (Laughter) but they framed up on me. What they  did, they   I told them I   d take her on this hayride. My uncle was  driving, had the hayride for the little school up here in Kansas, little rural  school. Her boyfriend went to school up there, so she wanted Shirley to  go with them. They had to find somebody to take her.  They come out, and I say,    Oh, I don   t know. I   ve got this good book  I   ve got to read. I   ve got a book report coming up.    Then I said,    Oh,  okay, I   ll go. You twisted my arm.    (Laughter) Anyway, they framed up  on me. That   s what I always told them, I said,    There   s nothing more  devious than a sixteen-year-old girl.    Well, what they did, we went on  this hayride, and it was September. It was just the latter part of  September, fifteenth or twentieth. We went down on this hayride, and  we went to Schermerhorn in Kansas up here, up on Shoal Creek, this  side of Joplin. It was just a real nice picnic ground and everything.  We had a wiener roast up there, and they got a cave down there that you  can go look in. We walked about a half a mile up that evening before  dark. On the way back, it was dark. We walked back and had our weenie  roast and everything. Then we had some music and a little dancing  around the campfire. On the way home, it got pretty cold. Of course,  Joann, (that was the girl that was with us) she says,    Oh, I brought an  extra blanket.    I said,    Boy, when you girls put me under that blanket  with Shirley, my hormones started working.    I couldn   t get her out of  my mind. That   s just where it started right there. That was September,     44.  Anyway, we went together the whole senior year. We got engaged on  May 5, 1945, at the Junior-Senior Banquet. Yes, I gave her a ring, got up  and announced it to everybody there at the Junior-Senior Banquet. That  was on May 5. Of course, I was just eighteen on May 18, the day I  graduated. That was my birthday. Anyway, they drafted me on the  nineteenth of June, and then I didn   t pass. My knees give me trouble  since I was a little boy. I had a disease called Osgood-Schlatter disease. I  grew up, but my knees didn   t. You know what I mean, they were   but  the Army wouldn   t take me. They told me,    Well, if we get you in boot  8  Wilson  Mott  camp and you take six, eight weeks of boot camp and your knees are  going to go bad on you, we   ll have to pay you a pension the rest of your  life. We   re just going to send you back home to take care of the  women.    I said,    I   m going to tell you something. I   ll take care of one  lady, but that   s all.     The twenty-third of June I went to work at  BF  Goodrich. Well, I got  back on the twenty-second of June, and I went to Goodrich, made an  application for a job, and they wanted me to go to work that day. I told  them,    I can   t. I   ve got business to do tonight.    I had to go visit my  girlfriend. The twenty-third is the day I went to work at Goodrich,  twenty-third of June,    45. Then we got married on the twenty-second of  July.  Wow, did you go on a honeymoon?  Yes. That was during the war. Our only honeymoon was   it was 105  degrees when we got married, the twenty-second of July. We had a little  ol    apartment up there, two room. It had a kitchen and a bedroom in it,  there in Picher. By the way, it was awful expensive. It cost us sixteen  dollars a month. (Laughter) That took care of our water bill, too, and gas  and electric and everything. So that was real expensive. We lived there  about a year. My wife went to school her senior year. I got to sign her  report card. I   ve still got that report card in there. I always held it up to  her, you know. She   d come home, and she   d missed four days that  semester. I said,    What in the heck        Oh, I was going to school that  morning, and I didn   t feel good, so I went over to my mom   s and stayed  all day.    See, I never did know this, and so her report card told on her.  (Laughter)  But anyway, we just had a wonderful adventure. That   s what we always  called it: adventure. Sixty-six years. She died on the sixth of May, sixty-six  years and one day after we got engaged. She had Alzheimer   s for  about six years, and I took care of her. You know what I mean? I was a  retired. Well, we were both retired emergency medical technicians. I was  in first aid for sixty years. When I was in the Boy Scouts, I took  advanced first aid. In    43 I was fifteen, and I went to work in a mill.  They come out to the school wanting some boys to go to work because  they had just drafted a bunch of their employees and they needed  somebody to work, so I went to work in a mill, working an evening shift.  I   d get out of school at three o   clock. I   d ride my bicycle home, set a  bucket down, pick up another dinner bucket and put on my old work  clothes, and ride a bicycle four and a half miles to go to work.  Then at eleven o   clock when I got off work, I put a carbide light on my  hat and ride home. Now, if it was wintertime when it was zero or  9  Wilson  Mott  something, the night shift boss would put my bicycle in the back of a  company truck and take me home, or raining real bad. They took care of  me, but I was real lucky. My uncle was the head bookkeeper for the  company. He   d married Mr. Simple   s daughter in    35, so it was kind of  family to me. Mr. Simple, his daughter was my aunt. The guy that hired  me didn   t know that. I was working for them, and my uncle saw my first  week check. He didn   t know I was working for them until then. Boy, he  was sure a fine gentleman.  What was Picher like when you moved back from California?  Well, I was in the first grade. Oh, it was running pretty good. This house  my dad had built, my grandparents lived there, and we lived there about  a month with them when we first came back. I started school out of that  house, and I had to walk about a mile over to Central School in first  grade. Then, after a month and a half, I found out there was another  school, closer, so they transferred me to Whitebird School. I could walk  down the railroad track about, oh, half a mile and get to school. It was  still booming. They were building a big pond dam across the street from  my grandmother   s house. There   s a railroad track that goes through  there. The streetcar used to come from Miami and go to Douthat, come  circle back and go to Douthat, and come back and go back to Miami  every thirty minutes.  Of course, just on the other side of this railroad track they were building  this big pond. It was about, covered forty or fifty acres. Then they built a  mill over there, and they put a tailing mill there, which they were re-running  the old chat piles. When they started stacking them up in 1917,  they were using a process to mill, to separate the dirt from the lead and  zinc. They got new processes, so they started re-running those in about     30. They started re-running those chat piles. They were getting just as  much out of it as they did before. That   s what they did. They re-run all  those. Some of them had be re-run three times, all those chat piles. There  were still people, trucks running everywhere.  That   s what I did when I went to work in that mill. In about two weeks,  they had me driving one of those big, forty-ton diesel trucks, semi. I was  fifteen, and I was driving that truck. There was a guy come down from  Tulsa for two of us, me and another boy. This boy that his girlfriend was  the one that got me to take my wife, he was working there, too, Jackie  Meyers. Anyway, we were both fifteen. He come down from Tulsa and  give us a driving test one Saturday. We got chauffer   s license when I  was fifteen years old, but we were driving on private roads. You know  what I mean? The mill, they always leased the road. Once in a while,  we   d get on a section line, but most of the time we were on private  roads.  10  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Then two months later, that same guy come back that summer and give  me a dynamite permit when I was sixteen. I was sixteen then, and me  and Jackie Meyers both had dynamite permits. We were shooting  tailings. See, these tailings, when we was hauling them, they get real  sticky, so when I was sixteen, I had a permit.    Powder monkey,    they  called me. I could drill holes in those chat piles and fill them up with  dynamite and shoot them off.  What would that do?  That   d knock the chat down to where we could shovel it up with a steam  shovel.  And then where would you put it?  In the mill. We   d haul it to the mill, dump it in a hopper. A conveyer  took it up and dumped it in a big hopper. That   s how the mill kept  running.  So were the mines active at that point?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes, there was mines. There was mines working  everywhere. This was during the war. See, they were going full blast. A  lot of the guys that were drafted out of the mines   I had two guys that I  knew real well that were drafted. They went through boot camp, and  then they got to Seattle, getting ready to head for Guadalcanal.  Loudspeaker come on in the train station and said,    Anybody here from  Picher, Oklahoma?    Of course, there was five of them in there from  Picher. He said,    Come over here to the main office. We want to talk to  you.    When they got over there, they said,    Here   s your discharge. You  need to go back to Picher and go to work in the mines.    It was that much  of a problem. This was in about    42. Of course, it was just getting  started. Those guys, they were very important. We had a lot of men  come back from that way. I was fifteen, and I worked three and a half  years in that mill.  At that time, about what was the population in Picher?  Five, six thousand. Oh, we used the whole area, see. There   s Treece   Kansas . That   s just about a mile from Picher. There   s Hockerville   Oklahoma , about two miles from Picher. There   s Century, North  Century, and Douthat, and that   s another little community. Douthat one  time had two theaters and four thousand people. That was during the  war, you know, before the war in the    20s and also during the war.  11  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Did Picher have a theater?  Had three of them, yes. Had the Mystic, the Roxie and the Plaza.  When did those close?  The Mystic, I think, was the last one open. I can   t remember. It was  sometime after the war. I can   t remember when it was, but I do know the  day that the Plaza Theater burned. That   s why. It burned on January 26,  1946. That   s when it closed. I can tell you the date it closed. One day, I  was over at the beauty shop with my wife, and a bunch of the old ladies  come in there and said,    John, I   m going to ask you this. I   ve asked  everybody in Picher that I   ve talked to. When did the Second Street fire  burn up the theater and the two drug stores and three bars? Nobody  remembers.    I said,    Well, I   m going to tell you something. It was the  twenty-sixth of January, 1946.    She says,    How did you know that?    I  said,    Well, I   m going to tell you something. Why I remember it is  because my dad died that night.    I was working at Goodrich, and I was  riding the bus to work from my apartment. I   d get out and walk out, and  get on the bus and go to work, and then come home on that bus, but I  had to bring a taxi that night to get home. See, my dad went to work at  Goodrich the first of June,    45. He had quit driving his truck over there  at the pit. He   d worked there for fifteen years.  At the mill?  At the mill. Different mill than I worked in. That   s why I knew how to  use dynamite. By the time I was nine, ten, I was up there where he was  hauling dirt. He run the shovel and drove a truck, whatever they wanted  him to do. He also used dynamite. I was up there when I was nine and  watching him make those shots and everything and tie them up and put  the caps in them and make them where they   d go off. I watched him do  that for seven, eight years. By the time I was fifteen, I was a powder  man, boy. (Laughter) That guy was dumbfounded when he started. Of  course, I   d been doing it for three months because when I went to work  out there, they knew that I could use dynamite.  How old did people have to be to be underground in the mines?  Guys fifteen were working in the mines underground. I had one boy that  I went to school with all through school, the third grade on up. He never  did start until seventh grade. He couldn   t learn. He was one of those  boys that just couldn   t. He went through five years of grade school, and  he couldn   t even read and write. Oh, he could read a little bit, but he  couldn   t write very good. T. J. Dugan. He was just     12  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Do you think that was an effect of the environment?  Yes, the lead. He was a classic. There was five boys in my class that  went through grade school with me, and they were troublemakers. When  the doctor came down from Harvard and was talking, the Tar Creek  Conference over here   you need to come to that this year because we  are going to have number sixteen. We   ve had one every year for the last  sixteen, and I helped start that. Rebecca Jim is the gal that started it. She  was a schoolteacher in Miami, and back in    82,   81, I was going over to  her classes and talking to them about Tar Creek when I was working on  it, explaining to them what her classes were. She started a club over  there, the Cherokee Environmental Club. She had a bunch of Indian  students, and she   s still got the lead agency down here. Right now we   re  doing a fish study for mercury, and Harvard and Oklahoma University  are doing the analysis for us. She got a big grant, and it was almost a  million, not quite, about nine hundred thousand. Of course, that   s what  furnished Harvard and the money to do the work. We   ve been working  three years on it. We   re doing a fish study for mercury in the water.  And that   s at Grand Lake?  Yes, Grand Lake and Neosho River. I   ve got an assignment this  weekend. Next Monday, we   re having a meeting. You ought to come to  that. It   s at Ketchum, and it   ll be the twenty-sixth. I think that   s Monday.  Harvard and Oklahoma University will be there. They   re going to bring  this study up to date. Two or three PhDs from Harvard come down here,  and they   ve been working on it ever since. We   ve been taking analysis  of the fish that people are turning in at Grand Lake and Neosho River.  Then we   re taking hair from 150 individuals every three months, three  times. You know what I mean? Each individual, they take them three  times. We   ve got whole families coming in, for youngsters and all of  them. We   ve been trying to work these 150 people, and getting more.  It   s been quite a   I   m on the board of directors that   s doing that. It   s  what I started back in, see, when I did the Grand Lake study. I did the  Grand Lake study for the EPA back in    87. Then we took fish samples  all over the area, Picher, Tar Creek, and all the mill ponds in Picher and  everything and checked them for lead. I worked on that.  What did you find?  Oh, if you don   t eat any carp organs, you   re okay. The fillets don   t  have   for catfish and fish that you   d eat, you fillet them. It   s in the  bones. Livers? Don   t eat any carp livers. (Laughter) Man, that Grand  Lake study that I did, I worked nine months. I was on that lake ten  hours, twelve hours a day, six days a week for nine months. I went  through the whole system. The seasons, I started off in early spring, and  13  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  I went clear through until November. I got summer, spring, winter, and I  had ninety-six positions on that lake, spots that I checked, once a week  or twice a week, six days a week.  Wow. Were you on a boat?  Yes, oh, I had my own boat. I had a state truck. They furnished me with  a state truck and a state credit card because, boy, I was busy. Mine was a  small motor. Well, it was a thirty-five-horse motor. I had my boat motor.  I   ve always had one, but I bought a new motor about that time. I had a  big, nice, sixteen-foot boat, a lake jon boat . I was burning twenty-one  gallons of gas a day in my boat. Can you imagine? I was by myself, and,  man, you think that wasn   t a hard job? I had these spots, and I   d go up,  and I had them marked on the lake, a lot of the deepest spots, with a  gallon jug and a half of a concrete block. I   d drop it in the water, and  then I   d go up there with my fish locator, you know, my depth finder. I  could just find that spot, and I would anchor. Then I   d drop my probe  from my Hydrolab down to the bottom. I   d come up one meter at a time  and write that down. If I was in ninety foot of water, I   d come up with  that probe, one meter at a time, have to let it sit there and stabilize, and  then I   d write it down in my diaries. See, that   s what I   ve got in my  diaries. I   ve got that.  Boy, and you   d think that wasn   t interesting, and I was working with  people. The first week I worked with that Hydrolab, I had a boy with me  that worked for the water board. One time I had a guy from the Corps of  Engineers come up here, and he had a logging truck, logging all these  drill holes and different holes down in the mines. He started doing that. I  was taking him to the different   he wanted the drill holes that went into  the mine area. I knew right where they was at. I knew where they was all  at. Running around on these hills, hunting all my life, I could remember  right where one   s at. I   d take him to it, and he says,    How do you  remember all these?    I said,    Man, this is my stomping grounds.    Fifty  square miles, and that   s where I walked and hunted with when I was  growing up.  When did you start hunting?  When I was six. My dad took me hunting when we first come back from  California. The first time we come back, it was in summer of    34. I was  six, and he took me dove hunting. Mom went out with us, and she stayed  in the car and crocheted while dad and I went hunting. I just had my bb  gun. Of course, I couldn   t shoot a dove flying, but I took my bb gun  anyway. He shot a dove, and it fell out there by this fence. He said,    Go  get it for me, John,    so I went out and got it, and it was still   I had to  chase it down and get it. He said,    Pull its head off     (Laughs) I said,  14  Wilson  Mott     What?     He said,    Pull its head off  Just grab it like this and jerk its  head off.    And I did, and it squirted blood all over me. Can you imagine  my shirt and my overalls and everything, my hair? I was just full of  blood. Boy, when I went back to the car, my mom had a conniption. She  saw all that blood on me, and she thought I   d been shot. (Laughter)  Anyway, that was my first hunting trip, and I was six. Then I started  going with him and carrying a .410, my mother   s gun, and he took the  firing pin out. Every time a bird jumped up or a rabbit jumped up, I had  to go,    Bang     I carried it for a year. I was getting close to seven years  old. That year, Thanksgiving, Paul Douthat and Billie Marie Douthat,  (that   s John Douthat   s mother and dad, see) they were with my mother  and dad. That was in    34, Thanksgiving day. They lived right there close  to where my grandmother did. Of course, Billie Marie and Paul didn   t  even have a car at the time. They were both teaching school, and they  didn   t have a car. They wanted to go down to her mother   s for  Thanksgiving dinner, so Dad and Mom and me and my sister, (I had a  sister that was eighteen months younger than me) we all went down on  Grand Lake. This was before Grand Lake was built. The lake filled up  with water in    40, and this was in    32 or    33.  We went down there for dinner, and Paul Douthat (that   s John   s dad)  and my dad and me went hunting that day. My dad put my firing pin in  my gun, and Paul Douthat went on my first hunting trip with me. Paul,  he used to tell me about things I did, and I   d say,    I remember     He said,     One time we had a squirrel running around in a tree up there,    and Paul  shot at it and missed it, and my dad shot at it and missed it, and I shot it  and killed it. It fell down up there, and old Paul took it over to my dad  and said,    Here   s your squirrel.    Dad said,    I didn   t shoot that squirrel.  John did.    So that was my first squirrel. That gun, I   ve still got it. My  son, Mickey, when he was six he killed his first squirrel with that gun.  Then my grandson, when he was six he killed his first squirrel with that  gun. Now, my great-grandson, he   s thirteen now, but he lives in Joplin.  He   s not for hunting. He   s a computer-game whiz.  Maybe he shoots the guns on the computer. (Laughs)  He does. He does. My granddaughter is a nurse in Joplin. She worked  for two years there at Freeman Hospital in heart surgery. They laid her  off about a year ago because they had the cutback, you know, when they  were cutting back. She was the youngest nurse in surgery, so they had  to, but she   d been doing that for years in heart surgery. She was on a  traveling team that traveled all over the United States. They   d put her  somewhere for twenty weeks at one hospital, and then she   d move. She  was all over the United States for nine years. Now, she   s thirty   well,  she was born in 1989.  15  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  So she   s twenty-something.  No, she   s older than that. Let   s see, she graduated out of college in    90.  Oh, okay.  She went to work at Miami Hospital the first day she   she went to NEO   Northeastern Oklahoma A M College . She was a surgical nurse.  Surgical technician is what they call them. When she traveled, that   s  what she was doing. Then she was in Orlando, Florida. They had a big  hospital there, and she was there about six months. My grandson, in    95  he had a daughter. They went to visit him out in Orlando, her brother.  Boy, my granddaughter got to holding that baby, and it got in her  system, so she got married. She had a boyfriend out there. She quit that  job out there, and she came back here and went back to college. She   s a  surgical RN in heart surgery. When she got laid off, she went to  collecting eyes for the International Lions Club there out of Joplin. She  was an organ collector for the transplant team at St. John   s in Joplin  when she first went to work there, about    91 or    92. She was on that  transplant team for five years. They shut it down, so that   s when she  started traveling. Now she   s working at a big nursing home, and she   s  the nurse in charge.  Going back to your professional career, what did you do at Goodrich?  I built truck tires.  Is that what you started out doing?  Yes, first day. I started, and it was on June 23. Of course, it   s quite a job.  They allow you twenty-six days to learn to do the job. After seven days,  I made my quota. I was drawing top money. You know what I mean?  For what I was doing, they never had anybody start that quick. The  seventh day I worked there, I made my quota. That was in    45, in June,     45. That year after the war, they shut that   we was building military  tires, you know, for the Army, big truck tires. They shut those military  truck tires down and started building commercial tires for the trucks on  the road and what have you. Of course, we had to change over, and  while we were changing over, I built farm service tires, the big ones.  Then in October, I started teaching. They put me to teaching.  October of    45?  Yes. I was eighteen, and I was teaching these servicemen when they was  getting out of the service to build truck tires. Boy, I worked for two  16  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  years, working, teaching tire building. Most of my guys, if they were  real sharp, in seven days they were getting their quota. They found that  out, and they wanted me to teach. I taught them just like I learned, you  know. I could communicate with them and talk to them, but a lot of  them had been in the military service for seven years or worked during  the war and everything, and they wasn   t used to an eighteen-year-old  telling them what to do. (Laughter) But I could fix that. I used public  relations and used my head. Oh, I can get along with anybody.  What goes into making truck tires?  Well, it   s a hard job. It   s heavy hand work. To build these truck tires,  you have a drum, a big drum, and it   s running around. You have to take  these bands, which is a four-ply band, and it   s a great big round band.  You have to put it over that drum, and then you pull it up on that drum a  little ways. Then you have a spear bar, which is a big long bar with a  roller on the end of it. You have to push this lever down, a foot pedal,  and it starts that thing rolling. It starts off slow, and you have to take that  roller and put in there, and you force that band onto that drum at high  speed. It is kind of hairy.  Can you get hurt pretty easily?  Oh, yes. Yes, you can get hurt, but I was always so careful. All those  twelve years, fourteen years that I built truck tires, I didn   t get hit but  once. It wasn   t my fault. It was the equipment. These ladies that were  building the bands were supposed to cement them together where they  wouldn   t come apart. This one lady, the material was dry, and she didn   t  use her cement like she was supposed to. When I stuck that in there, my  spear bar went through that ply and got in between there. There I was,  going, and I got my wings that day. (Laughter) I was on the end of that  bar, throwing me up in the air and everything, but I held on, and I got  out of it. It didn   t hurt me, but, boy, I learned a lot in that minute. They  give me my wings  (Laughter) I worked there twelve or fourteen years.  Anytime anybody had to be taught, I was the teacher.  Then I went to building the big bands for the off-the-road, you know, the  big earth-moving equipment. About    57, they started to put that in, and  so I went there in    45. That was about twelve years later that I built truck  tires. When I first went to work in the plant, it was during the war, and I  worked twelve hours a day for the next six months. I   d do other things in  the plant, so I learned to do everything. They had me curing tires and  doing everything. I could work an extra shift somewhere doing  something. They shut down for a while, and I built passenger tires.  When I left there, I could build passenger tires, truck tires, farm service,  17  Wilson  Mott  and off-the-road, and cure. I learned, and I   m never around anything  very long that I don   t know it. Like I say, when I was working in that  mill, I was there three and a half years. When I left, I called it   I had a  PhD from the Picher School of Mines. I was a machinist, a welder, a  carpenter, electrician, a plumber, and I could rebuild pumps, and I could  repair big truck tires, and a welder and everything. I always said, when I  was working for the water board, they said,    John, can you do this?    I  said,    Don   t even ask me. Just tell me what you want done because there  isn   t anything I can   t do.    Like I say, in three months working with those  guys, I was project assistant, so that tells you something. (Laughter) I  didn   t even know what I was doing until then.  We started and had those drill rigs working, and we were plugging  wells, and drill rigs working, and then we were still working on Tar  Creek. We had these shafts. We had to monitor these shafts, check the  water down below. The first time we did that (that was when I first  started) we had nine, ten men and a bunch of equipment from GRDA   Grand River Dam Authority . They came down with a cherry picker  (you know what a cherry picker is?) and a bulldozer, and they had a big  dump truck and about nine or ten men. People from the US Geological  Survey were with me, and the EPA and everybody had people there.  We monitored ten shafts. They put that cherry picker over a shaft.  They   d have me in that cherry picker, and I   d drop my Hydrolab down  that shaft, and I   d go ten meters at a time. We worked in meters. When I  got to the bottom, it was usually about 200 to 300 feet. I had to profile  that shaft. In other words, the water on the surface, it would be good  water, rain water that just went running in from the ground. Then as you  get down farther, there was more heavy metals, and conductivity would  go up. You understand conductivity?  Will you explain?  Well, there   s a probe in there, this electric probe. You hit this meter with  a jolt of electricity, and how much that water will conduct, the more  heavy metals that   s in it will conduct more. Your drinking water in here  is probably 250, somewhere like that. It   s according to how hard the  water is and what have you. Everybody   s different. Then you have the  dissolved oxygen. You had an oxygen meter there, and it tells you how  much oxygen is in that water. When you get down to the bottom: zero.  No oxygen. See, all the iron sulfide is in that water, in the mines, and  lead sulfide and zinc sulfide. That iron sulfide will rust. It   ll eat up all  that oxygen. The lead sulfide and the zinc sulfide will oxidize with that  oxygen in the water. When it oxidizes, that releases the sulfur out and  makes sulfuric acid in the water. I had 9,000 sometimes, conductivity,  when your drinking water is 250.  18  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wow.  I had one when I first started there in George Mayer   s pasture which is  down here, and Oklahoma University has got a ten-acre plot there now.  They   ve got seven ponds there, and the discharge is 450,000 gallons a  day, and they   re running it through that. They   re using plants to  neutralize the water. There   s several plants, hyacinths and cattails, and  all those will take the heavy metals out of the water. They   ve got a plant  there, and when the water leaves, goes into Tar Creek, it   s good water  now. It   s Dr. Nair, from...  When did you start working on the ranch?  Nineteen eighty. I programmed that, built weirs in there, and I could tell  you how many gallons of water in cubic feet a second went over those  weirs every day for twelve years. I had it. That   s what kind of blowed  their minds. Now they   ve got that big thing there, and they spent five  million dollars building those things. Now he   s got a class that comes up  here and takes care of it, Dr. Nair. I   ve just got so many projects around  going like that. That makes me feel good because, man, an old Picher  boy here that was knocked out and had knee trouble, but I could ride my  four wheeler and ride my horses. I done my work when I had to go out  in the field. I was either on my motorcycle, my four wheeler, or my  horse. I rode that fifty square miles. I could show you everything. I  already knew it because I was running that as a boy. I enjoy it, and I just  don   t forget it. When I started my book, I tried to start and go by year on  it, but I got to hurrying up so much, I got way ahead of myself.  Well, while you were growing up in Picher and the mines were still  active, it was a pretty dangerous profession. Were there many injuries?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We had two ambulances in Picher, funeral homes, and  they both had ambulances. Tell you what got me started in first aid.  When I was working out at that mill and I was fifteen, the federal  government Bureau of Mines sent some people in there, and we all had  to take Bureau of Mines    first aid. It   s advanced. You know what I  mean? It   s even better than the Red Cross first aid. So when I was  fifteen, I was working, doing that, taking those. They   d come in there  once every year, and they   d give those classes. Man, I took four of them  in three and a half years.  Then when I started my Boy Scouts in 1969, the Boy Scout camp just  started down here. They just bought it in    68. A guy give it to them,  seventeen hundred acres. The  Boy Scouts of America  Cherokee Area  Council out of Bartlesville, (that   s where our head office was) they  19  Wilson  Mott  asked me to teach all the leaders first aid. I had Red Cross advanced first  aid, and I was teaching all their leaders every year before they come to  scout camp. I had thirty at a time, and I   d go down on the weekend and  teach them about first aid. Well, that   s all I ever knew. My scouts, we  had Explorers. They were fourteen and older, and I had about twenty-five  boys. We started an emergency service as our curriculum. A lot of  them went to the fire department, and some of them went to different  things. You could take it and specialize in anything.  Well, I built an emergency service trailer with the boys. We built a  trailer. Then the school had a 4,000-watt military generator they had  given to them after the war. We got that and hooked it up in that trailer.  We had a propane tank in it, and we had cooking hotplates in it and a  stove with an oven on that trailer. It   s just a trailer that   s about eighteen  foot long and had four wheels. One of my scouts    dad that worked at  Goodrich was a welder, and he built this trailer for it. We just got the  parts. I went out to the junkyard out here, got all the parts we needed.  This old guy at the junkyard give the Boy Scouts everything, and we  built that trailer. We had everything. We had six tents in it. We had  tables that we could put up, and we had a cook shack, a tarp we put up  on four poles and set it up and have twenty-foot-square cook tent. We   d  take a tree, and in the middle of the tent, we   d put it up around that tree.  We   d take tables and put two screws in that tree, and the table come out  from that tree. We had folding legs that dropped down. We could take  that tree and come out with four tables from every direction, so we could  cook on one, and all the boys could eat. We could take that and set up.  One time in    51, three guys drowned on the lake. They were drowned  and from Commerce. They had an island down there close to Grand  Lake, right there on the place, so we went down and set up that tent. My  boys got excused from school for a week and a half. We went down  there and took care of all those people that were hunting for those    Had  about forty or fifty people there with boats and stuff. We were feeding  them and had a place they could sleep, had those eight tents up there.  Some of those guys would work all night and sleep in the daytime. We  just took that.  Did they find the bodies?  Yes. They found one of them the next spring. They found him where the  water went down. He was laying in the mud. Another time, they had a  wreck out here on the  Will Rogers  Turnpike bridge, right here on  Spring River. A car hit the bridge, the rails, and went off in that river at  two o   clock in the morning. They were down there trying to find those,  do everything. They called me, and I called my boys, and we were out  there in twenty-five minutes, about eight miles, with our trailer. We  20  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  hooked that generator up, and we dropped a 800-watt bulb down there  that lit up the whole countryside.  One of the guys was drowned, and there was three others that swam to  shore. One of them was about a quarter of a mile downstream on an  island. He saw that light, and he started hollering. Those boys were  down there all night. In thirty minutes, I had that light going. Those boys  were just right there, boy. The police departments and the sheriff  department, they   d call us. A boy disappeared down by Wyandotte one  time. They didn   t know where he was. He had been trapping on Shoal  Creek, and he just disappeared. Well, I took my boys, and we waded that  creek clear to Seneca. I found his traps where he   d been trapping, but  never did find anything about him. Anyway, ended up, he jumped a  freight train and went to Texas to visit his uncle. We spent five days  down there looking for him.  Well, when did you start working for the EPA?  Eighty. Well, I   ll tell you how it started. I was showing them around up  here. I was kind of showing them different places and     Well, before that, when was the discovery that     Well, in    79, the discharges started coming out of the ground.  Okay, and the first were on the ranch?  Well, one of them, yes. There was one over at Douthat, the big one. It  was going almost a million gallons a day. It had a hole that big that was  discharging. (Gestures) See, what happened, that hole in Douthat had  been a airshaft. They   d had a blower down there that blowed air down in  the mines to blow the bad air out. They had a big blower up there on top,  and when they shot the mines at four o   clock, you know, the dynamite,  all day this blower would blow air into the mines while the men were  working. Well, the men come out at four o   clock, come out of the  ground. Well, the shots went off at four twenty. Then that machine  automatically reversed and started sucking the smoke out. The nitro, that  made men have nitro headaches.  That would happen while you were living in Picher.  Oh, yes, that happened every day.  So you heard that big boom.  Oh, yes. When the booms went off in the ground, my mother used to  21  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  have to straighten our pictures up on the wall every evening after four  thirty. Five, six o   clock, she   d go around and straighten them. She had a  stick, and she   d take that stick and just straighten the pictures up. You  could feel them jar. They   d just jar like an earthquake. That was during  the war while I was growing up.  But that big hole they found was in Douthat in    79?  Yes. Well, they knew it was there, but air was going into the mines all  the time until the water got up. The mines filled up with water. They quit  pumping in    69. It took them almost ten years to fill up. There   s as much  water underground here in the mines   a third is what   s in Grand Lake.  They say 76,000 acre feet of water. An acre foot is an acre of water, a  foot deep, 750,000 gallon of water. I haven   t used that in twenty years.  I   m starting to fade a little bit. (Laughter)  This was all discovered in    79, and then people started getting  interested.  Well, in    79, I was regional director of the Oklahoma Wildlife  Federation. We had a meeting in the spring of    79 at Nowata at that big  hotel down there, an old cowboy hotel. I was down there. We was  having a meeting. I was instrumental in getting the National Grasslands  started. We was looking at a ranch to buy 900,000 acres. They was  going to buy it. Well, we were instrumental in getting it started. Then the  National Conservatory took over, and they bought it. Now we   ve got  that big grassland down there. I was instrumental in helping start that.  That   s wonderful.  They got buffalo on it now just like they were, wild. I was down there  that weekend in    79. The mines had just started discharging. Ed Pew,  Governor  David  Hall   s assistant, come to that meeting to tell us they  was going to start the Tar Creek Task Force. We got down there, and I  had been taking pictures of this discharge up here with my camera. I had  my new camera. I   d had it for eight years, and I was taking color slides  of it. Boy, I had two big slide reels of discharges and how that water was  turning red and this and that. I was taking pictures there every day  because there was a rifle range right there close to it, and I   d go down  there and shoot my rifle. I   d just stop and take pictures of it. It was a  mess.  Lytle Creek run into Tar Creek right under that bridge. That   s where  they combined. The discharge was right at the edge of Lytle Creek.  There was Tar Creek coming down there, and it was pretty and clear.  Then Lytle Creek was clear above it, had a beaver dam up there. Above  22  that beaver dam, it was just clear and pretty. Beaver dam up there, lots of  beaver in there and fish and everything in it. Right below that, the water  just turned red, right there. Here it   s clear, and here it   s red. (Gestures) It  was right there. I just took pictures of all that.  When I showed these pictures on Saturday at this council down there,  we was having a coffee break. We all had some apple pie and a cup of  coffee, and I showed them these color slides. Ed Pew was there. He  come up and told me, he says,    John, the water board has been down  there monitoring that for two months, and they   ve been taking pictures  of it. You have so much better pictures of everything. Would you show  those pictures tomorrow because I   m going to present the federation  with   we   re going to start a new organization called the Tar Creek Task  Force.    There was twenty-three state and federal agencies involved in  that. He says,    I want you to represent the Wildlife Federation on this  task force.    I said,    Okay.     Well, in the meantime, the next month, Governor Hall had to appoint a  new wildlife commissioner. We were working for this one guy to be  appointed wildlife commissioner by the governor. The governor didn   t  appoint him. He appointed somebody else. We gave him so much  trouble, the federation did, for not doing it, so he cut me out of it. They  didn   t even call me and tell me they was going to have a meeting. Paul  Thomas over at Picher   the Ottawa County Reclamation  Authority ,  it   s a state agency we started to take care of this mining land that was  turned over to these mining companies that had quit and disbanded.  Picher had a bunch of land that they didn   t want anymore, so they turned  it over to this state agency. Paul Thomas was chairman of the board of  directors on that. They wanted to appoint me on that, but I wouldn   t ever  do it. I didn   t want to mess with it.  Paul Thomas asked me to go down to this meeting when they formed  this task force to represent their organization, so I did. I had a flat tire,  and I was a little late getting to that meeting, and they had already  started the task force meeting. There was 150 people in that health  department building. I sat in the back room, and they started making  their plans, what they was going to do, and this and that. The first thing  they did, they had  450,000. The federal government had give them   450,000 to get started. They wanted to spend some of that money. They  got up there and said,    What we want to do is build a truck because  we   re going to have to be monitoring that water in the mines, down drill  holes. We want to build a truck with a generator on it, and a winch on it,  and a pump and a reel like on a fire truck,    a hose reel, an inch hose.  They want to be able to put a pump on the end of that hose and drop it  down this drill hole, which is about that big around, and pump water out  where we can test it, instead of having to go and drag a   just be able  23  Wilson  Mott  drop it down there and turn the pump on and pump the water out.  When they said they was going to do that, I said,    It won   t work.    They  said,    Why?    I said,    Well, you   ve got that centrifugal force pump  hanging on that cable. Once you start that pump up, it   s going to twist  that hose up, and you   re not even going to be able to get it out of that  hole. You have to put pipe on it to hold it steady, solid.    They said,    Oh,  it   ll work.    We stopped for dinner, and I was eating dinner with some of  these guys from the Corps of Engineers, and I explained to them why  that wouldn   t work. They said,    Well, I knew that, but I didn   t want to  say anything.     So one of the guys from the Corps of Engineers had gone and called his  pump company while we was eating dinner and talked to them and  telling them what they wanted to do. That pump guy said,    It won   t  work. You can put twenty-foot pieces of inch pipe on it, and it   ll work,  but you can   t just drop a hose down.    When they come back from  dinner, they changed the subject. (Laughter) Finally, Ed Pew called me  up and sat at the table with   he was chairman of that new organization.  They got a guy from the GRDA was the president of it. Of course, I  knew him. He was a Miami  Oklahoma  boy. I knew him real well.  Finally they just said,    Man, we can   t get along without him.    I was just  volunteering for a while.  Then, that fall, in the fall of    80, I took off and went to Colorado on a  month hunting trip. I took my horses out there behind my motor, my  pickup and camper, my wife and I. There was twenty-five other people  with me in my camp. I had a following when I went to Colorado. One  time, I had fifty-two people in my camp. There was kids from five  months old on up to twelve, fifteen. They took them out of school and  took them out there. It was just a city, pickups and trailers and tents and  everything. Forty-two years, I went to Colorado, and it was just like that  about every year.  Wow. But in the    80s, when you started working for the EPA     Yes. When I went to Colorado and they looked for me in    80, they  couldn   t find me. I was gone. I come back, and they was eating my ass  out for not being there. I said,    Hey, fellas, I got all the volunteer stuff.  I   ve had enough with you guys. Just forget about me.    He said,    We  can   t. Come down to Oklahoma City,    and they put me under contract,  contract worker. They was paying me eight dollars an hour when I  worked. Then they was trying to tell me when to work. I said,    Well,  this needs to be done.    After a week they said,    John, you   re going to be  working eight hours a day from now on. If you see something that needs  to be done, do it.     24  Wilson  Mott  That   s where it all started. That   s when I started doing like I did, writing  everything down. They furnished me with a Hydrolab. Do you know  what a Hydrolab is? It   s a piece of equipment in a tackle box about that  long and that high and weighs about twenty pounds. It   s got a big rope, a  twenty-foot wire on it, and your probe. You can put that in the water and  just sit there. You turn that dial over to pH, and it   ll give you the pH.  Then you turn it to dissolved oxygen, it   ll give you dissolved oxygen.  Conductivity, it   ll give you that. All you have to do is click, click, click,  click, and write it down. It might take a minute or two for the probe to  stabilize. I had one of those. Man, I started checking those twenty-eight  places every day. All those probes, I had to calibrate them every day.  The water board, the health department lab used to make me     stabilizing my   oh, I don   t know what I want to say   the ones I check it  against for all my stuff, I could calibrate that. Then I started writing  down what Picher water was. Every morning when I did it at the sink,  I   d write down what the Picher water was. Well, our water started  deteriorating about that time. Man, it went from 400 conductivity down  to 1,000. It just kept getting worse, worser and worser and worser, if you  pardon my grammar. (Laughter) I had to say that. My wife used to just  raise hell with me. (Laughs)  Mrs. Douthat was the English teacher at Picher, John   s mother. She  couldn   t stand for anybody to use bad grammar. One time, there was an  old preacher come to school to talk to us. We used to have a preacher  come talk to the students in an assembly every month or so. Different  preachers in the town would come. They can   t do that now. But anyway,  there was one ol    preacher there. He was way out of the woods, boy.     Little church in the wild woods    is what we called him. He didn   t have  the best grammar, and she   d get up there and just correct him in  assembly   Oh, my goodness. (Laughter)  She was something else. She was the nicest person. Of course, I grew up  with her, too. We knew her real well, and Paul. When I was a freshman  and sophomore in high school, we played tennis out there at the school.  We had a school tournament, and we had a mixed tournament. A boy  and a girl had a tournament. When I was in ninth grade, we had a gal  there in the ninth grade, and her name was Jean Lightfoot. Course, Jean  and I, we was partners in that tournament. Boy, we beat everybody, the  seniors and everybody. After she got out of high school, she went to a  doctor and found out that she was a boy. He was in a girl   s clothing. You  know what I mean? It was just under the skin. This doctor just made a  minor incision, and he was a boy. So that   s who I played    (Laughter)  25  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  We cheated. I always brought that up with Mrs. Douthat. I said,    It   s  your fault because you picked her.    (Laughter) I knew him real well. He  lived right there by me when I was growing up. She used to go out and  play baseball with the boys.  So in the    80s, were people drinking the water in Picher from the faucet?  Yes. We drilled two new wells. I plugged a lot of wells, I plugged them,  that were contaminating the Roubidoux  aquifer . I found out the wells  were so old and the acid water had eaten holes in them. The water was  running down the side of the drill hole, the well hole. It was cased off  from the mines. See, 450 feet is where they used to start their casing for  their wells, but we had to go to 900 and case them clear to 900 after I  started doing this. I figured out what was going on.  Were there more and more health problems arising in the    80s?  Well, no, it was just turning orange. The iron in it would rust. You   d  pour it out and let it sit overnight in a pitcher, and it   d turn orange. It  was that bad. Finally, I got two new wells. We plugged the old wells,  and I got two new ones. It was far enough away, but it went down close  to the mines. We went to the Roubidoux, and we cased the outside of the  well, cleared the Roubidoux instead of just going 450 feet. That   s the  way most of them was. I was involved with that. Boy, one of those  drillers, the guy that was putting in the well out there, he was going to  case it at 450 feet. I said,    You   re not either  It says in that blueprint.     He said,    Well, there   s no need to do that.    I said,    Fella, you don   t  know what you   re talking about.    Here I am, a layman, didn   t know  nothing about drilling wells, but I knew if they did it like that, it was  going to be contaminated just like our problem was.  The local rural water district was going to put in a new well. George Van  Poole, the farmer that was on the board of the rural water district, he  drank coffee with us over there at Picher. A bunch of the old miners  used to come in there. They was all eighty, eighty-five, ninety. We used  to drink coffee. He was an old farmer, and, boy, he was so efficient.  Man, he run his farms. He had two thousand acres, and I mean he made  the money. You know what I mean. Van Poole was his name. His dad  was an old Dutchman. He drank coffee with us over there. He said,     We   re going to put that new well in.    I said,    You don   t want to do it  like that.    He brought me the blueprints of it. I said,    That won   t work,  that 450 feet. You   ve got to go clear to the Roubidoux and block it off,  and then plug your old well before you start your new one.    You know  what I mean?    If you don   t, your pump   s going to pump that water from  over there in the Roubidoux, up.  26  Eagle Picher  Corporation  did the same thing. They had the boron plant  out here where they built rods for the power plants, you know, the  atomic power plants. Eagle Picher built it over there, and they had a new  well there. It was a twenty-four inch well, and they were pumping  thousands of gallons an hour for that plant. All of a sudden, it turned red.  It started working. Well, what they had done, there was five deep wells  in that area, one of them out there about 300, 400 feet from that well  they drilled. It was in the corner of a shaft. Back during prohibition, it  was there on that highway out there before they built that power plant  there. They set the drill rig and drilled a well in the corner of this shaft.  They had a still in their mines. They didn   t have to put a pump in it  because they put a cap on it and a spigot, and they could turn that water  on, and it   d come natural force.  That well was in there, and when Eagle Picher built that plant, they  covered that shaft up with a boulder pile that was there and then sealed it  over. That well was still down there, and when the acid water eat the  plug they had on the cap of that well down there, it started coming in. It  was just going 300 feet, under 1,100 feet. I told them, I said,    Man, you  can   t do that.    Then I went over there to five other wells, and they  plugged those. They kept saying,    There   s something still doing it.    I  said,    It   s that well over there.       There   s no well over there.    I said,     The heck there   s not.    I went to Baxter, and the guy that grew up in that  house there by that mine was the street in Baxter Springs. He was up  about seventy, and he was still working. I took him out there and told  them. He says,    There is a well there because I drank out of it all my  life, but it wasn   t on any of the maps. They didn   t want it on the maps.     Anyway, that   s just what I found out. I had to go show them where all  the wells were, and they plugged everything around there. Then they  drilled another well back over here and cased it clear to the bottom, like  I told them to. Right below that plant, they were making something in  there, chemically. They had a big pond there that was about ten acres. It  was about 400 feet long and about 300 feet wide, a football field wide.  They   d bury them up about nine, ten feet, and then they lined it with  plastic about that thick. (Gestures) They put sodium fluoride in it. It was  a byproduct of whatever they were making in that plant. Sodium fluoride  is nothing but rat poison. That deep well over there that they had  covered up was about 150 feet from that. One year, there was about  ninety-eight geese lit on that pond, and it killed them all instantly. That  stuff was so poison. The game warden found out about it, and they fined  them about  50,000, so much a goose.  They set up a gun out there, a propane gun, that went off every five, ten  minutes. Boom  It kept the geese scared away but it didn   t work. Then I  told them about that well over there. They said,    Oh, there   s no well  27  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  over there.    I proved to them there was. There   s a little creek that went  down below over there, and I used to monitor that every day. I   d go by  there with my state truck. Finally, they   d come over there and say,     What are you doing?    I said,    I   m monitoring, you peckerwoods.  You   re the worst people in the world for pollution.   And Eagle Picher  was, boy. These mines, that   s why all this shut down.  One day I went over there, and there wasn   t any  gambezi affinis  in that  creek. They disappeared. I checked the water, and they had got some  different stuff. They had dumped something in it and killed those fish.  Then they started getting rid of that sodium fluoride. They had two,  three, four million gallon of it in there. It was a byproduct of something  they was making, but they had to get rid of it. They had to get rid of it  with reverse osmosis. Do you know what that is? Okay. Well, I learned  about that. See, I   m learning stuff, and now I can talk to these engineers  and these chemists and what have you. (Laughter) Don   t know what I   m  talking about, but I can blow their minds.  Wow. So you   ve learned a lot.  Because of me, they had to get rid of all that stuff. They just had it  stored there, and they weren   t using it for anything. There wasn   t  anything they could use it for, so they finally got it. They got rid of it,  and that creek   s back to good. I check it every once in a while.  How important is it to you, or has it been, to stay in this area in  Oklahoma?  Well, I   ve always been environmentally    When I was working for the  Wildlife Federation   I   ll tell you why I got in the Wildlife Federation. I  was using my head. We had a club here in Miami, fifty bow hunters. I  wanted to change the rules and regulations of bow hunters. We had to  wear red when we was bow hunting. They wouldn   t let us wear  camouflage, so I went down to the wildlife commission one year, in    63,  and got before them. I got on the program and got before them and  lobbied to tell them what we wanted and how we wanted it, that we want  to wear camouflage. We have to move when we pull our bow, and the  deer were seeing us, and it was causing a problem.  I was really interested in archery. I went all out. I went to the wildlife  commission, and they told me, said,    John, there   s just fifty of you guys  in that club. You represent fifty people, and we   ve got other clubs  around here. You   re a drop in the bucket.    So that year I went to a  Wildlife Federation meeting, and in two months I was regional director  of nine counties up here in this area, in charge of it. The next time I went  to the meeting, I said,    Fellas, I represent 3,000 people here in the  28  Wilson  Mott  Wildlife Federation, and all the bow hunters want to change this rule  about camouflage.    They said,    Okay, we   ll talk about it.     In April that year, I went back, and they were getting ready to make the  rules for that year. The year before, they had told me they had already  printed the information, so they couldn   t use it. I went to them, and I  said,    Have you already printed your rules?    They said,    No.    I told  them we was going to get a lawsuit against them for having a meeting to  ask the people what they wanted, but they   d already printed all the rules  and regulations. Boy, that kind of got their attention when I said,    I   ll  have to talk to my lawyer about that.    (Laughs) I was just bluffing, but  then it worked.  Now Oklahoma has the best bow hunting rules and regulations in the  United States, in the world, because we   re allowed six deer. With a bow  and arrow, I can kill six deer. Used to have a ten-day season. Now we   ve  got a three-and-a-half-month season, from October 1 until January 15,  and that   s because of me. I   ve done that. I was doing that back in the     60s. When I make up my mind that I want something, I   m going to get  it one way or the other, hook or crook. (Laughter) That   s what I tell  them. I   ve been legal all the time. I   ve changed it, and we have  regulations that nobody else has. You know what I mean? Nobody can  kill six deer, and we can kill them all with a bow: two bucks and four  does.  Kansas, you can kill one buck with a rifle and one buck with a bow, and  that   s all. Missouri, now they   re getting close to what we   ve got. It   s  more and more and more. Oklahoma has problems now with deer,  running them over. I had two biologists in Oklahoma that were working.  One of them, I don   t know whether he still is, but he was the Wildlife  Director of Fort Sill. He used to take me down there and take me out on  Signal Hill. That   s where they used to use their bombing, you know,  their shell artillery and take me hunting on Signal Hill. (Laughs)  I know we have a lot more to talk about, but we   re getting close to noon,  so we have to wrap it up. (Laughs)  I get so wrapped up in it. Everything meets in. See, back in the early     60s before Tar Creek come up, I was working with this guy from the  Department of Pollution Control. Dick Gunn was his name. I was going  out here at Eagle Picher. They built a plant out here that they was trying  to pump all that water out of the mines and clean it up, the water they  was pumping into Spring River, and they were pumping bad water into  Spring River. It got to killing all the vertebrates and the bugs in the  bottom that the fish feed on and everything. Spring River was just one  place up there that was just dead, so they put this plant in over there, and  29  they were using it. They were getting ready to pump a lot of water out of  that mine they had up there in Kansas. It was one of the last ones, and  they was going to pump it and keep it pumped, but they couldn   t clean  up the water. President Nixon finally just shut them down, I mean shut  that mine down, and now it   s filled full of water.  Funny thing, I was hunting on these people   s property that I shut their  mine down, the Swalley. It was worth about a hundred million dollars.  They had already surveyed it, and there was that much ore there, but  they can   t pump the water anywhere. I was going up there taking water  samples out of that and then putting them on a bus going to Oklahoma  City for Dick Gunn when I was in the Federation. I was really hooked  up. They found my name in papers up there at the Wildlife Federation  where they was paying me for shipping that water through this  Department of Pollution Control.  They said,    How long you been a spy for the       (Laughter) I said,    I go  back a long ways. I might   ve been six.    (Laughter) When I make up my  mind I   m going to do something, it   s done. You know what I mean? I   m  going to do it. That   s why this all got started. I   m the reason they shut  Picher down. I got Dr. Abraham from the Disease Control, and I got a  hold of him one time. I went to our principal of our school, and a teacher  out there was hiring special education for several students that couldn   t  read. They were in third grade and couldn   t read or write. They had to  have special   and they were high lead. The health department wouldn   t  even check the kids    blood. They said,    Oh, John, we don   t want to  make any wave.    Boy, I stirred up a storm.  I had a friend on the water board who was going to a meeting in Dallas  on the next weekend with Disease Control and everybody. He was from  the water board. I told him I wanted somebody to listen to me. Our  health department wouldn   t. They just sat up there and said,    Oh, John,  we don   t want to make any waves.    Boy, I tell you, I stirred them up. I  got Dr. Abraham, and he called me the next Monday. He was at that  meeting, and Jerry Black told him what was going on up here. He called  me, and I talked to him three hours on the phone that Monday morning.  He came down. He flew from Atlanta to Tulsa and rented a car and  come down here Friday evening. I met him Saturday morning at the  restaurant down there, and we had breakfast together, and then I took  him on a tour.  First, I took him to our Head Start, kids over there, and the Head Start  was built on a sludge pond. I took him, and I dug a foot down and got  him a quart of dirt and handed it to him. I had a box that had twelve  quarts in that box, quart jars, and I give him twelve. He had to take those  back on the plane with him. (Laughs) Dr. Abraham took those back, and  30  they run them through the tests. Our grade school was built on a sludge  pond. A chat pile had been hauled away, and then they built right on top  of the sand, things like that. I knew what was the matter, but nobody  would listen to me. Well, I stirred it up. I started at the top and went  down.  A month later, the health department had a meeting over at the Picher  High School. They said,    We   re going to do this, and we   re going to do  that. We   re trying to get funding.    I looked in the back of that room, and  there was Dr. Abraham sitting back there in a pair of overalls. He come  in looking like a Picher guy. I went back there and sat with him. He said,     John, don   t tell anybody who I am. I   m here incognito.    The health  department went on about how they needed funding and everything. He  told me, he says,    John, I   ve already give them money to do that study  with. They   ve got it, and here they are wanting more.     The next week, the shit hit the fan, if you pardon my grammar. I mean,  they started checking them. Then they hired a bunch of nurses from  Oklahoma University to come down here and take the blood from the  students, collect the blood, all the way down to the first grade. Some of  those nurses were getting paid by how much blood they got. Some of  them were taking their own blood and turning it in to get paid for it. I  uncovered that. Then, the engineer that was in charge of our office we  had at Picher back in the    70s   we was plugging wells, and we was  doing all this, and so they had an engineer from IT Corporation. They  hired him. It was a bid, and they hired him, and he just kept disappearing  every day when I needed to talk to him. About three hours, he   d be gone.  Come to find out, I followed him one day, and he was going over here to  the airport. He had leased a plane to fly to a meeting in Oklahoma City,  a small plane. Then he paid for it with government money right out of  our budget. He started taking lessons to fly, and he was taking three  hours a day away from his job and everything. I called my boss, and I  fired that son of a buck. You know what I mean? I said,    Man, you don   t  mess around with me  You   re done     He says,    You can   t talk to me like  that     The next day, my boss from Oklahoma City come down, head of  the EPA. I told him what he was doing, and they got rid of him. IT  brought another guy in from New York, and him and I locked horns.  One day he said,    John, don   t go. I want to talk to you.    I sat there in the  office three and a half hours. He came back, and I said,    Hey, I want to  tell you something. I   m working here the same as you are, and I   ve got  things to do. I   ve got to go find a well for the drillers to plug. I   m still  looking for wells.    Ones I   d already found, they were plugging, but I  was still working hard, feverishly, ten, twelve hours a day trying to find  wells. He kept me three hours right there, waiting on his    I said,    Now  31  Wilson  Mott  I   m going to tell you something. If you want to go out on the chat pile  and talk about this, I will, but I want to talk to you here.    I talked to him,  and I told him what was what and where. I said,    Let   s work together.     The people in the office said,    John, I thought you was going to jump on  him right here.     Then he come back one day and said,    Are you carrying a gun?    I said,     Hell, yes  I always do.    I had a shoulder holster on, and my coat got  kind of    He   d seen my belt, where it was hooked onto my belt. I said,     Yes, I   m out working around these chat piles by myself all the time,  and there   s hundreds of motorcyclists out there running around climbing  these chat piles and everything. You   d be surprised with how much  trouble I have with people like that. They want to rob me and my  Hydrolab.    They was asking questions about it one day. Before I  thought, I said,    It   s a nine-thousand-dollar piece of equipment.    They  looked at each other and said,    Oh, what do you think about that,  fellas?    I started coughing and unbuttoned my coat and pulled her back  and got my handkerchief out of my hip pocket. They could see my gun.  Boy, they sure quieted down. I didn   t draw it, or I didn   t point it, or I  didn   t say a word, but I took care of the problem real quick. When I take  over, things are going to do just like a cookie bounce. The cookie don   t  crumble around me. It bounces.  Well, you   ve made a big impact, obviously.  Oh, yes. See that drill bit over there? It   s not gold. It   s plated. The  governor had that made for me for the work. He give me a  commendation for service above and beyond the line of duty. I got a  well over there they had me looking for. They sent me the directions to  look for it. I looked for it. Spent ninety thousand dollars moving a chat  pile to get to that well. They brought me a aerial photograph they were  using. It was dated, oh,    32. I was looking at that one day when we were  getting a backhoe to dig down and find that well. I had measured it and  backhoed, and we moved an amphitheater there on that chat pile with  earth movers, you know, those big earth movers. We spent ninety  thousand dollars moving it.  I said,    Is this what you used?    This engineer said,    Yes, we figured it  out there, and you had the measurements and everything.    I said,    Well,  this shaft that you drew here to measure it from was covered up during  the war in the middle of a bean field. They   ve covered it up and sealed it  so they could farm it.    I said,    We moved the wrong chat pile. It   s 400  feet off.    Now they   ve moved that chat pile. They hauled it all off.  Cates, David Cates, do you know him? He   s with the Department of  Environmental  Quality , David Cates. He was working for the health  department, and then they took part of the health department and part of  32  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  Mott  Wilson  the water board, and they made the Department of Environmental  Quality. He   s a state man.  I was so p   d off at the health department for the things they wouldn   t do  that I wanted to do. I just didn   t have any confidence in them at all. Then  David went to work for them. He come up with some good ideas, and he  was doing things right. I said,    David, you   re going to change my whole  view of the health department.    He says,    You   re doing so many good  things and everything.    I said,    Boy, those dumbasses down there, all  they want to do is sit at their desk and draw these big wages, these  doctors, PhDs.    One of them was supposed to have got a bunch started  to check these kids for lead, but they never would get out of their  offices. They wouldn   t do it. That   s when I changed their way a little bit.  Then, on top of that, I changed the way the US Geological Survey and  Corps of Engineers measure water, by measuring them in hundredths  instead of tenths.  Yes, that   s incredible. Okay, I want to thank you for visiting with me.  Any time. I   m at your bidding.  Okay. (Laughs)  That   s all I got to do.  Well, I really appreciate it.  -------  -------
