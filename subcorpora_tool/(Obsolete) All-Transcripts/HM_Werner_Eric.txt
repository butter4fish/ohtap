Speaker 1: Alright. Now before we get into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Let's roll.
Speaker 1: The first one is--they just require a brief answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, that's a tough one because I've got a very eclectic palate.  I love food period, I guess I like Thai food a lot.  That's probably one of my favorite foods is Thai.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, not really, blue is nice.
Speaker 1: Sir do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer, absolutely summer.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, I'm sure there are people that would disagree with that but they hear me more than I do (laugh).
Story_ID: 78909
Speaker 1: Okay, let's talk about your family.  Do you know very much about your family origins?  How far back can you go in family history?
Speaker 2: I think I can go back, I could go back to my grandparents from my maternal side and on my paternal side I can go back to as of yesterday actually, I can go back to my great-grandfather who was a resident of Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my great-grandfather on my father's [Joseph Werner] side his name was Nelson--Davidson Nelson and his wife was called Ella Nelson, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and that's in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Yes and I had a note on that, where's that piece of paper?  What's the name of that town?  That's a terrible note she's got, I took it.  Donaldsonville, Louisiana.  Donaldsonville. Are you aware of that?  It's like right outside of New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay are there any stories that have been passed along through your family about your--what your family is doing in the 19th century.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah my father's uncle, Delson was a trumpet player and he played for Ma Rainey.  He's gone to--I think they went to London [England] together, they played before the queen and that's one of the stories that I heard growing up.
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Delson they used to call him Uncle Delson.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-E-L-S-O-N, I believe.  Yeah, Nelson, N-E-L-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Delson Nelson?
Speaker 2: Yeah it's my father's uncle and my great grandfather they called him "Papa D" and he was a professor at Dillard University in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: What was his full name?
Speaker 2: His full name, excuse me for a minute.  It was Daniel Nelson.
Speaker 1: Any other stories or tidbits that have come down through history?
Speaker 2: No, I knew that they all had talent in the arts, they were musically inclined and that's something that my father always was involved in.  He was a trumpet player.  He played trumpet during World War II.  He used to tell stories about marching people onto the boat and marching them off the boat.  He never had to go to any theater or war but he did play in the military.  When he got he married and eventually had kids that kind of ended his musical career because he was more family oriented and really wanted to stay with us and make sure that we were okay.
Story_ID: 78910
Speaker 1: Now that leads to the question, can you give us your father's full name and date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's full name was Joseph Werner.  He was born in 1919 in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay in New Orleans?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in New Orleans and he came to Chicago [Illinois] at about age six with his family.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was he like and after his musical career what did he do?
Speaker 2: He formed his own business called the Hyde Park Delivery Service which was a commercial delivery service.  He was an entrepreneur and Hyde Park Delivery Service was a small trucking firm that you know, like carried goods from the stores in Hyde Park in that area to the residents of Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois].  So I grew up in that environment and worked with him on Saturdays when I was out of school.
Speaker 1: You said it was his own business and everything?
Speaker 2: Yeah he did.  He had his own business.  His father before him had his own business, you know so I always felt like I came from a line of entrepreneurial type spirits and I myself am an entrepreneur in photography.
Speaker 1: Now what was his personality like?
Speaker 2: Well he was a quiet man, he was more stern than not.  He had a sense of humor that I enjoyed but it was a dry sense of humor.  He was an excellent provider.  He built our home at a very early age.  We were living on the far southside in the early '50s [1950s] like '51 [1951]. He built this home before he was twenty-five.  He was a veteran of World War II and he was able to utilize the GI Bill and put us in a pretty decent neighborhood.  So we had more or less a middle class upbringing in that area.
Speaker 1: Where were you raised in Chicago?
Speaker 2: I was raised on the far southside, 94th and Prairie.  It was a neighborhood in transition at the time.  The schools were great and it was, you know, a pretty pleasant upbringing.
Story_ID: 78911
Speaker 1: Okay now give us your mother's name and spell that for us please.
Speaker 2: My mother is Gwendolyn Marie Blakey is her maiden name, B-L-A-K-E-Y.  She was born in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  She was born in 1917; she was two years older than my father [Joseph Werner].  She died last year.
Speaker 1: What was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: She was another creative person.  She was very creative; she worked for the Board of Education in their lunchroom program.  She was a caterer; she had her own business on the side as a caterer.  She was a dressmaker, milliner, very creative woman.  I always felt like I had a leg up in that my parents were creative and I've always had a bent toward being creative myself.  I determined that I really didn't want to be involved in anything but the arts as a career because I enjoy them so much.
Speaker 1: Did your parents have--ever tell you about how they met?
Speaker 2: No not really.  In and around Chicago I guess in the '40s [1940s] was a great time.  The music scene was live and they were both involved in those things and like and in and around the Club DeLisa, those kinds of spots is where I'm sure they met here in town because my father was still pursuing music and very interested in it.
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: One of each.  A brother who lives in Iowa, Karl Norbet Werner and my sister Toya, Toya Werner Martin who is also a photographer.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Karl's name?
Speaker 2: K-A-R-L, N-O-R-B-E-T, W-E-R-N-E-R.
Speaker 1: And Toya?
Speaker 2: T-O-Y-A, Toya Renee, R-E-N-E-E, Werner Martin.
Story_ID: 78912
Speaker 1: I want you to try to reflect back on the neighborhood that you grew up in and give us a sense of the--some of the sights and some of the sounds and some of the smells of growing up where you grew up.
Speaker 2: Well I grew up in-like I stated before middleclass neighborhood that was for the most part in transition.  I went to an integrated school, at that time it was approximately 25 percent minority and that was like eleven blocks away from my house.  The neighborhood was mostly comprised of bungalows and Georgian houses.  The architecture was pretty similar.  It was a neighborhood in which people like Jimmy Morgan's Cab Company lived there.  Judge Pincham [R. Eugene Pincham, HM] lives there.  A lot of entrepreneurs lived in that area.  In the '50s [1950s] before integration was fully implemented in this city that was one of the major middleclass neighborhoods in the city.
Speaker 1: Did they have a name?
Speaker 2: Well they called it West Chesterfield.  It was like a bordering Chatham, it was a little south of what was considered Chatham, and it was West Chesterfield.  It had great schools, like I said most of the parents were progressive people.  The kids that I knew and hung out with were very progressive people.  Most of them were doing things for the first time like working at the post office, driving CTA buses and having their own businesses was very common in that area.
Story_ID: 78913
Speaker 1: Were the neighbors very close?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think so for the most part; they were very close.  My mother [Gwendolyn Blakely Werner] was very close to the people on the block.  My father [Joseph Werner] didn't have much time for them, he was primarily involved in his business and he didn't mix well socially but my mother took all of that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of children on the block for you to play with?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, most people on the block did have kids.  I think that was the start of the baby boomer generation and kids were pretty plentiful.  So there were always kids to play with and we did things like go downtown and go to the shows and the museums.  It was a free time, I mean it was before gangs that I knew and we could stay out late and we could just do what we wanted to do.  We could burn leaves even and we'd do things like that.  Burn leaves and put potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil in our leaves and when we got finished burning leaves we'd just sit up and eat roasted potatoes and stuff, it was a great time, plenty of pretty girls too so that was great growing up.  So most of my memories of childhood are fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: It was called Burnside Elementary, Everett Ambrose Burnside [sic, Ambrose Everett Burnside].
Speaker 1: He was a general.
Speaker 2: Yeah a Civil War general actually.  From what I understand, not a very great one but President [Abraham] Lincoln utilized him in the Civil War.  Burnside never felt like he was qualified to do some of the things that Lincoln asked him to do but he tried and they built a school in his honor and I don't think he ever did anything during the war that was outstanding but they did name a school after him.
Story_ID: 78914
Speaker 1: What kind of a little kid were you like?  What did you like to do and what was--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well from my earliest memories were probably from about three years old.  I loved to draw, I loved to draw and grammar school I was drawing and painting and sculpting and those kind of things and loving it and I won a scholarship to the [School of the] Art Institute [of Chicago] while in grammar school which I was able to maintain for about four years going to the Art Institute on Saturdays and participating in their program that the Art Institute provided for elementary school kids was a great experience and one that I worked very hard to obtain because there were a couple of good artists in my grammar school and we had to be selected to participate in this scholarship.  Once you got the scholarship, you had to win X amount of honorable mentions to keep the scholarship current and I was able to do that for about three/four years and really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So you liked drawing?
Speaker 2: Oh I loved to draw and paint and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Were those your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: They were my favorite subjects, art was my favorite subject.  As a grammar school student, Marshall Field was very involved in grammar school art and I had pictures sent to Europe and that kind of thing and exhibited throughout the country as a part of that program.
Speaker 1: So they gave you recognition?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and as a high school student which I had no knowledge of when my art teacher submitted some of my work to the Red Cross and upon graduation they let me know that I had won a high school art award for the Red Cross in '63 [1963].
Story_ID: 78915
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to John Marshall Harlan High School which was like on 97th and Michigan which was very close to my house.  It was only about four blocks from my house.
Speaker 1: Harlan High School has quite a reputation.  A lot of people who come out of Harlan are very proud of Harlan High School or maybe I just bump into the people who talk about Harlan all the time but it does seem to be a certain amount of spirit that comes out of Harlan.
Speaker 2: It was a progressive high school at the time.  It was a new high school; I was probably a member of the first class that went all the way through Harlan.  It was opened in 1959 and I was able to go through the entire--my four years of high school were all spent at Harlan.  They had older kids that were transferred from Fenger High School that went to Harlan too.  It was a difficult place because the academics were rigorous, but it was a friendly place.
Speaker 1: Who are some of the teachers that took an interest in you or that you looked up to, who were some of your role models coming up?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if my role models were teachers or not but I had friends that went to Harlan that I respected a lot.  One of them that I'm still friends with today is a fellow named William Clark.  Upon graduating from Harlan he was accepted in Annapolis [U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland] and became an aeronautical engineer and then later went to law school.  Another friend was Robert Eaton whose parents open up a business at O'Hare in the early '60s [1960s].  They probably were the first black company to have a business.  They were the first black company to have a business in O'Hare and we're still buddies today.  And those kinds of people and their parents are people I looked up to.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers though?
Speaker 2: I wasn't really impressed by any teachers.  In high school, I didn't pay a whole lot of attention.  Grammar school was tough.  We had in eighth grade-we had subjects like solid geometry and things like that; grammar school was really rigorous so high school was--became a walk in the park because grammar school was so rigorous that high school wasn't very demanding at all and I didn't pay a whole lot of attention in high school, it was more of a socialization kind of a four years for me (laughter) rather than an academic one.
Story_ID: 78916
Speaker 1: What kind of social life did you have with all the pretty girls in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh it was wonderful (laughter), just wonderful.  Best dating and hanging out, just great, pretty women.
Speaker 1: What were some of your activities in school other than art and dating?  What else did you do (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well just learning the city of Chicago [Illinois] was always great.  Going and experiencing new things in and around the city.  Like to go to Lincoln Park or something in those days was really an excursion.  We use to spend a lot of our weekends at the Museum of Science and Industry, all those things were free and we enjoyed it as kids to go and to see and to the movie theater was always fun.  We didn't have any in our community directly but some of the adjoining communities had theaters like Roseland [Theatre] had several shows that we were accustomed to going to.
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of-were you a pretty good student in high school?
Speaker 2: No I was terrible.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I was horrid, I was great in art, but academically I didn't pay a lot of attention until I got to college and then it got serious to me.  High school was just not serious.
Speaker 1: But you were good enough to get to college?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, everybody had to be good enough to get to college coming out of Harlan [High School], everybody.  It was a kind of a time that this was not-they were not training us to go into industry, they were training us to go to college.  So we didn't have very many shops, I did qualify to get into the high school preparatory end of the school.  We had courses like chemistry and physics and the mathematical courses were tough, English was tough, they were all tough courses.  So I was on that track.
Story_ID: 78917
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were a senior on the verge of graduation, were you sure about what you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: I wasn't sure at all what I wanted to do.  I wasn't sure about college, I knew that I didn't want to go away to college; I wanted to stay in the city and go to college.  I had a fear of being in some foreign community in some way away college and really having a hard time while I'm up there in the country (laugh).
Speaker 1: You really liked Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I love Chicago and I wanted to stay here.  I went and visited trends that were in Champlain and those kinds of places and I wasn't impressed by those small towns and those small communities.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, there so many young people who want to go away to school.  They see it as a big adventure to go away wherever it is but you really wanted to stay.
Speaker 2: I wanted to stay.  I had no desire--it wasn't that I was a mama's boy or a daddy's boy or anything like that but I wanted to stay in the city, that's where--the city made me feel alive and I always felt like this city was vibrant and I loved it a lot and I saw nothing in those small communities that had anything to offer over this one and it wasn't something that my upbringing was pretty liberal and I didn't need to escape my parents so I didn't have that kind of desire--I didn't have those things pushing me to leave.  And while here in the city I could always work which is what I did.  I worked my way through school.
Speaker 1: So where did you choose to go to school--what did you do right after graduation?
Speaker 2: I went to junior college and I got me a job for the state, I worked at Illinois State Psychiatric Institute which paid for a lot of my early college.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well I went to Loop College which is now Harold Washington College [Chicago, Illinois] and I just bounced around the junior colleges and I got drafted during the Vietnam era and was sent off to war and picked up my education upon returning from Vietnam.
Story_ID: 78918
Speaker 1: Now was that a--was that a--how did you feel about being drafted?  Did you know about the war--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh I hated it and I did not want to go and I did everything I possibly could do not to go.  But in 1967 it was almost impossible to avoid the [Vietnam] War.  Every young man on the street at that time was getting draft notices to go.  I did everything in my power to not go.  I tried to join the National Guard which didn't work and I eventually was drafted and sent off to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and from there to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the Vietnam experience.  What was that like--what was the army like first of all?
Speaker 2: Well the [U.S.] Army during--the army was training you to go to war and when you're being trained to go to war-I don't know what it's like when there is not a war that's current but during Vietnam the training was unbelievable.  At the time that I got drafted, I was going to school and I was working full-time and I was very tired and so when I realized that I had to go to the army I said well listen at least you'll get eight hours sleep at night as a result of being in this organization which turned out to be not true at all.  We'd have to get up at 4:00/5:00 in the morning and start our day then and the day would last until 10:00/11:00 at night, there was very rigorous training.  They ran us a lot; we'd do ten miles runs.  Every day we had to do at least a five mile run and I couldn't stand running (laugh).  So it was very hard on me.  It got to the point where I actually enjoyed running because that was just how much we had to do it.  They'd run you until your feet developed blisters and then the blisters would break and bleed and dry up and you'd still be running.  It was amazing, people actually died during training because the physical part of that training was so rigorous that people actually died from exhaustion and heat strokes.  Running up and down the hills of the Ozarks, tough, it was very tough.  Vietnam didn't prove to be any more difficult than training for Vietnam.
Speaker 1: So how long was training?
Speaker 2: Well you go through basic which is a couple of months and then you go through advance training which is another couple of months so I guess I was down there for four or five months doing training.  I went from 165 pound to about 135 pounds as a part of that training.  But you come out of there feeling hard as nails because if you make it through the physical challenges were so great, that it just changed you.  It changed how you looked, it changed what you could do, it just changed you.
Story_ID: 78919
Speaker 1: We were--we had you at the end of basic training.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the year is 1967.
Speaker 2: Yes, well prior to going into the military, I had broken my elbow several times playing basketball not really realizing that my elbow had been broken.  I continued to live life and go on and it would hurt for a couple of days and then it would stop hurting and I would just go on.  I thought that a broken bone would be much more excruciating in terms of pain than it turned out to be.  But having gone through basic training, my elbow became arthritic and it made training very difficult because in order to eat at the mess hall, you had to travel through 77 monkey bars which were like things that you had to swing your body across and 77 of those was tough and you had to go through all 77 in order to get into the mess hall.  So I lost a lot of weight because a lot of days I didn't make it to the mess hall because I had to do those 77 bars with basically one operating arm and they did not really care that you had physical problems in 1967.  It wasn't a situation where you could run to get medical help.  They said no, no, no you got to go through this and you did have to go through that.  So the mess hall was maybe as large as a garage and they fed 250 men three times a day.  So in the mess hall there was no talking, the line coming into the front door was moving as fast as the line going out of the backdoor.  They would throw the food on your plate and you're supposed to just swallow it wholesale and get out, you know (laugh).  And prior to getting in the line, you had to do 77 of these monkey bars so basic was tough to say the least.  But if you are going to go to war you probably need training like that to endure the kind of physical things that you go through in combat situations.  And Vietnam is a place that you never expected to get out of.  When I first got to Vietnam, it was during the Tết season of 1968.  We were being mortared and bombed every night by the Vietnamese.  So when I got in the country, we started getting bombed, I think for the next two weeks straight we were being bombed.  Our station next to an air base, a place called Tuy Hoa Vietnam and air bases were very volatile situations because they were always being attacked.  I remember times in Tuy Hoa where we were overran by the enemy.  They would actually break through our perimeter and come onto the compound.  What they would do normally is throw in three or four mortars every night about 1:00 or 2:00 which would wake you up.  You'd have to get up, go look for them and then by the time you got back to bed you had to get up for duty at about 6:00 the next morning.  So you really didn't get much sleep in those kinds of situations.  It was always tense and a war of terror is a tough war because you never know where it's coming from and you never know in that situation a lot of Vietnamese actually worked for the United States military and you had a hard time determining who was the enemy and who was not because it could come from anywhere, it could just come from anywhere.  You could be sitting up one day at the mess hall or something and get hit by a mortar and people died like that.  You just don't feel like that you're going to be lucky enough to make it through twelve months of that kind of stuff.  The night that I left Vietnam--I left Vietnam from a place called Cam Ranh Bay and on that night we were back in Tết again.  Tết is a Vietnam holiday--Vietnam New Year which it seem to spur the enemy on to war and so I came in Tết and left in Tết and when I left in Tết we were being hit again in Cam Ranh Bay and we were hit pretty hard.  The last night I was in Vietnam, I got ran out of the barracks I was staying in because of the mortar fire and had to spend my last night in Vietnam sleeping in a piece of (unclear) going under a road because the enemy was actually on the compound and it was a very dangerous situation.  When you are going home they take away your weapon so you had no weapon, the enemy was on the compound with you and mortar fire was coming in.  So I found me a spot underneath the road and spent the night there.  And when that was over the planes came in to take us out--commercial airlines.  I think I came home on a Northwest Orient airplane.
Speaker 1: How long were you there?
Speaker 2: A year, the average time of service in Vietnam was one year.
Story_ID: 78920
Speaker 1: How were the black soldiers treated basically in Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Racism is a very serious thing.  When I first hit country they had a big sign on the wall, it said any soldier coming in this country that can type 50 words or more a minute, you were suppose to see this officer which meant that you might get a job typing at somebody's desk which when I saw that, I could type at that time--I could probably type at about 75 words a minute.  So I ran to the officer and said look I'm your man, I can type, give me a desk to sit at and we'll be fine.  But that didn't happen and I think it was basically because of racism that it didn't happen and they wouldn't let me do that and they sent me to a northern province called Tuy Hoa which was a lot more dangerous than where we came in the country.
Speaker 1: They were fighting in North Vietnam so a northern province in South Vietnam put you right up there--.
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't like near the DMZ [demilitarized zone] but it was further north than Cam Ranh Bay was.  So there again Tuy Hoa had an air field and air fields are always targets and so that's where I had to go and when I got there, well let me back up a minute because I had qualified to fly airplanes coming into the service.  They never sent me to flight school and I waited to go to flight school.  When I realized that those orders for flight school were not forthcoming, I did enough pushups to aggravate my elbow and thereby I went to the hospital and said look I can't go to Vietnam because I got this problem with my elbow and it's swollen.  They operated, I stayed in the hospital there at Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri] for quite a few months after that surgery and I was sent to Vietnam straight from the hospital.  I could only lift about ten pounds with my right arm at that point and then I was sent to Vietnam.  I was on the phone with the surgeon general in Washington [D.C.] begging not to go, and to no avail.  I had to go anyway.  It was a situation where I actually had to carry my rifle on my left arm as a right-handed person.  You normally keep that on your right arm but having come out of the hospital and having the surgery on my right arm, I didn't have any strength in it when I went to Vietnam.  I don't think I could lift ten pounds with my right arm when I went to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Did surgery improve it eventually?
Speaker 2: No it never did.  It always--it was a situation where I never was able to golf or play a lot of sports after that.  I mean basketball was out, golfing and those kinds of things or tennis were out because I didn't have the motions with the right arm to do those kinds of things as a result of the surgery because they actually had to remove a part of my--what they called a proximal radial head.  They removed about an inch and a half of it doing that surgery.
Speaker 1: Seems like that would disqualify you for service.
Speaker 2: That's what I had hoped but since I had qualified for flight--to fly, I got a profile saying that--from the surgery saying that I couldn't go to Vietnam and that kind of thing but a group of people at Fort Leonard Wood went to the doctor who wrote the order for me--who wrote the order to say that I couldn't do but X and Y and convinced him that since I had passed the flight program and was eligible to take the training, they went to him and convinced him that that's what I needed to do.  I needed to fly and he called me into his office and told me that he was going to remove my profile so that I could attend flight school and I begged him not to do that because I could see the writing on the wall.  I knew that once that profile was listed, they would probably send me straight to Vietnam which is exactly what they did.  I was in Vietnam for nine months before my orders for flight school came and when they caught up with me, I only had three months of service left in Vietnam.  To go to flight school at that point meant that I would have to sign up another year of military service, come back to Vietnam and roll the dice again in terms of whether I would be able to make it out of there alive or not.  And so I wasn't very interested in going to flight school at that point.  I felt like I could do the last three months and get out of there if I was lucky and which is what I did.
Story_ID: 78921
Speaker 1: So you came back to the States--were you in Vietnam when [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. King was assassinated in 1968.  It's amazing we're talking about this on his birthday.  Great man, King was a great man.  I got to see him once in my life when he came to Chicago [Illinois]; yeah I was in Vietnam when they happened.
Speaker 1: Tell us about--let's back track a little and tell us about when you saw him in Chicago.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Tell us about when you saw Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Well he appeared at the little park that is now called Nat King Cole Park; it's on 84th and King Drive.  When Martin came to the city, like I said a lot of people in that area were city employees and that kind of thing and the mayor at the time, the senior Mayor [Richard J.] Daley was not in favor of Martin being in his city.  So they made his time here pretty difficult and he spoke in this park.  I think there were like fifteen people out to hear him speak, that was it.
Speaker 1: People didn't know he was coming?
Speaker 2: I guess they didn't and me and a high school buddy of mine went to hear him.  So this great man spoke to an audience of fifteen people including kids in this little park on the South Side.  It was an amazing thing to see and hear.  He was a great man, he was one of my favorite people even to this day, Martin is.  I love his speeches; I love to read biographies of Martin because he was a phenomenal guy.
Speaker 1: Did he say anything in particular on that day that stuck with you?
Speaker 2: I knew he didn't say anything that I didn't agree with.  I agreed with everything he said (laugh).  That the city was racist, that we didn't have the opportunities that we probably deserved, I agreed with all of that.  At that point in time, I was going to--I had just completed going to grammar school where we had to be out of the neighborhood fifteen minutes after the dismissal bell or else we could get beat down.  The neighborhood was primarily eastern Europeans and they did not tolerate us being in that neighborhood much after school was dismissed.
Speaker 1: Well this is a consistent fact of Chicago life apparently.  A lot of people say that in those days and even in these days in some places if you are caught on the wrong side of (unclear), the wrong side of the street.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right, they had all of these natural barriers and we had to get under the viaduct by about 3:30 because it was no telling what was going to happen to you if you just got caught out there; in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Speaker 1: Did you know of any associates of yours, young people that were caught?
Speaker 2: Oh people did get beat up, people did get beat up.  The fellows that I ran around with made sure that they were underneath that viaduct by 3:30.  People did get beat up.  They didn't get shot in those days but they got beat up.
Speaker 1: That's interesting that Dr. King was speaking at Cole Park with fifteen people.
Speaker 2: Fifteen people, man.
Speaker 1: Did he have an entourage with him?
Speaker 2: Not really, maybe three or four people were with him.  But it was not well--it didn't--a lot of people did not agree with King especially from that community because they took the mayor's line that--what would happen as a result of Martin Luther King is that the applecart would be upset and their jobs, their businesses were tenuous enough that they didn't really want to participate or be known for supporting Dr. King.  There's a church on 35th and King Drive right now, the entrance was moved from King Drive to 35th Street.  So they didn't have to put that information on their return address, that it was Martin Luther King coming.
Speaker 1: Reverend Joe Jackson
Speaker 2: Absolutely so those feelings were very high especially amongst middle class blacks in this city.  They did not gravitate to King like after he died everybody was in favor of King but prior to his death that wasn't the case.
Speaker 1: So you think in principle, people probably agreed with him but they were afraid to lose their business.
Speaker 2: Right they were, they were--absolutely the case.  But as a kid you don't, I didn't have anything to lose.  They couldn't take my job; I didn't have one (laugh).
Story_ID: 78922
Speaker 1: So when you were in Vietnam, you all heard about [Rev.] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s assassination.  What were the reverberations among the soldiers?
Speaker 2: Well Vietnam is an interesting place.  One thing about it is that everybody had a weapon which one of the things my dad [Joseph Werner] always taught me was that when they made Coate (ph.) Smith & Wesson that everybody was equal and that turned out to be the case in Vietnam.  So there was a certain amount of respect that was naturally going to come to you because you had these weapons on you.  So not much was said about the assassination in terms of between the races but there was always racial tension in Vietnam, always racial tension.
Speaker 1: In what ways did it manifest itself?
Speaker 2: Well it manifested itself in the assignments that you got.  When I first hit country they told me that I could-well having qualified for flight school, I was being held by a training unit for combat engineers.  That whole unit was activated via Vietnam and I had to go over there with them although I had never trained as a combat engineer.  My first assignment it was suggested that I look for land mines in Vietnam which I refused to do.  I said I know this is a direct order that I'm supposed to look for these land mines but I'm basically not going to do this because it's just too dangerous.  Even if you knew what you were doing, the person next to you might not know what they were doing and then that was the end of it for you too and that was a contract that I just couldn't buy.  So I told the people directly that I wasn't going to do it and they offered me another assignment and that was to cook which I didn't feel like I wanted to do either and since I was on a roll telling them what I wasn't going to do, I told them that I wasn't going to cook either (laugh).  So they sent me to talk to this black officer maybe he could understand my position and he turned out to be from Chicago [Illinois] and gave me another job--he gave me an assignment in his office which was perfect.  So I did that for a while and then he sent me to Cam Ranh Bay to work in the satellite office and eventually I took over that office in Cam Ranh Bay.  It was a supply situation and my job was to supply a battalion of people--of men with goods that were coming into port from Cam Ranh Bay.  So what I ended up doing was running convoys of thirty and forty trucks around Vietnam.  We actually built the highway--the main highway on the coast of Vietnam called QL-1 and I supplied the materials for that--for QL-1 and I won the Army Accommodation [sic, Commendation] Medal which is about the fifth medal in the armies ranking of medals as a result of what I was able to do in terms of supplying the materials for that road.  I was basically by myself in Cam Ranh Bay working for the 77th--the 577th Engineering Battalion which was located in Tuy Hoa Vietnam.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Tuy Hoa?
Speaker 2: T-O-U-H-Y. Tuy Hoa. [sic, T-U-Y H-O-A]
Story_ID: 78923
Speaker 1: So in 1968 you--I'm glad we went back over Vietnam because we would have had you out of there without talking about this part.  Is there anything else about Vietnam you want to tell us before we leave Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Vietnam is where I had an epiphany, I believe in that I realized at that point prior to Vietnam my parents knew that I was always interested in art but they never encouraged me in art because they felt like that it was a tough line to make a living in and that I probably could not make a living as an artist but that experience in Vietnam made me realize that if God had given you any special talent or any special ability that you better take advantage of it.  I made a commitment to myself at that point that if I ever survive Vietnam that I would live a life dedicated to participating in the arts some kind of way that I was going live that kind of life.  So I think it had a lot to do with me becoming a photographer and I started to study photography and film after Vietnam and I think Vietnam really pushed me into that direction.  Prior to Vietnam I always felt like I had to have a career that allowed me time afterwards to participate in the arts.  I started studying flight at Midway Airport so that--I knew that airline pilots didn't work but about forty hours a month which would give me a lot of time to do the things that I enjoyed doing and wanted to do.  I always looked at careers that gave me time, time off.  Time off is what I was really concerned about so that I could participate in the arts.
Story_ID: 78924
Speaker 1: So when you came back what did you end up doing?
Speaker 2: Well they let you out of the [U.S.] Army; I think they gave me an airline ticket to get back to Chicago [Illinois].  I was let out on the west coast in Seattle [Washington] and they give you an airline ticket to get back.  The State of Illinois gave me $100.00, I think the army gave me $50.00 so I had $150.00 and I had a sport jacket I had made in Asia and that's what I had.  I had $150 bucks and a sport jacket when I got out of Vietnam (laugh).  So I began to look for a job which was never forthcoming.  A lot of people were getting out, there just was nobody getting hired to do anything.  You could work for CTA or you could work for the post office which was where a lot of people went and I had no desire to work for CTA or the post office.  I had a cousin who messed around in photography and I started hanging out with him and doing weddings on those weekends; realized that I could probably make enough money shooting weddings.  That I wouldn't have to work the rest of the week on a normal job and that's what I did.  I learned enough about photography to shoot these weddings and the rest of the week I would use to market the wedding.  I would take proofs to everybody that was connected with the bride and the groom.  The relatives--I would just carry the proofs and show it to them and that's how I made my living for a few years after the service and then I started a company called Art Color [Photographers].  We took pictures of grammar schools--in grammar schools of the kids.  The West Side at that point in time had just experienced the riots from Martin Luther King's assassination and the annual school pictures were not being taken there so it was perfect for me to come in.  Color was a new thing at the time.  I came in there with a package of color pictures and individual pictures as opposed to group pictures and was able to provide for my new family for about ten years shooting school pictures.
Story_ID: 78925
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So were you developing color at home?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't, I had, you know(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You have a color service you used?
Speaker 2: I used a color service.  We had schools that were as many as 2,000 students.  The volume was very high in terms of the amount of pictures we took and in the summers, I used to study film.  I connected with Jim Taylor [James Taylor] at the Community Film Workshop and I wanted to enhance my ability to light and the best lighting at the time was going on in film and I wanted to learn that.  So I made myself available to the Community Film Workshop eventually becoming the assistant director of that program which was a government sponsored program to get minorities involved in cinematography.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about Jim Taylor.  He's no longer with us.
Speaker 2: No he's not.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about Jim Taylor.
Speaker 2: Jim Taylor was a great photographer in my estimation.  He was head and shoulders above most of the photographers in our community.  That he was a study photographer.  He graduated from the Institute of Design at Illinois Institute of Technology [IIT, Chicago, Illinois] in 1951 after he completed his service in the military.  He was a great guy, he understood photography on a level that most never do.  He understood the technical aspects, he understood the chemistry, he understood the physics.  Most people get right into photography and concern themselves with the art but if you don't know how to mix chemistry and if you don't know those technical aspects, it limits what you can do creatively because it's like going into a painting with half a pallet, okay.  The things that Jim was doing were beyond that and the assignments that he had were beyond the usual assignments that you would find black photographers doing.  He shot for Downbeat which was impressive at the time; he got to travel. His studio was like right outside of the Loop [Chicago, Illinois] on North Clark.  It was a great place to be, it was a great place to learn, it was a great place to hang out with the people that came through.
Speaker 1: Now Jim was a cinematographer too?
Speaker 2: Jim started out as a still photographer.  He came into cinema in the '70s [1970s], in the early '70s [1970s].  That's the point that he actually started being involved in cinema.  I think that he might have been involved in some of the newsreel footages and always had a desire to be involved in cinema.  But cinema itself was a very expensive kind of operation.  So for a minority person to learn cinematography was--I mean the money that it would cost.  Cameras were 20 and 30,000 dollars.  A roll of film was--to shoot a roll of film and develop it might cost you 3/400 bucks, a ten minute roll of film.  The cost of cinema was prohibitive for most minorities which is the reason why the government established a system of workshops.  There were six of them throughout the country to give minorities a leg up.
Story_ID: 82901
Speaker 1: We were talking about Community Film Workshop, you said there were six of these models.
Speaker 2: Six workshops around the country.  I think I remember two of them pretty well and that was in Appalachia in White Plains, New York there was another workshop.  Those were the ones that we had the most contact with.
Speaker 1: Now you said the one in White Plains--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah those fellows--the people out of New York during the prison riots at Attica Prison in New York the prisoners demanded that African American cinematographers come in and document what was going on and so the people from the Community Film Workshop and I think it was White Plains, New York got to go in and photograph the kind of carnage that happened during Attica.  So it was cutting edge stuff to us.  We were young, that kind of stuff was exciting and it was good to be a part of it.  They had a saying at that time that you either get subjected to the media or you make it.  So we all felt like we were part of the group that was making the news rather than just being subjected to it and that we were documenting it.  The thing about documenting something is that you get a chance to pick and choose what you point your camera at.  So it becomes a lot of your story when you are--you're behind the camera.
Speaker 1: There's power there.
Speaker 2: It's a power there, it absolutely is.  You tell people what's true and what's not true; just being behind it and determining what you're going to aim the camera at and what you're not going to aim the camera at.  A lot of people forget that it's a person behind that camera.  They think that it's magic; that it happens in some far off land called Hollywood (laugh); that it's all magic but it's not.  There are real people with real minds so it's real thoughts that direct what you see and know.
Speaker 1: And making decisions about what you see.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  So it was fun being on that side of it like sitting here today is an amazing thing to me because it's such an unusual thing.  I'm usually in your position documenting somebody talking rather than being the talker, okay.  So it's been a great life, I've loved every minute of it.  I've never felt like that I went to work because I enjoyed it so much.  The people that you meet doing stuff like this, it's wonderful, it's a wonderful thing.
Story_ID: 82902
Speaker 1: So you studied with Jim Taylor [James Taylor]?
Speaker 2: I studied with Jim Taylor and eventually went to Governors State [University, University Park, Illinois].  Governors State was a whole new experience because it put me in touch with people like Ansel Adams, Morley Baer.  I remember sitting in a darkroom of Minor White.  These are great people; these people were the fathers of photography--of contemporary still photography.  It was great to be in their presence and to see their images close up and firsthand and be in their homes.  One of things that we did at the university-at Governors State was in 1979 upon completing my core course work there, we all went out to Carmel, California to hang out with people like Morley Baer and Ansel Adams and it was a great experience for me because I was in the home of people like Minor White.  These people were friends of photographers like W. Eugene Smith which I admired tremendously for the kind of things that they were doing.  What they did different than the normal photographer in the black community was that they understood the technical aspects of photography and could implement those technical aspects in the kind of work they were doing which was like wonderful stuff.  To see--there were a lot of street shooters in the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s] but when it came to street shooting usually the technical aspects of the work wasn't that great.  But people coming out of--like Governors State understood those things and could make better images in my estimation.  Could really utilize the medium.
Story_ID: 82903
Speaker 1: Now did you get any encouragement from some of the established black photographers in town, some of the older guys like James [sic, John] Tweedle?
Speaker 2: I knew Tweedle, I knew Jim [sic, John] Tweedle, he was a great guy.  I met him when he had a show on WTTW on PBS and I got a chance to go on there as a member of the Community Film Workshop.  Tweedle was great but there again I don't think Tweedle being probably one of the first African Americans to work for a major newspaper.  He worked for the Daily News.  Even Tweedle didn't have the technical understanding that was available at the time, he just didn't have it.  He couldn't totally use the medium.  He was one of the top guys out there but I don't think he could totally use the medium.  What would often happen in the news industry is that you go out and shoot the assignment and you'd come back from that assignment and turn it on to a dark room crew who would develop your film.  Then there were editors who would select the pictures that were going to the newspaper.  You didn't do those things yourself.
Story_ID: 82904
Speaker 1: Photography in my estimation is the thing that you need to control from the minute you take the picture through the development and on to the final print because all those things have great impact on the final image.  How it's developed, how's it printed and the image that's selected all have impact and most of the people-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: There are a lot of variable to it in terms of texture of paper.
Speaker 1: Yeah and how you decide to do it, a lot of variables.  So that when you turn over your development to someone else it impacts what their eventual work is going to be about and I think that's what happened to most--that's what happens to most photographers who work for newspapers and magazines.  Even photographers like Gordon Parks [HM] had to turn their film in and somebody else took it over.  I remember seeing a LIFE Magazine in the '50s [1950s] and I used to run home from grammar school because my parents had a subscription to LIFE because I loved the pictures in them, it was cutting edge stuff.  People like Gordon Parks was shooting for the publication, he was doing work in the ghettos of Harlem [New York].  He was doing work in the ghettos of Brazil which all impressed me.  It was the first time I had ever seen those kinds of images.  Gordon did a series for LIFE Magazine on the street gangs of New York City [New York].  Color had just been instituted, we're talking about, I think 1957 here and for him to go out and document these gangs in color film was a phenomenal thing to me, to see that happen.  But even photographers like Gordon Parks didn't have control over the technical aspects of photography, in my estimation, they didn't.  The emotions were slow.  They weren't high speed like they are now.  You can get emotions now that range up to 3200.  In those days the fastest film was tri-x which came out in 1957 with an ASA of 400 which was rocket fast.  Prior to that the ASAs or the exposure indexes was like 125 which was relatively slow which meant that you were not going to taking pictures at night for certain, they were just too slow.  But what the staff at LIFE Magazine was able to do in order for going to shoot color emotions under those kind of conditions was to hook up an infrared lighting system for Gordon to go out and shoot these gangs which meant that you could focus on heat instead of light and that's what was happening.  He actually had an infrared flash system that the technical people at TIME hooked up for him to go out and do this work with which is what he did.  When you see Gordon's work from like Brazil and stuff, it's exciting in terms of the images but very rarely do they really compromise [sic, comprise] the whole scale of values that you can find in a black and white print, rarely do you see that kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 82905
Speaker 1: So they were good--it's good photojournalism but it's not necessarily great, artistic photography?
Speaker 2: Absolutely and I always felt like those things could be combined.  Like having been privileged enough to see the work of Ansel [Adams] and Morley Baer and those kinds of people who absolutely subscribe to the--not just the zone system but--the zone system itself is just really the study of sensitometry which is the study of light sensitive materials.  That's what the zone system really is all about, the study of sensitometry and these people understood that.  Most of the people in the African American community did not understand sensitometry, they just didn't.  When I first became interested in photography and went to the studios that were in the community and asked the photographers at the time to help me understand this or to help me understand that, I was basically shut out, I thought being I was shut out.  But I later understood that they just didn't know that stuff.
Speaker 1: You thought they knew but wouldn't tell you?
Speaker 2: Right, I thought they knew and wouldn't tell me and my stuff didn't look like the stuff in magazines and I didn't understand why it couldn't look like stuff in magazines.  Why can I not do this and why can you not tell me how to do this, they just didn't know.  They just didn't understand it to that extent.  But you know like meeting and working with Jim Taylor [James Taylor] gave me an appreciation for what had to be done to make the images more acceptable to my eye, to me.
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] during the, I guess during the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] was filled with black photographers shooting with Ebony and Jet here and a lot of names come to mind of people that shot stuff here.  Who were some of your favorites here?  Are there any--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Some of those images are great, it's no question about it and I've met a lot of those guys that shot for the [Chicago] Defender and they shot for Jet/Ebony.  I met the people that shot the Emmett Till things but what was happening at Ebony and Jet and the Defender in those days was they did a lot of stuff developing by inspection.  They had no idea what they were getting when they shot it but when they got back to the dark room, they would actually pull film out of development to see should they let it go a little longer or should they pull it down, that kind of thing.  And to develop by inspection means that you had to look at a five watt light bulb with a green filter for no longer than fifteen seconds, make a determination as to whether you should pull the film now or later.  Should you pull the film now or should you let it stay here another two minutes, okay.  That's basically what was happening with development, that's basically what was happening with black photography at the time, in my estimation.  Those images were not great.  I can't think of a--sitting here in this chair right now, I can't think of some of the names of those guys that were shooting for those institutions and publications.  But the state of the art at that time was such that (unclear) stops were not that important.  The image itself was really what was important and that's what they concerned themselves with, the action not the technical aspects which I thought was something that could be incorporated with that.  That light meters were important; that I thought that I would not go on an assignment without a light meter because I had to know what the light was in the room.  A lot of people would look at their hand and say this is a F8 at 125th of a second, I never felt competent enough to do that, I always had to read it to know for sure.
Story_ID: 82906
Speaker 1: What do you normally shoot with?
Speaker 2: What equipment?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Generally Nikon equipment.  I've been using Nikon equipment for the past thirty years.  I love the engineering behind Nikon equipment.  I love the fact that you can have a lens that's twenty years old and use it on contemporary cameras because the mounting system of Nikon has never changed, it's always been bayonet--I mean it hasn't always been but from the early '50s [1950s] they stopped doing screw mounts which was the regular screw in mounts and made it bayonet.  So lenses always work throughout the entire system.  So you could buy a new body and use your old lenses which I thought was great and that's one of the remarkable things about Japanese engineering that made me stick with that equipment.  Another thing was when you had Nikon equipment, people thought you knew what you were doing and you were more apt to be hired (laugh).  So that was another aspect of having that kind of gear.
Speaker 1: This is true.
Speaker 2: Yeah they say you got a Nikon, you must know what you're doing.  It's not a Yashica.  So I think it took me two years to buy my first Nikon body but I've always used them ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay, you shoot like large formats or small formats?
Speaker 2: I'm capable of shooting any format from--I've shot 8 x 10 stuff down to 35.  But it's all film and if you understand sensitometry, if you have some understanding of sensitometry which I have some understanding of sensitometry, you can transform that information to any camera there is, it doesn't really matter.  The system is the same throughout.  The format is the size of the negative which doesn't really matter, it still got to be exposed correctly, so how big it is, is irrelevant.
Story_ID: 82907
Speaker 1: Now, what are your favorite subjects, what do you shoot?  Do you have a favorite subject matter?
Speaker 2: Well you know the thing about it is whenever you--I usually shoot assignments, that's what I mainly do and I love doing it.  The thing is to go into an assignment, try to do the best job you possibly can do so that people seeing the work after you completed it can get a feel for what the affair was or what was going on at the time that you took those pictures.  The deal is to tell a complete story and how well you do that is what you always try to do, at least I always try to do when I go out there is to really tell a good story and to make a person who is viewing that work feel like they were there in a sense in that they understood what's going on.
Speaker 1: That being the case, what have been some of your favorite--what occasions-(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: What have I done that I thought was kind of cool? Well I shot the Democratic [National] Convention for [President Bill] Clinton's second run.  I thought that was a fun thing to do.  I've done some things with Minister [Louis] Farrakhan [HM], I went to Africa with him in '86 [1986].  I probably photographed a number of entertainers, a number of them, which was always fun to do.  I remember being on a stage with Stevie Wonder which was phenomenal.  I was able to carry my kids with me on a lot of assignments and to expose them to that kind of stuff was great.  They are both very jaded now, they are not impressed by very much because they fill like they've done so much and seen and met so many people that it's just great.  I remember my son [Allen Werner]--we were in Atlanta [Georgia] on an assignment and he was having conversations with people like Dick Gregory [HM] and I was just laying back looking at him because they were just people to him at the time.  He was like ten or twelve years old and talking to these kinds of people which was phenomenal to me that he could do that.  Like I said now he's twenty-six years old and as jaded as they come (laughter).
Speaker 1: Not easily impressed?
Speaker 2: No he's not easily impressed at all.  We did a lot of work for Dorothy Height [HM] in a black family reunion.  So those things were going on in about twelve cities across the United States and we did that for about five years.  So my wife [Andrea Werner] at the time was working for Midway Airline so when I would have an assignment in LA [Los Angeles, California] or I'd have an assignment in Atlanta [Georgia] or in Memphis [Tennessee], I could drag my kids with me because we had free flights (laugh).  So that's just what we did.
Speaker 1: You had it made.
Speaker 2: Oh man we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we were in New York, we were in [Washington] D.C., we were just all over the place and got to carry my kids with me.  So they had a lot of exposure.  Growing up I think I saw Illinois and Kentucky which is where my mother [Gwendolyn Blakely Werner] was from, we would go there in the summers but outside of that, we didn't do a lot of travelling.  But my kids are well travelled; they've seen a lot.
Story_ID: 82908
Speaker 1: Is there a particular assignment that really sticks out as being your favorite one?
Speaker 2: I don't know, when I'm on an assignment, that's my favorite assignment because I'm totally committed to doing it (laugh) whatever it is.  I just love it, I just love doing it and I love the people that I've met shooting for all these years.  I've probably been shooting for over thirty years and I just love it.  I feel like I've learned so much working with some of the most outstanding people in the political milieu, it's just been great.  Walter Mondale is somebody I shot, I shot [President] Richard Nixon, I shot [President] George Bush.  All these people I've been very close up and had conversations with--recently at Palouse (ph.) Heaven Foundation I met and talked to Hillary Clinton.  These kinds of things are experiences that I will always cherish and they've been very special to me to having done them.  To photograph Bo Diddley which I've done, I photographed John Lee Hooker, Dizzy Gillespie, Ray Brown, Abby Lincoln and the list goes on and on and on; James Brown which has been situations with people that I never thought I would get a chance to meet or to work with and it's been wonderful.  My sister [Toya Werner Martin] came to me about twelve years ago and asked me to teach her photography.  I was amazed because I had been shooting pictures for a long time at that point and I was able to--when she came to me and asked me this, I decided that I wouldn't teach her individually but what I would do would be to establish a class and I began to teach a class at the park districts and I just made her a part of that.  So that it wouldn't be a one on one situation but that she would have other students to compete against and work with.  That's been a fun thing too because she's a working photographer now, she's won international awards in photography, she won the Leonard Sugar (ph.) Award from Carnegie Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  That's something that I will always be proud of her for doing.  She's won best for show in black creativity at the Museum of Science and Industry and has had many honors and awards.  I'm the only one that she's ever really studied under, I feel really responsible for her and it's been great.
Story_ID: 82909
Speaker 1: What are the toughest assignments, I mean you've done a lot of commercial photography?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I guess some of the toughest assignments I've been on is--are things for some of the tabloids like Globe and Inquirer and those kinds of things.  We take assignments from soup to nuts just to make it as an African American photographer.  There are probably only about four or five working photographers in a city of three and half million people.  So it's a privileged place to be in my estimation and in order to be that, oftentimes you have to take assignments that you might not enjoy and shooting for the tabloids were assignments that I normally did not enjoy because it always put me in situations where I was photographing somebody who might not want to be photographed.  To hide and to shoot people around the corner or something, I never really enjoyed at all.  I don't do that anymore but when my kids were going to college and those kinds of expenses were high and I needed to make as much money as I could, I would take those types of assignments.
Speaker 1: Anybody ever tell you to scram?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any confrontation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember Jim Brown telling me one day if I took one more picture, he was going up side my head and I looked at him and I said well God I wonder if he does hit me and I found down on the ground, how much money could I sue him for (laugh) which was the thing that I thought about because I felt like I could take a punch.  But I certainly wanted to take that punch from somebody who could afford to do it and I figured Jim Brown could probably handle punching me.  Another time I was shooting at the Hope Fest for Blues and I took a picture of--I can't even think of his name.  Maybelline--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Chuck Berry?
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry had a confrontation with photographers.  I guess he had some work done on his eyes and some people busted a lot of flashes in his face and caused him a lot of problems so I took this picture of him which his wife asked me to take.  He came running across the stage as though he was going to do something to me.  This was an old man at this point so I was like you really don't want to hit me because I'm going to fall immediately to the floor and sue you, that's what I'm going to do.  So those kinds of confrontations do occur (laugh).  You will run into more of them shooting for tabloids.  Yes some people--you never know how a person is going to react when you put a camera up in front of them, a lot of people don't want to be photographed.  It's amazing what that can do to a person and how they are going to react.  You never really know how they are going to react.
Speaker 1: You don't kind of feel sorry for some of them?  They are in the public light so much that they really can't move around without being shot.
Speaker 2: That's the price you've got to pay, that's the price you have to pay.  There's a tradeoff, if you're going to be Michael Jordan, you're going to get bothered.  There is just no way around that.  If you're going to be Prince, you're going to get bothered.  If you're going to be Stevie [Wonder], you're going to get bothered, there's just no way around that.  The public wants to know what you're about and there are people out there who are going to document it and bring it to them and tell them what you're about.  I think there is a tradeoff.  Fame is not an easy position to be in because you become a public kind of a thing instead of a private kind of an entity.  It's just the nature of being in the public eye.  So I don't know.

Speaker 1: Commercial photography, shooting ads and so forth.  Do you like doing that?  Do you have access to those kinds of jobs?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. And I think what has to happen in order for minorities to shoot ads and the kind of commercial work that you're talking about is that you really have to come up with the art directors.  The people who are making those decisions in terms of hiring the photographer for say a Pepsi-Cola or a Coca-Cola ad or for an automobile ad usually have a relationship with the art directors that are long-standing and go back and that just doesn't happen in the African American community.  Those kinds of people have big studios, million dollar shops to say the least.  They are well supplied and generally a minority is not even in a position to compete or attract that kind of work, it just never happens.  One of the premier photographers for the [Chicago] Sun Times not too many years ago was a fellow named Howard Simmons [HM] who was able to make that transition to shoot commercial work.  He had a beautiful studio and he was not able to attract the kind of clientele that he needed to make that a continuous kind of thing and I think it really drove him out of photography.  I've never been attracted to it because I kind of knew what it would entail and to go out there and set yourself up to lose on that kind of level is something that I never would do consciously.
Speaker 1: It requires a tremendous investment, right?
Speaker 2: A tremendous investment.
Speaker 1: And equipment.
Speaker 2: And equipment, very expensive gear.  Photography is a very expensive undertaking to begin with.  If you are a student of photography--just look at what you have to do.  You have to have a camera, you have to probably have a light meter, you probably have to have a dark room, you probably shoot three or four rolls of film a week at least just as a student.  Your processing and film costs during that week that you're studying photography will probably cost you well over a hundred bucks.  So from a student's standpoint to have all that gear and then be in a position to spend a hundred dollars a week it's a lot.  I've had courses in college that once you paid the tuition for the school, you might have to spend another thousand or two thousand dollars just to do the assignment work which puts us out of the mix on a whole lot of that.  Believe me that's common, that is common.  There are very few African American photographers and I think that the reason why that is, is because of the expense involved.  It took me two years to buy my first camera.  I didn't have a lens to go on it then, you know.  That was some more time that I had to spend and save to get a lens.  I became very good with the fifty millimeter lense because it was the only lense I had and so I had to work that lense.  When I needed a telephoto shot, I had to walk up on it, when I needed a wide angle shot, I had to walk away from it.  But me and that fifty worked it, you know.  So I really learned that lens, I knew exactly what it could do and how to make it do it.

Speaker 1: Now the black ad agencies, I think there are more of them in Chicago [Illinois] than any place else.  Burrell [Advertising]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Burrell and who else?
Speaker 1: We had Burrell at one time, Proctor [& Gardner] at one time, Burrell--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Like three of them maybe.
Speaker 1: That was a lot for--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah you're right, those three.
Speaker 1: Were they able to--and Gardner had an agency.  I don't know what--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Brainstorm I think it was called.  I've worked for all those people but I never really did commercial work for all those people.  Burrell had a public relations [PR] shop for awhile and I was fortunate enough to do a lot of work for their PR shop but I never did anything for their advertising because of the things that we just discussed.  What you have to have, what you have to be dealing with to attract that kind of work.
Speaker 1: So when they want something like that shot, do they have to contract with some--or do they ever do that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well they do, they do it all the time but they usually use a majority photographer.  If you've got an art director and he's got a chance to go to New York for three or four days or stay here in town, he's probably going to New York because that photographer in New York--that majority photographer in New York is going to probably have him some tickets to a Knicks game, he's probably going to be able to do things that I could not do to make him come utilize me, you know.  He's going to make it an entirely different experience for that art director.  I can't do that.  He can't come to my shop when he doesn't feel like being at J. Walter Thompson (ph.) that afternoon and hang out which is what he has to be able to do in order to hire me to do the commercial job.  I just can't provide that kind of stuff for him.
Speaker 1: These are the missing pages of photography.  How to be a photographer?  These are the missing pages.
Speaker 2: Have a rich parent, you know, which not too many of us have.

Speaker 1: Back in the old days, people like James Van Der Zee and the Smith Brothers [Morgan and Marvin Smith] in New York--have things really changed or were they just really lucky in those days?
Speaker 2: I think they were very dedicated people, they had to be.  In order for Van Der Zee to be shooting an 8 x 10 camera, he had to be very, very dedicated.  Because I'm sure that quite a bit of whatever money he was making went right back into his operation.  The thing about Van Der Zee is when he was really discovered, he was discovered in his nineties and they were throwing his negatives out on the street at the point of his discovery.  He just couldn't sustain himself anymore.  He lived to be a very old man and he really lived longer than he was able to work which meant that he couldn't provide for his space and that kind of thing and they were throwing those negatives out on the street when he was discovered.  A young woman found him, gave him a show at Harlem Museum, if I'm not wrong, and from there he went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and became nationally known as a result of this.  That happened after his career was effectively over with.
Speaker 1: I think a similar thing just happened with Smith Brothers in Harlem.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: The last one is still alive in the hospital right now and nobody really--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, you've got Roy DeCarava another New York photographer who was an excellent photographer.  His book "The Sweet Flypaper of Life" was one of the most sensitive books I've ever seen on photographs of African American people but he still struggles.  I had an opportunity-he had a show here in town and I had an opportunity to meet him and I was telling him that his book was one of things that has always inspired me and when I saw his book back in the '50s [1950s], I had considered the possibility of taking pictures myself. And he told me that he was sorry because he knew the struggle that that would entail to pick up a camera and just tell stories with a camera.  He said I'm sorry that turns you on like that because he knew the kind of work and hardship that would be involved in creating a career and a life behind one of these boxes.

Speaker 1: What advice would you have for young people who want to get into photography, what would you tell them to do if they really wanted to--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It can be done, it can be done but the thing that when you see a photographer working, the kind of people he's working with, you see him travel, you see him doing a whole lot of things that appear to be glamorous; very hard work.  It's very hard work and the rewards are limited in terms of economics and the ability to provide a living for yourself, very difficult.  You cannot do this unless you love it. You have-loving it is a prerequisite because it's the only thing that will sustain you through the rigors and the course work necessary to do it; you have to love it.  Nothing short of that will keep you in this business.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community at this point?
Speaker 2: For the black community?  That's a big question.
Speaker 1: We ask that of every one.
Speaker 2: That's a big question.  My hope is that we can survive.  I think that our survival is something that we shouldn't take for granted.  There are twenty five million Indians on this continent when we theoretically discovered it.  There is less than 150,000 Native Americans that are pure blood left.  So it's possible to take out twenty-five, thirty million people.  We always have to be concerned about that (laughter).  One of the valuable parts of this project that we are doing today is that you're documenting us and it means that we lived (laughter) and that's very critical because that history can be eliminated.  There have already been assaults on our history in this country.  You can grow up in this country and never know black people did anything.

Speaker 1: That leads into an interesting point with you that your name being Eric Werner--do people often think you're white?
Speaker 2: That just happened.  I think as a joke my mother [Gwendolyn Blakely Werner] played on folks but it has happened.  But you might get into the door but you might not get very far into it.  Yeah it's happened; it has always been a thing that amused me.  Yeah it sounds like--me and my brother's name is Karl.  We had just got finished engaging those people in war.  My sister was the latest born in our family and her name is Toya which is a Japanese name.  I have no idea what was on my mother's mind when she was doing this but I think it was kind of humorous that me and my brother were named with German names and then my sister was named with a Japanese name.  I think that's a kind of humor that's often missed by a lot of people but it's something that's always been kind of hilarious to me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Speaking of your mother, did--your mother had a chance to see you become--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and my father [Joseph Werner] did too, both did.  My mother died last year, my father died in '83 [1983] and they both got a chance to see me do some things in photography.  I did a slide show-I was telling my sister on the way down here that I did a slide show for an organization and I got my father to come and see the slide shows.  It was a big multiple screen kind of deal.  It was like three 9 x 12 screens with six projectors ran by a computer with quadraphonic sound, it was a pretty impressive kind of thing that we did for an organization's dinner--annual dinner.  My father had really never seen my work before.  When he saw this presentation and we were talking about how excited he was to see it and it was a thing that I'll take a lot of pride in having had the opportunity to show him something like that prior to him passing.  My mother saw a lot of my work.  She was with me for most of my career.  So she was well aware of what I was doing and I think she took a fair amount of pride in that I was able to survive in the arts.
Story_ID: 78941
Speaker 1: What would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Well I've had a chance to meet a lot of young photographers.  My legacy is that I was able to encourage them to do what they were doing which is a fair legacy for me.  I enjoy having done that.  I get a fair amount of respect in the community as a result of doing the things that I've done and that's a great position to be in.  You can't go very many places and not be recognized because one thing about being a photographer is that usually have a front seat and as a result of sitting in the front so often, a lot of people know you that you don't even know.  Because you're looking one way and they're looking through you to look at whatever they are looking at.  So it's been a fun position to be in and there is usually not too many people standing in front of you.  So it's been great; I'd do it again.
Story_ID: 78942
Speaker 1: Okay tell me this and this is slightly different, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as a real good competent photographer, I'd like that. And a hard worker.  I think the work ethic that I enjoy from my parents is something that I could not have done what I've done without.  To work in a field that's not really work at all because you enjoy it so much has been a great way to live.  If I had to work a job that I hated, I'd be a very miserable person, I believe.  But photography has always been exciting.  You're meeting new people every day.  You're going different places and doing different things all the time.  You're learning new stuff and that's just what it's about; it's about learning and doing.  I probably took more from this than I've given and I've given everything I had to give but in terms of what I've received, man I don't think it compares.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It's been my pleasure.

He hasn't made a big impact here in the United States but overseas he's really well known and very successful.  This is a portrait that we did together for Jazz Times Magazine.
Speaker 2: That's me and [Mayor] Harold Washington.  That's during his run for mayor in '83 [1983] I believe it was that we did that.  That picture is also on the wall in the current movie Barbershop.  That's Eric Werner as a young man.
Speaker 1: That when I saw you last, I think.
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: In the movie, I see you everywhere.  I don't know who you are but I keep seeing you.
Speaker 2: That's something that--that's at the State of Illinois Building, that's my son, [Allen] Toussaint [Werner] on the right.  We had just got--we had just completed photographing the black legislatures which is a part of the HistoryMakers projects--the HistoryMakers.  That's my entire family, my young family.  That's my first child on the left, Soraya and my son, [Allen] Toussaint and my wife Andrea.  That's in Darke County, Ohio and I think that had to be about 1978.

Speaker 1: Do you need to see it closer?
Speaker 2: Yeah I do.  Let me see. I can't even tell who that is.
Speaker 1: That's an old high school picture of me.
Speaker 2: Is that your high school graduation from Harlan?
Speaker 1: Yeah that's my high school graduation picture from Harlan High School, 1963.  Look how I look here, that's amazing.  That's me and my wife early on, had to be in the early '70s [1970s] with some of my nieces and nephews, amazing.  That's not my kids.  That's Soraya, that's my daughter.  See people who would call for my daughter, they couldn't pronounce her name, couldn't talk to her.

Speaker 1: Who is this?
Speaker 2: My sister brought these pictures, I have no idea what some of these things are.
Speaker 1: With who?
Speaker 2: That's me on vacation in the Bahamas my sister tells me, that's amazing.  That's it man.

Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  What was the occasion?
Speaker 1: This was a show at the Park West.  I had some photographs.  Nancy Wilson [HM] was singing and they had an auction of my photographs at the Park West.  That had to be about three years ago which makes it 1999.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph upon winning an award at the Museum of Science and Industry in their black creativity program.  Now the year on this had to be in the '90s [1990s], '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: That's an old friend of mine.  The first senator since reconstruction, Carol Moseley Braun.  We've known each other since her days at the University of Chicago Law School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  When or around was this taken?
Speaker 1: This was at an affair about maybe five/six years ago.  This was an affair that she attended, I was working and we ran into each other at that affair and Daryl Tate took that photograph.

I'm glad I did because it was a tremendous experience, one that I will remember forever and I did eventually have a show on my work from the Million Man March.  I think there are probably about fifty images that were in that show from that thing.  It's a very historical moment in our time in this country.
