 Adamson Mary Frederickson: Let's make sure that this is recording. All right; let's begin and talk a little bit about your family background and your childhood.  You were born in 1909? Mary Price Adamson:  That is correct. M. F.:  In Madison, North Carolina, in Rockingham County. Adamson: That's right. M. F.: And you were born in an area where the Prices and the Moores had been for generations and generations.  What came down to you as the youngest in a large family of Prices about the history of your families? Adamson: The history of my family, I have found out more about it in later years than I knew about it as a child. We just had a little community there, and we heard a lot about the names of Grandma Miranda and Grandma Emily, and so forth.  But I didn't really know much about them. M. F.: Do you remember any of your grandparents? Adamson: Only Grandma Minnie Price is the only one.  I remember her quite vividly because she stayed with us.  She went from family, one of from/her children to another, and so she stayed with us quite a bit, particularly since that was her home where we were living, you see, where she had spent her married life. M. F.: Was this your father's mother? Adamson: Yes, my father's mother. And we lived in my father's family home on a farm, the Rose Bank Farm, we laughingly called it.  I page 2 - Adamson guess it must have been named that by someone, I don't know who.  But anyhow, Grandma considered it really her home and it was because she had been married in Alabama and had gone there.  She was quite young when she was married.  I've forgotten. There she had all of her children and her husband died when they lived there.  He was buried in the family graveyard in the front yard, and so forth.  So she spent a good part of the time with us when she was in the country.  She stayed with my Uncle John in Winston-Salem quite a bit too.  Now you already know perhaps things about our grandma, Grandma Minnie and her background, M. F.: No, not specifically, no. Adamson: Well, I'll tell you about Grandpa and about Grandma Minnie. Grandma Minnie was the daughter of a very prosperous slave-owning family in Alabama;   Hillsboro,   Alabama, I think was the name of the little community where she lived.  Grandpa started a tobacco factory, a place there up, oh, within sight of the house where I grew up.  It was used as a barn by the time I came along.  But he had started his tobacco factory before the Reynolds and the Dukes, in Winston-Salem and Durham, started their factories. According to the family information, anyhow from what I was told, when the railroads were being built, the people in Madison refused to have the railroad coming through Madison.  Instead, it went through Winston-Salem and another branch of the railroad through Durham. So R. J. Reynolds and whatever his name wasDukestarted those and they had easy access whereas Grandpa Price had to do all the merchandising of his product, so   he himself went out on trips to sell the tobacco that he manufactured.  Now whether it was chewing tobacco or pipe tobacco page 3 - Adamson or just what kind of tobacco, I don't know.  Anyhow, on one of his trips he had gone as far away as Alabamain other words, he had sort of a wide range and it was a fairly successful operationand he met Minnie Wolfe there.  I don't know anything about their meeting and so forth and so on,except he did ask her to marry him, and she did do so and came as a very young bride to the family farm there in Madison. We were five miles from Madison, but Madison was the mailing address. M. F.: What had been the effects of the Civil War on your family? Adamson:  I heard only reverberations about it.  My grandfather's family had slaves, and the most that I knew about it as a child was the slave graveyard in our front yard; it was sort of toward the barns as was our family graveyard.  But they were slightly separated, apart. houses Then there were the slave / down from the house, down towards the creek, in the fields that way.  There was a ditch that had been there, and it was told that the slave houses were built along that ditch, I suppose for the drainage.  I don't know anything more about it.  But these were just things that I accepted as a child.  That's what it was.  They were still known as the slave houses' ditch and the slave graveyard.  These were places where I played as a child. M. F.: When your father was running the farm, were they still farming tobacco? Adamson: Yes, it was a tobacco farm.  I don't know how large the farm had been originally, whether it was the same size.  But by the time that I came along, there were about 2,000 acres in the farm. M. F.: Who worked on the farm? Who did he have to help him? page 4 - Adamson Adamson: Tenant farmers and my brothers, M. F.: Were they black? Adamson: They were black; let's see, I guess there were one or two white tenant farmers. There were aboutI could stop to count thembut there were about six or eight   tenant houses on the farm. M. F.:  Did you have any contact with those tenants? Adamson: Yes, very much I had contact with those tenants.  For one thing, Martha Oliver lived within sight of our house.  It seemed to me like a considerable distance at the time, but now if I saw it it doubtless would be not very far away because we could see her house up the road, on the way to Madison.  She was really more the house servant.  She had a small plot of land, but she really didn't work in the fields. What she did was she worked at our house. Her older daughter, Nora, was my nurse, and so I was particularly close to her. And then Martha's youngest girl was just about my age.  I can't remember her name right now.  And there Petras was a son/who was just older than I, so that I was associated with them very closely.  Then the other tenant farmers were within walking distance but a little farther away.  So when I started to school at the Gold Hill School, why, we had to go past some of these houses.  Well, I just knew about them.  I perhaps should clarify something as far as time was concerned. My father was having a very difficult time, my parents were having a very difficult time about the time I was born.  I was the tenth child, and that would   explain about it, but also, times were hard.  I don't what know enough about history to know/depression it was, but anyhow, it was the county seat, very difficult for him to make a living.  He had gone to Wentworth/to be page 5 - Adamson the clerk of the court where some of the children had been born. But they had moved back to the farm before I was born because they were just struggling very hard to make a living.  So my sister, Teeny, just two and a half years older than I was born in Wentworth, but I was born on the farm. M. F.: After they came back. Adamson: Yes.  So my earliest memories are of the hotel in Leaksville-Spray where they moved, my parents moved again in an effort to make a living.  There was a small hotel where mostly the drummers stayed. You know what a drummer is? M. F. :  No. Adamson:  Now they would be called traveling salesmen, but then they were drummers.  There was a railroad that went through, it was a cotton mill town, so the drummers came through in connection, I suppose, with the tobacco and the cotton business there.  They needed to have a place to stay.  And how large the hotel was? It seemed quite large to me as a child, but in later years when I went through Spray, why, it seemed a very small establishment. Anyhow, the idea was that they would have a place for the family to live, and then they could make some money in running the hotel. So it also was a very difficult life. My parents really, really had a hard time making a living. M. F.: Did they stay in Spray for a very long time? Adamson: Well, since I was born in the farm and how old I was when we went there, a year, not more than two years, my first memories are in the hotel in Spray.  Then we moved back to the farm when I was five page 6 - Adamson years old because it was just too difficult in trying to run the farm. My father was trying to run the farm,to keep up with the tenants, and so forth.  I have only one memory of the farm and during that period, and that is going up there with him one time,when we went in the surrey. We had to cross a stream that was swollen with rain, and it was a very exciting thing for me, you know, whether the horses were going to make it across or not. We had to have hot bricks in the foot of the surrey to try to keep us warm for this trip up there. We didn't stay very long.  I don't remember that we stayed at all, but I it was one of my earliest, most vivid memories about that trip in the wintertime up to the farm. M. F.: What had your father's life been like all along? He was born, I believe Teeny told me, quite early. He was quite a bit older than your mother, in other words. Adamson:  No, he was only seven     years older than my mother. She was eighteen when they were married, and I think he was twenty-five. That may not be exactly right, but that's approximately.  I mean, they were both at just the marriageable ages. M. F.:  Do you remember hearing stories about or having him tell you what his life had been like when he was a child? Adamson: No, I don't. He had a friend in Madison, Mr. Pickett, Mr. Nat Pickett.  He and Mr. Pickett loved to sit and talk.  Mr. Pickett would come out to the farm on a Sunday, and they would sit on the porch and rock back and forth and discuss various and sundry things. Mr. Pickett was a more sophisticated kind of man.  He had lots of books in his house, page 7 - Adamson and he was said to be a Socialist. My father was a very devoted Democrat. So that perhaps provided a basis for them. But I happen to remember sitting on the edge of the porch and listening to their conversation one afternoon, and it made an impression on me because they were talking about what the Civil War had done to the South, and particularly to our section of the South.  They both agreed that we were still feeling the effects of the Civil War economy. My father was saying that that was what was the basis for his having such a difficult time making a living, that the economy was still in bad shape.  It seems to me that they said something like, in those years,                                        the big depression came along, you know, after the war,       but I have no real memory about what they said.  But it made an impression on my childish mind that they were talking about the Civil War because all I knew about the Civil War is the that room that I slept in upstairs/had swords on the wall that my father's uncles had used when they were in the Confederate army.  So, there were other things too, but that registered because I would lie in bed and look up at those swords on the wall,  (laughter) M. F.: You knew that in some way you were a child of the Confederacy. (laughter)  Had your father been sent to college? Did he attend a college? Adamson: Yes, he went to the University of North Carolina, but he was not able to stay I believe it was two years that he was therebecause my grandfather died. Whether it was a heart attack, I don't know what it was, but something rather suddenly.  Grandma Minnie had a half a dozen childrenI could stop to count to tell you how many. But anyhow, my father was the oldest one, so it was taken for granted that he had to page 8 - Adamson come back and become the head of the family.  So he was not able to stay at Chapel Hill longer than whatever time it was.  I can't think that he finished out whatever term he was in.  I suspect he must have been in his sophomore year when his father died, and that he had to come home and take charge of things. Then my mother had gone to Greensboro College. Hers was a strong Methodist family, and her two half-sisters had gone to college there. In the Civil War and because of the difficulties of things in the Civil War, they had only been able to stay two years. So that when my mother got at the age to go to college, my Grandfather Moore was more prosperous and could have sent her to college for the full time, but since her two half-sisters had only been there for two years, why, he did not think it appropriate for her to stay more than two years.  She and my father, both having had this taste of college education,     were obsessed by the idea that their children should have an education. And that was really the driving force in their lives. Everything was built around the childrens' going to school.  Every effort was made not only for the children to go to school, but to go to the best school that could possibly be managed. M. F.: By the time you were born, several of your older brothers and sisters had already gone to school, right? Adamson: My brother,Tom, my oldest brother, was in the university at Chapel Hill. He was in the class of 1909, I think. That was the year that I was born.  My sister, Ruth, went to Salem College.  She was there saying she was at the time I was born.  I remember her /    quite irate about coming finding home and/another baby in the family.  She would have to look after me, page 9 - Adamson so she often laughed about it in a wonderfully good, human kind of way. She said the only way she could manage me was to yell at me, "Shut up!" (laughter) She and Tom both reflected the fact that the family fortunes were better then.  They got progressively worse as more and more children came along.  They rather went to college on a different status than the had younger ones did.  They wore the proper kind of clothes and/some sort of social pretensions, you know, that sort of thing.  Then when my next brotherwe called him Tiny; his name was, oh, Valentine, sort of an was abbreviation. His name / James Valentine; he was named for my father and some ancestor.  I've forgotten where the Valentine name came from. him But anyhow, my father didn't want/to be called the same thing that he had was called, so he was called Valentine and/the family nickname, of Tiny.   When he got to the point of going to college, the times were tough and he really more or less worked his way through the university. He was a brilliant student. He not only did his regular undergraduate work but did the medical school.  Then he went from the university medical school to Johns Hopkins University, and how in the world he managed to do that, I don't know, to do it and to have the highest grades, because there certainly was not a lot of help.  There would have been some help from my parents, but there wasn't a lot of help. M. F.: We talked a little bit about your father's earlier life and his. . . . Adamson: His what? M. F.: His earlier life and going to college for two years, and you said your mother also went to college for two years. What do you page 10 - Adamson remember hearing about her life when she was small? Adamson: Hers was a very devoted, close family.  Her father had a mill on the Belew1 s Creek, which flows into the Dan River and then on down to Danville.  Incidentally, it's been dammed up by the Duke Power Company and my mother's childhood home                        is all under water. Anyhow, my Grandfather Moore was something of a scientist.  I'm not sure whether he went to what was then Trinity College and is now Duke University.     Anyhow, my mother's two brothers went to Trinity.  They were all of a scientific mind. My uncle Enoch turned into a manufacturer. He invented an electric machine to make        steelthe terminology somehow escapes me right now.  But anyhow, he was quite successful in his business.  My grandfather apparently was sort of the marvel around there because he had his mill set up so that it would run by water and generating electricity? then some scientific business/       He also had a farm, but not as large as my Grandfather Price's farm. M. F.:  They were sort of from the same social group in the county? Adamson: They were definitely of the same social level in the county, so it was normal that the two of them should meet. M. F.: What sort of plans do you think were made for your mother's life? Was she sort of raised to be a southern lady, or was she . . . Adamson: No, she was raised to be good; southern lady's not the term, was right/ She/raised to be upright, is what she was. As I say, her family was  very strong Methodist. My grandfather had married Marinda Branson. And she was a ladyI don't know whether you    heard about Grandma Marinda or notbut she'd been to Greensboro College, and she was interested in the affairs of state.  She said the children needed page 11 - Adamson books to study from during the Civil War era because it just wasn't any. possible for them to get/ So she turned in and wrote books, textbooks, for the children      in the area to learn their reading, writing, and arithmetic.  Incidentally, there are copies of her books in the New York Public Library in the rare book collection.  She had them printed, oh, I imagine her husband or I don't know just who, did the printing of them. But anyhow, on the brown paper; they didn't have any other on. paper to do it/ I have seen those books, but I'm afraid at a time when I was rather scornful of the literary merit of (laughter) a devoted Confederate lady writing a history book (laughter). M. F.: Had they tossed out the regular history books, I guess, when the war broke out or when they seceded? Adamson:  I imagine it was a combination of those things.  There just weren't any books available for study, and     the ones that might be around were not acceptable to the southern point of view. M. F.:  Interesting. Adamson: So anyhow, Grandmother Marinda died. She had three children; no, she had two daughters, Aunt Mary and Aunt Grace. And then she died, and in the course of time, my grandfather married her younger sister, Emily.  Then he and she had two sons and my mother, the three children.  So there was this very close tie                            between, you couldn't really call them half sisters, anyhow, the two batches of children. M. F. : Do you think that your Grandmother Marinda' s plans for the children having books to read and all, that she planned to have her page 12 - Adamson educated? daughters /    I mean, there was no reluctance on her part or on that college? family's part to have their daughters read and go to / What did they see them doing, teaching school or marrying, but being well educated, or. . . Adamson: I assume from the fact that both of those aunts, Aunt Mary and Aunt Grace, married young men in the area at fairly early ages and had lots of children that that was the accepted social pattern.  But just why those children . . . well, as I was saying, Aunt Grace and Aunt Mary went to Greensboro College for two years, and that was two years only because the times were so tough. Apparently they had what passed for what education was available. M. F.: Did any of those women work for the suffrage movement that you know about? Adamson:  I never heard any word to that effect.  Now, just what their interests were, I don't know. But Aunt Mary was a very lively person.  She had this great drove of children, and her husband, Uncle Jim Wall, his name was, wasI don't know, there was sort of the implication that Uncle Jimwas not as energetic as he might have been. Anyhow, Aunt Mary went to Greensboro and started running a boarding house and brought up her large brood of children.  Then when the children that it were at least teenage, they read somewhere about Idaho/was the land of opportunity, that people could go out there and they could get land, and there was an open opportunity.                        Then the railroad had been through, so it was possible to get to Idaho.  So Aunt Mary packed up a lunch eight days for sufficient to last/tier and however many children there were, at least half a dozen, and they managed to get money enough to buy their train page 13 - Adamson tickets. They got on the train and went to Idaho, leaving Uncle Jim in Greensboro. He apparently didn't think it was such a good idea to go to Idaho.  So they went out and just how they managed to get along, I don't know. But after they had become established, I suppose Aunt Mary ran a boarding house again, and whether it was Boise or Twin Falls, I don't know. After they were established there, Uncle Jim heard about it and he went out there too. He got himself on the train and went out to join up with them.  He was not a skilled worker, so that what he did was he established a garbage collection business and managed so well at it that when he died before long, he left Aunt Mary enough money so that compared her last days were spent in ease, not luxury, but in ease as/to her long years of hard work. M. F.: Do you remember people in the family talking about them leaving? What was the reaction to her scooting off to Idaho with all these children? Adamson:  I was very young, and so my memories are vague^ but anyhow, I'm telling you these stories,    I got the impression from the way that they were told.  I would not verify    their being factually correct, but it's my childish memory of what I heard about them. M. F.: Did your mother ever participate in any of the women's club movements? Adamson: Oh,there was Madison was five miles away, and out in the country there was nothing to do. We even had to go to Madison to a Presbyterian go to/church, five miles away, and we didn't go very much, even though my parents were quite religous,because it was too much to get all of page 14 - Adamson the children up and washed and dressed and get them off to the five miles to go to Sunday school or church.  So there wasn't any opportunity for her to do that. She was quite interested in learning and knowing about things. a She had a cousin whose name was Eugene Branson, who was/professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Now you would call him a sociologist, but his specialty was on the rural conditions in the South. He was quite an accepted scholar and professor, so that when we moved to Chapel Hill, my mother thought that what she would like to do would be to go     to the university since she had had only two years of college.  She decided she would take one of Cousin Eugene's classes. She and my father had always been very stern with the children about studying and making good grades. We were supposed to apply ourselves in school.  So, she had no alternative but to study hard and because she had the double thingsshe had to meet Cousin Eugene's criteria because he had been a tutor in her home when she was a child, and Miss Mary Trotter had also been a tutor. Miss Mary TrotterI was named for her had lived in my mother's home because there was no school for them to go to. When she went to Chapel Hill, she did take the sociology courses and my, my, she worked hard,  whether Cousin Eugene may have given her preference in grades, I don't know.  (laughter) M. F.: Did she take courses for several years? Adamson: Yes, I think it was for at least two years, and perhaps she took only one course a year.                       But she found it enormously interesting.  She was a person who liked to read, and she liked to find out about things.  She had a good, curious mind, about  such things as page 15 - Adamson new kinds of foods.  She did not feel that she had to have just the kind of food that she was brought up with.  She read the magazines.  I remember her winning a prize from  Woman's Home Companion,or some magazine, about a cake.  She chose a name for it that she called "Royal Tropic Aroma Cake."  (laughter) M. F.: Was she ever interested in politics? Adamson:  I don't know.  It would not have been appropriate. My father was very interested in politics.  He was a registrar.  When my grandfather, the tobacco manufacturer, was alive and in business, he had what we called the "office" in the front yard of our place where he ran his tobacco businessgoodness, I've lost the train about what I started to say about the office.  Oh, it was in the office where the voting in took place; the precinct and the registration/ my father was the registrar.  So anybody in that precinct     came to our front yard to register and vote.  I remember that most vividly becauseI remember, you know, how things stick in childrens' minds without having any logical reason about why they did but I remember my father coming in to the house one day saying that a Negro had come up to register. And he was very much confused about what to do about it. He's thinking, of course, he couldn't permit a black man to register, but on the other hand, he admitted he was better qualified than some of the people that had been there to register.  I remember, and it must have been so for it to have stuck in my mind all these years, that he was really chagrined with himself about it. But he went through the business of making it so difficult for the man to register that he couldn't do it. Now I consider my father to have been an honest man, and I'm page 16 - Adamson just telling you that story for what was going on, the approach about it because I'm sure that he was ashamed about doing that. But this was something that he thought he had to do. M. F.: How did he and your mother both interact with the people who worked for them and with the people who worked for them both as tenants and also in the house, and other people in the community? Adamson: Never any harshness, anything at all.  They got along very well indeed with them. And there again, I have only a child's analysis of the social scene.  But something that I remembered quite well.  I was telling you about Martha Oliver who lived there and who had been so very close to our family. Martha married or went to live with someone who was said to be a white man.  I don't know whether he really was or not.  Anyhow, he lived some miles away. So when she wanted to move over there, my father went up and he took his wagon and the team and so forth, and helped Martha with the moving.  For some reason      I went on that moving trip, though I can't see how there was room enough for me to go, you know.  So it must have just been my wanting to go, and they found a place for me to go along.  But that stuck in my mind.  I'm sure my father didn't    approve of Martha's going to live with that man, but he nevertheless did what he could to help her. And about my mother, I have a vivid memory of her at the time she was teaching school to try to get a little cash money,and how she was my first school teacher, incidentally.  She went to some sort of teachers training course that they in Wentworth, the county seat, had/one summer for several weeks, and                                      she got her certificate to teach at the local Gold Hill school, the one-teacher, and page 17 - Adamson near us. then the two-teacher school,that was /   She was working at that, and yet I have this vivid memory of her sewing at night and making clothes for Martha's little boy.  I particularly remember it because she was making pants for the child.  She showed me about how she waswhatever call it; you would/ these days it would be a zipper, but whatever it was the opening in the pants what the little boy needed.       The subject of one's personal parts, or much less sex,    was never mentioned in our house at all. My parents had ten children but we1d never have known any sex life at all     went on.  My sister Ruth had lots of beaus, but they were always talked about in a social,entertaining,kind of way.  There was never, never any real discussion about the serious aspects of these things. So I'm wandering around, I'm afraid. M. F.: No.  I've wanted to ask if you were aware of sort of the nature of the relationship between your mother and father.  They ran this farm, they had trouble making a living, they had children together. How did they get along together? What was it like? Your mother often went out to work, I mean, she taught school outside the home. How did your father react to that? How did they get along? Adamson:  I never heard any harshness at all between them.  As a for matter of fact, it was not permitted/the children ever to have any harsh words.  I mean, my father would say, "We won't have any snaps,please." (laughter) For instance ,when she started to teach school was when I started school^ she was my first teacher. Martha came to help with the cooking and cleaning so that she could go to teach school.  I started my school page 18 - Adamson with as my mother    the teacher at this little country school.  I remember very vividly about my father, the trouble he went to to make a path for us, the shortest route for us to get over to the Gold Hill school because to go by the road was several miles and would have for me required the horse and buggy/to go.  It was a shorter distance to go cut a path, through the field.  So he not only/ he put a log across the stream to get across and there was a rail       to hold onto. There's a word for these things which are part of our childhood vocabulary. Then when we got over to the Wilsons farm, which was the largest farm between us and the school, to get through the Wilsons' pasture, he made a stile over the fence so that we could get through and go through the field to the school.  That was a rather arduous task.  But he put his mind to it and figured out about what was the best route for us to go.  Then if there were really bad days, he would hitch up the buggy and take us. But it was too much for him, with his farm work to do.  He couldn't spend his time taking us back and forth to school.  That's one thing I remember about it. Another thingI remember these things; there's no rhyme nor reason I do. about what I remember, certain things I don't, and others/ But I remember sitting on the porch, the front porch, one time and my father talking about the contempt he had for the people in the little town of Madisonwho, incidentally, considered themselves very much socially above us because we lived out in the country.  So the Madison people fancied themselves as being much above those country people.  My father was talking about the Madison social set, and to show his disdain for them page 19 - Adamson BEGIN SIDE II TAPE I Adamson:  . . . concern. He would                      I've forgotten what his expression was, but the implication was he'd just as soon walk down, naked down the streets of Madison, you know, as far as those people were concerned. My mother drew herself very proudly and said, "I trust you would have too much respect for me to do it."  (laughter) M. F.: As the youngest of ten children, who were your closest companions on the farm? Were they your brothers and sisters or . . . Adamson: My sister, Teeny, who was two and a half years older than I was the person I was closest to. And then my brother, Wright, who was five years older than I; I saw quite a bit of him.  Then in a large familyI understand it's a general customwe sort of divided up into cliques.  The first five children were boys, with one girl, and the last five were girls, with one boy.  So the boys in the upper bracket sort of adopted one of the girls in the lower bracket, and to these days, my brother Paul, who was myI don't know what you would call him, but anyhowI'm going to see him for his eightieth birthday in Greensboro on the second of May. That's really one of the objects of going to see him, although Paul and I have very little in common. He is a shrewd businessman and  very conservative as far as political and social As far as race relations are concerned, I can only say that he's deplorable, and I'm well known as being one who has worked and felt that the rights of the black people are something that's very important to me personally and to the society.  So, despite these things, Paul and I have never had any disagreement at all, even when I was active in politics in North Carolina on the opposite side of the Democratic party's affairs than he was. page 20 - Adamson We never had any disagreements.  So that was just the way it went. My brother, Enoch, was the patron of my sister Teeny, as she may have told you.  So it went.  Each of the girls had a special brother, and Mildred will tell you perhaps about Tom being her patron. M. F.: I was very interested in looking at what most of the boys went on to do and the kinds of things the women in your family went into. It's almost like you and your brother Paul, it's almost diametrically opposed in a way.  Do you have any hints about why that happened? Did it have to do with them being older, or the women coming along at a different time? Adamson: I have speculated about that quite a bit over the years and have never come to any answers that satisfied me.  The only thing that would be a comment that I would make about it was that the boys,being the first five children,came along when the family had more social pretensions.  The economic status was not as hard as it was for the last one of the last five, five.  Although Wright/takes after the boys, and my sister Ruth, who was the girl                      amid the four boys, was completely apolitical but a wonderfully human and sensitive, tolerant kind of person. M. F.:  Could it have had anything to do with the relationship that you had with your parents, the girls perhaps being closer to your mother or the boys being closer to your father? Adamson:  I never, never thought that that was true. Of course, the boys worked in the fields, and it was strictly forbidden for the girls to work in the fields, no matter how hard up our family was.  The girls did not work in the fields because that would have been below our social page 21 - Adamson status to do it. We worked in the garden, yes, but not in the fields. But then to get back to your question, my brothers were more associated with my father since they were working in the fields and running the farm and doing the things there.  The girls were more associated with the house. M. F.: Were you closer to one parent more than the other? Adamson: Yes, I was very much closer to my mother because she was my first teacher in school.  Then my father died when I was eleven, I think it was, twelve, I suppose it wasin 1921; I was born in 1909, so I must have been twelve years old. My mother had very difficult years with trying to get along on the farm and finding she couldn't do it, and moving to Chapel Hill to run a rooming house so that the children could go to school there.  There again, she maintained the drive.  So that it was only as a grown person that I looked back on my father and our relation, and I'm very critical of myself for not having understood him better.  I think he must have been quite a person.  He was irritable and a very stern parent. He didn't permit nonsense from the children. But he was very good and always encouraging about reading and helpful about information, and just trying to guide us in the way that we should go. And I think that if I had known him later on, I would have liked him very much. As a child, I was very disapproving of him. M. F.: Because he was so stern? Adamson: Because he was so stern, and because he was difficult to get along with, and he was very unhappy about his not being able to "provide." M. F.:  Earn a living? page 22 - Adamson Adamson: Provide. He was brought up, you know, the head of the "provide." family and it was his job to / I can see it was just a terrible assignment that he gave himself. M. F.: Did he feel as strongly that the girls in the family should have as much education as the boys? Adamson: Definitely.  Both of the parents felt very much that the girls should have an education.  Mildred may tell you about   how when the time came for her to go to high school, there was no high school within our area where she could go.  He got my Uncle Ashby, his       brother who lived in Miami, Florida, to take Mildred       to live with them so that she could go to high school in Miami. Uncle Ashby died of TB, and my mother apparently knew that he was a very sick man.  She was alarmed about Mildred's going to live in the house with someone who was sick like that.  Ruth has told me the story about how my mother tried every way she could to get my father to agree that Mildred should not go to live with Uncle Ashby and his family.  The night before they were to leave, my mother cried all night,Ruth said.  She was just heartbroken that Mildred should be sent. But still she had to give in; that this was the only way that Mildred could get a high school education. Now, my sister Branson was sent to live with our Uncle John in Leaksville, which is in Rockingham County also.  That was a different matter, I think, because Uncle John was a fairly successful businessman. He lived not too very far from us, and that was a different experience. It wasn't just Branson's and Mildred's leaving home; it was a question of whether they should have an education, and that was the only way page 23 - Adamson that my father could figure that they could get an education. M. F.: What about higher education, about sending them to college or making available some kind of advanced training for them? Adamson:  Just as the boys had to go to college, except Paul.  Paul wouldn't go to college. He flunked out of prep school. He just flatly refused to take up with the academic life at all.  His three older brothers were brilliant students, and he would have none of it at all. Paul has a very sharp mind and is a successful businessman.  I don't know why he got the different perspective. But anyhow, both parents were intent about the girls having an education.  I told you about Ruth going to Salem College, and that she only went there for a couple of years.  But that seemed to fit the mold all right since my parents had only been able to go to college for a couple of years.  Those couple of years fitted Ruth to teach school and to earn her living, to be in a position to support herself. When my mother moved to Chapel Hill, one of the reasons was because Mildred and Branson were both of college age, and Wright also, the three children of college age, so that two of them could live at home. Mildred and Wright could live at home so it would be fairly easy for them to go to college.  But Branson had been a big woman on campus.  She was vice-president of the student body and so forth, and so a terrific effort was made that she should continue to go to what was then . . . Female Academy, the female college, Greensboro Female College, I think was the name of it. Anyhow, both Mildred and Branson had gone there for the three years, I guess. How in the world my parents had managed to pay for it, I just don't know. Anyhow, they did and then not page 24 - Adamson only were they there, but my mother insisted about their being able to graduate from college.  They didn't fit into the pattern of having only two years of college. M. F.: You mentioned that your family couldn't go to church very often because it was so far away and it was hard to get there. But how much of a part did religion play in your lives? Adamson: A great deal. My father was an elder of the Presbyterian Church. My mother's family had started the Methodist Church in that part of the county where she lived.      That church is still in existence. There are stained glass windows of members of her family around.  I guess my Uncle Eeny,  when he got money enough, probably payed for them. But taken care of. anyhow, he probably also paid to have the grounds/ Both my father and now my mother are/buried at that Eden Church.  As children, we always said our prayers before going to bed. When the minister came to call on us all members of the family, no matter where they were, were called in. They were brought in for the family prayers, they called it,when the minister came to call. My mother never held any office in the church, but they were both very religious people. They were not tolerant of the Primitive Baptist Church, which was closest by.  It was just a short distance to go there.  Inasmuch as my father had a relative by marriage, who Cousin Charlie Dalton/had married  Cousin Ida who was a member of that Primitive Baptist Church, and we were very close to Cousin Charlie and Cousin Ida and their family,    there was never any unpleasantness about that.  But my family only went on special occasions to that page 25 - Adamson Primitive Baptist. M. F.:  Oh, but they did go sometimes? Adamson: Sometimes they went, I mean, to keep the social relations and the family relationship because Ida was the only one . . . M. F.: What was their disagreement with the Primitive Baptists? In what ways were they critical of that religion? Adamson: You know, I don't exactly know about why they were so critical, except the preacher. They only had services about once a month at this church and there was a traveling preacher. My sister Mildred, to this day, can put on a dinner entertainment by preaching a sermon by the minister, whatever his name was, I've forgotten.  (laughter)  But it was literally what it said was a primitive kind of. . . . M. F.:  The style was different than the Presbyterian. Adamson: Yes it was. And they had foot washings, so that was always something that, well, we just looked down our noses at . . . (laughter) M. F.:  Do you remember ever going to a black religious service or church? Adamson: No, it just wasn't in the mores for us to do that. Not at all.  I went to some revival meetings at the white, and I went to a baptism up in the creek, which was several miles from where they would, you know, immerse people under the water.  I went to some of those, but they were not, oh, certainly not integrated. They were not black. So what the black services were like, I just don't know.  I do know that Martha and her family were quite religious, and Nora, my nurse, married a minister whose name was Frank Barum. Just exactly the mechanics of page 26 - Adamson it, I don't know.  I maybe could find out because my brother Wright was enough older than I. He very much liked and respected Frank Barum who worked in the fields with him. He's made some reference recently about being in touch with himFrank is quite old and infirmsending him some small gifts or something. M. F.:  I wondered if any people in your family had maintained contact maybe with/some of the tenants on your father's farm or people you knew. Adamson: Not for any reason other than that our home place was sold, had to be sold, and the people who bought it were people that my father did not like at all. We very much looked down our nose at them. We said he was a local bootlegger.  Whether he was or not, I don't know. Anyhow, that sort of cut off our base in the area.  Then my cousins who lived up at my mother's home place, when their father died it was too difficult for them, for the women, to live out on the farm. The two daughters of that family, they wanted to get jobs, and they moved to Winston-Salem where they were able to get jobs and lived.  So we just had no base.  I was talking about Mr. Pickett, who was my father's friend in Madison. He had a daughter who was just my age. When Mr. Pickett came out to see Pa, why, Nancy always came.  Then I would be invited every so often to go into town to visit her. When I was living in North Carolina in the 40's, I saw Nancy and her husband, and it just runs me mad that I can't remember what her husband's name is and exactly where it was that she lived, that I should have forgotten, because we were close friends for a long time and good enough friends so that I got in touch with her and I went down to see them. Otherwise, there just is no base page 27 - Adamson left there. All of our family was away, and there was no one we were close enough to. When I was living there in the 40's, I tried to go Madison, and it was just a sad experience for me because I didn't have anybody that I wanted to see.  I could remember exactly how the street turned, and so forth and so on. But Tom Wolfe says you can't go home again.  So I just gave up.  I didn't even have the heart to drive up to look at our old home to see what the        years there had done to it.  I just couldn't make myself do it.  The highway ran close enough by so that I could see it in the distance from the new highway that went through. M. F.:  I had asked you about the church being a part of, or religion playing a part in your family's life. How did it affect you as a child, do you think? Adamson:  It affected me in this wayI wasn't close enough to be an active Sunday school participant, but the town churches always . . . was it more than one church?  I don't know.  Anyhow, there was a big church picnic out on our place almost every year because we had a big yard and there were creeks on both sides of the place.  So it was a good place for them.  I had that contact. But I really wasn't close enough to do anything about it. And once during those early yearsthis was before we lived in Chapel HillI went to Winston-Salem to visit Uncle John and his family. He had two daughters I think I told you. He had three daughters. One of them was a year younger than I, one a year older, and one three years older, just the age of my sister Teenie.  So they were very strong in the First Presbyterian Church of Winston-Salem. page 28 - Adamson So I would go up and would go to Sunday school with them.     Do you read Elizabeth Spence's books about the South? M.  F.:    No,  I haven't. Adamson: She's one of my favorite writers. Her books are really quite good. One of them was set in that Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, much to my interest. The Reynolds family were also members of that church. My Aunt Carrie much admired the Reynolds and the Hanes families and the other members of the church.  But anyhow, once when I was staying with them there was a big revival meeting in Winston-Salem. You're acquainted with revival meetings, I'm sure.  A traveling evangelist would come through.  This one was a Reverend Culpepper, they called him.  So the Reverend CulpepperI don't know why they didn't speak good English; you'd think they would. But anyhow, that's what they called him. He had a big revival meeting, and I was there visiting Uncle John's girls. So we went to the revival meeting several times.  Once when the call came to come up front and give yourself to Jesus, why, I proceeded up front (laughter) and gave myself to Jesus. When I got home, I thought about it enough that I did not think my parents would be sympathetic with that kind of behavior because they were more serious, and they took their religion seriously.  So I figured, now, what am I going to do about this because I said I'm going to try to be as good as I can and you know, I've done this and I'm afraid to admit it.  I finally worked out the planand you can draw what conclusions about my character you wish (laughter)but I figured that if I behaved as well as I knew how to behave, did not act like a spoiled brat and so forth and so on, page 29 - Adamson and in general tried to behave properly. That would be all right, and I wouldn't have to tell my parents about my having yielded to the Reverend Culpepper,  (laughter) M. F.: Did they ever find out? Adamson: I don't know whether they did or not. They never said anything to me about it if they found out. I just don't know whether they found out about it and just thought it would be better to ignore the whole thing as childish, which it was. M. F.: Did you ever get any feeling, or do you have any feeling now that your family was in some way non-traditional when you were very young, the time especially when you were living near Madison? Or were they pretty much in the tradition of the families in that area and what people had been doing for a long time? Adamson:  They were and they weren't.  They were in that their family plans and procedures are very much the same. But they were differentand our neighbors thought we looked down on them, even some that were remote relativesbecause they were so intent on the education and trying to know what was . . . they were interested in cultural things. One of the big events in my life was when my father went to Winston-Salem to sell his tobacco crop one year, and there was comparatively good prices on them.  So he bought an Edison phonograph and about six or eight records. This was the most wonderful thing that happened to us. We would sit every night after we'd had our dinner, supper I guess we called it. We would gather around and play all of the records.  There page 30 - Adamson are still things there like the sextet from "Lucia" and the quartet from "Rigoletto" that (laughter) are favorite pieces.  In some way or another, my father and mother had aspirations.  They wanted to have a more culturally complete life than they were able to have. And they liked to do things.  I like to play bridge now, but     always say to me I remember my father and mother played wisp before I was born,  (laughter) M. F.: When you think about your family background, do you have any sense of how your own values, the values that led you into such progressive causes later, where they came from in that background? Adamson: I have wondered about that.  The only answer I have that I was very much influenced by my sister Mildred, but that isn't an adequate answer. Mildred got an M. A. in sociology at the University of Chicago, and then she got acquainted with the YWCA when she was in Chicago.  She went to work for the YWCA as the industrial secretary. I was of an impressionable early teen age, and she was working in Lynchburg, Virginia.  I went up to stay at the YW camp with her, and there was just a whole new approach to life as far as I was concerned. Mildred is a very decisive kind of person.  She never takes a mild stance.  She has keen ideas.  She and Branson both were much influenced by men they metEdward Linderman, a sociologist, who was at the Women's College in Greensboro when they were there. He befriended them and my sister Teenie also and had a tremendous influence. He was an editor later of the New Republic. He was concerned with what was going on in the world.  So I got from them that interest in current events, current affairs. But there must have been other things, but I have never been page 31 - Adamson able to figure out just what they were. M. F.: How do you think your position in the family as youngest influenced you? What effect did that have on you? Adamson: I was a terribly spoiled brat for the simple reason that I had three serious illnesses before I was five years old.  I had pneumonia when I was just an infant, then I had an awful case of measles, and what was it . . . smallpox. No, I didn't have smallpox.  I got vaccinated for smallpox.  It was while we were living in Spray that I had a very serious illness. Whether it was my character or the fact that I really did just need to have attention, but I remember that I was quite old enough to figure it out for myself that when I started going out with boys, about the time I was living in Chapel Hill, it was better not to cry when things didn't go my way.  I mean, this was a process (laughter).  Isn't that horrible?  (laughter) M. F.:  I wanted to ask you what some of your early school experiences were. You started at the Gold Hill School very close to your home, and you and your mother went off through the path every day to school. Adamson:  That's right. And then later on, Helen Rankin started. It got to be a two-teacher school, and she taught there.  She married my brother Paul, so that's another link-up in the county. Her family was down in the other end of the county, down closer to Reidsville. M. F.: You mentioned Miss Mary Trotter too. Was she . . . Adamson: Oh, now that was in my mother's childhood. You see, Miss Mary Trotter and cousin Eugene had lived in my grandfather Moore's house to tutor the children because there was no school for them to go to. page 32 - Adamson M. F.: But you didn't know her did you? Adamson: No. No, so far as I know I never saw ... I must have seen Miss Mary Trotter, but I don't remember anything about it.  Cousin Eugene I knew very well when we lived in Chapel Hill because he lived in Chapel Hill naturally. Then after I went to the secondI'm not sure whether the third grade at Gold Hill Schoolmy sister Ruth and my mother started teaching at Bald Hill School, which was a little bit larger school and a little bit farther away from us.  We went in the surrey to there.  I went there, it must have been, through the third and fourth grades.  Then my sister Ruth got a job of teaching at a school up in the mountainsGlade Valley School.  I think it must have been a church school, but I don't know. Anyhow, the family times were so hard.  This was about the time when my father was having his last illness, and it was really very tough.  So Ruth took TeenyTeeny may have told youup to that Glade Valley School, which was . . . they could board and live in the school. When that happened, then my brother Wright was in high school, was of high school age. The first couple of years he rode the horse, Old Sam. My father had a good saddle horse, so Wright rode Old Sam to Madison to go to high school. But then somewhere or another, I don't know, I guess it was because my father was no longer to drive, and he had bought a T-model Ford when they first went around in the country.  He must have had to have sold the tobacco well some of the time. Anyhow, Wright was just a very young boy. But he drove the Ford to Madison to school. Teeny, I think, I'm not sure whether she graduated from Madison High School or not.  It would be easy enough to page 33 - Adamson find out if it were of any interest. Anyhow, we rode into Madison to school when I was in the fifth and sixth grades I guess it was.  Then the next year, my father died during that time and we had to sell the farm and get the household goods and so forth. And this big move about going to Chapel Hill took place. M. F.:  How did you feel about having your mother as a teacher? Was that easy to deal with? Adamson:  It was very easy to deal with because she had had some experience with children (laughter).... M. F.: The good teacher. Adamson:  ... So I never remember any unpleasantness at all with any of the other ... I had a desk mateyou know, they wouldn't have individual desks, they doubled themmy desk mate was Ola Wilson through whose land we had to walk in going to school.  That was at the Gold Hill School.  Then I guess the older children, Helen must have taught the older children.  My mother                        her the first two or three grades and then Helen M. F.: What did you think of school? Did you like it from the beginning? Adamson: It never occured to me not to like it.  This was like we had been brought up in a highly religious family, a family of ministers, you know, to not like going to church. M. F.:  Right.  Did you want to be a teacher like your mother and like Ruth? page 34 - Adamson Adamson: No. Never once did I consider that I wanted to be a teacher. Why, I don't know.  I never did. M. F.: Did you not want to be a teacher? Adamson: Just how I came by that I don't know. But anyhow, definitely I never once thought of being a teacher.  Teeny, I think, who's the same way.  She never taught at all, whereas the older girls, all three of the older girls, had been teachers. M. F.: Did you ever feel like you should be a teacher, like that was one of the alternatives that you had? Adamson:  I don't remember if I went through that, but there must have been some sort of decision that was made in my mind.  Why, I don't recall at all. M. F.: When you moved into Chapel Hill then, you were almost ready for high school? Adamson:  I went to the sixth and seventh grades in Chapel Hill. I guess it was.  I started high school there. M. F.: Was that move hard for you to make? Adamson: Yes, it was difficult for me because I was a country bumpkin really.  At that time, the town was divided between Carrboro and Chapel Hill.  Carrboro was a mill town, and Chapel Hill was the university part of the town. And the two did not mingle at all.  There were some of the students from Carrboro at the school. We all went to the same school. But the social life was never considered at all. Just for the fact that we happened to be living in the university part of the town, why, we were automatically in the social circles of the university. page 35 - Adamson I was asked to the faculty children's parties, my classmates, that sort of thing.  It was very difficult then because, well, they had dances whether it was every Saturday night or how often, I don't know.  But anyhow, the boys took turns asking the different girls. And some of the girls were popular and they would get broken on at the dances and all. Well, I wasn't.  I didn't know at all how to play the game, so it was a very humiliating social experience, to literally be a wallflower.  I did not feel that I could refuse to go.  Except one time we had a next-door neighbor named the Thomases, and there were two children in that family, Helen and Monk. And Helen was very popular.  She had a steady beau and was very popular.  Monk, I don't know just exactly what about. Anyhow, he was always asked to the parties.  Once I created a real ruckus because I was put with Monk to go to one of the dances, and I flatly refused to go with him because I had been put with him at a previous dance and he hadn't even done the minimum, that is to dance the first dance with me.  (laughter) And his mother, oh, his mother was absolutely furious.  She came over and said, "Why, Monkford was descended from royalty on both sides of the house." And that I should refuse to go to the dance with him, it was just absolutely intolerable. But I still wouldn't go.  (laughter) M. F.: Well, there was quite an active social life . . . you were quite young. Adamson: Yes. M. F.: You were still in early high school? page 36 - Adamson Adamson: Yes, yes. M. F.: But that was what you were supposed to do, you were supposed to know how to go to all these dances. Adamson: That's right.  I was supposed to know how to dance, which I didn't at all.  I was supposed to know how to make small conversation, which I didn't know how to do at all.  I got along fine.  I don't know whether you remember about the Woolens or not, whether any of them are still around Chapel Hill.  Charles Woolen was the treasurer of the university. His daughter was in my class at school and was sort of a special pal of mine.  And the Lawsons, Estelle Lawson later got to be a national golf champion.  So I was quite friendly with them.  My brother Tom had been a good athlete, and Dr. Lawson was the head of the physical education department. Tom had been a special pet of his. When we moved to Chapel Hill, why, the Lawson families were very kind to us.  So there was no social awkwardness there. But it was a hard adjustment for me to make. M. F.: How did your mother make the adjustment? She was running a boarding house? Adamson:  She was running a rooming house, not a boarding house. She made the adjustment fine because she proceeded to go to the First Presbyterian Churchyou probably know it in Chapel Hill. And she set me off, as far as religion was concerned, by arranging with the minister that on thus and such Sunday I should join the church. And I was furious about just being told that I should do that, although I liked Dr. Moss and it's a very pleasant church.  But anyhow, you asked about my religious page 37 - Adamson tendencies.  That took me a long time.  In later years, I worked, my last job, worked thirteen years for the National Council of Churches, and I found out many good things about the church and many excellent people. But anyhow, she went to there, and we went to Sunday school there and so forth.  She established there.  She kept fairly busy, having four children at home, and then there were about five or six students who lived in the place.  She didn't get them any meals, but anyhow, they had to be looked after and kept after, and so forth and so on.                                              going to school; you've forgotten that she was a student. She had to study. M. F.:  Right.  But it just seems that the change would have been incredibly abrupt for her, from having lived on the farm and raised all these children and sort of lived a certain kind of life and then suddenly, like you, being thrust into this very social scene, in a way. I was just curious as to how she ... do you think that it turned out in a way to be an opportunity for her, that her life really changed in a good way? Adamson: She had a wonderful ability to adjust to different situations, and she had to make some, oh, quite a number . . . BEGIN SIDE 1 TAPE II Adamson: When I was a junior in high school and my sister Branson was working there, so she got an apartment. My mother, and Teeny, and I lived there in the apartment in Greensboro.  Teeny entered the Women's Collegeoh, maybe she'd been to Women's College.  I don't know; that's her story, not mine.  But I rushed through, got through high school page 38 - Adamson and entered college at mig-term, early. When I went for my physical examination, I used to go home.  They called my mother and said I was to be put to bed. M. F.: What was wrong? Adamson: I had anemia.  I don't know. Anyhow, in the course of time my mother moved up to Lynchburg to live with my sister Mildred who was working for the YWCA up there.  So the next year, Teeny and I went to the college, and we were together at the college. There was a different kind of life.  Then in the course of that timeI could get all these straightened out       it's not importantmy brother Jimmy came home for a holiday from his work as a doctor of the Guggenheim Mine in Bolivia. He, incidentally, had taken that job when he got through with his internship at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Massachusetts and went to Bolivia where he lived for seventeen years and sent money home to his mother and the five younger children in the family.  So he, in effect, a supported                            .  I mention this because it's/very significant angle of our family life for a member of it to do. He didn't ever expect any appreciation. This was just something that he could do, just as my brother Enoch, who had been at Chapel Hill, he finished his graduate work in journalism. This was the time my father was very, very sick. So Enoch just came home to the farm,and lived there for a winter and took care of things so that my mother                            there. There was nothing else to do.  I mean, that that's a       it     .  This has meant a great deal to me, my family background, and it's now distressing to me that our family, which had been so close, has now in the course of page 39 - Adamson time dissolved. Whether that's of any sociological interest, I don't know. But personally it was a matter of great concern. M. F.: So even though you weren't at home when you were small with these older brothers and with your older sister Ruth, you were very close to them anyway. Adamson: That's right. M. F.: And they remained very close to your mother and close to Chapel Hill. Adamson:  That's right. And to all of us. We were a very close family. M. F.: When you were graduating from high school and making plans to go to college, was there any question of where you would go? Was it just assumed that you would go to North Carolina College for Women? Adamson: Yes, because of the financial angle of first living home, and then it was the cheapest place to go because although I didn't want to teach, supposedly one got free tuition by agreeing to teach at the college, which I didn't do. But I was willing to take my chances.  So with the money that Jimmy was sending home, you see, I managed to go to college and pay what had to be paid. M. F.: Did you have any plans, career plans, or any plans about why you wanted to go to college, or what you wanted to do when you finished? Adamson: I have thought about it. From my earliest, I was always interested in journalism of one kind or another. The first instance of page 40 - Adamson that is when we were living in Chapel Hill. The Daughters of the Confederacy each year gave a prize for something. One year it was for a life of Robert E. Lee.  So I wrote a life of Robert E. Lee and won their $5 prize. Then the next year they were going to give a prize for a history of the Civil War.  So I wrote a history of the Civil War this is in seventh grade (laughter)and won the $5 again.  So those were my only outlets in high school and grammar school.  In Chapel Hill High School, after I got there, there wasn't any kind of publications. When I got to Greensboro High School, they had a magazine and a little newspaper. I volunteered and worked on both of them. When I started going to Women's College, there again I volunteered on them.  When I was at Chapel Hill in college, I worked on the Tar Heel and on the what's the name of the humorous publication? It's probably gone now, but anyhow, something I know very well.  I always worked in publications, and I've always been interested in publications. Most of my working years have had to do with publications of one kind or another. M. F.:  So it was not just chance that got you into journalism. You'd sort of planned to do that. Adamson: No.  These were just the things I was interested in doing.  I don't know whether it was because Enoch had bought a set of books when he was studying journalism at Chapel HillRichard Harding Davisand I read them from cover to cover several times. When we moved to Chapel Hill, in some way or another, I guess it was somebody we knew worked for the library. Anyhow, I was permitted to use the university library and go in the stacks and get books.  So I was page 41 - Adamson a very big bookworm and interested in these things. M. F.: Could you major in journalism at NCCW at that time? Adamson: No; at Chapel Hill, yes.  It was not a really big department. Oscar Coffin was professor and he taught a class in journalism. But there wasn't really a department, so I majored in English. But it was sort of understood . . . M. F.: But you spent your first three years at North Carolina College for Women, right?  In Greensboro. Adamson: Yes. M. F.: And when you were there, did you major in English as well? Adamson: Yes. M. F.:  Tell me what that place is like when you were there.  You were there from 1926 to 1929. Adamson: I was supposed to be in the class of 1930.  I can tell you what it was like from where I sat when I finished, was getting to finish my junior year.  I was living at home by that time in Greensboro. I was starting to tell you about my brother Jimmy had put up money and built a house for my mother in Greensboro.  It was a nice house, and so I was living at home and going to college.  Sogoodness, I've lost the thread of what I was saying. What was I talking about? M. F.: North Carolina College for Women. Adamson: Oh, about what it was like.  So I flatly said to my mother, "I am not going back to the Women's College anymore." The expression now would be "I've had it up to here, and I'm not going back there." I was fed up with the Women's College.  I was getting old enough, I guess, page 42 - Adamson to be interested in boys. Just the whole atmosphere ... I had several friends that I liked, but I was just bored with the whole business.  So the I just presented her with a dilemma, but by that time, I was/only child of college age.  So that gave a little bit more leeway.  I transferred to Chapel Hill. M. F.:  For your last year. Adamson: For my last year. And in transferring, I lost credits because they had been required courses at the Women's College, and there were required courses at Chapel Hill.  They did not coincide, so I had to spend an extra quarter.  And that was the reason I was graduated in 1931 instead of 1930.  That's the reason I'm not sure how many of these that people I'm going to recognize in the dormitory/I'll be staying in. M. F.:  Let me ask you a few more things about North Carolina College for Women and why it was so boring. Were there any activities among the students that you were involved in? Adamson:  I worked on the Carolinian, the paper.  That was about the only thing.  Since I was living off campus and the last couple of years I was there, perhaps I didn't give it a fair share. But there were the two debating societies which I just thought were just . . . M. F.: What did they debate? Adamson: What did they debate? I don't know. Anyhow, I just found the whole thing was not stimulating. I wasn't a brilliant student, so if I'd applied myself to my books, why, I would have done better. M. F.: Do you remember any faculty or teachers who particularly influenced you? 43 - Adamson Adamson: Yes, there was a woman from Wisconsin who was named Magnhilda Gulanda, who taught history.  I had a good course of her's in European history, and it was really the best course that I had there very stimulating.  Then I had a good English teacher.  I'd had an excellent English teacher in Greensboro High School.  I also was fortunate in having a good English teacher at Women's College.  I've forgotten what her name is and I shouldn't because my niece, Mary Louise Price, when she was there, this woman recognized her and, "You are a niece of Mary Price, aren't you? She used to sit right there in that seat."  (laughter) M. F.: Were most of the faculty women? Adamson: No.  There was a Dr. Arnett , who taught American history and lived across the street from us in Greensboro. His daughter, Dorothy, was wonderful helping in the Progressive Party campaign in '48. His wife was a friend of my mother's.  She's really an excellent person. And Dr. Arnett was a good person too, but his class was just dull, dull, dull. were there? M. F.: Do you think the place had changed since Mildred and Branson/ Adamson: Yes, it was very much in the process of changing during all of those years, and what it's like now, I of course wouldn't know at all. M. F.:  So from the days when Edward Linderman was there, people like him had sort of drifted away from Greensboro, do you think? Adamson:  I don't remember any really stimulating faculty there at the time I was there. page 44 - Adamson M. F.: Was the YWCA active? Adamson: No, it was not active on campus. M. F.: They weren't doing any kind of work with industrial groups like the work that Mildred was doing in Lynchburg? Adamson: No, there was no stimulus at all.  I remember the Gastonia strike was during that time I was there.  Because we subscribed to the New Republicmy sisters had started doing itI knew about the Gastonia strike.  But I never was able to go down there at that time.  To get from Greensboro to Gastonia would have been quite a trip for a young girl. M. F.: The whole time you were in both Greensboro and Chapel Hill earlier, you mentioned Carrboro was the textile town, was the mill town, and was apart from Chapel Hill.  Were you aware of mill workers around Greensboro? Adamson:  No, it was very much class differences.  Out in Proximity and White Oak, the workers out there, it was just complete division. There was no thought of. . . . M. F.: But you did go to school in Chapel Hill with the children of mill workers? Adamson: I can't specifically remember, but I may be wrong about that because I don't remember knowing any of those children.  I said that, I think, because I couldn't think whether there was a school in Carrboro. So I think I was probably wrong about that.  The class structure was very firmly established. M. F.:  So you really never even saw these people, or did you see them and just think of them as being very far apart? page 45 - Adamson Adamson: No. When I went to school in Madison, the mill village there is called Mayodan. It's at the confluence of the Mayo and the Dan Rivers. My mother's family had lived on the Dan, you know, it went on down in there with the Mayo, in Danville. You know, it's down there. That was very definitely a mill town, and there was just no mingling between Madison and Mayodan.  It was really a very bad social situation. I don't remember being      there.  But you asked me about influences. I think that these things must have seeped into my consciousness somewhere. M. F.: Back to North Carolina College for Women for a minute. Was it a really protective environment? You were living on campus, but did you feel that, why were those women there? Were there serious students? Were people training to be teachers, or were people being sort of, having their eyes open to the possibilities? Adamson: Again, I lose my historical perspective about it.  I'm not sure about Governor Aycock's years in North Carolina.  If you happen to remember about those years, but in the later years I saw, when I became interested in the race matter, his statement published around about the right of every child to develop the best of his talents burgeoned the best of his ability.  There was sort of that thinking was carried over. As I say, I can't remember whether the governor . . . at the University of North Carolina, you know, Harry                      Chase had come from Wisconsin, I think.  And so there was quite a renaissance there.  I was close enough to that to be influenced by it. page 46 - Adamson M. F.: But you obviously felt sort of restricted at the North Carolina College for Women, at the Women's College, and wanted to go somewhere else. Adamson: That's right. not M. F.: Not that it's not enough reason, but other than/having stimulating faculty and not having things going on, what do you think that school thought that women would go on to do? What were you being trained for? Adamson: We were not being trained for anything, and that's what got me down.  It was a purposeless exercise, as far as I was concerned. There was nothing that was stimulating to do.  I had a few good friends there. One of them, incidentally, I introduced to my brother Enoch and they were finally married, oh, a dozen years ago.  She continues to be my very, very close friend. And a couple of other people that I found. But there was just nothing for us.  All there was to do would be to . . . it was forbidden, for instance, to smoke.  The most we could think of it by way of                                  to take cigarettes and go down in the park and sit on the log in the park and smoke a cigarette.  Charlotte was always one who managed to have boyfriends, but I didn't have the technique that she did of                                                                  .  I wouldn't go with those fellows, even so.  (laughter) All the while envying her. M. F.: Then when you went down to Chapel Hill for your last year, or last, as it turned out, about year and a half . . . Adamson: Year and a quarter, yes. M. F.: Year and a quarter. page 47 - Adamson Adamson:  It was a quarter system, so it was for four quarters. M. F.:  How would you compare the atmosphere at Chapel Hill to the one you'd come from at Greensboro? Adamson: Oh, I was as happy as could be.  I lived in a boarding house on Columbia Road.  There were some other students living there that I was congenial with. And then I met them.  I met people, of course, at the Tarheel and the other things like that that I was interested in.  I managed to have a date almost every night, and always to go to the dances and get broken on the proper number of times (laughter) at the dances. M. F.: You said that in Greensboro your technique hadn't been developed about getting dates and going out. Adamson:  That's right. M. F.: What made it suddenly develop? Adamson: Well, I don't know.  I suppose it was I was getting older and more observant about the way things were done. My mother, wonderful woman that she was, never gave me, anyhow, so far as I know any of my sister the least bit of guidance about how to go about making one's self attractive in the social scene.  She was married at eighteen and apparently it just didn't occur to her that it was necessary to put your mind to it and what to do.  She was always wonderful about it, when we were going to the dances or something,of going to the trouble to try to see that we had something to wear. But I just had a good time in Chapel Hill. M. F.: What about the things you were studying? You said you took page 48 - Adamson under Oscar Coffin in journalism. Were there other people who influenced you? Adamson: Yes, I was interested in my classes.  I was majoring in English and minoring in French. Liked both very much, except I acquired a lifelong boredomas far as                                                          is concerned. (laughter) M. F.: Was there anything else that you read that particularly influenced you at the time? Adamson: Yes, I was reading avidly, still reading avidly at that time.  I sort of had a policy that if there was something that I heard about or an author that I didn't know anything about, I would get him out of the library and see what about.  Mostly fiction; I wasn't a student of science or anything like that.  This was pretty much fiction. M. F.:  Do you remember being influenced by any of the expatriates, say, Hemingway, or . . . Adamson: Well, you asked me a leading question.  Yes, when I was in school I read about the Left Bank and the bunch in Paris. And I was just dying to read The Sun Also Rises because that was very much talked about then.  I couldn't figure out how to do it because it wasn't in the library in Greensboro. Money was very scarce.  I had a good friend, Elizabeth Stone, in high school. We exchanged Christmas gifts.  So I figured that what I would do would be to give Elizabeth a copy of The Sun Also Rises for her Christmas gift, and then I would buy it early enough so that I could read it (laughter) before I gave it to her. Which I did, and which I thought was well worth all of my conniving (laughter) because it was a page 49 - Adamson window opening to a whole new approach to life. M. F.: Did you continue reading Hemingway after that? Adamson: Yes, I liked Hemingway very much until his later years. I didn't care for his later books. M. F.: What about Fitzgerald's books? Were you reading those when they came out? Adamson:  Very much so, very much so, yes. M. F.: What did you think about the whole idea of the flapper? Adamson: I didn't either think or not think; it just was. M. F.: Was it real?  I mean, did it compare to what you were doing and the things you were involved in? Did you ever see yourself as a flapper? Adamson: No, not really, because my circumstances were too quiet for me to. It wasn't for lack of interest in same, but it wasn't much possible for me. M. F.: Harold Coy says in here that you learned to drive an automobile like a man? I was very curious about that. Adamson: Well, Harold's such a lousy driver.  (laughter)  Oh, I shouldn't say that; he might read this sometime.  Who knowssome things about coincidence and somebody knows about . . . No, when I was talking about living at home in Greensboro and going to college, my mother bought a car at the time.  I learned to drive there and drove over to the college. To get out of the driveway, it was sort of a circle up a hill and there was a tree on one side and the house on the other. You had to learn to be page 50 - Adamson pretty expert. M. F.: Who taught you how to drive? Adamson:  I guess it was my brother Wright.  I can't quite remember. M. F.: Was it unusual for a girl to learn how to drive? Adamson: No, no. Now Elizabeth Stone, for instance, drove and it was not unusual at all.  I took to it.  I'm not an athlete kind of person, but there are certain sorts of things that I did rather wellmechanical things.  Oh, I danced rather well and swam ok and, you know, that.  But I never excelled in sports.  I played tennis and hockey and basketball but never really any good at all. M. F.: Did you, besides working for the Tarheel and the humor magazine at Chapel Hill, were there any other groups that you joined? Were you active in Student Government, or were you in a sorority, or anything like a sorority? Adamson:  I was in a sorority, yes.  I joined Chi Omega.  I was pleased about doing it because from my background in Chapel Hill being on the outside of the social circle,and then in Women's College there wasn't anything like that.  So I just figured, now this would be a good move to make as far as my broadening my social perspective was concerned. And sure enough, it so happened that at the national convention of the Chi Omegas my senior year, for some reason or another, I don't know why, I got chosen to go because somebody else who was supposed to go couldn't or something like that and I could.  So I did my first traveling, and it was Hot Springs, Arkansas, and it was really a big deal to go there because Mildred and HaroldHarold was a reporter on the paper in St. page 51 - Adamson Louis. They were living in St. Louis. Mildred was working for the YWCA in St. Louis.  So I went by to see them, and they were terribly ashamed of me.  They didn't want anybody they knew to know that I was going to a sorority convention (laughter). M. F.: That was too . . . social, or too conservative? What was their objection? Adamson: Well, they were very forward-thinking people. Mildred again will tell you about it. But she, for instance, used her own name when they were married, and that was something very, very far within position. Harold was a good reporter.  I think he still is a good reporter in the paper there.  They just had a different perspective. The week with them was of great interest.  And I liked it much better than I liked the big hotel. M. F.: In Hot Springs? Adamson:  In Hot Springs, yes.  And the sorority. M. F.:  So the sorority turned out to be mind-expanding in an indirect way. Adamson:  Yes, but it was good.  For instance, the friend who wrote me about coming to the reunion and urged me to come and some of our friends was a Chi Omega.  She was talking about the Chi Omegas who were going to be there.  So it broadened my social perspective, which is what I wanted to do. (telephone interruption) ...  To speak disparagingly about the Chi Omegas, and I get to Chapel Hill.     They'll probably see what's going on down there. page 52 - Adamson M. F.: I just wonder what was involved in being in a sorority in the late 20's.  Did you live with these people? Adamson: No, we did not have a house.  It was simply like belonging to any club, of having a circle of people with whom you were socially accepted.  I liked them, and I hope that several of them are going to be at the reunion. M. F.: How would you compare having been in this Women's College? You said you were tired of its being a women's college, and you wanted to have dates and go out, and then coming to Chapel Hill and joining a sorority, a group that was specifically for women? Adamson:  Status, status. M. F.:  It was a group specifically for women, but it was more oriented to the social scene. Adamson: They were socially attractive women. That's what I was doing. I was still aware of my country, hard-poverty years, you know. I was trying to break out of my cocoon. M. F.: When you were at Chapel Hill, did you have any ties to or hear of anyone who was involved in any of the settlement house movements, maybe, or in the Women's Trade Union League? Or again, was the YWCA active at Chapel Hill? Adamson: No, not at the time . . . oh, you were talking about the years I was in college.  There wasn't any kind of socially conscious movement on the campus, as far as I know.  There would be now, people, the Farm Workers group, that sort of thing. M. F.: Was there just sort of this atmosphere that Chase set up page 53 - Adamson inquiry, of open/ You said you were sort of influenced by Chase, President Chase. Adamson: Oh yes.  The person I was really influenced by was Frank Graham. When Mildred was at Chapel Hillshe also will tell you about that probablyshe was a student of his, and he was an excellent teacher and had great influence on her.  So he was still a teacher when I was there, and he was a decided good element to my way of thinking on the campus. But I didn't have any of his courses.  I wasn't asso- him. elated with/ I got to know him later on, of course, at the Southern Conference. M. F.:  Right, right.  Did you have any contact with the people in the sociology department, like Howard Odum? Adamson: I lived next door to Howard Odum. M. F.:  But were you aware of the work that that group was doing at the Institute? Adamson:  I was aware that there was work being done, but I was not aware of the content.  I lived next to him when I was a child, and when I went back to college he was an established person, and I did not take any of his courses. M. F.: One other thing about the Institute and Howard Odum and Frank Graham. Do you remember anything about the way most students regarded those people, Frank Graham, or Howard Odum? Did they have a lot of supporters, or were they sort of considered odd or unusual? Adamson: No, I think they were respected and it just wasn't a debated kind of thing, so far as my awareness of it was concerned. M. F.:  Then you graduated in December of 1930? page 54 - Adamson Adamson:  '31. When I transferred from Women's College, I lost credit  So I had to     an extra quarter, and I was in the class of 1931. M. F.: So when you finished in 1931, you were thrown out of school right in the middle of the Depression. How did you and the people you graduated with sort of view the Depression? Did people think it would be over very quickly? Adamson:  It's amazing to me, but I don't think we had any social consciousness at all about it.  I knew that times were tough, and it was not going to be easy to get a job.  There wasn't a bank open in Greens-no idea of boro for several years. I had / what to do about it. I was quite lucky to get a job reading proof on the Greensboro Daily News and learned a has lot about reading proof, which/stood me in good stead forever. M. F.:  How did you get that job? Adamson:  I guess I applied,  but I knew about it.  Branson had worked in the office there, and Enoch had been a reporter for the Daily News. One of Mildred's and Branson's classmates, Ann Cantrell White, was the society editor.       Incidentally, she's about the only person I see when I go back to Greensboro.  She's now retired from the Daily News, but she is still living in Greensboro.  I had dinner with her when I was there in 1973, and I shall be in touch with her. M. F.: Ann Cantrell White? Adamson: Yes.  She now writes feature articles.  She's old enough so that, you know, she's been retired for some years.  But she does special pieces. page 55 - Adamson M. F.: I see.  So how long did you work with her? Adamson: I didn't really.  I was reading copy, and then every so a story. often I would get an assignment to do/    I was assigned to do some stories, and, social/ when she was away on vacation, to do the social page.  I didn't work there very long because it was a job that required working at night.  It was just no good, you know, for  a young girl working at night, then to have only the morning.  Now I think that would be a fine arrangement.  I would love having mornings, but then for a young girl it wasn't good. M. F.:  Who were you living with in Greensboro at the time? Adamson:  I was living with my mother there in the nice house, yes. M. F.:  How did she feel about your coming back from school and going to work? Did she sort of expect you to get married? Was there anyone around to marry? Adamson:  She never expected of me to get married.  If I had dates and went out, she tried to be agreeable about it. But she would always sit up until I got home  at night, which was much better than her saying, "You will be home by this and such a time."  (laughter)  I knew that she tried to be very careful about it, but she did not promote my social life at all with men, except to oversee my clothes. M. F.: The year after you left Chapel Hill and went to Greensboro, did you have an active social life? Working, I guess, nights that limited you. Adamson:     That's what I got fed up about,  is that it just wasn't ,and got a job, possible to do anything about it.     So I quit/and learned to type at the expense of the Vick  Chemical Company when they were introducing their page 56 - Adamson cough drops.  That was before processing letters came along, and we individually typed letters to every doctor in the country, the same letter. A whole crew of us, you know, just over and over again. But it let me say, I had when I went to apply for a job that I knew how to type, you know,/a skill. clerical M. F.: Was learning/work, gaining clerical skills at that time sort of a more forward-thinking thing to do? Was it if you have the alternative of teaching school or going into business or becoming a secretary, were people interested in doing something different or unusual, taking a secretarial route? Adamson:  There wasn't as much as now. My sister Branson, for instance,    had good secretarial jobs in Greensboro.  So it must have been a difference in the people, and me and her, for instance.  She turned out to be a successful businesswoman later on in life.  I've never been business,                               a successful in / you know, never been/business-minded person. M. F.:  I guess I mean as far as the things that you had open to you to do. Did learning how to type open a wider variety of things? Was that one of the things that you could do? Adamson: Just think for yourself in a town like that, with not a bank open.  There just weren't jobs, that's all there was to it. There just weren't jobs.  That's the reason it was very foolish of me to quit the Greensboro Daily News the way I did. M. F.: Well then, how long did you stay with the Vick Chemical Company? Adamson: Oh, that was just a matter of months.  Then Branson and her husband, Bob Daniel, were trying desperately to make a living as all page 57 - Adamson of us were in the Depression years. Bob went to New York and worked as a salesman of office furniture, and Branson got a job working in Macy's and Teeny executive offices.  So they were not very good jobs, but they/had an apartment in the Village.  They let me sleep on the couch in their living room.  Bob told them,when he sold the International Paper Company a filing system, he said he had an expert installator.  So he got hold of me and said, "Come quick.  You're an expert installator." M. F.:  He called you or wrote to you in Greensboro? Adamson: Yes.  So I picked up and went to New York, and as I say, they put me up.                                                That's another example, you see, of the family relationship. We accepted responsibility for each other. We were a unit. M. F.: How did your mother react to your going to New York? Adamson:  She was worried about my not having a job because by that was not good; time, the situation with Jimmy in South America/ he had been involved in the war between Paraguay and Bolivia.  He waa a doctor, but it got very difficult for him to continue sending money. And there weren't or her. members of the family to finance me/  So, what to do?  She came out west to stay with my brother Tom and his family, and I just had to find trip or a job somehow or another.  So it wasn't any romantic/anything else, but looking for work. It was asimple economic necessity.  I had to have a job, and how was I going to get it? M. F.:  And New York happened to be the place. Adamson: And Bob pulled this little business. page 58 - Adamson M. F.: Well, once you got to New York, what was your life like? Adamson: A friend of Teeny' s, I guess, had a friend who was coming up from Alabama to study at the New York School of Social Work.  So we they said maybe she and / could look for a place to live together.  I was making twenty dollars a week at the International Paper Company. Her name was Margaret Shook,        called Tommy.  Tommy and I looked for an apartment. We found one for forty dollars a month that we thought we could live in.  That was      twenty dollars apiece, which was about pay: what we could / one week's pay.  I lived there for about a year. Oh, that's where I first really learned something about cooking and living separately, and so forth.  It was a very, very pleasant place. Then I started getting salary cuts of ten percent.   Then when the third ten percent cut came I looked for another job. BEGIN SIDE II TAPE II M. F.:  Did you eventually have to give up your apartment? Adamson:  I gave up the apartment when Tommy married Foster Nix. So I had to look for another place to live.  There's no sense in going into all the intermediate things, but I eventually answered an ad in the New York Times, I guess it was, of someone who had an apartment to share in the neighborhood.  It was on Commerce Street, which was the same block I had been living on, at Bedford                                      Street.  So I answered it, and I did start to share that small apartment with Hope Sterling, her name was, who was a nice enough person in a way.  But we really weren't very congenial. However, we not only lived in that apartment but we moved over on another side of the same block, over on Morton page 59 - Adamson Street, and lived over there for about a year or so.  It was sort of just a business arrangement; we got along all right.  We sometimes went to concerts together. M. F.: What were you doing for the International Paper Company at that time? Adamson:  Oh, I was installing that file system that Bob Daniel had sold them and told them that he had a trained installator.  So I was trying to work on that.  Then when I got the third ten percent pay cut, I realized it was impossible for me to live on that.  So I sort of took a flyer,and told a tale that I was sick,and didn't come in for a week, and used the time to look for another job because what was I to do? It was sort of a tough situation.  I don't know whether it was unethical or not; maybe so.  But anyhow, I got a job working for the French Management Company, the builders and owners of two city housing developments over by the East River.  I also told them that I knew lunch shorthand, but I only knew it from /   time going to the continuation school next door to the Daily News building where the International Paper Company was located.  I went over there for lunch hours and tried to learn something about it, but not very well (laughter).
