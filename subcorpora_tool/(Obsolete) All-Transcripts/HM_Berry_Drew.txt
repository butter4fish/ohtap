Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Andrew Jeremiah Berry, A-N-D-R-E-W, initial J-E-R-E-M-I-A-H Berry, B-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you are known as Drew Berry--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and there's a story behind that, right?
Speaker 2: Ahh, yeah.  The story is that my family never liked--especially my mom [Clementine Southall]--didn't like Andrew Jeremiah; she didn't like that, so she decided she'd call me AJ, and to this day, people in the family call me AJ, okay?  But, I wasn't crazy about AJ, so when I went to college, you know, Drew Pearson of the Dallas Cowboys [Pearson, a sportscaster, played wide receiver for the Dallas Cowboys, a National Football League team] was famous; I'm like, "Okay, Andrew--I think I'll call myself Drew," and so I started calling myself Drew ever since; that's what I use.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My family disliked Andrew Jeremiah so much that, you know, when I went to school--elementary school, I really thought my name was AJ, and I went to the board the first grade and I wrote AJ Berry and the teacher said, "That's not your name," and I said, "Oh yes it is."  So that's one of those things (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story behind Andrew Jeremiah?  Your mother did not like it; I assume your father [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] named you.
Speaker 2: My father is a preacher, a minister, and I guess he just decided he wanted to call me Andrew Jeremiah--biblical characters [Andrew was a disciple of Jesus Christ; Jeremiah was a prophet of Israel].  And so he did that and my mom probably had other things to worry about and said, "Whatever," and Andrew Jeremiah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: My dad's the only one who liked it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 22nd, 1955; I was born in East Texas--a place called Henderson, Texas, near the big city of Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how close is Tyler to Dallas [Texas]?
Speaker 2: You're probably talking about a two-hour drive--well, an hour and a-half drive; probably about 80 miles; 80, 90 miles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tyler is known for--it's the 'Rose Capital of the World' and where running back Earl Campbell [Heisman trophy winner and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee] was from.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Claim to fame (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: A media consultant, and President and CEO of Drew Berry and Associates [media and consulting agency].
Speaker 1: All right.  And you've been a general manager--station general manager a couple of times, right?  And news director and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--News director a few times [at WCAU-TV Philadelphia and WFAA-TV Dallas], general manager [at WMAR-TV Baltimore] once, and that lasted almost 10 years or so, and both very exciting jobs and helped me put my kids [Andrea, Adam, and Andrew Berry] through school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is December 5th [sic, 4th], 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time, and don't give your address.
Speaker 2: We are in Bel Air, Maryland; two words, B-E-L A-I-R, Maryland, which is Harford County, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a correction; it is December 4th (laughter).
Story_ID: 55398
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as kind of a warm-up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes--salmon.
Speaker 1: Okay; favorite color.
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year.
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: All right; favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Anywhere warm (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Challenges are opportunities in disguise.  I don't know who I stole it from, but that's my favorite phrase.
Story_ID: 55399
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's [Clementine Southall] side of the family and your father's [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] side but separately.  So I'll ask about your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Clementine--Southall is her maiden name, and it's C-L-E-M-E-N-T-I-N-E, and then Southall, S as in Sam, O-U-T-H-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Hers was June 5th, 1929 and she's Dallas, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them, and are there any stories about them?
Speaker 2: I can't trace them back that far other than there are a lot of ministers--a lot of preachers in that family.  Her dad Willie [Southall] was a preacher and he had a son, Albert Southall, who was also a preacher, and most of them were in Dallas.  Some of them went off to California--several of them went off to California, but they were, they were preachers and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right; and around the Dallas area?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now is there another point of origin for the family?  Did they--is there some smaller place they came from or some other state, or--
Speaker 2: Yes there's a place called Taylor, Texas, T-A-Y-L-O-R, that some of them came from, and I don't know if anybody's still there now--that most of them--it's the only one of my mom's siblings that are still around; my mom died back in '79' [1979], so--and she only has one brother who's still alive.
Speaker 1: Okay; so any stories in your mother's family about slavery or Juneteenth [celebration of African American freedom and the abolition of slavery in Texas in June 1985] or reconstruction [era of rebuilding (1865-1877) in the United States after the American Civil War (1861-1865)], or any of that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know a lot about that--about that, that side of the family.  In fact, just recently, recently in the past two years started really researching my father's side, but don't know a lot about my mom's side of the family.
Speaker 1: So they were--Taylor's were a rural, I guess, town and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Definitely.
Speaker 1: Were they engaged in farming there, or do they have some other trade?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't farming; they were--what I recall is they worked with their hands whether their--I don't have a clear understanding, but it was certainly-it was nothing--it wasn't farming.  It was--oh gosh.
Speaker 1: Were they contractors or carpenters or--
Speaker 2: Carpenter type work; in fact her dad was very good at that--carpentry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your mother's father was a minister--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --but he was a part-time carpenter.  Did he do carpentry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, that was like really a full-time--full-time was carpentry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and ministers, you know.  He had a little church and went there on Sundays and--but during the week it was carpentry.
Story_ID: 55400
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did your mother [Clementine Southall] tell you what it was like when she was growing up in Dallas [Texas], and what the neighborhood was like, and the schools in the black community?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, you know, it's--I think--your typical stories of, you know, not being--you know, going down the highway and not being able to use the restroom, that type of thing;  having to pull over to the side of the road, that type of thing.  Although she talked about how persistent my dad [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] was in trying to talk people into letting him--letting them use the restroom, it, it didn't--it never really worked, but he certainly was persistent.  But she would talk about things; she would talk about things like that--the typical type of stories that you hear growing up in the south.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Dallas was typically segregated and--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, were the signs up and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes; definitely, definitely.  Signs were all over the place, and--my dad was--well, I know we're talking about my mom, but my dad was a very kind of cautious kind of person.  He erred on the side of trying to keep us safe, and we'll get to some of that a little bit later, but he was a real cautious kind of guy.
Story_ID: 55401
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So your mother [Clementine Southall] did--now was she able to--how far in school was she able to go?
Speaker 2: She went to the 11th grade.  My mom became pregnant around that time and had her first kid, and she--I think that's one reason why she was determined to make sure that we graduated at least from high school, and that--I was so happy that before she died, she was able to see her first kid graduate from college, and that was me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were the oldest, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I'm actually the next to the youngest--
Speaker 1: Oh, next to the youngest; okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --and so I was the first in the family.  Now others went to college, but I was the only one that graduated, and she was--I can still remember the look on her face when that happened; she was just so happy, and would go around the church, 'cause my dad's [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] a minister, and she'd go around the church and she was--she had passed out invitations and pictures--she was just really happy about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I was glad she saw that before she died.
Speaker 1: All right.  Was your mother a housewife, or did she work outside the home?
Speaker 2: She was a housewife.  Occasionally, she would get little jobs.  I remember she worked at a bakery down the street, and we loved it that she worked there because she'd always bring home these nice little pies and cakes and things like that; but she had little odd jobs like that.  Sometimes she would clean homes, okay.  But she never really, for long, had a very steady job.  She was--at that time it was, you know, the wife stays at home and takes care of the kids, that kind of thing.  And I guess when things got a little tight sometimes I guess she went out to make a little extra money.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now let me go to your--oh, what high school did your mother go to--attend?
Speaker 2: I think it's--I think it was Emmett [J.] Scott [(1873-1957) chief aide to Booker T. Washington and special advisor of black affairs for Woodrow Wilson] in Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 1: Emmett Scott--named after the famous Emmett Scott who was Booker T. Washington's secretary and became the head of Hampton Institute--I mean--not Hampton but Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama]; so, Emmett [J.] Scott High School.  So the neighborhood she grew up in would be called--did it have a name, or--
Speaker 2: Not that I know of; it was just like where everybody else lived and it was in a small section of town; everybody lived on--you know, I don't know if it was one of those neighborhoods where everybody lived on one side of the tracks one color and the other side--I don't know, I don't know the name of that neighborhood, but I can assure you that people didn't have means (laughter).
Story_ID: 55402
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well when you lived in Dallas [Texas], did you live in the same neighborhood when you grew up, or was it completely different?
Speaker 2: I lived in a--well, when we first moved to Dallas, okay--'cause my mom [Clementine Southall] ended up in Tyler [Texas] and all that, but when we first moved back to Dallas, I was about four years old.  And we lived in East Dallas in the [housing] projects, and then after some years, we ended up moving to the Oak Cliff [district in Dallas, Texas] section of Dallas, and that was the southern sector, and it was a little neighborhood probably five minutes from downtown--'The Avenues,' we called it; and it was, I think, Avenue A through L or something like that.  And it was about the time where their whites were moving out, blacks were moving in; we were like at the end of that period, and we were just glad to get a home.  There were, you know, there were five of us and then plus the parents, so we were just glad to get that little extra space and have a yard of our own because what we were living in initially was a duplex where we shared one side with another family, and it was only like a two or three-room for all of us in that house.
Story_ID: 55403
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well let me go to your father's [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Calvin Charles Berry, Jr., C-A-L-V-I-N  C-H-A-R-L-E-S  B-E-R-R-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 13th, 1930, and he lived in--he was born in Kerens, Texas, K-E-R-E-N-S; Kerens, Texas, which is also East Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: Well, I can trace it back to his granddad; his name was Gus Berry.  And Gus Berry was down there near Austin [Texas], near the Taylor [Texas] area as well.  And Gus was a little short guy--very short man, and Gus was a--I'll call him a businessman; he would sell cigarettes and candy and things like that out of his home, but he was--and--put it like this, he was prolific when it came to, to ladies, okay?  (Laughter).  He, he, he, he, he definitely loved ladies, and so, so you know I would trace it back and see where he had a couple of marriages there.  But then I think at one point he got sick or something, and moved to the Tyler, Texas area where my grandfather [Calvin Charles Berry, Sr.] had moved to, and actually he ended up dying in Tyler, Texas, but--and my granddad was a preacher as well; he was a minister.
Speaker 1: Okay. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Bishop Calvin Charles Berry, Sr.
Story_ID: 55404
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he [Calvin Charles Berry, Sr.] was a bishop of--now what denomination is he?
Speaker 2: It's a non-denominational--it's a--it's a Church of the Living God, which is--which probably that sector was probably had about oh, 40 churches or somethin' like that; mostly very small churches--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --and so he was--he was the presiding bishop of those 40 churches.
Speaker 1: Now is this an African American denomination?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Pretty much? Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, it is; yes, it is.  It's closer to Baptist; it's--there's really--not much different than that denomination.  It's that sector and Baptist; you would not know the difference if you went there.
Speaker 1: Well the governing seems to be different with a bishop.  How did it work as opposed to--I know the Methodist have a bishop, and the Catholics of course, and others.
Speaker 2: There's a bishop's council; I don't know how many, but there's a bishop council--I don't know, maybe there are 10, 12, I don't know.  And every four years, I believe, they have to run for office and, you know, if he wants to stay in power, he has to get the votes to stay in power through the congregation; the entire congregation votes.  And so he stayed in power until he died, and that's when my dad [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] took over.  They voted my dad in later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay, so this council of bishops--and they make decisions about the rest of the churches and what they--and who's the pastor in these churches?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They decide--they decide what, you know, who goes to what church and, you know, the rules and regulations and changing--any type of change of the bylaws or any of that type of stuff, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the services and the--procedures are pretty much Baptist otherwise?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they really are.  I mean you would not tell the difference, so I don't know how that denomination got started as a small denomination but my dad, to this day--my dad, to this day is, is very proud to be the presiding bishop of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's always good to know about black organizations and the formations, and this is a good, you know, church (unclear)--
Speaker 2: My dad--my granddad had cataracts--became blind, so he's still at the organization [Church of the Living God, Texas] after that.  He, he is one of those people who--he didn't trust many people and, you know, I can remember many times where he'd pull his money out and I'd go to visit and he'd hear my voice, and he'd say, "AJ!"  'Cause they called me AJ, and "How you doin?"  And he'd reach--and I knew that my granddad would always give me a couple of bucks or somethin'; he would always find a way.  He says, "How much is this now?"  I'd say, "That's a dollar, granddad."  "Well that's your dollar," you know, that kinda thing.  And so he was a--I thought he was a very nice man; loved to dress, you know?  He was the kind that--he loved shoes and he loved, he loved clothing, and he loved Buicks [American automobile] (laughter).  He'd drive those big Buicks.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's the affinity people have for cars--certain kinds of cars.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --He liked Buicks with the (unclear) on the side in those days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah (laughter); yes, absolutely.
Story_ID: 55405
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now did your--what did your father [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] say about growing up?  Well, let me first--just the same question.  Are there any stories about slavery or Juneteenth [1985], or what life was like, you know, before they got to Dallas [Texas]?
Speaker 2: Well, not any stories about slavery or Juneteenth, but we joke in the family that on the Berry side, you know, because of my grandma and my dad--my granddad [Calvin Charles Berry, Sr.], they had an affinity for guns; they loved guns.  I guess a lotta people did back then, but they just loved guns, and we joke that one day my grandmother [Sammie Berry] got mad at my granddad and--Sammie Berry was her name--and got a gun out and shot out his tires (laughter).  So it's a running joke in the family that you gotta watch out for that side of the family because something may not be quite right there (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) on his Buick (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, on his Buick; he loved that Buick, and I can tell you it just hurt him to the heart (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what did your father say about growing up?  Well--did you grandfather and grandmother have a pretty contentious relationship all the time, or was this just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no; it was just, you know, probably one of those things; they actually had a very good relationship and she was the feisty one; she was a feisty one.  She--I was actually scared of her half the time because she was very demonstrative when she talked, and she didn't take any--she didn't take things from anybody.  She was really candid and blunt about just about everything, but she's another one.  You come there and she's the sweetest person in the world when it came to her grandkids and all of that, but nobody would mess with her because they knew that she meant business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess being a preacher's wife you have to stand your ground sometimes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yes, you do (laughter); yes, you do.
Story_ID: 55406
Speaker 1: All right.  So what did your father say about growing up?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: He had a lot to say about growing up.  In fact, probably about seven or eight years ago, we went back to where he grew up and mostly in the Tyler [Texas] and Henderson, Texas area.  I mean he started preaching when he was like nine years old, okay?  But he would tell us about, you know, the--really more along the jobs that he had and the distances that he had to walk to for those jobs, you know.  He talks about, you know, when he and my mom [Clementine Southall] decide to marry, how to make ends meet; he start out by his first job--not first job; first 'real' job I would say was he was in charge of cleaning up the chicken yard, you know?  Raking chicken stuff up to make a living, and occasionally, you know, they'd give him a few chickens to feed his family and that type of thing.  So he was, you know, he was okay with that.  But he wanted to go to Dallas--go to the big city to try to--for a better living for his family.  So when he left East Texas when I was four--this was like '59' [1959], 1959 or so, went to Dallas and he got on with a--an insurance company parking cars, and so he was happy with that, but at the same time he was pastoring a church and he received papers to--for the presiding bishop, his dad, to pastor the church in Dallas, a little small church in South Dallas.  And he did that a good while, and--my dad is the kind of person--he's very--has an entrepreneurial spirit, so he's a kind of a vision--I think he's a visionary; I know he's a visionary.  So they stayed at that church for maybe a year or two, and he decided that he wanted to go on the other side of town, and he convinced the deacon board to purchase a church, and another church, and this church was, you know, by standards then, it was pretty big; it probably had 12, 15 classrooms, a huge dining area, a sanctuary that would hold maybe 200, 250 or something like that, a pastor's office, a choir room, I mean it was a nice-sized church.  And they knew they didn't know how they were gonna pay for it, but it was around the time that white flight was taking place in that section of Dallas so felt it was a little easier for them to get in there.  And they ended up purchasing that church, and Sunday to Sunday tried to figure out how to pay the mortgage.  But I guess it was a lot in-between that, and instead of working the parking lot, he left that and went to a company called Railway Express like the equivalent of Federal Express, but it was local; and that's when he started making a little money.  It wasn't easy; we didn't get--we were poor but didn't know it, okay?  Always had food and that type of thing, you know--the little sacrifices that we had to make.  As kids, we didn't think anything of it, you know.  My birthday is December 22nd, you know, and stories about people who are born around that date always get cheated in gifts around Christmas; well it's true, you know.  My birthday came--there used to be a show, a cowboy show, called 'Have Gun-Will Travel,' [American Western television series (1957-1963)] and Richard Boone I think was the star, and he would go around and he--I guess he was a bounty hunter.  He'd give away these cards that say, 'Have gun will travel,' and had a little derringer up his sleeve and that type of thing.  Well, my family bought me that one year, you know, with the little derringer gun and the holster and the little cards and all of that, and I was able to open that on my birthday.  My mom said, "You can play with that for one hour, then put it back, wrap it back up, and you can bring it back out at Christmas."  (Laughter).  But I was happy; I mean it didn't bother me at the time.  I was like, 'Wow.'  I hated I had to do that, but I was happy that I got it, so it wasn't, it wasn't difficult growing up, you know?
Speaker 1: Well I wanna ask you more about that.  I just wanted to ask you about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now did your father go to the army at all?  Did he serve in the army?
Speaker 2: My dad did go to the army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he finish high school?
Speaker 2: My dad did not finish high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know where he went?
Speaker 2: Emmett [J.] Scott High School [Tyler, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Emmett Scott, okay.
Speaker 2: --in Tyler.
Story_ID: 55407
Speaker 1: So now this raises another question.  The other question I didn't ask was did your parents [Clementine Southall and Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] meet before your dad went to the army or after, or did they meet at Emmett [J.] Scott [High School, Tyler, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, they met at Emmett Scott.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.  Now here is the question of the hour.  Is there a story about how they met and how they fell in love and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know; I do not know how they--to this day; you know what?  And that is a question when I go next month down there, I'm, gon' have to ask 'cause that's ridiculous; I do not know how my parents met--just don't.
Speaker 1: Well it's not unusual that people don't, but you know, it's a question that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It's a good, it's a good question; it's something that--like I would know that.  My kids always ask me how--you know--they would like know now, you know.  "How did you and mom meet?"  So that's interesting.  I'll ask; we'll see if he tells me (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Anyways--but they met at Emmett Scott--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and did they get married at Emmett Scott or--I mean were they still in high school, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were in high school and they, and they got married and then both of them stopped going, then--now it's time to take care of this baby that was coming.  So they, they both quit school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your dad get drafted soon after that, or did he go to volunteer--or(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I don't know if he was drafted or volunteered, quite frankly, but he went for a couple of years and got an honorable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--This would have been like after World War II [1939-1945], I guess; just after--
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's--
Speaker 1: --'cause he would have come out in '48' [1948]?
Speaker 2: Around that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and out of school around 1947 or '48' [1948].
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right, so it was right after World War II.  So I don't know--I don't know if he was drafted or volunteered; my guess, my guess is that he was drafted, but I don't know that.  He stayed in a couple of years and then got an honorable discharge.
Speaker 1: This is in the army--
Speaker 2: The army.
Speaker 1: --United States Army.
Speaker 2: United States Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 55259
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your father [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] serve overseas when he was in the army [United States Army]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he did not; I think he was mostly in Kentucky--Fort Knox, Kentucky [Fort Knox is an army post of the United States] or something like that.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)(unclear)--you're old, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, that's where he was; that's where he spent most of his time.
Speaker 1: All right.  So he came--when he came out, was he able to use the GI Bill [The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 paid for the tuition of veterans up to $500 a year] to go to school or anything?
Speaker 2: I don't think so; he's, he's never mentioned anything like that.  I think he--you know, by that--you know, he was, he was, he was busy with--certainly busy with family, but when he came out, no, he didn't use the GI Bill; not to my knowledge.
Story_ID: 55260
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So your parents [Clementine Southall and Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] got married in the late '40s [1940s], and--now when you think about their personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, what their talents were, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My mom, without question--most of the traits; and that's because my mom was--she was a soft-spoken--I wouldn't say I'm soft-spoken, but she was a real gentle kind of person; very loving and very positive spirit, always smiling.  She was just one of those kinda people that everybody kinda likes because everything was positive; never--never anything negative.  You would--wouldn't hear her raise her voice much at all; she didn't have to, so I'm pretty close to my mom's personality, I take most of it from her.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what was your father like?
Speaker 2: My dad is a very creative--I call him entrepreneur; he, he has a lot of good ideas, he thinks big, he is candid and sometimes blunt, so if you ask him his opinion, he's not going to dance around it.  If you don't wanna hear what he really thinks, don't ask him because he's--he does not sugar-coat anything.  He's very, very blunt about what he says.
Speaker 1: Does he sort of take after his mother [Sammie Berry] in that regard?
Speaker 2: I think so, yes; yes, absolutely (laughter).  He is one of those type people who's ultra-prepared for everything, almost like it's almost a paranoia.  He is--he's just always ultra-prepared; he believes in preparation, and so any type of scenario he's already examined, you know, an alternative to it.  And that's the way he lives to this day.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he said he was ultra-cautious too, you know; he was cautious and believed in taking precautions.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he took precautions but he, but he wasn't afraid to ask for anything; I mean he's cautious but everything's very strategic.  Everything he does is very, very strategic and he won't step out there unless it's all buttoned up and he knows, you know, if he has a high chance of probability; he's just--that's the way he is.
Story_ID: 55261
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--now do you have siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you name them from the oldest through the youngest, and put yourself in the flow.  And tell us a little about them--what they're doing now and--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Calvin--Calvin Berry--Calvin, Jr.  He's the oldest, and Calvin was the second black fire fighter in Dallas [Texas].  He has an entrepreneurial spirit, he helped me get through college [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] by, you know, a little part-time; when he wasn't fighting fires, he'd do some landscaping on the weekends, and so I would go out with him and he'd split whatever, you know, whatever the take was.  But he's--he ended up quitting the fire fight--the fire department because he wanted to build homes; he was pretty good at construction, so he started his company in building homes in the Dallas area and was pretty darn good at it.  So he is quite an entrepreneurial spirit and he was saying he really never wanted to work for anybody again.  Housing downturn, he had--you know, he--so that was, that was a little tough when things kinda started drying up so he ended up doing some facilities management at a mega-church out there in Dallas, and he seems to be a real happy camper.  He just recently bought him a new home and all of that.  He just had one kid but he's probably the--he is the sibling who--my big brother--who really was there for me when it was tough for me getting through school financially; and that's because--not because my family didn't have at that time, it's because of a choice I made, and that is I wanted to do it myself, and I don't recommend that to folk (laughter) 'cause 10 years later, I ended up paying for the rest of my college education (laughter).  But that's my brother, that's my oldest.  And then I have a brother Steve--Steven Berry, who lives about an hour from me right now in Delaware.  Steve loves cars; he's always loved cars so early on, he could--he would take engines apart and put 'em back together; anything in the house--don't let Steve get ahold to it because he's so mechanically inclined; he would just take things apart and sometimes he wouldn't put 'em back together.  But he would take things apart; he loves mechanics, and to this day he's a very good mechanic.  He runs a couple of stores for major name brands.  And then I have my sister Linda.  Linda went to college for, I think, three years or so, and she ended up getting married and moving to California--Atlanta [Georgia], then California, with her husband, and her husband did something with the banking-slash-insurance industry, and they did very well and they end up retiring at 49 and moving back to Dallas.  And Linda is the comedian of the family; she is one of those people who you can certainly depend on, and I think she is the person who kinda is part of the glue that holds that, that family together, and we always like to go over to her house, and she can cook like you wouldn't believe.  And we're pretty, we're pretty close--I'm pretty close to all my siblings.
Speaker 1: Now is she still in Dallas?
Speaker 2: She's still in Dallas--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --still in Dallas, and I think she does like a part-time at some pharmaceutical distribution company or something like that because she says she was bored to death staying at home.  I'm like, "Oh, that's kinda nice; I wish I had that option" (laughter), okay?  So she has two kids--one up in New York and one's there in Dallas as well.  And then me--then I came along, and then after me, there is my sister Cynthia; she's in Dallas as well; works for Frito-Lay [snack manufacturer, division of PepsiCo], and I call her, I call her 'little sister,' and she's got a son in the army [United States Army].  So all my--all my siblings have kids and all of them fortunately are doing very well.
Story_ID: 55262
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when you grew up, did the household consist of basically just--I mean your nuclear family with your parents [Clementine Southall and Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] and your siblings, did any grandparents live with you or any other relatives?
Speaker 2: I had a grandmother (cannot identify) who lived with us for maybe, maybe six months to a year or so.  Grandmother on my mom's side moved from Tucson, Arizona; I don't know how she got out there, but moved from Tucson, Arizona, and they stayed with us a short period of time, then they got--then they were--her dad [Willie Southall] was with her too--my mom's dad, and he had dementia so he had some special things going there.  They ended up going to a nursing home and he ended up dying and a short time later she died and all that.  But they lived with us with a short period of time in Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you were talking about the neighborhood you lived in early on.  You said you all lived in Oak--
Speaker 2: Oak Cliff [Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Oak Cliff?
Speaker 2: South Oak Cliff.
Speaker 1: Early, right?  As early (ph.).
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: And then you finally moved to--
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in East Dallas [Texas] and then early on--and then around when I was probably five or six, we moved to Oak Cliff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you all were there a short period of time too, right?
Speaker 2: No, Oak Cliff, we stayed there in Oak Cliff the rest of my--until I graduated from high school [South Oak Cliff High School, Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--We had two houses in Oak Cliff.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was the neighborhood that whites had fled from--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --as, I guess, the black population of Dallas grew--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --started spreading?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--yeah, it was in, it was in--"Wow, if you move to Oak Cliff, oh wow, you must be doin' well."  Well, that wasn't the case but, you know, it was, it was a nice step up, you know.  Wow, you got a bath and a-half now; wow, you know?  And I had my own bedroom.  I was like, "Wow!"  Because in that first house, I slept on like a back porch with a sofa that was leaning (laughter), so I was happy to get a bed and a room of my own (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so was everybody still at home then?
Speaker 2: No, they--everybody--there was two of us left by the time that we went over there with us--my little sister [Cynthia Berry] and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So that's when we moved over there, so everybody was about out of--they were out of the house.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So can you--so the house was a double, you said, right? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well that was the first house; this was a single, this was a single (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was a single house, okay.
Speaker 2: --and it was a pretty nice neighborhood from--compared to where we came from.  It wasn't fancy or anything like that.  Wow, we had a garage; it was a--there's a garage that actually was converted into extra living space and--but we had a driveway and that was like 'Oh, my gosh, wow!' this is--this is pretty cool (laughter).
Story_ID: 55263
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So we always ask this question.  Can you kinda describe the neighborhood for us, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was 99 percent African American; it was full of kids that--where I never, never longed for anyone to play with.  I'm the outdoors type person so I don't care if it's a hundred degrees outside in the Texas sun, I can always find somebody to go out and play in the front--throw a ball, ride the bicycle, whatever the case.  At the time, you don't--you're not all that aware; at least we weren't aware of any high crime, but I'm sure it was, but my awareness it just wasn't there 'cause I was so comfortable.  I was very comfortable going around the neighborhood anytime--any time of day and night--no big deal.  And my family was the same way.  The--our street had--what I do recall is that the street had lots of front yard gardens--lots of flowers and things like that.  To this day, my favorite flower is a rose; my mom [Clementine Southall] loved roses.  And even here at my home here it's over-kill; I got so many roses around this house.  My wife [Brenda Fowler-Berry] thinks I'm crazy, but it was one of those flowers my wife--mom was very proud of, she has lots of pictures of roses and things like that, and when I think of that neighborhood, I think of all the flowers that were in that neighborhood and all the, all the children uninhibited by any type of fear of anything, you know.  We even had a little creek behind--the other side of the houses had a creek, and we would go down and explore, you know, with our sticks and things like that.  I never caught any fish down there, but just a great place to explore.  I found myself later on looking for a community like that for my own kids.  So it was--I felt like that community had everything, everything we needed; I rarely, rarely went outside of that community.  Church was maybe about three or four miles away, but rarely did I--did we venture out.
Story_ID: 55264
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your church--your father's church?
Speaker 2: It was Church of the Living God [part of incorporated brotherhood of 36 Church of the Living God churches in Texas, Louisiana, and California].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that particular church, did it have a different name?
Speaker 2: No all of them--all Church of the Living God.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So just different addresses, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Different address, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so it was about four or five miles away--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what are some of your memories of church?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--Well, my memories of church is how, during football season, how--first of all, I couldn't wait to get out the church because I'm a Dallas Cowboy [professional American football team in Dallas, Texas] fan, and how we were able to, a friend and I, sneak outta church most Sundays.  I would always--somehow my parents would let me hold the keys to the car for whatever reason; I guess they trusted me, I guess.  I would take those keys, I would go in the car, I would turn the radio on and, I'd listen to the game 'cause sometimes church frequently lasted longer than the twelve o'clock start for the games.  So I would be in there and then after it's over, everybody would ask me, "So what are the [Dallas] Cowboys doing?"  (Laughter).  And I would gladly tell them that.  So I remember that.  The other thing we used to do--about two blocks away, there was a store and--now I'm a little kid--and I would have my quarter or whatever, I would go down and, and I'd spend 15 or 20 cents, and you can get a lot for it then, on candy; and we would sometimes--many times--go in the back of the church, around football season, and we would, boy we would eat a lotta candy, and the ushers they let us alone.  But then as I got a little bit older, I started trying to not go inside church, and we had a little wooded area next to us and I remember the ushers would come looking for us and we would run off into the woods and--of course they couldn't find us but they'd call, you know, "I know you guys are in there," and that type of thing.  Now I don't know--I never really got in trouble for that, so I don't know if they--I don't know--quite understand that 'cause these days, my kids--if they did something like that, they would be in some hot water at that age.  I don't know how I got away with that but I did, and--but we would stay kinda hidden and then we'd--once they leave, we would slowly sneak in the back of the church and sit back there, 'cause we--we didn't wanna get in trouble with our parents.  But I never got in trouble with my parents for that, and that's strange to me because they were disciplinarians, so--beats me. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is--what you're telling me--these stories are stereotypically in the black community called stories of the PK (laughter), you know; they can't get away with anything.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, we did.   (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You know (unclear) free cokes out of the coke machine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, we did some of that too, now (laughter).
Speaker 1: He knows how to get out of church, you know.  But other kids, you know, when they see the PK coming, they get with him, they can get out of service (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, there was a little--there was a good deal of that there, and one thing I remember I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Preacher's did is a PK, for those who don't know.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, another thing I remember is that there's a lady named Janetta (ph.) Smith. She used to make ice creams maybe a couple of times a month in the back, and the rock salt and, you know, she let us crank it and all of that, and that was the other highlight is that, you know, when she'd come in and stay.  Her daughter is still alive and shoot, her daughter must be 80-some years old.  So about five years ago, I asked her for the recipe and she says, "Let me dig it up," and she actually sent it to me; I've yet to make it, but I will because I have such great memories. I thought it was the best ice cream ever.  Now, I might taste it now and say, "Wow, it's probably terrible," I don't know, but as a kid, ice cream is ice cream (laughter).  It was good (laughter).
Speaker 1: You were only like--so you were born in '56 [1956], so only about five, I guess, when John F. Kennedy [The 35th president of the United States was assassinated in 1963 while campaigning in Texas] was assassinated.  Do you remember any of that?
Speaker 2: I was almost about eight, okay?  I was born in '55' [1955].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay; '55' [1955], that's right.  Okay.
Story_ID: 55265
Speaker 1: Well we were just trying to--we were talking about the--some of the stories of being a PK, a preacher's kid, and the church [Church of the Living God, Texas], and the--now--which kinda segues into football in a sense, 'cause I know that your name was influenced by the Dallas Cowboys. So you're a Cowboy fan (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, I was a Cowboys fan; I don't know if I fully understood the game, but when you're in Texas, you gotta know football.  Texas is football.  I didn't care about baseball, I didn't care about basketball, any of that, you know?  And most of the time we didn't have a baseball team--not a--you know.  So it was Cowboys, Cowboys, Cowboys.  And so I can go back and get all the history in the world from Ed LeBaron to Don Meredith to Don Perkins to Bob Hayes--'Bullet Bob' Hayes, the fastest human alive--that type of thing [all players for the Dallas Cowboys].  And to this day, I have to be careful, but Dallas is, I'll say, my co-favorite team because my son's [Andrew Berry] with the [Indianapolis] Colts [National Football League team in Indianapolis, Indiana] so I have to (laughter)--I do like the Colts now, no question about that.  But Dallas Cowboys (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now does your son play for the Colts or is he part of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--He's a pro scout director [sic, coordinator].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he is--but yeah, Dallas Cowboys; those were a lotta great stories, and a lotta heartache over the years with that team; lotta heartache.
Speaker 1: A lot of people, you know, loved the Cowboys and they became what they called America's team after a while, you know, so--and the rest of those who don't believe so hate 'em (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, big time; big time.  There's like a love-hate big time, big time.
Speaker 1: Like the [New York] Yankees [American professional baseball team in The Bronx, New York City, New York] in baseball.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah; absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right, so Dallas Cowboys.  Now you went to games too.  You actually--you and your (simultaneous)--did you go with your father [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Well, well, no; I never went to a game with my father but we would--it was at the Fair Park [Stadium]--became--the Cotton Bowl [Stadium] was at the Fair Park [Dallas, Texas] where the Cowboys played, so my parents would drop us off there sometimes and they would have some amusement rides and things like that sometimes, so we would, we would go there, you know, and mostly hang out--not a lot, but sometimes we would, and what kids used to do, and you talk about the preacher's kid, you could climb the fence and get in for free, okay?  (Laughter).  But I probably could have just walked in back then because nobody was really going to the Dallas Cowboy games 'cause it was new, and it's a big cotton bowl, and initially they weren't very good, and all that.  But I can tell you a couple of times we did go in over the fence.
Speaker 1: I know you told me you saw Jim Brown [celebrated American football player for the Cleveland Browns and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee] play (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, and that was--it's like--I didn't like him at the time because he'd just run right through the Cowboys; nobody could stop Jim Brown.  But it was, you know--looking back, it's like wow, I got to see greatness, you know, this Hall of Famer and, you know, I guess the closest, I think, to modern day Jim Brown was Earl Campbell [American football running back and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee] and maybe Adrian Peterson [American football player for the Minnesota Vikings].  Now Adrian Peterson--just a--he's just a beast.  Earl Campbell from Texas--Tyler, Texas; just a--not even human, just run over people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you play sports growing up?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Did you play football?
Speaker 2: I played football; I had to play.  Football was the game I loved.  I was, believe it or not, at probably 140 or 50 pounds; I was middle linebacker, I was very aggressive; I loved to hit.  Didn't like to get hit, but I loved to hit.  And so I was a middle linebacker in junior high, and then in high school, I won the starting job for strong safety at South Oak Cliff High School [Dallas, Texas].  I think we lost two games, close games, that year, and I went on.  I was disappointed that the University of Texas [at Austin in Austin, Texas], you know, didn't come and get me.  I mean why wouldn't they want me?  I thought I was just fantastic--like most kids do.
Speaker 1: Now were there any--I mean when you were in high school, there were black players on the University of Texas team by then [Julius Whittier integrated the University of Texas football team in 1970], right?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, but I was--when I was in high school, I think Earl Campbell was a--went to Texas a year before I did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so they were just starting to kinda integrate that team and so, you know, I played in high school and I actually--when I went to college I was walk-on, and walk-ons at University of Texas at that time--they wrote a book about walk-ons; I think it was called 'Meat On The Hoof' [Gary Shaw, 1972], or something like that (laughter).  And so, oh yeah, come on; you can walk on, and you're basically tackling dummies, and that kinda thing.  So that lasted a short period of time, so I decided to use my brain.
Speaker 1: So what did you play, safety or something at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, when you walk on like that, you can declare you wanna play cornerback or something like that, but I didn't have the speed for that; I was slow.  I could hit, and I was, you know--and even at that time, I was only 160, 165 pounds.  Can you imagine me trying to tackle Earl Campbell at 160, 165 pounds?  I was itching for just an--I just wanna show them what I can do; I wanna hit Earl Campbell, I wanna hit him, I wanna show them.  I am so happy that to this day, that I didn't get that opportunity because I probably woulda had a broken neck, okay?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He was pretty tough.  Earl Campbell was a legend.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  So I did--I--you know, after I saw the writing on the wall--like, you know what?  I'm not going to really get a real shot at that.  Me and another guy, we did, we walked on and we said, "Ahh, let's get outta this."  And then--so I made a transition outta that and (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 55266
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.  Well, I wanna ask you about that later, but I'm gonna go back to growing up as a kid.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Now where did you start grade school?
Speaker 2: Albert Sidney Johnston [Elementary School, Dallas, Texas]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's where I was when [John F.] Kennedy was shot [The 35th president of the United States was assassinated in 1963 while campaigning in Texas].  That's the question.
Speaker 1: Albert Sidney Johnson (ph.) [Johnston was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was killed in 1862 at the Battle of Shiloh].
Speaker 2: Johnston.
Speaker 1: Johnston, right; I know that name, but I can't think of who he was.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I think it was something dealing with the Civil War; I'm not sure, but it may have been something dealing with the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, right; that's probably right--Civil War.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, named for a white Civil War confederate officer--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --Albert Sidney Johnson.  That's--this is an elementary school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It's Johnston.
Speaker 1: Johnston, right--elementary school.  So you started school there--what, kindergarten or first grade or what?
Speaker 2: First grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Started there at first grade, and I stayed there first through the sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Through sixth.  Now did you--what was--so there was--the school was 99 percent black--
Speaker 2: Well at that time, that school was probably a hundred percent black.  Well, there was one Hispanic guy--one Hispanic guy that I can remember, Paul Schivalo (ph.) (cannot verify), or something; I even remember his name 'cause it was, it was really interesting, and that's really the first taste that I got to any type of diversity, you know.  And Paul would bring lunches to school that I wasn't familiar with; he had--maybe had some bean sandwiches and things like the tortillas; I wasn't--I didn't know anything about that.  I'm like, "What is that, man?  What is that?"  And it was--we had, at that time, in elementary school, we had all black teachers.  And I still, I still remember them by name, and most of them are still alive in Dallas.  In fact, the next time I go to Dallas--I have a friend who stays in contact with them and we're gonna visit them.  So these were--most were very, very, very committed; very, very committed to education.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your favorites?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there's a Miss Bridges; I was in her class when [John F.] Kennedy was shot [The 35th president of the United States was assassinated in 1963 while campaigning in Texas].  And I could remember, you know, they let us out early and, you know, certainly the teachers crying and that type of thing, and we didn't quite know what was going on, you know.  In the second, third grade there, and all I remember is they were crying and they said Kennedy was shot, and that--I would hear these ambulances or emergency vehicles or sirens and--but--and we immediately said, "Oh, they must be going to pick up Kennedy."  We didn't know; we were kids.  We were miles away.  We were probably, I don't know, eight miles away from the scene, so it probably had nothing to do with it, but as kids, you know, you have vivid imaginations.  And I can remember going home that night and just seeing, you know, even the angst or the disappointment or the sadness on my parents' [Clementine Southall and Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] faces.  And we would sit on what we called the back porch.  It was an enclosed area, it was probably early--like a sunroom, had windows all the way around it, but it had curtains that--I don't know what you call it--a little bit at the top and a little bit at the bottom, and in the middle it's nothing but window (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Like cafe curtains?
Speaker 2: Cafe curtains, yes.  And I can remember being so disturbed by somebody shooting somebody--shooting the president.  I could not sit in front of the TV and the windows at night time; I could not--I was freaked out by open windows like that, and so I would not--or windows that weren't covered--so I would get close to the wall where, if there is anyone out there, they couldn't see me.  To this day, I feel somewhat traumatized by that because I can't sit in front of a--at night time, I cannot sit in front of a window that's not covered, or blinds not closed; I can't, I just can't do it because I just feel like somebody's out there seeing me and I can't see them.  And it was all the result of that Lee Harvey Oswald [largely though to be the sniper who assassinated Kennedy]--not Lee Harvey--yeah, Lee Harvey Oswald shooting Kennedy.
Story_ID: 55267
Speaker 1: Goodness, Robert [F.] Kennedy [(1925-1968) The U.S. Attorney General during John F. Kennedy's administration, Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated during his presidential campaign in 1968].
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: What year did Robert Kennedy get shot?
Speaker 2: Sixty-Eight [1968] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Sixty-Eight [1968].
Speaker 2: --a couple of months after Kennedy--I mean Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  But--now 1963 was the year that--I've been told it's the year when network television went from covering the nightly news for 15 minutes to a half an hour; it's also the year, as we just mentioned, that John F. Kennedy [(1917-1963) The 35th president of the United States was assassinated in 1963 while campaigning in Texas] was shot and killed with, you know, almost round-the-clock news coverage--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --of the event; and at an age when you only had two or three top television stations in your city [Dallas, Texas], if that many.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--They had--those were the days.
Speaker 2: I don't know how many there were in Dallas [Texas] then--how many stations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--About three or four; I think there were three stations plus the independent [station] that I used to watch 'The Three Stooges' (laughter), and things like that on (laughter).
Speaker 2: '[The] Cisco Kid'--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Yes, yes; you know--'Mr. Peppermint', and just--things like that.  But it was four stations; it was very simple then (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, but the incident--now here you're eight years old, and here's round-the-clock news coverage pretty much on all the stations.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: You see history unfolding before you.
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Did you--I mean do you think that that experience like shaped your subsequent career at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Not at all.  It didn't--it did not.  It really had nothing to do with the choice of career that I took, and I can get into that a little bit later, but that didn't shape it.
Speaker 2: I was wondering because, you know, Dan Rather [(1931- )American journalist and news anchorman for CBS news] is a Texas guy--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and that's when he first came into national prominence as an anchorman and a reporter--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --you know.  So--I'd never heard of him until that era when [Walter] Cronkite [(1916-2009)American broadcast journalist, anchorman for CBS evening news] would (ask in?) Dan Rather, and he'd come on with his Texas accent, you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  And he actually made--well Dan Rather made his, you know, his name tying himself to a tree or something, you know, during a hurricane [Hurricane Carla, 1961], I think, in Galveston, Texas or something like that.
Speaker 2: I never heard of that story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was--he made his name during a hurricane.
Speaker 2: He tied himself to a tree in Galveston (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, he was in the middle of--and, and, and I hope I have this right, but he was covering a major storm and, you know, you see all the reporters now; they're there when the wind is blowin' and howlin', you know, that's the kinda thing they do, but I think he was the first to do that; so he made a name for himself.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Was his cameraman tied to a tree, too?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Mighta blew away, I don't know (laughter).
Story_ID: 55268
Speaker 1: Well we--you know, I just wanted to, you know--so you had like four stations in Dallas [Texas]--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and did you watch TV a lot growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I watched TV a lot probably, but not news.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, you know, I wasn't--I wasn't an avid consumer of news.  I liked, you know, the entertainment.  I used to--I would watch things like 'Leave it to Beaver,' okay?--Things like that, and I used to wonder, I'm like, "Wow, you know what?  'Leave it to Beaver'--Beaver never gets a spanking; I can't--why can't it be like that in my family?"  (Laughter).  Okay?  I mean he never (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Now you were raised in a traditional black family where you(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, and I got--Oh, yeah, I got--I got the belt, okay?  And I'm okay with that; I really am, because that was a discipline.  I mean our parents [Clementine Southall and Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] didn't abuse it or anything like that, but I got--yeah, I got a belt on my butt, and so did my brothers and sisters, okay?  And it was all in love, and I don't think that's a bad thing.  But I wanted Beaver--I wanted that type of treatment; I wanted them to talk to me instead of--instead of that.  I can probably count the 'whoopings', as we call 'em, but you got the point across.
Speaker 1: Did you raise your children, you know, with corporal punishment, or did you raise them like the Beaver?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's a cross between the two because I can--you know I probably popped 'em on the butt; it wouldn't take much.  I think I was very fortunate, I think the kids understood the discipline.  I would get a belt and I'd fold it in half and I'd pop it like that (DEMONSTRATION) (laughter), so maybe someone could say, "Well, that's mental abuse."  I mean maybe they could say--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Terror.
Speaker 2: Okay, maybe it's--but--the kids will--they laugh about that to this day, you know.  They knew that when mom and I said X, Y and Z, they, they, they knew to do it.  So fortunately, I might have had to use that once; I'm sure I popped 'em on the butt with my hand a couple of times, no question about that, but I think, you know, we started pretty early with them.  I think the trick to that whole disciplinary thing is you really have to start early 'cause if you try to start when they're a teenager, it's very difficult.
Story_ID: 55269
Speaker 1: So--Well, okay--so were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a very good student--elementary, junior high, high school.  It was when I got to college that I struggled.
Speaker 1: What were you interested in at the elementary and high school level?
Speaker 2: I liked writing--I loved writing; I loved math at the time.  But I think it was one of those cases where, you know, I--I don't think that the schools were very good, but I didn't find that out until I got to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Didn't find that out until I got to college.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now high school--what was your high school?
Speaker 2: South Oak Cliff High School [Dallas, Texas].
Speaker 1: South Oak, Oak, Oak--
Speaker 2: South Oak--Cliff.
Speaker 1: Oak Cliff, okay; all right.
Speaker 2: It was probably--it's a 10-minute walk from my home.
Speaker 1: Alright, and so was the demographics the same?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it had probably--I'd say it was still probably about 98 percent African American, few Hispanics--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it made that--that school had undergone a massive transition rapidly 'cause it was, you know, probably five years earlier it was all white, and then that whole migration happened and it changed pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay; so South Oak Cliff High School.  Now who were your favorite instructors there, or were there any mentors there?
Speaker 2: Oh, to this day, I stay in touch with Sarah Layden (ph.) (cannot verify).  Sarah Layden was really--I would call her my first white teacher.  Sarah was a--is, because she's still alive, you know, talking about a PK--preacher's kid and all that, Sarah didn't take any stuff; she always stayed one step ahead.  Now I played football and I tried to get outta some things and she would say, "Oh, really?  Emm hmm, okay."  Next time I see her, the coach would be with her, and she'd say, "So Andrew says that he needs to be at practice blah, blah, blah, blah," and the coach said, "Really?"  And so, you know, they caught me a couple of times.  I knew after a couple of times that--don't mess with Sarah.  But Sarah introduced me to Shakespeare, she was--poetry, she allowed me to, to really experiment--so much so--I was in her class, I was into [William] Shakespeare--she introduced us through the play 'Macbeth'.  And so I wrote a section of 'Macbeth' into black dialect and she let me--I loved taking pictures and film; I had a little Super 8 camera [motion picture camera introduced in 1965] and that type of thing, and so she let me act it out--shoot it, act it out, record sound, and this took, you know, took a--took a couple of weeks to do, you know, so we had assigned people parts out in front of the school and all of that, and nobody knew what we were doing, and she brought the whole English department in to watch the movie that I put together.  But she was one of those out-of-the-box kinda teachers that would let you experiment; she wasn't so tied to the curriculum that you couldn't do other things because people learn differently, that type of thing.  So to this day, I call her up and, and I, I, I know her family, I visit her.  She's the only teacher that I--I'm really, I'll say, close with.  I know the others, you know, that type of thing, but she's the one; she's the one teacher that I think had probably the biggest impact on my life--Sarah Layden.
Story_ID: 55270
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now--I had a question.  So you're shooting Super 8 [motion picture camera introduced in 1965] and did you shoot a lot?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you're shooting a lot, and did you have any aspirations to be a filmmaker?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You were coming along during the Blaxploitation film era--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --or what's been called that anyway.
Speaker 2: 'Shaft,'[Blaxploitation film, 1971] and all of those (unclear).  I did; in fact, I did, at the time, wanted to--I wanted to make movies and I just, I just loved it; I would even, you know--I loved writing and I loved shooting, and I even made a little mini-movie--at home movie; they called it 'Whatever Happened to Baby Cynthia,' my little sister [Cynthia Berry], okay, you know, the whole bit--a play after 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane' [1962 American horror movie] with what--Joan Crawford [(1906-1977) Oscar-winning American actress] and I forget who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It was Bette Davis [(1908-1989) American actress and two-time  Oscar-winner].
Speaker 2: --and Bette Davis, right; that's correct--which I think was a fascinating movie; it certainly dates me, but that's okay.  And so it was, you know--I would have fun; I'd always have willing participants.  People loved to see themselves, and so I went to school saying, "You know what?  I think you know, this might be something I wanna do" because it was so much fun.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So had you really--was that your, I guess, your aspiration in high school, to become a filmmaker?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the--around the junior, senior year, you know.  I didn't quite know what I wanted to do, but I did know that I wanted to do something with telling stories with writing and with taking pictures and video film; I did know I wanted to do something with that.  And when I went to college, I started pursuing that.
Story_ID: 55271
Speaker 1: Okay.  Before we get you out of high school--when you were growing up, were there any black personalities on television in Dallas [Texas]--news people or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the people?
Speaker 2: Iola Johnson [(1950- ) the first African American news anchorwoman in Dallas, Texas].  She may have been, you know, certainly either--if not the first, certainly I would say, you know, one of the few African American anchorwomen who co-anchored a major show--newscast.  She was loved by all and, and every African American in town.  Now this is the station I ended up working at; they were number one by a mile.  It was very unusual for--to have that kinda diversity in Dallas [Texas] on the air back then, but--Iola Johnson.
Speaker 1: Was she the first black anchor?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --first black anchor.
Story_ID: 55272
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you were a senior [at South Oak Cliff High School in Dallas, Texas] in what year?
Speaker 2: Seventy-Four [1974].
Speaker 1: Seventy-Four [1974].  Now this is a pivotal year in television because of--I don't know how much attention you paid to it, but this was about the time of the Watergate hearings [1973 U.S. Senate investigation of wiretapping in the Nixon administration], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I didn't pay a whole bunch of attention to that, you know.  Jumpin' right outta high school, I certainly was aware of what was going on, but not the details and all of that.  I was into survival if you had--well, actually, you had--what I was into was the whole kinda gas lines; that was around the time when you had long gas lines--that economic crisis and all that [1973 oil crisis catalyzed by the OAPEC's oil embargo. The price of per barrel quadrupled] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right, yeah, they had the gas (unclear) crisis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yes, and everybody was gouging at the service stations and things like that; I paid a lot of attention to that; it was--somehow I was just fascinated with that.
Speaker 1: I think they reduced the speed to 50 miles an hour (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--That's right, 55 from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Fifty-Five, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely; and then even--almost a short time after that, I guess [James Earl 'Jimmy'] Carter [Jr.] [(1924- ) Carter was the 39th U.S. president and 2002 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize] in '76 [1976], but it's the gas lines what I really remember around my senior year.  And I drove a little Volkswagen [German-manufactured automobile]; I can remember--and filling that car up for $2.65 and, you know, when the prices shot up and they were gouging like that, I can remember my dad tellin' one of the guys, say, "You know what?  People are gonna remember that you gouged them when this is over 'cause it's not gonna always be like that, and you're gonna have a tough time."  My dad was right; within a year after that, that guy was closed down 'cause he gouged them.  It's about three blocks from my house, but I remember that whole gas crisis.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the gas like doubled in price--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from 30 cents to 60 cents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, and in some places it even went up to a dollar, and that was just crazy for that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  I don't really remember it hitting a dollar 'til '77 [1977] in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 55273
Speaker 1: But--so okay; I mentioned Watergate 'cause, you know, Barbara Jordan [(1936-1996) U.S. D-Representative from Texas who gave the opening statement at Richard Nixon's impeachment hearings] comes into national prominence--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and you got Sam Irvin [(1896-1985) U.S. D-Senator] and Bill [D.] Moyer [(1934- )American journalist and former White House press secretary from East Texas] is on the news--a lot of Texas influences over all of these--
Speaker 2: Definitely.  Yeah, you know, the whole Barbara Jordan thing, you know; we're certainly aware of Barb--Barbara Jordan, during the time, and my dad [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] would say--Dad would always say, "You know what?  I think I was on a debate team against her one time."  I'm like, "Dad, where?"  "Well, we had, you know these debate teams in (Tulsa?)."  Well I don't know, I never looked into it, you know, but he was--everybody loved Barbara Jordan.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet her growing up?
Speaker 2: Never met her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --never did.
Story_ID: 55274
Speaker 1: All right.  Did your father, in the church--involved in any civil rights activities or anything?
Speaker 2: No--no, my dad he was really politically cautious and I don't remember him being involved in it, and I know when we wanted to go down and march [Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama?] and things like that, he says, "No, I see what they're doin' to folk down there and I don't want you guys to get hurt; no, you're not goin'."  And we were like, "We wanna go, we'll be--"  "No, you can't go," that type of thing.  And I don't think he was cowardice or anything like that; he didn't want his kids to get hurt.  I mean he'd see the images on TV and this is Texas, okay?  Probably would have been a lot worse (laughter) in Texas, okay?
Story_ID: 55275
Speaker 1: Okay, so on the verge of graduation now kind of--so you got good grades--did you graduate with any high honors?
Speaker 2: I think I was top 10 of class with honors, you know, National Honor Society and all that kinda thing and--which helped me get, you know, some money for scholarship as well going to UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Did you have your heart set on UT?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't know where I wanted to go, you know; there were some pulling me to different schools, but what got my attention over at UT--they sent a recruitment team to our high school and there was a lady by the name of Almetrius Duran, an African American woman, a little short African American woman (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Almetris (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Almetris Duran.
Speaker 1: Do you know how to spell that?
Speaker 2: A-L-M-E-T-R-I-S Duran, D-U-R-E-N or A-N--was kind of a mother figure and--but now, you know, 20 years later, she got a dorm [University of Texas Almetris Duran Dorm]  named after there.  But anyway--and so she told us about UT and told us that, you know, they really want to come there, we could get a good--they wanted us to come there, we could get a good education, that type of thing.  And I had this curiosity from 'Leave it to Beaver' and some of those old shows.  I had almost no interaction with whites 'cause it was all-black environment, you know, all my life, and I always had this fascination.  So I wanted to know whether or not I could compete with whites, so I chose University of Texas.  I knew all the programs they had--radio, television and film and that type of thing, but I wanted to know whether I could compete 'cause I didn't, I didn't have that experience; I didn't know anything about diversity, I didn't know how to pronounce all these different names or this, you know, Italian name and all; I didn't know anything about diversity.  And so I went to UT and it was a great experience, but I found that is--that's when I found out that I wasn't as prepared as I thought I was.
Story_ID: 55276
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you find out?
Speaker 2: Well, I decided right even before I graduated--a few weeks before I graduated, I enrolled in summer school at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas] because I wanted to get a jump on things; I wanted to--I was ready for the experience, I was ready to leave home, I was ready.  So I went, and the summer sessions, of course, are very intense.  I wasn't used to having a whole bunch of homework and things like that, you know--syllabus?  What the heck is a syllabus, you know (laughter)?  So I'm like, "Look at all this extra time I have on my hands" (laughter).  And I finally start looking at this and I'm like, "Wow, I gotta read that much material a day?  Oh my gosh," okay?  So anyway--so I got out of that; I got out of the summer sessions with B's--history and English--some of those mass courses that you just have to--you have to take to graduate.  But then, when the Fall came and, you know, you have a full load again, math in particular, you know I had calculus and all this--and when I had to start taking math, everything seemed so foreign to me and I'm like, "Okay, this is not--this is not--these are not the things that I learned in high school." Even my writing skills--I start questioning everything; I started becoming quite insecure, you know.  I got out of it with, you know--I got out of college with a B average--barely--but it was a struggle in some classes, so I--you know, they had a time you could take some pass, fail and that type of thing, so I--it was then I said, "Okay, I'm not as prepared as I thought I was."  But, I did better in the courses that I really wanted to excel in such as, you know, radio, television and film and that type of thing, and I took the, you know, the whole journalism thing--and--we transitiong? (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(unclear) journalism track (unclear).
Story_ID: 55277
Speaker 1: Well, yeah--well, I was on radio, television, film, which is kind of that filmmaker thing.  But--I took a print journalism course; hated it--absolutely hated it.  Now this was along the time that my dad and I weren't gettin' along very well, you know--typical teenager, you know; you're in college--first person really determined, gonna finish college, that type of thing; and so my dad and I had a falling out and I told him that he had the resources by this time--had lots of resources.  And I told him, "No, I don't need your money, I'm gonna put myself through school; you can take that money and you can shove it."  I told my dad [Calvin Charles Berry, Jr.] that, okay?  (unclear).
Speaker 2: So wait were you staying at home when you were going to the University of Texas?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--No, I was--no.
Speaker 2: So you were on campus.
Speaker 1: I was on campus.  So I was determined though; I was gonna show him that I'm a survivor.
Speaker 2: At what stage were you at, at this point, when you--
Speaker 1: Freshman.
Speaker 2: Freshman?
Speaker 1: Couple of things goin' on there; couple of things goin' on there, and one was my relationship with my dad; I'll get back to that in a second.  But also, my first roommate was--who's name--a white guy who I worked at McDonald's with back in Dallas [Texas]; so we both went there and I say, "Hey, okay, yeah, let's stay together"--Paul--Paul Keifer (cannot verify); he's a lawyer in Dallas now.  Well, Paul, when his parents found out, now this, you know, this is '74 [1974].  When Paul's parents find--they find out that he's staying with a black guy, they told him, "If you do that, we're pullin' all funds, you're gonna hurt your career; you cannot stay with that guy.  I know you know who he is and you work together, but you can't stay in the same room 'cause it's gonna hurt you."  Paul said, "I'm doin' it; I'll work on my own.  I'll put myself through school, okay?  Yeah, I want the money but if you wanna do that, that's fine; I'm not gonna change because you think I shouldn't be with a black guy."  Paul visited me recently, too, he and his lovely wife.  But--so Paul, for that year, he was on the outs with his family, I was on the outs with my family, and we both were working like crazy to put ourselves through school, and we made the statement.  So after the first year we, you know, he went his way, I went my way, you know.  We stayed in contact, that type of thing.  He went on to be a successful lawyer and all of that, and we, you know, when we do talk; we talk about those days.  But my dad, you know--McDonald's wasn't cuttin' it for me, working at McDonald's and college; I needed more money, you know.  After all, I think I needed like $3800 a year (laughter) to put myself through school (laughter), including--that included the dorm, so--there's a friend who said, "Andrew, there's this opening at the local television station, an ABC affiliate, it's called KVUE, and they're looking for a reporter-trainee."  I said, "Reporter-trainee?  Well, what do you have to do?"  "I don't know."  "Well," she says, "I'm not quite sure, but you get to shoot video and I think they put you on TV, too, that type of thing."  We didn't know.  So she says, "I'm not gonna apply for it but you might wanna try."  So I did; I went over to the--I got an interview, you know?  One of the few people--blacks at UT [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]; there were 300 and somethin' blacks outta 41,000 at UT at the time--less than one percent; so somewhat of a novelty.  So I go to the station, you know, and get my interview, did a terrible job; I bombed that interview like you wouldn't believe.  I just--I wasn't prepared, I did no research or anything; I just showed up.  The lady said, "Okay, well I'll call you in about two days."  So if somebody tells me--I'm--(unclear), I'll follow up.  She didn't call me so I got on the phone, I called her; she wouldn't take my call--Gail Granberry--I occasionally stay in contact with her to this day.  She was one of the few women news directors at the time, so she was a kinda--she was a novelty; they didn't have women news directors running news departments at that time.  So I must have called her seven or eight times a day; it was total harassment, okay?  And she finally picked up the phone after a few days, and she said, "Berry, don't you call me again."  And she was very--and I could hear the--over the phone.  She says, "You're either incredibly stupid to call me this much or you are very desperate for a job."  I said, "Miss Granberry, I can assure you that I'm not stupid, but I do need a job."  Another pause--Gail Ship (ph.) Granberry saw something in me and she--and she said, "Come in, let's talk again."  She says, "You know you really did a terrible job in interview, but you know what?  You are relentless; I believe you'd do a good job for me."  So I got the job.  I was anchoring their morning cut-ins and reporter-trainee and, you know, just had this--it was a huge learning curve for me--huge.  The people there were very--very kind in teaching me all the ropes, that type of thing. I had some embarrassing moments and things like that, you know, you're new--all new people do.  But--
Story_ID: 55278
Speaker 1: This was WK--
Speaker 2: KVUE--
Speaker 1: KVUE (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--in Austin; Austin, Texas.
Speaker 1: Austin, Texas.
Speaker 2: First job.
Speaker 1: KU--
Speaker 2: KVUE.
Speaker 1: KVUE.
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it is there that I learned the craft of reporting and producing.  I didn't think I was very good in front of the camera, but people watched.  And this was--this was--a station--this was one of the--one of four stations in the market; the number one station was on what they called the VHF band, owned by LBJ's [Lyndon B. Johnson] family.  Now, it wasn't coincidental that the other stations were on their UHF band; this is before cable, so you had the, you know, 36 and 24 and that type of thing; people really couldn't get those, so that was quite a monopoly at Channel 7 at KTBC, the Johnson station.  And so--but of course cable came in and changed all of that.  But I got a--I had some good teachers, some very, very good teachers at that, at that station and so while I was in college, and this was, you know, I would work, you know, 40--sometimes 45 hours a week there while doing my college work. I loved it so much and they--and several times they'd say, "Andrew Berry, you can't work that many hours here; you gotta graduate college."  I say, "I will graduate college, but this is what I wanna do, okay?  I can't get this in college, okay?  I'm getting all the other stuff, I understand that, but this is what I wanna do."  And so I did that until I graduated college.
Speaker 1: In 1978, correct?
Speaker 2: Seventy-Eight [1978].
Story_ID: 55426
Speaker 1: All right.  So okay, so you graduated in 1978 [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and you're--now how far along are you at KVUE [news station in Austin, Texas] at this point?
Speaker 2: almost about two and a-half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--the opportunity came for me to learn producing; now I would produce little segments in the morning 'cause I would produce my own show, run my own prompter and all that kinda thing and be on the air.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you this.  What was your day like?  When did you start and, I mean you know, what were your hours?
Speaker 2: Well the first cut-in was at 7:25 in the morning so I would get there anywhere from 5:30 to 6; you have five or six stories you have to write, and then after that, you know, after 7:25, 8:25 cut-in, by 9:00 everybody gets in and you are--you get your assignment for the day, and so then I'd have to write a report.  Now I would--they had such a great flexibility in classes at University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas]; there are classes that I could take once a week for like three hours, and so I would do those; there were some independent study classes there so I would--I would have just great flexibility in class schedules so I could--it was easier for me to schedule than the job as well.
Speaker 1: So your hours at the job would end about what time?
Speaker 2: Depending on the day, I could be there 'til 3 in the afternoon; some days I'd have to leave at 1, other days I was there with the--I could be there all day, 'til 5 or 6:00, to see the story go on the air; just depends on the semester and how my classes were scheduled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any--I know you said Miss [Gail] Granberry [former news director at KVUE] was like a mentor to you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Were there any African American people there at the station at that time?
Speaker 2: No, the, the, the, the other lone African American on the air in the market was a guy named Cleveland Moore [cannot verify], and he worked at that--he was my predecessor, and he moved on, for a few extra bucks, to the competitor--to the NBC [National Broadcasting Company] affiliate, and so no--didn't have a--didn't even know Cleveland; we'd see each other occasionally on stories, but nope, there was no mentors because there weren't any more in the market.
Story_ID: 55427
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was KVUE [news station in Austin, Texas] a relatively new station in terms of the UHF [ultra high frequency] band?  I know that opened up, I guess, in the early '60's [1960s] or '60' [1960] through '64' [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah; I would say it was a relatively--yeah, it was relatively new, but I think it had probably been there, you know, 10 years--at least 10 years, or something like that at least.  And--but it was--but it had--everybody was young in that newsroom--everybody; and most had graduated from University of Texas [at Austin, Austin Texas], and so you had--the top two people in there were women; wow, that's very unusual, and actually, the last year I was there, actually, there was a gentleman who came in from Tucson, Arizona; that's when I really learned how to produce--Russ Stockton [cannot verify].  Now, I really don't know what ethnicity Russ was, but he--he taught me a lot about producing, and that's what I fell in love with--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is producing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1978--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and--so what did you produce first?
Speaker 2: First, I produced the 6 p.m. news at KVUE.  But, you know, I'm the creative type and I knew in all the big markets and all that, that, you know, they routinely did live shots and all of that.  For us to do a live shot, it was like an act of Congress, it's very difficult.
Story_ID: 55428
Speaker 1: It was just clunky and all of that, and I wanted to go somewhere where if I said, "Let's do a live shot," bam--very easy to do.  So that's when I decided I was going to go to the ABC [American Broadcasting Company] affiliate, KSAT-TV, in San Antonio, Texas, which was 80 miles south.
Speaker 2: Okay, so when you--after you graduated, did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right after I graduated.
Speaker 2: --through K--what is it, K--
Speaker 1: KSAT
Speaker 2: SAT, San Antonio, Texas.
Speaker 1: ABC affiliate--and they had lotta bells and whistles.  So I think I was producing there the 5:00--5 p.m. show, and I had so much fun at that station because they had the bells and whistles, and I found out--that's when I really found out I was a pretty darn good producer; that's when I really got my confidence producing.  And at that time--well, still, the bigger market you go, the more money you make, so I made a few hundred dollars more a month at KSAT, but at that time, my goal was, 'I gotta make $20,000 a year' (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--put this in perspective (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--back then, yeah.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Seventy-Eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1978 that's good money.
Speaker 2: Some middle man in the positions of paying 12, 15,000 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --so you wanted to make pretty decent, you know, good salary for a middle man (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Absolutely.  So I wasn't there yet at KSAT, but by this time I figured out well, the bigger market I go, the more money I can make, the more toys, more bells and whistles, blah, blah, blah.
Story_ID: 55429
Speaker 1: So I just got a call out of the blue from a news director [WVUE-TV] in New Orleans [Louisiana], and that news director said, "Hey, we need a producer for our 5:00 show and we hear that you're pretty good and, you know, why don't you come in and talk to us?"  I said, "New Orleans?"  Hmm, I heard a lot about New Orleans; so I was like, "Okay."  So I got to the airport--well, before that, he asked me, "Well, how are you dressed?"  I said, "Well I have on"--whatever color I had at the time, and I said, "I'm dressed in"--whatever; and the guy said, "Well I have white hair; you'll see a guy dressed in a suit with some white hair and you'll see he's lookin' for somebody, it's probably you; you just--you'll find me."  So--saw each other in the airport, exchanged pleasantries, got in the car, and he said--name is Alec Nagel (ph.) [cannot verify].  He said, "You know, I hope you don't mind me saying this but I didn't know you were black."  And I said, "Ahh, don't worry about it."  I said, "I wasn't sure if you were white."  And we started laughing, you know, so that broke the ice.  He hired me and finally I cracked the $20,000 barrier--
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000.00); you couldn't tell me anything now, I had made it (laughter).  Twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00).  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So this is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Twenty-two thousand dollars ($22,000.00).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay; and what was the name of this station?
Speaker 1: That was WVUE--
Speaker 2: WVUE, okay.
Speaker 1: --in New Orleans.
Speaker 2: Not affiliated in any way.
Story_ID: 55430
Speaker 1: Not in any way.  And let me tell you--I had the time of my life in New Orleans [Louisiana]; that's where I met my wife [Brenda Fowler-Berry], but I met a lot more people before I met my wife (laughter).  It was a great run, a good station, and there was one other--there was another African American on the air there--well two more; one was an anchor who used to be with the network, I think his name was Ken Watts, and I don't know how--why he left the network but he was there, and he was doing the weekend duty.  Well, this is when I started learning about management.  I remember the general manager there, the top guy, saying, "That's your show.  Andrew Berry, what you say goes, okay?  We see what you did in San Antonio [Texas] and we want you to do that here, and if anybody gives you any problems with that, you let me know."  I said, "Oh, that's alright, okay; I appreciate that."  Well, I noticed that they had promoted a young lady from reporter to anchor.  That young lady, she's pretty green but a lotta times when people reach that status of being the anchor, sometimes they change, you know.  When people really start recognizing you and everywhere you go, "Oh, this is"--you know, well--let's just say Mary Doe was promoted; what's important is not her name but--Mary Doe.  Well, Mary Doe would go up to the producer's board; it's like a blackboard with a rundown of all the stories, and she would go to this other producer who--this guy was probably about 15 years older than me, a white guy, a seasoned veteran; and she would say, "Well, I think this story oughta go here and this story oughta go there and that story oughta go there."  And he sat back and he listened and he said, "Lynn--Lynn--your job is to read the news; my job is to produce, okay?  So thank you, but you just read this; we're not changing it."  I was like, "Yes!  That's the way to go."  Because I didn't think--what she was suggesting to him didn't make sense; she wasn't a producer.  Well, I happened to be producing a show; Lynn was going to co-anchor on the show as well, but I'm like--I remember how she tried to tinker with the show, and I said, "Lynn, my job is to produce; I need you to read it, okay?  Thank you, but I'm not changing it."  Two days later, I was put on the weekends, okay?  That's a demotion from what I was doing.  I was devastated because I simply repeated what the other guy said (laughter) in a nice way.  Found out from a friend that she went crying to the GM [general manager] and said that I was hard to work with, and I was actually devastated because nothing like that had ever happened to me. This--
Story_ID: 55431
Speaker 1: --this was--didn't know it at the time, but this was a really critical, critical, critical lesson for me in management, okay?  And first of all, you know, everybody's not gonna be treated the same because different things motivate different people, and so, you know, when I first went in as management, I said, "Well, I'm gonna treat everybody the same."  That's not what you do in management, okay?  You play to people's strengths and all that, but if you treat everybody the same--some people are motivated by money, some are motivated by power, responsibility, you know; different things motivate different people.  And--whether you like it or not, in the news world, if there's an anchor that's 100 percent wrong and the producer is 100 percent right, and that anchor says, "I can't work with him anymore"--the companies put the investment, the money, into the anchor--the producer goes; that's just the way it is, okay?  You gotta understand that.  Promos all over the air, you know.  This anchor is the best thing since sliced bread and all that; they don't know the producer so, you know, so the anchors do have some clout there, and it was a very, very important lesson for me to learn.  Number one, they can tell you that you're the boss, but don't believe it (laughter).  Make decisions, but you just gotta put that in perspective; so that was an important lesson.  So anyway, turned out to be one of the best things ever happened because it was then that--I couldn't wait to get outta there; it drew me closer to my girlfriend at the time, my present wife, and--because they were having this Christmas party.  And I told my wife, "I'm not going to that Christmas party."  First of all, I was ashamed to go because, you know, I was hurt and everybody be lookin' at me, you know, I got demoted to the weekends because I couldn't get along with Lynn, okay?  And she said, "No, we're going, I'm going with you; let's go, let's go."  And that's another lesson--don't let 'em see you when you're hurtin'; don't let 'em see it.  We all hurt, but you don't have to show it.  And so we went.  They were shocked that I showed up.  Had a good time, sat at the table with Ken Watts who invited me, and--but I knew I was better--I knew I was a good producer; I knew it.  So I'm like, 'Okay.'  The best thing that I take with me is--the best revenge is success; I've taken that with me.
Story_ID: 55432
Speaker 1: I heard about this new thing called CNN [Cable News Network based in Atlanta, Georgia]; CNN hired me outta there--another nice boost in salary (laughter), okay?  Another nice boost.  I reached out and said, "Hey, what's this?"  And I had people--at the same time, though, I had the number four market in the country asking me to leave New Orleans and come to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Now, the reason they knew about me is because that was the year [1981] that the [Philadelphia] Eagles went to the Super Bowl and lost [The Philadelphia Eagles were defeated by the Oakland Raiders in the 15th Super Bowl in 1981].  They sat down a team of people including their executive producer, who is now head of news out of LA [Los Angeles, California]--KABC--Cheryl (unclear) Fair.  And we helped them because, you know, you coordinate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, the Super Bowl was in New Orleans--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in the [Mercedes-Benz] Superdome [sports and exhibition venue in New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right, that's right; so we coordinated, you know, they needed help.  When you come down there, the local affiliate needs to help you out.  So we helped them out and we bonded; we got a good relationship goin' there, and when she went back, she said, "You know what?  There's this guy down--this producer down there; you guys should take a look at him."  Well they started callin' and I'm like, "I don't wanna go to northeast; why would I--I don't know anything about the northeast; why would I wanna go to Philadelphia?  I'm a southern guy, I'm staying in the south."  So he called me several times; the assistant news director there wanted me to come up and I'm like, "I'm not interested; I don't wanna come--I don't wanna come to Philadelphia."  Yeah, you know, it was good money, good job, but I'm like, "I don't wanna come to Philadelphia."  So I went to CNN--went to CNN, part of the hardest--one of the hardest times I ever worked.  It was like, you know, it's a new start-up operation and I mean there was no time for social life.  I thought I was gonna have a great social life in Atlanta [Georgia]; all I did was work.
Story_ID: 55433
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the golden age of black Atlanta [Georgia]; you got Maynard [Holbrook] Jackson [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --and you know, everybody's--I mean they're feeling it.
Speaker 2: You're right; absolutely.  This was the time of the--remember the missing and murdered boys [The Atlanta Child Murders 1979-1981]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was around that time; it was a great time to be there, it was a lot going on.
Speaker 1: And CNN [Cable Network News] was really--cable TV had just opened up--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --across the country, and CNN was like a novelty; everybody--nobody had ever seen anything like it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they like, "Well what is this thing?"  So it was a great opportunity for young people 'cause you could do all kinda things.  But we really--it was like you had--I had no time for social life--none; I was tired all the time.
Speaker 1: So were you married at this point that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, not yet.  I was asking her [Brenda Fowler-Berry] to marry me but she says, "I'm not gonna follow you to Atlanta, I got this nice chemical engineering job in New Orleans [Louisiana], I'm making good money."  She was already up there making good money, okay?  She say, "I'm not following some man to Atlanta" (laughter), so I say, "Okay, all right (laughter), no problem, it's all right."  I took the attitude, 'Well there are plenty good-looking ladies in Atlanta.'  There are, but I had no time--no social time, so that was kinda depressing.  So anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well what show did you produce for CNN?
Speaker 2: It was a one-hour show, like at 4 or 5:00 in the afternoon and, you know, I don't know what it was called or anything like that, but it was a one-hour show.
Speaker 1: Who were the anchors on the show?
Speaker 2: There was Chris Curle and Don Farmer; it changed, it, it, it, it, it changed, but I think it was Chris Curle and Don Farmer.  I think they were married at the time, but it's been a long time; I can't believe that.
Speaker 1: So you were responsible for a block of time that was just an hour?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, just an hour.  But you were basically writing it all yourself.  I mean it was, it was--wasn't easy to produce; it was not easy to produce, and I was just a little bit more structured.  There was no structure at the time because people didn't know what they were doing; they were still kinda learning the ropes and what is--they didn't even know what this cable operation was all about.
Story_ID: 55434
Speaker 1: So anyway, Philadelphia [Action News, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] kept callin'.  He said, "I don't know why you went there, but this is the last time we're going to call, okay?  Here's the money, we're the number one shop in Philadelphia; you'll be, you know, doing this show and you'll be producing this and that," and I'm like, "oooh."  So--the person who hired me at CNN [Cable News Network in Atlanta, Georgia] had gone now; they didn't keep some of the financial commitments.  Again, it was kinda crazy there at the time, so I said, "Okay, fine."  I told Philadelphia, "I'm coming."  So I left, and that was another key--really a key move for me 'cause this station was a monster; nobody was even close in the ratings, even to this day, and--
Speaker 2: You said this is the number four market in America.
Speaker 1: In America, okay?  That's big.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--The biggest station in the number four market (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It was the number four market in the country, and the number one rated station--Action News.
Speaker 2: This is WPVI.
Speaker 1: WPVI.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, this was a--now, this was something very new.  When I got to Philadelphia, I'd never seen so many--not just blacks on the air, but blacks behind the scene at this station.  I was like, 'Wow, this is very interesting.'  And they were excited when I came, so you had--this is the first time I had a support system in the industry--first time.  And--but--it was, it was more than just that group; everybody seemed to be very supportive; it was a great station, a great station to work at--work for.
Story_ID: 55435
Speaker 1: I was there [WPVI-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] a year, and the main anchor [Jim Gardner], who I was afraid of, he's still there to this day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--What was his name?
Speaker 1: Jim Gardner [Action News anchor at WPVI-TV since 1976]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, wonderful guy.  He saw what I was doing on the weekends; he liked my shows on the weekends, and his producer was leaving and he went to management.  Now, Jim was a perfectionist and so I would hear some of the conversations sometimes that they would have with the producers and so I was scared; I was scared of Jim.  So when management came to me and said, "Jim Gardner wants you to produce his show," I said, "No way; I'll quit before I do it (laughter)."  "I don't wanna do it, I don't want that responsibility--no, I don't want--no, no, no."  I was really--I was afraid.  He said, "Okay."  They came back, they said, "Drew, you'll have the support you need but we really want you to do that."  I said, "I'm not doin' it."  He said, "Drew, you have no choice; you have to do this.  This is gonna be the contract, blah, blah, blah, blah."  I didn't have an alternative at that time, okay?  And this was about the time I was getting married, so it was a lot goin' on.  Anyway, long story short, I took Jim Gardner's show--another great move.  He is, without a doubt, the best anchor I've ever worked with, you know.  When you're a producer, you have to be so in sync with that anchor because there are so many changes.  I could give Jim one word, you know; maybe Jim asked me earlier on, "I don't know what--what county is that?"  Or something like that, and "I'll get back with you," whatever.  But he was so superb; I could hit--hit that little button, talk in his ear, and I'd say, "Burlington County," and he would--I would know just by his body movement; nobody would know but me, that he got it.  He was just--he didn't need much information.  I'll put it like this--we communicated; he didn't need a lotta chatter in his ear, he just needed just a word or two and he'd take off; he was--and he still--he's very, very good, and one of the few anchors--in that size market, he would write the entire first block of the show, which usually goes 12, 15 minutes or something like that.  Anchors in big markets usually didn't do that; that was unheard of, but he had that kinda work ethic and expertise.  He was a very good writer, too.  So that was a great move for me; that was--I stayed there--I stayed in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for seven years my first turn, and at the end of that, they ended up buying ABC [American Broadcasting Corporation]; it was Cap City Station [Capitol Cities Station]--they ended up buying ABC [in 1985].  And that led for new opportunities for me.
Speaker 2: So they ended up buying American Broadcasting Company--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: ABC.
Story_ID: 55436
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.  And the folk there will say now--now WPVI-TV [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was a tightly-run ship; there weren't a lotta extra resources--not a lotta extra resources.  They had enough resources to do anything we wanted, but it was tight; people really--they did a lot there.  Well, ABC at the time--where I had maybe one writer on the 6:00 show, they may would have four or five writers.  And WABC [news station in New York City, New York] in New York, they came to me and they said, "Drew, we need you to go to New York."  I said, "You know, I understand that, but I'm in the process of--I wanna be executive producer somewhere, whether it's back in Dallas or somewhere, but I wanna be executive producer."  "Well we don't have it here, but what about going up to New York?"  I said, "I like that; that's kinda interesting."  So they shipped me up to New York and that's when--Oh, my gosh, you talking about--I thought I'd really made it; my salary doubled, so I was--even at that time, you know, with overtime, this was my first taste of unions, too.  I would average, with overtime and all that, about a hundred grand; and that was--for that time--and that was good money, too, but it was also New York City (laughter).  So, you know--I was from Texas you know, I'd go down the street and, you know, everybody has their hand out and I'm the good guy, I'm givin' this person this and that person that, you know, and you know, I'm goin' to lunch here and I'm like, not payin' attention, and I'm like, "Wait a minute; I don't think my standard of livin' has increased at all here," it's like, "Why do I feel like I don't have--have as much money anymore?"  (Laughter).  Parking and gas; it was just--oh, it was just outrageous.  Anyway--
Speaker 2: So this is 1987 wand you go to New York City to WABC (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Uhh huhh, 1987.
Speaker 2: Now you haven't been out of school 10 years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I was movin' fast.  That was--
Speaker 2: You're moving really fast (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I was movin' really, really fast and had a name across--a positive name across the country; everybody knew--I got calls all the time, all the time, and--
Speaker 2: Now were you going by the name of Drew at this point?
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: Now where did that start?
Speaker 1: Drew started back at Austin, Texas.  When I was on the air [with KVUE], sometime I'd use Andrew, sometimes I'd use Drew, and the executive producer came to me and said, "Hey, I don't care which one you use but you gotta stay with one name."  (Laughter).  So I chose Drew--
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: --so that started way back then.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 55437
Speaker 1: So anyway, you know--so after one year in New York [as a producer for WABC in New York City], they promoted me to executive producer of the money-making show, the 11 p.m. show, and when I was promoted to that, the calls increased even more--people asking me but I'm like, "Ahh, I don't wanna leave this company, this company is good, blah, blah, blah."  So New York [City] is a great news town.  I learned a lot about management there; I had a boss, a news director, who--a former military guy, who--I would say he didn't have the best management skills, but he was a competitor; he knew how to win.  That's where I picked up strategies on how to play in sweeps; that's the ratings period.  This guy was really, really good; I saw him when he was in a tight battle with one of the stations for number one.  This is around the time when Donald Trump [(1946- )American business magnate] and Ivana Trump [(1949- )Czech-American married to Donald Trump from 1977-1992)] were on the outs with each other, and he latched on to that story; he would send people out of the country on that story--I forget what the out-of-the-country component was, but bottom line is he would latch on to a story of high interest in that market, market it like crazy, put the story low on the news cast to drag people down the news cast; I mean he just had--just great strategies and he would--and I think we were number one the whole time he was there; he was good.  He had a--he wasn't well-liked, okay?  He wasn't the nicest person, okay, to many people--to most people.  Never--you know, he was all right, he was always--never, you know, he was always nice to me, and I think part of that is because I came from the mother ship [Capital Cities Communications bought the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) in 1985]--outta Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--'cause that was the mother ship of Capital Cities [Communications], and--but just a lotta things that I saw that I just didn't like.  Also, that was the first real union shock.  Now, I had this kinda anti-union mentality because of PVI [WPVI-TV, news station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], even a big union town like that.  It wasn't a union at that station; we could do--everybody could touch everything.  You could--you know.  And union shops at that time--and you couldn't pick up a light or, you know, you couldn't pick up a camera, you couldn't do any of that stuff.  But I went to New York [City] where they had the union so you couldn't do a lot of that.  And they knew I was from this station--non-union, so they were--they decided they were gonna teach me a lesson--the photographers and the editors, and this is a producer's nightmare.  So as a producer, you're supposed to be checking to make sure that your packages are getting recorded--
Story_ID: 55447
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about the producer's nightmare in New York [City, New York].  So they [unionized employees at WABC-TV in New York City, New York] knew I was from the non-union shop in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I was this new guy comin' in there from the company [Capital Cities Communications] that just bought ABC [American Broadcasting Corporation]; they weren't crazy about that, so they wanted me to know--you're really in the big leagues now; you're in New York.  So--ahh, 6:00 news, number one show in the market, so I--you know, I was a producer, I'm feelin' pretty good, I know there are check points, I check to see whether or not my video packages are ready for the top of show or for the first segment of the show, make sure the video is there, and that type of thing.  So I would go back to the coordinator and I'd say, "How are we?"  He says, "Well," he says, "Everybody's working as hard as they can; my folk work as hard as they can, and it's gonna be tight but, you know, I'm not making any promises, but we should be okay."  I've heard that--I've heard that before, but something felt a little different this time, so I kept asking, you know--an hour before, half-hour before, 20 minutes before, 15 minutes, and--"Well, don't have anything, don't have anything yet; don't have the video yet, you know?  They're really humpin' it.  It was a lotta volume today but we're workin' as fast as we can."  Five minutes--"Ahh, it's gonna be tight, it's gonna be tight."  Before the open of the show, I go up in the booth, the open hits, "What do we have?"  "We don't have anything; we don't have any video, we don't have anything."  I say, "Okay."  So I get on the little toggle to talk to the anchor in the ear--in his ear while the show opens.  "Bill [Beutel], we have no video, no package for the top of the show; we just need to tell folk; tell 'em what the story is about and tell 'em we'll be back in a minute 'cause we need to buy some time."  Sabotage is what they did.  So the show opened, and the anchor came on and said, "Hello, I'm Bill Beutel on this"--whatever--"Monday blah, blah, blah.  Our top story today is X, Y and Z; we'll have more on that story in just a minute--we'll be back in a minute."  Went to commercial.  That's a producer's nightmare because you're going back to commercial within 30 seconds of opening that show, so the whole half-hour of that show was me back and forth with the video people saying, "What do we have?"  And just puttin' in; as we got it, we just--we put it in.  After the show, of course I was livid; I knew it was sabotage, I knew what was goin' on.  I marched back to the news director's office, I said, "You know what happened;" he says, "They got you."  He said, "They got you; I'll handle it."  Brought the folk in, guy said, "Well, you know what?  Things got in late today, we were doing the best we could," you know, and "My guys work hard"--that kinda thing.  And leavin' out, his back to the news director, he looked at me and went (INTERVIEWEE WINKED) (laughter).  So that was my, that was--okay, you gotta play ball with this guy, okay?
Speaker 2: So what weren't you doing with him that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--It's about establishing a rapport, but it was more than just establishing a rapport immediately; it was more the anger that they--they did not want this company to take over ABC because this company was known for doing things a very efficient way, and they knew cuts were coming and I represented the company that they didn't like, so it was an instantly--you don't want him here, so much so they brought other people in there.  They put feces in people's locker who had came up; it was--they got really nasty, okay?  The best thing to happen to me is that--it was around the political election; we went with--the top union guy and I were assigned with another anchor to go around the country during this election cycle; we bonded.  I never had any more problems.  In fact, even on the trip, the guy let me pick up equipment and help out.  It was a bond.  They had made their statement.  Now, they had anger toward other people who were coming up from that--from that new parent company, and they didn't let up on those folk at all.  But they cut me a break; they found out I was a pretty good guy, that kinda thing, and so I had no problems.  But it took a couple of months before that.  So it was a tough environment but it was just a great news town, and after a year, they promoted me to executive producer, and it was just a great experience.

Speaker 1: By this time, I felt that I was ready to run my own shop; I was ready to be news director.  I'm in New York, I'm a young guy, I'm creative, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And--put a couple of feelers out, had a couple of offers--CBS in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--back in Philadelphia, said, "Hey, I want you to come back with us; you know the town."  This was at WCAU--at that time it was CBS.
Speaker 2: So this is--okay, now we're in-- (PHONE STARTS RINGING) ooh, sorry.
Speaker 1: Probably '92' [1992].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: It was probably 1992, and I got an offer from CBS to come back down to the number two position in their news department, the assistant news director, and that, you know, CBS had a lotta stations and said, you know, "You could work your way up to be news director."  That was very--you know, I wanted that.  It was also very unusual because there was a black general manager at that station; that was unheard of in a major market like that; he was a radio guy, and--
Speaker 2: Is this Gene [Lothery] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Gene Lothery, yes.  And I say, "Oh, that's kinda interesting; general manager, huhh?"  Emm, I'm shootin' for news director but now let's see what general manager's all about.  Anyway, I went back to Philadelphia to work for CBS in the number two position in the news department, and then within a few months, the news director left and I earned the position as news director.  That was during [Operation] Desert Storm [1991 military operation led by the United States in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait]--Desert Shield--yeah, Desert Storm; (unclear) the first one was Desert Storm (laughter)--okay.  And I became news director, and that's when I was able to work against my old station [WABC-TV in New York City, New York]; that was a tough part because there were a lotta people over there who, to this day, I love.  It was a--you know, but it's all business.  And that's where I earned my two Emmys--best newscast.  We did some good work, they had a lotta resources, good company at the--you know, at the time, and it was--that was another tough job just because I'd never run a news department before.  And so now you're into ratings and all of that, and this is a number two station versus the number one stations that I'd been workin' at, so now you get into ratings and things like that.
Story_ID: 55449
Speaker 1: I think I asked--well, we talked during the break about you explaining what sweeps are--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what your New York [WABC-TV in New York City, New York] general manager was adept at dealing with--
Speaker 2: The news director there, yeah.  Sweeps--basically it's a period of time--usually February, May, November, sometimes July depending on the market, where advertisers--where rates are set.  You put on your best fare, at least that was the strategy then; you put your best stuff on in the sweeps period to entice more people because those are the months, if the ratings are good--you know, the higher the rating, the more money you get from advertisers.  So those are the months that the advertisers recognize, and the advertising agencies, so you want to get your best demographics and best ratings in those months.  So you put on--your best foot forward--extra special programs and things like that.  So--and a lot of it is, is, is--well, all of it is strategic because it could--the difference between a tenth of a rating point could make the difference between you being number one and number two or number three in highly competitive markets, and so the placement of those stories are very, very important, you know.  Many times, if you put it at the top, you've highly promoted this big story you have and you put it at the top of your news cast.  Well, soon as your--soon as those viewers see that, they're gonna flip over to some other channel; if you're not their favorite station, they'll flip over, and you lose those ratings, you lose those--that audience.  So the strategies were replacement, depending on the quarter hour; maybe you put it in at 15, maybe it's a four-minute piece--15 to 19.  It's--you got credit for increments of time that people watched, so sometimes they would put things at the bottom.  I remember the last day of sweeps; now this was a very unethical thing that happened at a station in the market.  This was, I think, when ER [American medical drama. The series ran from 2004-2009] was hot--really hot.
Speaker 1: The TV show?
Speaker 2: The TV show.  And there was some bit actor nobody even knew; only had a part for maybe two episodes, but really bit--nobody would even know.  The station came on to say, "ER star dies--details at 11."  Now they said this promoted all during prime time.  They didn't tell viewers until the end of the show--of that newscast who the actor was.  Guess what?  They won the book with a kinda unethical kinda act there, but I'm sure it hurt them at some point because if you do that enough, people won't believe you, and it hurts you in the long run.  But there are people who sometimes do that; I think it's very unethical but, you know, that's how competitive it is, that's how critical--jobs depend a lotta times on--many times, on ratings and revenue and all of that, so people will do a lotta things that they probably shouldn't do.
Story_ID: 55450
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Do you think that sweeps affect the quality of the news a consumer gets at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I think sweeps can improve the quality because you have some really good--you have some pretty interesting things, especially investigative and consumer things, so I don't think it hurts; I think it helps more than hurts.
Speaker 1: So it does make it fluffier--it makes it more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: It can make it more substantive, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it can; that's right.  Now, sometimes a--high interest stories, it could be; it could be entertainment, it could be fluff, but the bottom line is what do your viewers want, okay?  And you got research that tells you what your viewers want, okay?  So if you do a good mix of what your viewers want and need, you stay in business and you don't have to lay off people.  Now that's my view.  So you gotta, you know, you gotta kinda weigh that; you give it too much fluff, you're gonna lose a big core audience.  If you don't give enough fluff, you're gonna lose a core audience.  So you've gotta, you know, you really have to find the right balance there; that's why you see news cast hard, and then come the fluffy stuff later, or the gossipy stuff, or consumer--you know, I had one news director who would push viewer benefit--let's push viewer bene--what can the viewers get out of this?  And I think that's a very good strategy; it's a strategy that's used in many stations.  So, if you can, you know, give enough of that mix, that's very important.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's certain, I guess, bywords in the industry like--I don't know how many "7 on your sides" there are. If you're on Channel 7, it's always "7 on your side", you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(Laughter)--Yes, that's right, that's right.  Yep, that's the advocacy--we're lookin' out for you--yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: There's also the aspect of fear, I know, the major television stations in towns have been criticized for, you know, promoting fear of everything--germs, weather, you know, fabrics, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--'You don't wanna miss this report; your ear is gonna fall off and you don't even know what's gonna'--I mean, yeah.  It's--yes, there is--yeah, fear factor can sell as well.  And of course people like me wouldn't couch it like that but this is more of a consumer health; we're-lookin'-out-for-you kinda thing.  But it's--yeah, fear works sometimes--yes.
Speaker 1: The sweeps are, you know, real competitive time--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and a lot of the rules get bent maybe sometimes and, you know, all the stops are pulled out.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean they pull out the stops; you put a lotta resources--some people work weeks and months on things for just sweeps, and everybody does it.  Now--now that you have people-meters where you can get those demographics and things every day, many stations have gone to year-round sweeps, okay, because, you know, some advertisers buy--many advertisers just buy--"Well, what are the cara(?)-numbers (ph.) looking like?  They're not tied to just the sweeps, so you--depends on the market, depends on the station, the philosophy and all of that, and your sales department and all of that, so you got--we--I know instantly now, you know, who were the people watched my show last night.  Are they 25 to 54?  Are they 18 to 49?  Are they men?  Are they women?  Are they black?  Are they white?  I mean you got all of that kinda information now, instantly.
Story_ID: 55451
Speaker 1: One of the problems--I know there are problems with all--with any survey; I know the old AC Nielsen Survey [named after the marketing research company's founder, Arthur C. Nielsen, Sr.] was actually a survey sheet they would send to you and you would fill that out based on what you were watching--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, I wasn't always reliable 'cause it's human; sometimes the TV is on, nobody's watching it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, different things like that; or the person who's supposed to sign in the household, to fill out the paper, forgets.
Speaker 2: Yes, it used to drive us crazy because we would go down to--I think it was (unclear), Florida--Florida were the Nielsen books are, and we would look and see the books that people sent in.  The station with the strongest brand would benefit most from those diaries, okay, because people, a lotta times, aren't diligent in filling it out every day, and so they can't remember what they watched two or three days ago many times, so they'll just go to their favorite station and they'll just go (DEMONSTRATION)--put a line through--they were watchin' all this time, when we know that's not true; that's why a lotta the major stations, the front-runners, didn't want the people meters [Nielsen people meters measure which shows and what times people are watching TV] to come in because the people-meters tell you exactly--can't do that anymore; they count you real time, and so you can't, you can't cheat those as much, I'll put it like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think there are the--I was in a household where they had the people meter and sometimes the TV was on and nobody was watching (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --which is often true, you know.
Speaker 2: that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: But somebody did choose that at one point, or maybe not, because the programs changed--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --even though the--
Speaker 2: But, you know, that's the other thing; I mean they continue to refine these--you know, those things; even radios now, they can--I mean your phone, you know, they're experimenting with that--you got phones, you know.  Phones always--got some kinda signal, so the radio people can use that to record.  Okay, well--it's listening, like SoundHound [mobile phone app that identifies music] and other listening programs on the phone?  You install that thing on your phone and they know what you're listenin' to say on radio, so the technology is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I mean without your permission? I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no, no, you have to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--If you're listening to the radio on your phone, they can monitor what you're listening to.
Speaker 2: Well, program on your phone--no, you have to give 'em permission because they have to put a special software on there, but they continue to improve that.  Now problems with it in the past have been they have low participation from the affluent community 'cause they don't wanna take the time to do it; you have always high participation from the older community--seniors, okay?  You can count on 'em; you can count on them filling out the diaries and things like that.  It's tough with men, and in ethnic--in some communities, in order to get people to participate, they pay you--pay you a few bucks here; you fill this out, it's $5.00, $10.00, $30.00, whatever the case is.  So it's always been a struggle, but Nielsen is really the only game in town; others have tried, and you know, it's--they--they're the only game.
Story_ID: 55452
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], you won two Emmys [for best news report]--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --at WCAU--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what were the stories about?
Speaker 2: Well it was the entire news cast.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a collection of content over a period of time, and they liked the mix of content that we had--well, produced and content.  So we beat out everybody in the market, in the Tri-State area [New York, New Jersey, Connecticut], and I was very proud of that.
Speaker 1: It says here you have 45 Mid-Atlantic Emmy Award nominations.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well--you know--now those weren't just me, okay?
Speaker 1: Okay; those for the station.
Speaker 2: Those are for the station, and different reporters could enter their own categories as well, okay?  I entered as a news director; this is my collective body and this is what I put my hands on, blah, blah, blah.  And individual reporters, they may have a Emmy nomination or win for best writing or something like that, so they could do that.
Story_ID: 55453
Speaker 1: We had a fantastic investigative unit--consumer investigative unit--and speaking of that, some of the things you don't hear that go on behind the scenes, in dealing with the sales department--this is when I really learned about sales and news relationship.  Now remember, the salespeople, they go out and they get the money so you can keep the lights on; the news department produces content so that they can sell it, that type of thing.  Well, when I first arrived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that second time, there were some big car dealers that were really pissed off at the station [WCAU-TV].  Now keep in mind, probably at that time, 40 percent of the revenue might have come from car dealers. So the car dealers, some of the car dealers, said they would never buy time on the station again because they didn't like a report that the consumer investigator did.  Now this goes on; you're not gonna hear a lot about this.  People don't--people kinda hush, hush; they won't say a lot.  Well, I'm like--I wanna uncover all wrongdoing whether, you know, whether it's people doing unnecessary repairs, blah, blah, blah, whatever--that kinda thing.  Well, we were banned from having this reporter do those type of stories at the major car dealers.  The choice--you have two choices; you eat or you don't eat if you're gonna work there.  You work there or you don't work there--very clear.  We were banned from doing that.  Now, I'd argued a good fight and all of that, and the argument from the other side is that, well, you know, you wanna keep other people employed, blah, blah, blah.  Now, this goes on in every station; nobody will admit it.  They're just not gonna admit it.  But you will notice that you're not generally going to see many stories on a station going in uncovering repairs, you know--unneeded repairs and things like that, anti-car dealership story unless--two reasons you'll see it; if the state agency or federal agency comes in and says, "We're investigating you for whatever."  You're gonna see it then, okay?
Speaker 2: But none initiated by the station?
Speaker 1: But they're not gonna be--usually, they're not gonna be initiated by the station, okay?  And it's a kind of an unspoken thing, and people will deny it; they'll deny it because that speaks right at that whole credibility issue--wait a minute now.  But what you will do is you may see some of the smaller mom and pop stories, but not the huge people who advertise a lot of money on the station; you'll occasionally see that, but most of the time it's because the state or the feds have come in and they're doing some kind of investigation, okay?
Speaker 2: So if you're a bad plumber, it's okay to get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well, bad plumber--they're gonna be all--you're gonna get them.  But a big plumbing agency, you'll get them too, but I'm talking about car dealerships.
Speaker 2: Car dealerships.
Speaker 1: Forty percent of your revenue; and they have associations and all of that.  So you have to be smart about how you do those stories.  If the feds or the state get involved, hey, no problem. You initiate and try to do your sting and all that--at the big places, you are playing with a lot of fire, and it's unfortunate.
Speaker 2: Is there pressure from government?  I mean, for instance, city government, around things like police brutality and other things.  Are they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, they don't advertise, so that does--that has no impact--just I'm talking about this one category, and that's automobiles, okay?
Speaker 2: Okay, cars; alright.
Speaker 1: That's the category 'cause it's--many times, a life blood of a television station, of a newspaper, okay; but especially TV--40 percent, up to 40 percent of your revenue.  They shut down, you lay off, you lose jobs.  It's, it's real tough.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The car dealerships is something like a common denominator across the board that people--
Speaker 1: Pretty much so, but stations have tried to kinda get away from being so dependent on car dealership--car dealer advertising.  They're trying to diversify their portfolio more so they won't have those type of pressures; but that was my first taste of that in the industry, and I thought that was just awful.  So, you know, you find other ways to do it and to get the story to help consumers.
Story_ID: 55454
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did you have like, I guess, a production philosophy of your own?  And I wonder about, you know--also, about WCAU [TV news station in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and they had--they seemed to, you know, really garner, you know, a lot of Emmy nominations.  If they would do anything production-wise, it was different or radically innovative from what the other stations were doing.
Speaker 2: I think what we brought to the table there that shows certainly some progress in the ratings; it was all--all evolved around viewer benefit pieces, lot of consumer--we had very strong consumer units.  Also pacing--I took the pacing from the number one station in town [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], Action News; I mean they would--it (HITTING SOUND)--moved; they moved, and I was part of that for years, and--so we mixed that in with viewer benefit, consumer and investigative, played up some of the personalities, and I think that's why--one reason why we were able to improve in the ratings in Philadelphia at the CBS station.  Now, we never did; we didn't come close to taking over the number one station 'cause a lot of times people--people are wedded to those brands, and it takes a lot to take people away.
Story_ID: 55455
Speaker 1: Action News rarely made a mistake.  I can remember one mistake they made, and that was years before when I was there; management decided that they were not going to put a hidden camera to--trained on what they call the Move compound [residence of the Move Organization, a black liberation group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  MOVE was a group that was--they called 'em a radical group, but they stayed to themselves in this house and the police wanted to flush them out of this house, this apartment (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I think there were complaints from neighbors about smell, people walking around naked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's right; all kinda things; yes, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and then obscenities over a loud-speaker system (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's right; you got it, you got it.  And so they ended up dropping what the city officials called at the time, an incendiary device on top of it and burned down dozens and dozens of homes.  The station--the CBS station put a camera, trained it on that compound, had it there all the time; they were the only ones who got that--that video and a lot more where our station when--at--at the time, was a lot more cautious and didn't wanna incite any type of riot or anything like that over there, and they stayed away.  And in hindsight, that was not a good move because it was temporary; but for a few weeks, the viewers went to the station that had the video exclusively.
Speaker 2: This is 1984 [sic, 1985] or so?
Speaker 1: Around that time.  And so--but it was--that was one of the few times--I think that was a mistake on the number one station's part at the time.  It was--it just was.  I mean I know why they did it, but it was a--it was a mistake.
