I have one aunt in Huntsville who is in her, close, very close to a hundred.  She's in her nineties.  I think, about ninety-seven, ninety-eight.  And, she's the one relative on my father's side of the family that I remain in touch with and am close to, visit, and that type of thing.  But, I didn't grow up with, with my father around.  So, I don't know very much about him and his family.
Speaker 1: What is your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: Georgia Morgan.
Speaker 1: 'Kay.
Story_ID: 116113
Speaker 1: All right.  So, let's talk about your, your mother.  Do you, can you tell me your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was Jenny Richardson when she was growing up.  And, then when she married, she became Jenny Horton.  And, then when she re-married, she became Jenny Campbell.  And, that's her name she goes by now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me about your, your grandmother, on your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My grandmother is Euphima Richardson.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that please?
Speaker 2: That's E-U-P-H-I-M-A, and her maiden name was Euphima Davis.  And, then when married, she became Euphima Richardson.  She was from Jamaica and I remember my grandmother, we--when I was growing up, we all lived in one household in Mount Vernon, New York, was my grandparents' house.  And, when my mother married and she moved to Brooklyn [New York], and then when her marriage didn't work out, and I was about two or so, she moved back to Mount Vernon.  So, all my life, all my young years growing up, I grew up in the house with my grandparents, my mother, grandmother and my grandfather around, my mother, and my sister.  And, and I have a--I had an aunt and uncle who lived on the third floor of this very large house.  So, on the main floor, my grandparents, my mother, my sister and I lived on the main floor.  Second floor of the house, my grandmother rented out to roomers, boarders.  And, then on the third floor of the house was a separate apartment.  And, that's where my aunt and uncle and my cousin lived.  And, so, I always remember, my grandmother's as a person that would--who was very strong-willed.  She ran that house and took care of those interesting collection of people who were kind of coming and going, who would rent rooms in the house.  And, she had another property in Mount Vernon that she also ran, that we refer to as 33.  Because the address was 33, I think, Union Lane.  And, sometimes we would accompany her to that house when she had to collect rent, or clean the place, or do whatever.  And, we would kinda go along, tag along with my grandmother and go shopping with her.  But, she was, she was a woman of, at least to me as a child, kind of few words.  But, handled her business, took care of--I grew up in a house with a lot of strong women who took care of running the house, taking care of things, making decisions and, and, so, that kind of rubbed off on me.  I became someone who could make a lot of decisions pretty quickly, was very confident.  In a way, it was a strong point.  But, in a way, probably it was a--I became very, very headstrong and determined about how I wanted to do things.
Speaker 1: What--Tell me how--do you know how your grandmother acquired the property that she owned?
Speaker 2: I--not, not in a lot of details.  My grandfather was a carpenter.  And, my grandmother did sewing.  She did some domestic work.  So, the two of them, you know, my--they--both my grandparents were from the West Indies, were from Jamaica.  And, they were those hardworking Jamaican folks who, you know, did what they had to do.  And, so, I think, part of the time, she was working as a domestic and part-time she was doing these other things, saved her money.  She had--my grandmother and my grandfather had one daughter and three sons.  And, so, you know, in addition to taking care of their, their children, they were also saving their money and they bought these properties.  And, you know, we lived in and she, you know, had income coming from her boarders as well.
Story_ID: 116114
Speaker 1: Tell me about, it--was it any other stories about your grandmother [Euphima Richardson]?
Speaker 2: You know, there were just, there would be-- living in a house where you have people who rented out rooms, there were always these very colorful situations where, you know, somebody had to be put out, or somebody, you know, was, you know, came to ring the doorbell and it was Friday.  And, that's when they would--and, you know.  I just remember my grandmother going to the door and, so and so's here, and that's the day they were supposed to pay the rent, and they weren't.  And, I, you know, I just remember at different times, you know, my mother would have, my grandmother would have to deal with, with someone who, she put them out.  And, once--one story I always remember was some boarder had left the house and my mot--my grandmother and I went up to the room to clean it.  She was cleaning and I was just kind of accompanying her, and we, you know, it's this really strange smell and she couldn't figure out for, you know, we were searching the room, searching room, it was a strange smell.  And, the boarder, who I guess must have left under unhappy circumstances, had left a fish wrapped in a newspaper and a jar of urine in the back of a closet and that's what was smelling up the room.  So, there was always some interesting, you know, someone who I guess, must've had some type of mental health problem at the time.  One raining day was out in the yard praying in the rain and, you know, naked.  That type of, you know, you had situations that periodically would occur like that.  But, then there were also boarders who lived there for a very long time.  A woman who had a couple of children and generally my grandmother kinda didn't want to rent to chil--to people who had children.  But, who lived there for a couple of years, and, you know, was a, was, you know, just someone who was very steady with paying their rent and taking care of their family.  And, so, so, it was, it was very interesting, you know.  We always had some interesting little situations occurring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, it was very close, it was a close family being with my mother and being with my uncle [Prentice Richardson], and my aunt [Ernestine Richardson], and my cousin [Douglas Richardson] and everybody kind of being under, under one roof.
Story_ID: 116115
Speaker 1: What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was William Richardson.
Speaker 1: And, tell me about, about him.
Speaker 2: Again, as a child, you know, especially, especially at that time in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], you know, I don't remember having like a lot of conversations with my grandfather.  But, I do remember him as being, at least to me, again, like if, I'm saying both of my grandmother [Euphima Richardson], my grandfather were kinda quiet people, at least me.  My mother [Jenny Campbell] might say differently.  But, you know, he would take us to on, you know, hot summer days, he'd take us to the store for ice cream.  I remember, he apparently had a sweet tooth, he always kept these little bags, with little sweets on his dresser, that type of thing.  But, I don't, you know, I know he was someone who worked with his hands a lot, did a lot of carpentry and yard work and that type of thing, painting, and repair work and so forth.  But, you know, it's kinda one of those--I spent all those years growing up but, I can't really, I can't tell you any, like, really great memorable conversations.  But, it was one of those, we always felt very secure, warm, loved, taken care of in, in my home and in that family growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me the name of your aunt and uncle who lived there, also.
Speaker 2: My uncle who lived in the house was Prentice Richardson, and his aunt--my aunt was Aunt Ernestine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then their son is Douglas Richardson, who still lives in Mount Vernon [New York].
Story_ID: 116116
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell me about your mother.  What, was--yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  My mother.
Speaker 1: Tell me.  Tell me all about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Jenny Horton, Jenny Campbell today, was a single mom who--she worked for the telephone company.  And, the things, myself and my sister, I know have both have gotten from her was about speaking properly and proper diction in answering the phone.  And, you know, just having these certain skills and manners about how you deliver, you know, yourself and presented yourself on the phone.  My mother was somebody who--we lived in Mount Vernon [New York], but maybe once or twice a month, we'd get on the train and she'd take us to New York [City].  And, growing up, I do believe I have been to every museum in New York City, many, many times.  To the point where I could probably close my eyes and tell you, if you turn this corner and take a right, you'll find this there.  But, my mother was very big on exposing us to a lot of culture.  And, so, even though she was a single mother and, you know, probably--thinking back now, it's like, well, you know, she was living in her parents' home and so forth.  She had these two daughters, you know, she had one job.  She wasn't receiving any income from my father once they divorced.  She would take us and we'd spend--we'd get on the train, we'd ride in New York, we'd go to museum, walk around the museum all day.  I thought it was a very big deal to go to Chock Full o'Nuts for lunch, to get a cheeseburger (laughter), a brownie, and an orange, I remember that, an orange juice.  And, that was like a big lunch, you know, 'cause we were going out.  But, I just remember the excitement of when she would tell us on Saturday, "Oh, tomorrow we're going to New York."  And, I was like, "We're going to the city."  And, she would take us to art museums, and architecture museums, and, you know, every type of--Radio City Music Hall.  We loved going into Radio City Music Hall and see the Christmas pageant or a certain show.  And, although I didn't realize it at the time, it gave me such an exposure.  I have such a love for art.  When I started doing public relations, I ended up doing a lot of PR work for artists.  And, I have a really soft spot in my heart for artists.  And, I think, it's all because of my mother's exposed us to so much culture when we were growing up.  But, you know, we just, we would go everywhere in New York.  We do the Circle Line Tours, and you know, we kind of go into New York City and we'd be a tourist.  And, thinking back, you know, I realize that, she didn't spend a lot of money.  But, at the time, it probably was a significant little portion of her, of the money that she brought in.  But, she found every opportunity to expose us to things.  And, we just, we just really, my sister, my mother and I would just go out and just have a really good time.  And, the three of us are still very close to this day.
Speaker 1: How much education did your mom have?
Speaker 2: My mother completed high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: January 15th, same day the birth as [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and I believe that's 1926.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories, you'd like to share about your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  One of the, one of the stories that, that was, there were some, you know, growing up, there so many that you can kind of think of.  But, I grew up in a family of women who sewed.  Everybody in my family sewed.  My mother sewed.  She used to teach me tailoring.  And, so, my sister and I, you know, if we were going out to anything, my mother, when we were children, made all our clothes, from the coat with the lining of the coats were as pretty as the clothes themselves.  And, we grew up sowing and making everything.  But, my mother did a little bit of traveling when I was young.  She went to Bermuda one time and she went to Jamaica.  She and her sister went to Jamaica--
Story_ID: 116117
Speaker 1: And, I just remember, just being so enthralled about the idea of traveling.  And, I was a young child, I, you know, didn't travel any place far.  I think New Jersey, was about as far as I (laughter), I ever went.  But, I alw--I dreamed of, "I can't, I can't wait 'til one day when I get to travel."  And, so, when I was in college, when I went to college, I didn't go to college right straight from high school.  I didn't know what I wanted to do.  And, I went into New York City and I'd take secretarial skills.  And, so, I went to New York City to work as a secretary.  And, then when I realized that, you know, that that wasn't going to work for me and that wasn't gonna cut it.  I decided to go to college.  And, I had saved up a little bit of money.  And, at the time, I was dating a guy who was from Africa.  And, so, I decided that I was gonna go to Africa.  And, of course, you know, I'm at school and, and this all came out of a conversation.  My roommate was also dating a guy who was from Africa.  They were from the same country, the Gambia.  And, one day in my dorm room, he made mention of the fact that a couple year ago when he went home, he had taken an American student with him and she had a great time.  And, on a lark, I just kind of, we were just kind of talking and I said, "I would love to go to Africa."  And, he says, "When you wanna go, you let me know.  You can come and stay with my family."  And, in my mind, he was like, when he said it, it was like, you know, people invite you to come and stay at their house, but a lot of times they really don't, and they don't ever mean for you to come.  And, so, I just, I just said, "Well, supposed I wanted to go this year?"  And, he got all excited.  I mean, you can just tell from--he was beaming.  He was like, "Really?"  And, and this shows you how long ago it was.  He said, he says, "If you're serious, I'll send a telegram (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And, you can stay with my cousin and you can--he was getting all excited and I can tell, he really meant it.  And, I was like, "Well, how much would it cost?"  And, again, this shows the time--how long ago it was.  And, I--it was about $700 dollars for the airfare, so.  And, I thought, we'll, you know, I've worked, I've got that.  And, he says, "You wouldn't have to have to pay anything else."  And, so, then I decided, I was gonna go.  And, of course, you know, I'm making all these plans and I'm up at co--I'm up at school and I have to at some point tell my mother [Jenny Campbell] about this, you know.  And, I'm thinking, she's not gonna go for this.  So, what I did was, Thanksgiving when I went home, I made these plans to go to Africa at Christmastime.  When I went home at Thanksgiving, I went and applied for my passport, put in my paperwork for my Visa, all the things I needed to do.  And, my mother and I was in the kitchen wa--kitchen washing dishes one night.  And, I just decided, this is the time.  I gotta tell her.  And, I just knew it was gonna be a really big fight.  She was gonna just really--I got up the courage and I said, "Mom, remember, remember I told you I might be trying to go someplace, travel during Christmas break?"  She said, "Yeah."  And, I said, and then I just launched into this very fast, "I'm planning to go to Africa.  You're not gonna have to pay a dime.  I've saved the money.  I'm gonna be staying with Lye [ph.], he's the friend of Maul [ph.].  I know you don't know him.  But, he's a nice person.  I want--I'm really staying with his cousin."  She, da da da da, and I kind of ran it all down.  And, I just knew my mother was gonna hit the roof and it was gonna be a big, you know, blow up, and I was gonna have to really convince her.  And, she just looked at me, and she walked over to a calendar on the wall and she said, "Now, what day are you leaving?"  And, I was, I mean, I was so shocked, I was, I was, you know, but, I've got more argument to make.  And, she just, she circled the day--the day after Christmas and she circled it.  And, says, "And, when will you be coming back?"  And, she circled it.  And, I was, I was just shocked and it almost was like, don't you really care about me?  And, but, years later, you know, I asked her about it, I said, "How--you know, what made you decided to--you didn't argue with me."  And, she says, "I thought it was a great opportunity.  I figured I raised you the right way all these years.  You were mature enough to know what you were doing and I didn't have a problem with it."  But, she told me my grandmother really did have a problem.  My grandmother [Euphima Richardson] gave her a really hard time about her allowing me to go.  So, that was the first time I had travelled internationally.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And, had a really great experience.
Story_ID: 116118
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  We're gonna now begin to talk about you as a young child.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: First childhood memory.  Wow, that's a tough question.  I guess, it would have to be something related to playing with my sister [Donna Satchel].  My sister's only two years older than I, and, you know, when we were growing up, we were just--we did everything together, you know.  Playing dolls and playing games, and doing all these things.  So, it would have to be something involving she and I playing together, you know, in that house in Mount Vernon [New York].
Story_ID: 116119
Speaker 1: 'Kay.  Can you remember a story about the things that you [Gay and her sister, Donna Satchel] used to do together?
Speaker 2: Oh, God (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I mean, we were big on playing, playing board games and playing dolls.  We use to play this one game in the summertime where we had a fan, a floor, a fan that sat on the floor and was kind of, was round.  And, we'd play this game where we take little pieces of paper.  And, we'd stick through the--into the thing and it was like we were, it was like ticketing, we were ticketing ourselves to go someplace, to travel someplace.  So, I think we both had this kind of wander lust to, to be off and traveling.  But, we just had a lot of, you know, from the times of playing with dolls to, to going to parties, to going in Mount Vernon [New York], going to fabric stores and buying fabrics to make a dress to wear to a party that night, or that type of thing.  You know, we were, we were, I was also tagging behind her, I guess would be the right, the best way to described it.
Speaker 1: Now, what is your sister's name?
Speaker 2: My sister is Donna Satchel.  She was Donna Horton and her, her name now is Donna Satchel.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, you said she's two years older than you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116120
Speaker 1: Was there anything special about holidays at your home?
Speaker 2: Holidays were always a time where everybody came, came together.  I had an aunt and an uncle who lived in Jamaica, New York.  And, they would come in for--and every Christmas, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July barbeques, family summer barbeques and all like that.  And, my uncle had another uncle, Uncle Willie, who lived in Mount Vernon [New York] and cousins and everybody would come to my grandmother [Euphima Richardson] and grandfather's [William Richardson] house.  You know, they were the, the patriarchs of the family.  And, they would all, everybody would come there and we're have backyard barbeques, you know, where you had the stone fireplace and you'd cook the meat outside.  And, set the tables out.  And, I just remember all the preparation.  There was always a lot of preparation.  And, my grandmother's thing, we had to eat at 2:00 o'clock.  And, just certain traditions that--
Speaker 1: Why would we have to--why did you have to eat at 2:00 o'clock?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It was like a Sunday thing.  I was like, you know, if everybody wasn't there at 2:00 o'clock, she was getting nervous.  And, we kind of joke today about, my gosh, we're eating at 4:00 o'clock, we're eating at this different time.  GoGo, we called my grandmother GoGo, because my sister couldn't say grandma.  And, it came out GoGo.  So, for all my--I didn't even realize GoGo was a strange kind of name for a grandmother until somebody kind of--I went to college or somewhere, and it was like, people we asking.  But, as I would go to college and I'd meet people and I'd bring 'em home, I would in--this is my grandmother GoGo.  And, then they call her GoGo, so, we called them Papa and GoGo.  But, you know, that was just her thing, you had to eat at 2:00 o'clock, so, you know.  But, yeah, just a lot of latritions [ph.], a lot of food, a lot of preparation, and the family all being there on the holidays.
Story_ID: 116121
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community that you lived in.  What, what street?  Can you remember the street name?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.  I lived at 123 South First Avenue in Mount Vernon, New York.  It was one bock, block before the library.  And, it was between 3rd Street, which at the time in the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s], I guess, more of the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s].  It was a street that had a lot of people kind of hanging around, hanging out and a lot of liquor stores and that type of thing.  And, it ran, kind of front one end of town all the way down to the other.  And, the bus line would run along there.  And, then the street we lived on was a residential street.  It was a very diverse neighborhood, you know.  Some of our neighbors were white.  Some of them were from Jamaica.  Some of them were, were from, you know, the USA.  Folks behind us, the way the homes were in Mount Vernon is, you know, your backyard, you have the chain link fence and then the other person's backyard.  So, you became friendly with your neighbors across the way.  They were Italians who lived behind us.  And, up the street there was, one of my, my friends from growing up, I think her mother was Asian and the father was African American.  And, like one of my sister's girlfriends up the block, who lived in the apartment building was, you know, white girl.  And, and it was just pretty, pretty diverse.  But, Mount Vernon itself at the time when I was growing up, you had a lot of, I guess, Puerto Ricans and Jamaicans and Italians and Portuguese.  So, it was, it was pretty diverse.  You know, we had, at the time when I was in high school, there was one high school.  So, at some point even though you might have gone to different elementary schools, I think there were maybe a couple of middle schools, and then when you hit high school, everybody was in the same high school.  And, I just remember having, especially in my younger years, having a lot of friends that were just, you know, they were just people who you knew and they were friends.  And, now you think back, and it's like, boy for the time, that was really very interesting that it was such a diverse community.
Story_ID: 116122
Speaker 1: Tell me what sounds, smells, and sights, you can remember from growing up.
Speaker 2: Sounds, sounds, I remember on summer nights, we would always, in our house, in the summertime, we would turn the bed a different direction.  Again, that's one of those things now, I think back, it's like, I don't know why we did that.  But, I can remember we'd pull the rugs and our beds, my sister and I had twin beds in our room.  And, they'd face a certain way in the wintertime and we'd turn them facing--I think maybe it was to have them facing more towards the window so that you would open the window and get that cool breeze.  'Cause that was back before, that was at the time when you had one air conditioning unit which was in the living room.  And, you know, I guess, to get some ventilation, you know, going.  But, I just remember the sounds of hearing, you know, different insects and different things at night, you know.  You kind of hear them.  And, let's see, smells.  Probably just my, my grandmother [Euphima Richardson] and my mother [Jenny Campbell] did a lot of cooking and just all of, all the foods they cooked and just kind of smelling knowing dinner was ready.  And, you know, I think, on certain days of the week, maybe on a Wednesday every couple weeks, my uncle would come down and everybody would all eat at a big table.  And, have--and the Sunday dinners, we had big Sunday dinners, so, you know, homemade foods that were prepared and cooked.  That was, was certainly a smell.  And, what was the other one?
Speaker 1: Sights.
Speaker 2: Sights.  I remember, oh, a sight that comes immediately to mind was, I don't know if it was the, I think it was Memorial Day, the parade in Mount Vernon [New York] would pass by our block.  And, I remember sometimes occasion, I guess when I forgot or what the time parade started, hearing the bands coming down the street and thinking, Oh, I gotta get outside the parade's coming, you know.  But, it would pass right in front of the house.  So, I just--and, you know, your friends are playing in the band, and that's one of the immediate sights that I, I can think of.
Story_ID: 116123
Speaker 1: Do you have any other memories of that time right before you, you start to go to school?
Speaker 2: Right before?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Before going to school.  No, I remember I just--accompanying my, my grandmother [Euphima Richardson] to the A&P, which is, which was I guess was two blocks from the house and, my sister [Donna Satchel] and I when we would go with her to the store.  I grew up in a house where we didn't have a car until probably I was maybe about ten or twelve years old.  And, so, you know, we would walk all over the place.  And, 'til this day, I still love to walk everywhere I go.  But, we would accompany my grandmother.  She'd take--she had one of those metal carts that folded down, the folding grocery cart with the wheels.  And, we'd walk down to the A&P and then you'd buy your, I think it could accommodate four bags of groceries.  And, you'd buy your groceries and you'd stack 'em up in a bag.  And, then my sister and I would have to pull it the two blocks back to the house, that type of thing.  And, that's something I kind of clearly remember, you know.  It was a slight--it was a hill heading back up to the house.  Yeah, I remember that.  But, just, just Mount Vernon [New York] to me was a great place to grow up.  We could walk to the shopping, main shopping area, 4th Avenue, was only about four or five blocks from the house.  And, so, we walked to all our schools, you know, growing up, my sister and I, we would walk to school.  And, you know, when I started working in New York, I would catch the bus or either walk to, to 41st Street sometimes when I was really didn't feel like waiting for the bus.  Or, else, catch a bus to 41st Street and then catch the subway down to New York City.  I worked in New York City a couple years as a secretary.

Speaker 1: Tell me the name of your elementary school.
Speaker 2: I went to Robert Fulton Elementary School.  And, I went to George Washington Middle School.  And, actually, it was called George Washington Junior High.  And, I went to Mount Vernon High School [Mount Vernon, New York].
Speaker 1: So, tell me about elementary school.  Were there any--well, tell me the makeup of the school.  You said, that since it was a diverse community, you really all came together in high school.  What was the makeup of the school when you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: From what I can remember, like I remember, I remember going to kindergarten and (laughter), and I remember I think, I remember the first day of kindergarten because I have this very clear picture of this one boy who, I can almost remember his name.  It's kind of fleeting, it's Angelo, his first name was Angelo, and I guess he was very frighten about being in kindergarten, and he ended up running out of, out of the classroom, running out of the school.  And, I guess, maybe running home.  And, I just remember that whole, like, the teacher was kind of upset and trying to, now come calm down, and he just, he ran out of there.  But, I remember that there were black and white students in my kindergarten class.  And, you know, we were all just kinda kids going to school together.  And, and, down through the years some of these people who I remember from kindergarten and first grade, I remember later on in school in junior high and high school.
Speaker 1: Did you walk to school or take the bus?
Speaker 2: Walked to school.  I think I pretty much walked to all of my schools except for high school.  There was one high school and that was a little far and then I would take the bus to go to high school.
Speaker 1: Who were you teachers?  Do you have a favorite teacher that you can remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, when--in junior high, the one teacher who stands out in my mind, I had, I had several teachers down through the years where I just remember I had a home economics teacher, Mrs.--
Speaker 1: No.  In elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, in elementary school?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: There was Miss Shelton and I can't remember if she was my kindergarten or my first grade teacher.  I just remember having a very strong impression of her.
Story_ID: 116125
Speaker 1: We were talking about your elementary teacher.  Tell me about your elementary school teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The one teacher I can remember from elementary school [Robert Fulton Elementary School, Mount Vernon, New York] was a Miss Shelton.  And, I can't remember if she was my first grade or kindergarten teacher.  But, I just remember her as a very warm, kind of motherly, you know.  At that time, kindergarten was a lot of play and interaction and it just gave me--I liked kindergarten, and I liked first grade.  I liked the start of school.  I had a very positive experience and so, I guess, that kind of set me up for enjoying elementary school, you know, through, throughout the times there.
Speaker 1: Were your teachers black and white?  Or, were they just white, or?
Speaker 2: From what I can recall, the teachers that I have who come to mind, they were white.  I don't recall having any black teachers when I was in elementary school.  None are sticking in my mind.  I remember African American teachers when I hit junior high.  But, I'm not recalling any.  Not saying there weren't any in the school.  But, the one's that I had and the one that I can remember, I remember several white teachers that I had.
Story_ID: 116126
Speaker 1: And, did you have any special interests while you were in elementary school [Robert Fulton Elementary School, Mount Vernon, New York]?
Speaker 2: When--in elementary school that sticks out in my mind was, I played the violin for several years.  And, at some point, I composed a piece for the violin, and was allowed to play it in the assembly.  That kind of--that, that was one of the kind of shining moments for me during the, that period of time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the piece was like?
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause some, something, I remember, I remember when I was composing it, but to this day, I couldn't, couldn't tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, do you still enjoy the violin?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do.  I do.  I think, between having played a string instrument, which I don't think I was ever any, particularly good at it.  But, it was a difficult instrument to play to, you know, to play well, to really make it sound the way you really wanted it to sound.  And, to this day, I love to hear, you know, Noel Pointer, Ken Ford, you know.  I love to hear a violin being played, being played well, and I have a great appreciation for, for musicians.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was, I was a good student.  I always received good grades.  I believe, I was fairly well self-motivated.  I don't recall my mother having to kind of get behind me a lot to, for me to get my work done.  Getting good grades mattered a lot to me and I wanted to please my mother [Jenny Campbell].  So, I pretty much always received pretty good grades. I remember in junior high, I received some type of citizenship award and always remember basically having good grades.
Speaker 1: Were there any other activities in elementary school?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't recall being involved in, I wasn't involved in too many clubs or anything like that, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116127
Speaker 1: So, now, 1966 you're going on to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, again, the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: Washington Junior High [School, Mount Vernon, New York].
Speaker 1: High school.  Okay.  Tell me about your day, your days there.
Speaker 2: At Washington Junior High, what, what I recall was, I was one of the officers of my junior high school class.  It was a type of thing where you had to run.  I was the vice president of the student class of--and, you had to actually run for the position.  And, so, you have to make campaign posters and you had to--I remember, I had green and white, some type of little, a stick of gum on it, you know, that I would hand out.  Vote for Gale, I think, or Gale Horton, or something like that.  And, a very good friend of mine, Pat Lee, was the president.  She won as president of the class and then I was the vice president of the class.  And, then another friend of ours, Craig Vanderburgh [ph.] was the treasurer, I believe, I believe he was treasurer.  And, I just remember, you know, those were really--you had, had to do a lot of (unclear) at least making speeches.  And, it was very interesting because I recall at that time, it didn't, you know--later on I kind of became nervous about having to stand before a group and speaking.  But, I remember, when I was in junior high when I had to do it, it wasn't, it wasn't so intimidating as it kind of became later on.  But, those were really good years, had a lot of good friends from junior high, who I'm still friends with today.  Pat Lee, a friend who I reconnected with a couple of years ago who lives in the Maryland area.  My girlfriend, Barbara, she was Barbara Rourke [ph.] at the time, she's now Barbara Simmons.  She's my daughter's godmother.  And, she and I met in the seventh or the eighth grade.  We were actually, I think, exchanging notes in somebody's class.  Shirley Johnson, another friend who lives in Florida now.  And, most of, most of these friends, you know, we met in junior high, had a connection and it continued on through high school and beyond.
Speaker 1: Was it very easy for you to write your speeches at that time?
Speaker 2: From what I recall, I don't remember it being anything that caused me a lot of, you know, and, you know, I just kind of did it.  Thought about what I wanted to say, and kind of wrote 'em up and that type of thing.  I don't remember it being--later on in life, I remember, kind of getting very nervous and getting very, oh, gosh, and wanted to say just the right thing.  But, I remember, at that time at junior high, I guess, it was just kind of almost a, a natural thing.
Speaker 1: You talked about wanting to travel when you got older.  Did you have any new dreams or aspirations at this time?
Speaker 2: No.  Not that, not that I can recall, you know.  When I was in junior high, a couple of experiences that I had that I think were setting me up for what I was gonna do later in life.  I had, I had one junior high school teacher, I believe his name was David Shirah [ph.] and he was my social studies teacher.  And, as I said, I used to always pretty much get, you know, good grade on my, on my work.  But, in social studies we'd have to write these rather long papers and reports and different things.  And, he wasn't just a teacher who would grade your report.  He would also include, at least on mine, he'd include these rather long, you know, he'd tell you why it was, you know, you did a very good job on this, love the way you put this.  And, he was extremely enthusiastic.  And, I remember, just getting this feeling of, WOW, you know.  Boy, it looks like I can really do this.  But, I don't, at that time, it didn't, I don't think I was starting to form, "Oh, I should, I should be a writer.  I should become a writer."  But, I remember, it was a very positive experience, the comments about how I put together my work and what I had to say, and how I expressed myself.
Speaker 1: So, were there any other activities in junior high school?
Speaker 2: No.  I wasn't really a part of any other clubs or organizations that I can remember.  No, I think, I was student council, and just my school work.  I don't know, or recall any other groups that I was involved in very heavily.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Outside of school, did you attend any organizations?  Maybe at your church, or the YMCA, that type of thing, outside of school.
Speaker 2: Not in junior high school.  At some point, you know, I, I did--elementary, junior high school years, at some point I did attend the YMCA's day camp, that type of thing.  I attended Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon and, you know, was a, was a member of Sunday school and took part in some Sunday school activities and things like that.  But, there weren't any like, specific clubs or groups that I was very active in during that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your whole family went to the same church?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I should say, my mother [Jenny Campbell], my sister [Donna Satchel] and I attended Grace Baptist Church.  And, then my uncle [Prentice Richardson] and aunt [Ernestine Richardson] were members of--were Jehovah Witness and they attended a Jehovah Witness Kingdom Hall in, in Mount Vernon [New York].
Speaker 1: Were there any experiences in church that you can remember?
Speaker 2: None, that, that stand out, no, no, it was--we went on a regular basis but none that really stand out.
Story_ID: 116128
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, 1966, you're in junior high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, the climate of the country, [John F.] Kennedy was killed in '63 [1963], you were young but you might remember what was going on in your household.  Do you have any recollection of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, around that time, what stands out in my mind was '63 [1963], '64 [1964], I just remember it being a period where I went from kind of, maybe you could almost say from innocence of, you know, happy childhood, summers, family, all of that, to my grandfather [William Richardson] died.  I had a, I had a--my grandfather who passed away and then my aunt [Ernestine Richardson], my Uncle Prentice's wife, the uncle who lived in our house, his wife died very suddenly.  And, the death of my grandfather and the death of my aunt happened within a couple of years of each other.  So, and, that was all around that 1963, '64 [1964], '65 [1965] period.  So, for me it was losing someone very close to me, my grandfather and then losing my aunt.  And, then, hearing about this, you know, Kennedy being, you know--but, being young where you didn't quite--you kind of--you knew there's something really bad going on in the country, you know.  Kennedy dying, and then [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] dying and this unrest and just kind of, being, as a child being kind of scared of what was happening and not being sure or getting that sense of things--good times don't go on forever and things are--there's uncertainty in life and you lose people.  And, sometimes as a child, you don't quite understand why.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Did you mother talk to you about any of this at all?  Or, did you have to go on your own feelings and just watch what was going on in the household?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember any, like, really long discussions.  I do remember, you know, being at school and getting the word when Martin Luther King and Kennedy dying, that type of thing coming home.  And, you know, everybody was watching TV and trying, you know, just to talk--my mother didn't like, come to us and kind of sit down and have any really big discussion with us.  But, just getting a sense of something, something really terrible has gone on here.  And, it's, it's going to affect all of us.
Story_ID: 116129
Speaker 1: Were--was your family involved in Civil Rights at all?
Speaker 2: No.  None, none that I can recall, no.
Speaker 1: What about voting?  Did you mother [Jenny Campbell] and father [J.C. Horton] vote or--I'm sorry not your father, but your mother or any other people in your family?  Did they go out and vote?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did.  And, they, you know, like I said, where all--they weren't involved in a lot of politics.  They always kind of make it a point of letting us know that it was important to vote.  There was an Election Day, they were heading to the polls.  And, this was, you know, I kind of just grow up with the sense, this is something that, you know, it was almost like you don't have an option.  This is something that you have to do, you know, you have to pay taxes, you have to vote, you know.  And, just because that's the way people in my house did it, but they didn't make a big deal about it.  It wasn't, it wasn't anything that--but, everybody did go.  Well, I shouldn't say everybody, I knew my mother voted in the elections.
Story_ID: 116130
Speaker 1: So, now you go on to high school and tell me the name of the high school again?
Speaker 2: Mount Vernon High School [Mount Vernon, New York](laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  And, tell me about some of your experiences there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  In high school, I was, I kind of followed the path of my sister.  I have an older sister, Donna, who's two years older than me.  And, when she went to high school, she studied secretarial science, which is typing and shorthand and learning how to be a secretary, you know, handle things in the office.  And, so, you know, that's what she was following, and I was following her path.  And, so, I took the same types of courses.  Interestingly, when I was in high school, I, and it's very interesting how this came about.  I ended up being a secretary in my senior year to someone whose name at the time didn't mean anything to me.  And, then I found out who he was, Ahmad Jamal, the jazz pianist.  And, when my teacher first came to me and she--what happened was, she came to me and she said, "Would you be interested in a part-time job after school?"  And, I said, "Sure."  She said, "Well this gentlemen, would like one of--a student to come and work in his home as a secretary."  I said, "Okay."  And, she, and then she told me, which was very interesting 'cause she was a white teacher, and she told me, "Well, we sent this other student."  And, she told me who the student was and it was a white student.  "We sent this other student to his home, but he wanted to hire a black girl."  And, she, when she mentioned his name, you know, I'm sixteen, seventeen, seventeen years old, the name meant nothing to me.  All I know is it was a foreign sounding name.  And, so, I got a little-"Hm. Who is this foreigner who wants some black girl working in his home as a secretary?"  And, so, I kind of went for the interview.  But, I was like, "Well if I go there and anything doesn't seem right, you know, I'd just, I'm just gonna let these people know."  And, I was so surprise when I get to their home, they opened the door and his wife was a black woman, you know.  She shows up and then I met him and he's a black man.  And, I was like, "Oh, okay."  And, so, for, I think, for several months, I worked in his home.  And, the interesting thing is, he would be in his main room practicing the piano.  And, I'd be in his little office typing up letters that he had dictated to me.  And, so that was kind of interesting, I was Ahmad Jamal's secretary for (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --a couple of months.
Story_ID: 116131
Speaker 1: Did you run for office in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I, you know, it's very interesting when you think about, it's like, I don't know why I didn't.  But, no, I didn't run for any offices.  I had a boyfriend who ran track.  And, so, me and my friends would go to track meets, you know, on the weekends.  The high school basketball team was very hot.  And, several of the basketball players went on to play, I think, professional ball.  So, you know, we had a hot team that year.  And, so, we would, we'd go to a lot of basketball games, and we'd go to track meets on the weekends.  And, we just, you know, we were just kind of kids having a really good time, and studying--
Story_ID: 116132
Speaker 1: Most of my friends were kind of getting ready for college.  It was, it was very interesting, I was the first in my family to go to college.  But, I didn't go to college right away.  As a matter of fact, I, I had a lot of guidance counselors who I felt weren't giving me guidance.  They were trying to convince me what school I should go to.  And, I got so turned off by them, 'cause every time I would go, I went in looking for them to tell me, well, based on you having these skills, you having these interests; this would be a good career path.  But, they didn't do that.  They were very into, we can get you into this school.  We can get you into that school.  And, I felt, at the time, that I needed to know what I was going to school for, in order to go to school.  So, I got so turned off by the fact that all they wanted to talked about was what school they could get me into, that I just decided I wasn't gonna go to school.  I was gonna be like my sister [Donna Satchel].  I was gonna go to New York City.  And, my idea at the time was, I was gonna start at the bottom of the business world as a secretary and I was gonna work my way to the top.  And, so, when I graduated and most of my friends went off to college, I went to New York City, and I started working.  And, the first company I worked for was McGraw-Hill Publishing Company.  And, what I found out was that, my idea of working at the bottom, from the bottom to the top, doesn't really work that way.  And, I had a boss who traveled internationally quite a bit.  And, so, I kept going to him saying, "You know, when you're travelling, why don't you give me a project."  'Cause he was so overworked, and give me--and I was looking for something really, you know, meaty, to sink my teeth into.  And, so, finally, after pestering him over and over again, this one time, he says, "Okay.  I'll be in Europe next week.  I have a project for you."  And, I brightened and I thought, "Okay this is it.  This is gonna be something I could really show him what I can do."  And, he says, "While I'm away, could you straighten out my bookshelves?"  And, he pointed to those, you know, you know, floor to ceiling bookshelves that he wanted straightened out.  And, that, at that moment, I knew that he didn't see me as anything more than "a secretary."  And, that I wasn't going to, at least working for him, I wasn't gonna have the opportunity to work my way much anywhere.  And, that day, was the day I decided that, I needed to go to college because this wasn't gonna be enough.  And, so, that day I went to McGraw-Hill's library, started going through the college catalogs.  I was probably about twenty at the time, so, I felt as though I was much older than the other students.  So, I wanted to pick--I wasn't sure I could get through four years of school, 'cause I had been out for a couple of years.  So, I picked a two year school purposely 'cause I said, "I know I can make it through two years of school."  So, I started going through college catalogs for junior colleges in New York.  And, and that's when I kind of recall these experiences I had with my junior high school teacher and the comments on my paper.  So, it was like, you know, I've always like to write.  When I was younger I used to write plays for my friends.  And, it was like, writing, writing, maybe journalism.  Maybe I can be a writer, or reporter.  And, so, I picked, the school I picked was based on it being a two year school and it offering journalism classes.  And, so, I picked State University of New York at Morrisville [now Morrisville State College. Morrisville, New York].  And, they had a two year program in journalism.  And, I applied and I got in.  And, that's how I got on the path to becoming a journalist.
Story_ID: 116133
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's, let's just step back a minute.  You graduated from high school in 1972?
Speaker 2: "Nineteen Seventy-two [1972]."
Speaker 1: And, you worked at, at the publishing company [McGraw-Hill Education] for two years?
Speaker 2: About that.  I think, I think, I was there about two years.  And, I think, I moved on and took another job for a short period of time before I actually, by--you know, I was applying to school before I actually ended up going to school.  So, yeah, I think, I was working for about two to three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, tell me about your coll--your first college days.
Speaker 2: First college days.  It was a, you know, this is my--I had lived at home while I was working in New York [City].  So, this is my first time really being away from home.  And, Morrisville [State University of New York, Morrisville, New York] was a small school, about 3,000 students.  And, of those 3,000 students about ninety of them were African American.  And, Morrisville is upstate New York.  You leave New--you leave Mount Vernon, New York and you travel five hours upstate to get to Morrisville.
Speaker 1: Five hours upstate?
Speaker 2: Five hours upstate.  So, you're truly, you know, for all of us who came from very urban areas, you're kind of in the middle of nowhere at this very small school.  And, we always used to joked, that if you, when you're heading to Morrisville, if you turn your head and look to the left as you're going up the highway, you'll miss the school on the right.  But, in a way, it was, it was, it was a perfect first experience for me, because it was a small school, your instructors knew you really well.  They spent a lot of one-on-one time.  You had the opportunity for them to spend one-on-one time with, with you.  Although, I would later go on to Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York], I always tell people that, Morrisville was really the school where I really got my solid foundation on how to write.  Because those instructor and those professors really worked with you and critiqued you.  And, there was opportunity to go and talk with them about, how am I doing and, you know, how is this going?  And, for them to say, try this and try that.  So, academically, I was on the Dean's List and did very well, really took to journalism, really loved the classes.  Socially, it was a lot of fun, and in all that, we had an African American Student Union Association and we all hung out and partied and all like that.  So, and, that was when, that was when I began to also do some of my traveling.  That has become my true passion for me.  I was dating a guy when I was at Morrisville who was from the Gambia, West Africa.  And, my roommate was dating another guy who was from the Gambia.  And, through a conversation that came up right before Thanksgiving, my girl, my girlfriend's boyfriend who was from the Gambia, mentioned that a couple years previous he had taken another woman from the U.S. to Africa.  And, how she had this great experience.
Speaker 1: This is when your mother [Jenny Campbell], you said--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so that's how that whole--unfolded.  And, that was when I was at [SUNY] Morrisville [in Morrisville, New York].  So, that's when I first took off and began traveling.  And, then when I went on to Syracuse, I did some more traveling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116134
Speaker 1: Around this time, the Vietnam War is going on [1955-1975].  Did you have any friends that were drafted?
Speaker 2: I re--I recall more of people being drafted and, and when I was in high school.  Like, in--my sister's--some people who my sister [Donna Satchel] knew were, like in 1968 and '69 [1969], I guess, and maybe '70 [1970], you know, were very concerned about whether or not they were gonna be drafted and go on to school.  And, and--but, I don't, you know, by the time I was heading off to college, a friend of mine who joined the Air Force was like, stationed in Alaska.  So, I guess, you know, things were, were, you know, changing like that.  But, no, there weren't any people who I knew who were, I think, it was a little bit, a little bit earlier.
Story_ID: 116135
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right. So, when you leave Morrisville [State University of New York, Morrisville, New York], you go to which school?
Speaker 2: I transferred from--got, got my two year, year degree and applied to Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York], was accepted and then I transferred to Syracuse University which is--wasn't, wasn't too far, just down the road from Morrisville.
Speaker 1: And, you got your associates degree in?
Speaker 2: Journalism.
Speaker 1: Journalism, okay.  And, Syracuse was right down the street.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, although--probably about forty-five minutes away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About an hour away (laughter).  But, that was a big school.  And, that was, that was going from a little small situation to going to a very major, you know, a big university.
Speaker 1: So, how did you transition from--Morrisville seems as though the teachers were very nurturing--to a much larger school.  Did you find someone that could give you that warm and cozy feeling (laughter) there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was very interesting, there wasn't, it wasn't too much of really of a warm and cozy feeling.  I mean, I went from a situation where you knew every black student on the campus, to a situation where there were a ton of--in a way, I kind of went there thinking, "Oh, this is gonna be great, there's so many more African American students."  But, there were, I guess, it was almost, I almost felt like I was going from being in a little country, country bumpkin to the big city.  Because, in Morrisville where everybody knew everybody, it was, "Hi," everybody spoke to everyone because it so small.  At Syracuse, there were so many more students and there wasn't, to me, to the degree of warmth and friendliness.  And, I guess, maybe 'cause it was, there were so many more people and folks didn't feel as though they had to get to know everybody.  So, that was a little bit different.
Story_ID: 116136
Speaker 1: But, one of the things that actually was very interesting also, when I attended school at [SUNY] Morrisville [in Morrisville, New York], you had--Morrisville was a place that I, Morrisville was the place where for the first time, I was ever called a nigger.  I was walking across campus, across, you know, and someone shouts out of a dorm room, or out of a whatever, you know.  And, it--and, when they, and when they shouted and I'm walking, it was one of those things, it was like, "Who said that?  And, who are they talking to?  Oh, they're shout"--you know--I had come from a situation in New York, where, you know, hadn't encountered that.  And, upstate New York, you know, there were a lot of areas where there were, I think, students attending school there who hadn't encountered African American students.  Who, maybe, this was the first time they ever had to deal with, on a personal level, African American people.  I had two roommates when I was going to Morrisville, and both roommates were white.  One was from Long Island, and, you know, she was cool, we were friends, you know.  My friends would come in the room, she'd say "Hi," whatever.  And, the other roommate was from upstate New York.  And, it was very clear she was very uncomfortable around black people.  And, so, when my friends would come in the room, she would leave the room.  And, it was very, it kind of like, what's, you know, what's up with that.  But, she apparently--and, it kind of got to a point where, in time, she ended up moving out.  And, we kind of had a little bit of an ugly situation.

Speaker 1: So, we're back now in Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, we're talking about the differences in the campus.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were, there more difference like I said, it was very, a little bit cold.  I mean, I was, I kind of went there thinking, "Oh, this is gonna be great.  There's gonna be all these people.  We're all gonna, you know--I'm gonna have even more folks who, you know, supportive environment."  And, it was, and it was a little bit more, where everybody was a little bit more like, yeah, you know, we're, we're here, we're--I didn't--and I think, I ended up, I became the editor of the Black Student Newspaper, and The Black Voice on the campus.  And, I think I wrote an editorial or two about how for students coming to Syracuse, there wasn't as much warmth and support.  And, people were a little more standoffish, a little more like, yes, we're here but we don't need to be kind of running all over each other.  And, how that, I didn't see that as necessarily a good thing.  But, I do remember writing an editorial about that for the paper.
Story_ID: 116138
Speaker 1: Did you find any teachers who influenced you in your writing?
Speaker 2: Oh, in my writing, you know, I--all the instruction and the classes, you know, you had a lot of really large classes at Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York].  [S.I.] Newhouse School of Communications [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York], you know.  I just remember, they were very good and very thorough in terms of, of, you know, the work you were doing, and things you were working on, and that type of thing in terms of, you know, honing your skills, and bringing them along.  But, you know, no one, on one stands out in my mind in terms of--I really could, could cite more people at Morrisville [State University of New York, Morrisville, New York] than I could at Syracuse in terms of who I think were, were bigger influences on me.
Speaker 1: Was there somebody special at Morrisville?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, there were two instructors that I had.  And, one was Jerry, oh, gosh, I can't remember his name.  He might had been the head of the department.  And, I remember Jerry but I can't think of his last name.  But, there were, the two at the time.  The two instructors who I think kind of lead that department, who taught photography and who taught news writing, were extremely instrumental in, in helping me to become the journalist and editor I would become later on.
Story_ID: 116139
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, we were talking about the transition from Morrisville [State University of New York, Morrisville, New York] to Syracuse [University, Syracuse, New York].
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: But, also it was a transition from your home in kind of a sheltered life to school.  And, then to, well, to Morrisville and then to Syracuse.  When did you think your world started to become larger?
Speaker 2: Probably with just going to school.  I think when I went to Morrisville knowing that you were in an environment where you had these new friends.  You were meeting new people, some of them liked you, some of them didn't, you know; white and black, you know.  That whole experience kinda like finding your way of, oh, okay, this is new.  And, oh, some of these problems are some of the problems we've had before in other places.  And, you know, there's always some racial issues going on at school here and not everybody likes everybody.  But, it's not, it wasn't like a neg--it wasn't like a situation where I went to school and all the blacks folks were against all the white.  It wasn't anything like that.  It was like, like I said, when my roommate Cindy, she was really cool and nice, and this and that.  And, then, but, I had another roommate who, you know, she had some problems with, with--and it was pretty clear, it was because of color.  So, I think things like that, that kind of made you say, "Okay, I see, I see how some of this is shaping up."  But, you know, I think that when I first kind of got a sense of, and, you know, I was on my own to make my decision about how to handle and deal with those things and, you know.  I think for the most part, I learned to deal with them well.  There was a situation where the roommate who I didn't get along with, she was across the hall one time with some other people.  And, the dor--the room across the hall and the girls she was talking to over there, they were all white.  She was over there complaining, talking about, talking about me.  And, talking about how, you know, "She always has these people in her room and I can't get any work done."  And, I'm, you know, and it was, it was--and I was in my room ironing.  I just happened to have the door open and it's very interesting to hear somebody talking about you and you were kinda right there.  And, I just remember getting, just getting so angry, and just getting--and, it's like, what am I gonna do.  And, just kind of, you know, having this almost this rage.  And, so, I opened my door, and I pushed opened the door.  And, the--to see the look on her face when she saw me standing there, she was just talking about me, you know, about how she wasn't doing well.  And, I just, you know, and I just kind of preceded to read her the riot act.  And, I let her know that, if she was having a problem with school, it was her problem.  I was on the Deans' List and I was doing well.  And, if she couldn't get along with everybody there, than she needed to, you know--that type of thing.  But, just kind of handled it and, you know, didn't come to anything, anything, you know, violent or anything like that.  But, just kind of had to read her, that type of thing.  But, you know, you had, you had some situations like that, that would kind of pop up.  And, things where, you know, people talk about New York.  And, I tried to tell my daughter and other people, you have to realize areas cover a lot of territory and there are a lot of different people in it.  It's not all, you know, in any community, it's not all nice, it's not all rosy.  You got a lot of folks and not everybody is gonna appreciate who you are regardless of, you know, at your age, your color, or whatever.  And, you do have to learn to deal with those things.
Story_ID: 116140
Speaker 1: So, in Syracuse [New York] when, when you wrote the article and you were dealing with the, the newspaper and you wrote the article, what, what were you feeling when you wrote it?  I mean, were you angry about the situation on campus?
Speaker 2: I think I was, I think I was very disappointed.  Because, I think when I was preparing to go to Syracuse [University in Syracuse, New York], I was thinking, "Oh, this is gonna be great.  I'm gonna be on this major campus, lot of people, you know, far more black folks, you know.  And, all these different disciplines in these different areas, and it's just gonna be--I'm just gonna feel this, I'm gonna feel this love and support and all like that."  And, then I got there.  And, it was like, you know, you--well, you see somebody and I'd say, "Hi," and it was like, folks sometimes didn't even wanna speak to you.  And, it was like, I was just--I was shocked.  And, it was like, man, it was like one of those, I didn't think it was gonna be like this.  And, and I couldn't quite understand why on that campus there wasn't, there wasn't, and don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that, you know, nobody spoke.  'Cause there were, you know, there were fraternities and sororities and there were a lot of, you know.  But, I think, it seemed to me it was a little clique-ish.  You had your people who you hung out with and people who you spoke with.  Like all the journalism people, all the people who worked for the "Black Voice," we were all friends.  And, probably all the people form the sororities and, maybe those fraternities, you know, they were friendly and some of them, that type of thing.  But, it wasn't a, for whatever reason, there wasn't this, oh, you know, "Sister, Gale, hi, welcome to campus, come, glad to have you here" kind of a thing.  And, I guess, I thought it was gonna be that.  And, that was a disappointment to me.  So, I think, I was kind of writing, I wrote that editorial and, you know, that's something that--I've been writing editorials ever since Morrisville and I'm still writing editorials now.  Kind of giving my opinion on things that I see going on in the community that I want to bring to someone's attention.  I wanna bring to the reader's attention of the various publications that I work for.
Speaker 1: So, that was the root of what you do now--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm still, I'm still writing about--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, we all need to get along and we all should be, you know, how come we can't all do whatever in certain situations at different points and times.  But, you know, it's kind of interesting because a lot of times the, the things that you write about, the areas may change.  The the specific issues may change, but a lot of times the things that you're trying to, the points you're trying to get across to people remain the same, in terms of responsibility, in terms of kindness, in terms of unity, in terms of knowing that we have differences but we're all the same, you know, that type of thing.
Story_ID: 116141
Speaker 1: Was there a Black Student Movement on the campus [at Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York] at all?
Speaker 2: There was a Black Student, maybe the BSU.  Or, BSO, or B, BS something or the other.  The Black Student, so, BSA, Black Student Associations, there was, yeah.  Of which the Black Voice, the newspaper was, I think kind of under that umbrella group that then represented several different groups.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you pledge?
Speaker 2: No, I did not pledge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not pledge.
Speaker 1: What about sports or music?
Speaker 2: I, I was not, I kind of regretted the fact that I was not athletically inclined, didn't not go out for any sports in high school.  They, the one they told me a story with my mother.  The one when I was in high school, they started a girl's track team.  And, when I heard about it, I thought, "Oh, yeah, that's something I wanna do.  I'm wanna run track."  And, when I came home and told my mother [Jenny Campbell] I wanted to run track, she had this very negative view of that.  And, she was like, "No daughter of mine is gonna be running wild through the streets."  So, she squashed that idea.  So, I tease her to this day; that who knows, I could've been the next Flo-Jo, and you know, never, never got a chance to realize the potential, you know.  But, you know, no I didn't do any sports in--
Speaker 1: Do you have any other--
Speaker 2: During those years.
Speaker 1: Stories to share about, about the days at Syracuse?
Speaker 2: In terms of, in terms of the newspaper, I was both the edi--I was the editor of the student newspaper, the black student newspaper.  And, I also worked downtown at the, I think it was the "Syracuse Herald [-Journal]," I believe, a couple hours a week, worked there.  But, just have very, very wonderful fond memories of, of the staff, of the photographers, the writers, and you know, everybody who worked on the paper.  We were a very, they was like family, you know, they were really like your family.  And, you know, back, back at that time, you were cutting and pasting in terms of laying it out.  It was done a lot.  It was a little more hands on.  It was hands on a different way back at that time.  But, you know, just remember a lot of nights of staying up 'til one, two, three in the morning, working on the paper, trying to get the paper done, get the paper out and all like that.  And, you know, still, still kind of doing it but not, not quite the same way today.  But, still, still had the passion that, that what we are putting out.  Delivering information to people, sharing information, and profile pieces, and news and all like that, is important and is valuable and still have a lot of fun doing it.
Speaker 1: What part did you play in the newspaper?  What did you do, actually?  What was your job?
Speaker 2: For the student newspaper?
Speaker 1: No.  For the Syra--"Syracuse Herald."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  For the Herald, I was a, seems like I, I--they had me doing a little bit of everything on the--I don't know if I did any writing of, I probably wrote a couple articles.  I think that added to my string book, you know, 'cause at that time you keep a string book with all your articles.  But, you know, gathering information.  Probably doing some obits.  Anything that they needed doing.  The small rewrites on little, little pieces of copy, things like that.  Whatever needed to be done, you know.  I was, I guess I was, I don't know if I was considered, I guess I was considered an intern.  So, whatever needed to be done, working on copy and so forth, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so what year did you graduate from Syracuse [University in Syracuse, New York]?
Speaker 2: "Nineteen Seventy-eight [1978]."
Speaker 1: And, a degree in, B.A.?
Speaker 2: A Bachelor of Science in--
Speaker 1: B.S.
Speaker 2: Commu--communications, journalism.
Story_ID: 116142
Speaker 1: So, what happened after school?
Speaker 2: Well, while I was still in school, I went to a job fair in, seems like it was, it was a bunch of students and I think we took a bus.  And, it might have been New York, 'cause I remember we had a long bus ride, and I think it was in New York City.  And, so, we go to this job fair and, you know, handing out resumes and it's a long day.  And, it seems like it was the end of the day, and I was standing by a table, I think, casually talking to someone, or maybe somebody told me, you should go over and talk to those people over there.  And, it was kind of like, almost reluctant like, well, I've been doing this all day, "oh, go ahead, go ahead."  And, so, I ended up going to this table and it was Captain City Con--Capital City Communications [Capital Cities Communications], which at the time, and I guess they're still around, at the time, they owned a lot of newspapers, TV stations and radio stations.  And, this was a time when there weren't a lot of, a lot of the newspapers were searching for--they were being highly criticized about not having enough minorities at their newspapers.  And, so, CapCities had started a program where they were hiring some fresh out of college students to be their minority interns.  And, the way the program worked was they would send you around the country for a year.  For a year, you'd be an intern with them.  They--and you, they'd send you around the country and you work at four different newspapers in a year by design.  So, every three months, you'd have to move to a different newspaper.  And, so, when I heard about the program, I got real excited.  Its like, "Oh, man, that'd be so wonderful, that's so wonderful.  And, so, I, you know, gave them my resume and so forth.  And, then I got a call and they flew me to New York, which is, you know, you're--very heady experience and they--and it was me and maybe about, maybe, I don't know, ten, twelve, fifteen other students from Howard University [Washington D.C.], different colleges they had selected.  And, they wined and dined us for this weekend, really treated us well, and interviewed us, and took us around.  And, then we went back to school.  And, then after some period of time, they kind of called.  And, they were selecting, I believe, I'm trying to think, maybe that first year was, I don't know, it was four, six, or eight students.  But, we were in pairs.  They were gonna pair you up and move you around the country.  And, so, I remember this one day, I get this call from a person in New York.  And, he starts out, you know, with the typical, "we're so pleased to meet with you.  You were really impressive.  You're da, da, da, da."  And, I remember, on the phone, I was just like, oh, gosh, this is it, this is it, I'm so--and, and then he says "Unfortunately."  And, I remember, just being there on the phone and tears just falling down with it.  "Unfortunately, we've chosen someone else for the program."  And, I just remember, just, I was just crying.  But, of course, I'm trying to, "Oh, yes, I understand," and I'm, you know, trying to keep my composure.  And, and I'm just think, "I can't believe I didn't get it."  And, so, then he say, "However, we would like to know if you'd be interested in the opportunity of working for CapCities in"--I'm trying to think, where was the newspaper, was it--Bell, Bell, no, no, Pontiac, Michigan.  The Pon--oh no, The Oakland Press in Pontiac, Michigan because the paper had gone on strike.  Everybody at the paper had gone out on strike.  So, what they were doing is, they were hiring all these college students to come in (laughter) to, to put--to walk across the picket line.  So, he offered me a job at the paper, you know, "Would you be interested in taking a job full-time?"  So, I was like, "Well, can I think about it."  And, he says, "And, what we'll do is, you will be an alternate for the program."  And, I'm thinking, "Yeah, like anybody's gonna turn down the opportunity not to be in this program."  So, I asked him, let me think about it.  And, I called my mother, 'cause I wasn't sure I felt comfortable about the whole idea of crossing the picket line.  But, then also, I was fresh out of college and I needed a job.  So, I called my mother.  And, my mother was like, "Look, if this is an opportunity for you."  'Cause my mother had worked for a company that often times--she was a part of the union and they'd go out on strike so, I kind of sought her counseling.  She was like, "This is an opportunity for you.  You go take that job" and, you know, all will be okay.  And, so, I had determin--I had made up my mind, I was gonna take the job.  I was gonna move to Michigan, and I was gonna work for the paper.  And, I guess, by the time maybe I had got back to him, he informed me that somebody had declined the offer.  And, so, now I had the offer of--the opportunity to either to go into the program, or to go to Michigan.  And, so, then, it was like, okay.  So, then I decided to go into the program and I was paired up with another woman at Howard University.  She'd graduated from Howard, Robin.  And, she and I then took off.  And, so, any--in that year that I graduated, I think, I moved, ended up moving six, six or seven times.  Because I moved from Syracuse [New York] to New York [City].  Stayed in New York for about a month or two before the program started.  The first paper I went to was the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.  So, I flew to Texas.  And, the way it worked is, they would put us up in a hotel for one week.  So, for one week, we kind of had this hol--and in a week, we had to find an apartment, and open a checking account.  We had to kind of find our way and be ready to start work the next week.
Story_ID: 116143
Speaker 1: And, so, I--after this year, I became very adept that being about to come into a city, assess where do I need to go and what do I need to do, get a map out and kind of find my way.  And, then be able to be up and running.  But, that's how the program went, so I was in Michigan for, no, I was in Fort Worth, Texas for three months.  And, then from Fort Worth we went to the "Oakland Press" in Pontiac, Michigan where they were out on strike.  And, everyday we'd have to cross the picket line and be called scabs and all that kind of thing.  And, it was almost like a college atmosphere at the paper because everybody they had brought in were all these high school graduates.  I mean, college graduates, just recent graduates, and a lot of them were African Americans.  So, it was like, you had all these new friends that were, you know, young and just starting out in the business.  And, and then from Pontiac, I went to King City, Missouri, working King City.  And, the interesting situation, in Fort Worth, the Fort Worth folks were great.  Fort Worth folks were like, well, you know, they had us doing everything from concerts to cov--front page stories to political things.  They critique--it was truly the way an internship should work.  We were being critiqued and given information and they were nice.  They were, you know, taking us out, and it was really a great experience.  (Laughter) and, so, we went from there to then going someplace where everything was on strike and you're kinda doing, you would write, you know, anything you needed to write and we were on our own.  And, then when we went to Kansas City.  Kansas City had been a family run newspaper for a lot of years.  And, then CapCities had come in and bought them out.  And, so, basically, people in Kansas City who worked for the newspaper, hated the people in New York, who were--they were, you know, the corporate folks at CapCities.  So, their attitude was basically, they never said this, but their attitude was basically, "You gonna send these little black girls down here if you want to, but they're not messing, not messing with our paper."  And, we had just come from two other papers.  We were writing everything and fully involved in the operations of the paper, to a situation where they stuck us in the back of the room, and they had us writing obits for eight hours a day.  And, you know, little short little crime things and just, you know.  And, we just sat in the newsroom, in the back of the newsroom not doing anything.  We were bored out of our minds.  So, while my roommate and I made friends with the--there was a young woman who was this lifestyle editor, so we made friends with her.  She didn't have enough staff.  And, so, we'd started saying, well, you know, we're not doing anything, you want us to, you know--and, she started giving us some things to write.  And, so, I think, when our stories started showing up in the paper and the powers that be, who were supposedly over us, started realizing, oh, they can write.  Then they decided, oh, if they can write then they're gonna write for us.  And, so, then they started giving us some, some of, you know, decent assignments.  And, in the end, we ended up doing, I think, a three part series about people's properties were being sold on the courthouse steps, unbeknownst to them.  And, so, we, and my roommate and I ended up doing a, a three part series on that and some other things and, you know, it turned out good.  But, it was, it was a very different situation in Kansas City than at any of the other papers.  And, then the last paper I went to was Belle, Belleville News-Democrat in Belleville, Illinois.  And, that was a small paper and, I think, I stayed there for about six weeks.  And, then I had been offered a job at the Fort Worth paper.  So, then I left, finished up the program, and went to Fort Worth and, and worked as a general assignment reporter.
Story_ID: 116144
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happened when you finished the internship?
Speaker 2: Went to Fort Worth [Texas].  There was guy I was dating, who I would in time marry.  And, so, it was like, the paper had offered me a job and there was a guy who, you know, had fallen in love with.  And, so, I went to Fort Worth and end up staying in Fort Worth, and staying in Texas for about, I think about five or six years.  Maybe about, yeah, five or six years, I think.  It might have been maybe six or seven, now that I think back on it.  But, worked for "Fort Worth Star-Telegram," and then went to my--my husband Pierre Chery was in the Air Force and, I believe when he got out of the Air Force, we ended up moving to College Station, Texas, which is kind of, out in the middle of kind of nowhere.  And, at the time, I was pregnant with my son [Jean-Pierre Chery] and so, we moved there and we stayed there for a little while.  And, then when I came back to Dallas, the Dallas Fort Worth area, I applied for a job and got a job with the "Fort Worth Times Herald."  And worked for the "Times Herald" for several years.  And--
Speaker 1: What year is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, let's see.  Oh, my son, Jean-Pierre, was born in 1982, so, probably, I was probably at the "Time Herald" from about '81 [1981] to maybe '84 [1984].  I'm guessing on those dates to be honest with you.  And, then I really hit a point where I got burned out on, on, it was daily newspaper reporting which can be, really be a bit of a grind.  And, in Dallas [Texas], it was--there were--while I was working for the Times Herald, I covered the Arlington area.  At the time, there were two daily newspapers.  And, so, it was a highly competitive situation, you know.  Now, you don't have too many cities where there are two newspapers that are competing against each other.  But, there was a lot of competition to make sure your stories were, you were getting the lil--the jump on anybody else.  And, I really hit a burn out point.  And, so, I kind of stepped away from journalism, decided that, you know, I'm burned out on this and I don't think I wanna do this anymore.  And, my marriage was falling apart, so I decided that I'm leaving Texas.  And, I had a girlfriend from, from college who lived in Atlanta [Georgia].  And, every time I came to Atlanta, I had such a great time.  And, I said, "You know, if it was ever a city I would pick to move to, because I really enjoyed it and enjoyed the experience, it would be Atlanta.  So, I decided I didn't wanna go back to New York.  And, so, I decided to, to go to Atlanta, and that's how my son and I ended up here in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about working at the newspaper.  How was it working--how were your colleagues?  How did they treat you?
Speaker 2: At the--
Speaker 1: At the--
Speaker 2: Guy I worked for?
Speaker 1: Times.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: The Times Herald.
Speaker 2: At the Times Herald?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: At the Times Herald, when I joined the Times Herald, they were your, they were forming a team to start covering what they call the Mid-Cities, which is Arlington, Buford (Bedford), Euless, I'm trying to remember all the names of these cities, I haven't been there in a very long time.  And, so, they brought in a number of reporters and I think at the time, and I might have been, I'm trying to remember, I might have been 27, 27 or 28, and I think I might have been one of the older reporters of the "Times."  So, it was like, it was a lot of really young reporters, you know, who--and, so, like I said, it was, it was interesting 'cause we were covering a new area and so forth.  But, it was high competitive.  The col--the colleagues I was working with, and we were a pretty diverse group.  Some people had come in from California.  Some people had come in from other parts of Texas.  And, you know, everybody got along just fine.  But, it was just, it was a real kind of a pressure cooker situation and I just really burned out.
Speaker 1: Do you know [HM] Iola Johnson?
Speaker 2: That names is--
Speaker 1: She was a news reporter on television there at that time.
Speaker 2: It sound, now when you said it, it sound so familiar to me.
Speaker 1: She's the--she was the first black
Speaker 2: Iola Johnson.
Speaker 1: TV caster.  T--
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: TV newscaster.
Speaker 2: Newscaster.  Yeah.  Her name is familiar to me.  I can't get a mental picture but the name is so familiar.  I, I believe--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm familiar with her, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you, so, you leave Dallas and decide that you're gonna come to Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.

Speaker 1: So, tell me what happens next.
Speaker 2: So, I moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  I move here without a job; my son [Jean-Pierre Chery] and I.  And, when I first moved here, I'm living in my girlfriend's house, Paulette's house in Decatur [Georgia].  And, she converted her dining room into a bedroom for me and my son and we stayed there with her for a couple months.  And, I go out and look for a job.  You see my secretarial skills, 'cause I'm kind of thinking, you know, (unclear) or something.  I just don't think I wanna do this anymore.  And, so, initially, I start working at the General Motors Plant as a secretary.  And, I worked there from January until June, I believe.  And, there was that period of time where I just was really wondering, "Gosh, I I'm just, I'm--am I ever gonna have a professional job again.  Am I gonna get back in something?"  But, it ended up that--turned out that a friend of my, who was a writer who we, I'm trying to think where we met.  She was a, she was a journalist.  And, she and I up--we had met some time in the past.  And, she called me one day and said, "Listen, there's somebody I know over at this hospital who keeps asking me about, do I want a job in public relations?  And, I'm not interested.  Do you think you'd be interested?  And, I was like, "Yeah, sure, you know, possibly."  So, I go for the interview and I, you know, go and meet the individual at the hospital.  And, it's a PR job, and a lot of they were looking for was media relations work, somebody who could work media.  And, you know, I had the experience having been on the other side with the media.  And, so, ends up, I was offered the job.  And, I went there and I started out as public information manager and in time became the public relations director.  And, stayed there for, I think, six in a half, almost seven years.  And, it was a great place to work.  I so loved that job.  It was a children's hospital.  So, you were promoting things having to do with children's health, medical innovations, having to do with children, you know.  I was pitching stories to CNN.  And, it was very interesting 'cause I was on the other, I was on the other side where people, previously people had been pitching stories to me.  Trying to get me to write stories about them.  Here I was now, using my skills and what I knew about the media to try to sell stories to the news organizations.  So, I was pitching stories to the radio and representing the hospital as the hospital's spokesperson.  I was the person who had to go on TV and talk about a situation.  I had to do media training with, with the doctors and the executive of the hospital, to train them.  So, that when they had to go on air, they would be prepared to do the interviews and so forth.  Did a lot of special events and it was just a great--I loved working at that place.  It was absolutely wonderful.  The dedication of the people and in trying to get the word about what was being done at the hospital.  And, also get the word about the positive stories of children who were sometimes in situations that were just, you know, you would think heartbreaking until you saw the, the spirit of that child who came through.  And, it was, it was, it--they were, they were some really good years.
Story_ID: 116146
Speaker 1: Is there any one story that you remember in particular?
Speaker 2: There were probably two little girls who kind of stand out in my mind.  And, both of these little girls, were girls who ended up losing their legs because of different medical situations.  We're talking children, you know, children who were about six or eight years old.  And, one little girl, was a little girl name Shea [ph.].  And, she had some type of a blood disorder that caused her legs to have to be amputated at the knee.  And, at the time that I met her, I think she was just starting to come to the hospital, was being treated.  And, one of the things that she told her parents and said that "She wanted, one day she wanted a pair of red tennis shoes."  And, to see this child who had no legs who was talking about having a pair of red tennis shoes just sounds like, oh, that must be the most heartbreaking thing you can think of.  But, in time, she ended up being fitted with artificial limbs.  And, she was coming in for therapy and so forth.  And, in time, when you saw her, unless you knew she had lost her legs, if you saw her walking in the hallways of the hospital, you wouldn't have known that she, that she lo--lost her legs.  I mean, she walked that well and so forth.  And, about two years ago, I think it was two years, two summers ago, I was flipping through a paper here in Atlanta and I go--there's a back page, and it's this full page picture of this girl running this race someplace in Europe.  And, I looked at the picture, it's like, "Oh, okay."  That's a--and it was of, you know, Paralympics or something like that.  And, I looked down at the picture and it's the same girl, Shea Howard, who was now nineteen or twenty years old.  And, it talked about how she--and it was one of those situations, "Oh, my goodness."  But, at the time, when you--when I met her at the hospital, she was one of those kids--and there was another girl whose name I can't remember--who you knew she was gonna be okay because she was determined to do all these things anyhow.  It was kind of like, yeah, I've lost my legs but I wanna be fitted.  I wanna do this.  I wanna do that.  And, when you kind of see that happening, it kind of gives you a renewed sense of human ability to overcome cert--situations.  And, also it gives you sense of how we should be grateful of all the things that we can do that we take for granted and we don't really appreciate.  But, if we didn't have them, how much we would appreciate it.
Story_ID: 116147
Speaker 1: Before we go on, I wanna ask you about any articles that you have written up until this time that you remember that really standout in your mind.
Speaker 2: Okay.  A couple that stand out in my mind, there is a piece that I co-authored with another writer on foreclosures in--that were happening in Kansas City [Missouri].  And, at the time, one of things that was, was so interesting about because I think some recordkeeping issues, people's homes were being foreclosed on and sold on the courthouse steps, and people didn't know it until the time when we called them.  And, you wanna talk about a, a really gut wrenching conversation to have somebody call someone to interview them about their home that's gonna be sold tomorrow.  And, the person is unaware that their home is gonna be sold, you know, that next day or that next week.  And, I think, you know, that was gratifying to try to delve into what was some of the problems.  And, what were the situations that were happening, and shine a light on, on things that weren't being handled in the best possible way.  Another series of articles that I worked on in Fort Worth [Texas] had to do with race relations in Fort Worth.  And, that of course was, was very meaningful and satisfying to work on, explaining the different points of view, what was happening in people's lives, how they perceived things taking place in the city at the time.  And, just kind of the state of affairs between just everyday people in Fort Worth, Texas at that time.
Speaker 1: What was going on there that would make you write this article?
Speaker 2: I think it was just an examination.  It was a--the--I think, we were asked just too kind of go and find out how things were working.  It wasn't, there wasn't any particular, you know, boiling point issue of anything happening then.  But, just in terms of, of how people were feeling, what was happening, how people saw things in the past and in the future in Fort Worth, Texas.
Story_ID: 116148
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else that you wanna talk about, about your days before Scottish Rite [Children's Medical Center in Atlanta, Georgia], in the newspaper business?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's been interesting for me because some of the things that were--just kind of drove me crazy and there were seemed to be more than I could stand actually, in hindsight, they were, they were things that helped to make me, I think, good at what I would do later on.  So, you know, it's kind of that old, you know, you're not enjoying it now, but it's a good thing.  Because I did work for a daily newspaper, I did learn how to write very fast.  And, so, and I also learned, how to kind of be in that pressure cooker situation where, you know, back at that time people were still pounding out, we were still pounding out stories on--in the early days, we're pounding out stories on typewriters, and you know, then to computers.  And, you were working in a newsroom environment where there was, you know, a lot of noise going around, a lot of people moving around and you still had to compose you thoughts.  And, so, I was used to working in a kind of chaotic situation but still have to kind of, "ok, what do I think?  What do I wanna write?"  Being under a deadline pressure of coming back from a city council meeting or covering something in the evening, coming back to your desk and knowing, I've got twenty-five minutes to write this story, you know, oh, my gosh.  And, I remember every time it would happen, its like, "Okay, this is the one I'm not gonna be able to do it.  I can't do it, there's not enough time."  And, then you look down and you think, "Oh, now I got twenty minutes to write this story."  And, so, and then somehow you get a thought, "Okay, let me just put down something on paper."  And, you just start pounding it out.  And, so, I became adapt at being able to write a story quickly.  And, later on, the beauty of having done that is that later on you're able to write quickly when you have to.  But it's nice to be in a situation where you don't have to do it every single day, you know, like that.  And, so, also I think it added to when there was, I was in situations where there was a lot of chaos kind of going on, I could be very clam and say, "Okay, this what we need to do."  Because, you know, I was used to being in a situation where, okay, this is being done, this person's on deadline, this is being--there's something going on, you still have to kind of focus and be calm and get, get your part of it out of the way.  So, that became something of, you know, kind of when I worked at the hospital and we'd have some emergency situation, then I'd draw on that, "Okay, here's what I need to do.  Here's what we need to put together."  And, it was like, oh, gosh, I've been in far, you know, more intense situations than this.  So, this one's easier.  And, so, that became I think a skill that, that helped me later on.
Story_ID: 116149
Speaker 1: Where there any journalists that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: There were several journalists I looked up to.  When I was in, in Texas, I was a member of the, what was it, the--we had, we had a very interesting name for the black journalist association.  And, it was, I think they--it was, I know at one time somebody wanted to name it Black, Black Folks in the Media, and I thought--I think we went with a slightly more professional name than that.  But, you know, it was the, the black journalist association and at the time, I believe, Paula Walker was heading it up who would later go on to the New York Times.  And, I'm not sure where she is now.  But, I know Paula was certainly somebody who, who I worked with and I looked up to, and she was a friend.  You know, there were several other journalist and Chuck, Charles, I can't think of his last name.  But, we were all, we all supported each other.  We all kind of gave each other advice, you know.  Being a younger person coming in, these people kind of guide and led you.  And, that was a situation where in Fort Worth among the black journalist, people were very nurturing, supportive, helpful, a lot of networking going on, a lot of whatever you need, you know.  Meetings at different people's houses, you know.  They were your colleagues and they were your friends.  And, that was, that was a wonderful situation.  You're working on different committees together, working on reviewing contest entries and competitions, journalist competitions from other states, being a member of, of AAB--NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].  Our association was a member of the A--NABJ.  Here in Atlanta, it's AABJ [Atlanta Association of Black Journalists].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 116150
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now we're, you're at Scottish Rite [Children's Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia], and what happens after Scottish Rite?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, like I said, I loved working at Scottish Rite.  I think some of the things that, that I thought, I was kind of proud of being a part of, being all a part of this communication, getting information out, was when I, when I went to the hos--the medical center of the hospital.  Initially, all the advertising and the ads that they would run for the medical center only would show white children in them.  And, you know, being part of the communications department, you know, when I was--they were rolling out a new campaign and they would kind of say, "Oh, look at these ads, what do you think?"  Its like, "Oh okay.  The words are really nice, and really cute kids."  And, you know, being one of the voices--and, I had a conversation recently with a woman who worked for a power company here in Georgia.  And, she--we kind of had the same experience of us being in a position where we're reviewing something that's being presented as, this is gonna be the advertising for our organization and us looking at it going, "There's something wrong with this picture.  There aren't any people of color in this picture."  And, I think, you know, being that voice to kind of point out to someone to kinda say, "Okay."  I don't know how these people are gonna receive this.  But, I need to let them know that this ad that you're doing has some flaws in it.  It doesn't truly reflect the community.  And, I as, as a woman of color, when I see something like this, what it says to me is, you don't want me here.  And, I'm not sure that's a message that you want put out that way.  And, so, I think you need to kind of think about including--do you want--are you trying to say that this, you know, healthcare organization is, is not for everybody?  If you're--because you may be.  And, I think the people who were involved in that were unaware that that message was being transmitted.  And, so, you know, I think there were a lot of people like myself who were kind of bring it to someone's attention that, you know--where are the Asian folks?  Where are Hispanic folks?  Where are the black folks?  You know, if, if you're this hospital that's truly for everybody, shouldn't they be in some of these ads and kind of being a part of that.  I launched some PSAs for the hospital.  And, in our PSAs when we would show children, we'd always try to make sure we had a, a good mix of children, you know, they were white, and they were black, and they were, you know, Asian, and they were the rainbow colors of--that reflect our community.  And, trying to get that across, 'cause that's in--so, now when I see those ads on, and it's like, "Oh, they got all the colors," it's like, okay, you know.  I'm very proud of the fact that, you know, in a small way I played a part in, in helping those, that to be where it is today.
Speaker 1: Do you really think that the hospital really wasn't aware that they needed to show different nationalities and colors in the ads?  Because the hospital, it, it's on the north side of town.  So, there's a different mix of people who live there.  So--
Speaker 2: Right.  But, when you, when you're at that hospital, there were only, at the time that, now, now they're under one umbrella.  They all go by, by one name.  At the time when I was there, there were two children's hospitals in the Atlanta [Georgia] area.  And, they competed against each other.  And, so, even though the hospital's located on the north side of town, if you're a child and you have medical crisis, you're probably gonna be in one of those two hospitals.  And, the population of those hospitals as you walk through the hallways, you saw--it wasn't, you know, it wasn't majority or minority, you saw, you saw a little bit of everybody who was going there.  But, the ads didn't reflect that.  And, so, like I said, I don't think it was a, a deliberate exclusion.  I think it was, well, let's pick the cute kids and let's pick the kids, you know, we want.  The kids they were picking were always the same kind of kids.  And, I think they were, were, you know, not so much aware that this was, you know, like I said, I'd look at those ads and I think, "Hm." I, you know, that didn't sit too well with me.  And, I'm not su--I don't think they realized it had probably a negative impact.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 116151
Speaker 1: So, what happens next?
Speaker 2: So, I leave the hospital and there was a gentleman who I had met through a professional association, IABC, International Association of Business Communicators, who, I think he and I, Dick Lind and I served on several committees together.  And, he started talking to me about, he was in business for himself in communications doing PR [public relations] in communications.  And, he started talking to me about, you know, have you ever thought about going out on your own.  And, one day you and I should partner and, you know, run a PR firm and a communications firm and he kind of talking to me about that off and on for a while.  And, then when I got to a point where I was kind of burned out on during the job, I loved working at the hospital but I kinda felt like, I needed a new challenge.  And, I thought, I had--my daughter [Imani Gay] was born in 1992.  And, after I kind of came back from maternity leave, I was thinking, you know, "I think I'm ready for a new challenge."  And, so, I called Dick up and said, "Maybe I'm ready for that challenge."  He says, "Well, let's, let's do it."  So, I joined him in business and we became partners in a PR firm.  Started out as, his business as Lind, Lind and Associates.  And, then in time, we changed the name to Horton-Lind Communications.  And, we basically were independents who would go out and get clients.  We did all types of--he specialized in speech writing.  I specialized in media relations.  And, we would go out and get clients and work on doing the press releases, getting them on, you know, training them in communications, strategies, and how to do interviews and we, you know, send out their, their press releases and do the follow-up calls to the media, and try to get our clients on TV.  And, we'd do special events and write annual reports.  It was like, if you need it written or, or publicized, we would handle that.  So, I did that for about five years or so.  And, had a full range of clients, represented a lot of artists.  And--
Speaker 1: Who, who were some of your clients?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  Let's see, [HM] Brenda Singletary who's a Atlanta [Georgia] artist who is now a White House Fellow and whose artwork is hanging in the White House.  She represented her for a number of years, represented--did work for General Services Administration, did some PR and communications work for them.  Did work for Atlanta Fulton County--Atlanta Fulton Recreation Authority [Atlanta, Georgia], who, I guess I would--I'm not sure if they still have authority over the stadium; did PR work for them for a while.  Gosh, I can't think of all of 'em.  But, you know, we had, we had a lot of different clients.  My partner [Dick Lind] had been, in doing this a while.  So, he had clients like, Coca-Cola, and some of the more established clients.  But, we would just go there and hustle and get, bring in business.  And, it was, it was a really an eye-opened experience of having to handle the, doing the work and also doing the business side; marketing and promoting yourself and, also, playing collections and all like that.  It--there were a lot of hats to wear, and you know, where you're a proprietor like that, you have to wear them all.  So, I was able to learn, to hone new skills.
Story_ID: 116152
Speaker 1: But, somewhere in the process, I started missing journalism.  I started missing writing, just writing stories and telling stories.  I missed having a product, a newspaper or a magazine, something that had these stories, you know.  And, and I started to long for, to return to being a journalist instead of being a publicist.  And, as it turned out, I had a client who was an attorney and he, Keenan Nix, had a annual party in the summer or spring or summertime on his, on the lawn of his law practice in Decatur.  And, I went and met a woman who I had known previously and we had--I can't recall how I met Jane DeJanette [ph.].  But, I ran into her at this event and she had starting telling me about this new publication that was coming out and was gonna be focused on the African American community in Atlanta.  And, it was, it was conceived by herself and the Glenns, Earl and [HM] Carolyn Glenn, who started the Champion newspaper.  And, and she was, and her telling me about this lifestyle magazine focused on the African American community.  I was just like, "That's sounds great."  And, then at some point she says, "Well, if you know of anybody who might be a good editors, let me know, 'cause we're looking for someone to the editor."  And, I was like, "Oh, wait, you know, maybe me."  And, so, then I was invited to attend a meeting that they were having.  They, what they did was before they started the magazine, the summer before the magazine started in December of 1999, they had a series of meeting where they brought together several people in the communications field.  And, she would brainstorm about what the magazine should be about.  So, I went to the initial meeting and, and I had a lot of ideas, and I voiced them, and shared them.  And, I guess they like some other things that I had to say, because I was asked to return to the next meeting and plan out the agenda for that meeting.  And, so, from there, I started attending the meetings and planning it out and then, and it kind of evolved into--next thing I kind of knew, I was the editor of the magazine.  So, I have been proud of my association with Atlanta Goodlife magazine and Ace III Communications because I was able to be a part of, of planning it before it ever hit the streets.  It wasn't like just coming in and picking up where--it was like, what departments.  What are we gonna call this section.  And, what, what are, what should we be about.  And, I have thoroughly enjoyed working on Atlanta Goodlife and also working with the Champion newspaper because I'm the managing editor with Ace III Communications.  So, I have oversight responsibility.  I have direct responsibility of seeing that Goodlife comes out every month and the content and working with all, everybody who's involved.  And, then I have--I'm involved also, with--in the Champion newspaper which is a weekly newspaper, so.
Speaker 2: Was the Champion newspaper, was this already in publication when you started?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, it was.
Speaker 2: When did the newspaper, do you remember, it--not sure?
Speaker 1: Gosh, I'm bad on dates.  With the newspaper, I'd be, I'd be, I'd be guessing if I was to pick to date.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It had been around.  It had started originally as a newspaper focusing on the African American community in Metro Atlanta.  And, then its focus became focusing on everyone in the DeKalb County.  And, then it became the legal organ.  So, the focus of the newspaper and the focus of the magazine, they have two, two different focuses.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, the Goodlife magazine, tell me about some of the, the articles that you write and some of the people that you talk about.  Tell me about, about the magazine.
Speaker 1: Oh, gosh.  It's been really wonderful.  We have, we have had the good fortune to write stories and do interviews with, you know, a broad cross-section, kind of a little bit of everybody in Atlanta who has helped to shape, make Atlanta.  And, also, have been involved in national.  I mean, we have covered nine--I've done, some of the cases, I've done the interviews and some of the cases, I've arranged that we would do the interviews with every from, everyone from Shirley Franklin, Mayor of Atlanta [Georgia], to [HM] John Lewis.  I interviewed him up in Washington [D.C.] for a cover story that we did, to Evander Holyfield, and Brian Jordan.  We have done stories on, you know, Raven-Symone.  We've done stories on, oh, Hosea Williams where I think we did the last interview with him before he passed.  Coretta Scott King, you know--
Speaker 2: Did you get an award for the article on Coretta Scott King?
Speaker 1: Well, actually, the--we--that year, Goodlife received about six or seven awards.  I think on the website, they have my name down because I had submitted the entry.  But, Cathy Mitchel who is the editor of the "Champion Newspaper" actually won the award for the Coretta Scott King.  She's the one who interviewed Coretta.  And, did a wonderful, told a wonderful story about, about her.  But, I think, I--that year, I won for the interview that I did with Evander Holyfield, which was, I think was entitled was "Thirty Minutes with Evander Holyfield" 'cause that's about, maybe fifteen, I had a really short period of time.  So, I had to--that was like one of those, you have to come in and get, get what you need and, turn it around really quickly.  But, we've done, you know, Judge [Glenda A.] Hatchett.  We've done Leah Ward Sears.  We've done, just, just, amazing number of people--
Story_ID: 116153
Speaker 1: But, you also do people, interview those who are not so famous.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.  That's right.  And, that's one of the things I'm very proud of.  A lot of our, you know, our cover stories are those people names and faces that you know.  You kind of do a double take.  Recently, you know, we had Andre Benjamin on the cover, Andre 3000. and, the people who you'll know.  But, inside we have stories on the broad cross-section of people who make up Atlanta [Georgia] but you wouldn't necessarily know them, you know.  Entrepreneurs, people who are working in ministries, people who are reaching out to do things in the community, people who have stories that just, you know, kind of break your heart.  And, then you'll kind of be inspired about how they recovered from situations.  Folks who have dreams, you know.  We do things on magicians and musicians, and folks who find voids in the marketplace, a women who has come up with her own boarder of people of color for a room boarder 'cause she couldn't find any, you know, that, that suited her.  And, just, and we also try to do a lot of things on travel, destinations that maybe you wouldn't have thought about.  I mean, we try to do the destinations that people maybe are familiar with and give them a new take on, on heritage trails and things such as that.  But, we also try to do things on places, you know, I've gone to Montana and done something on, say out of, you know, going fly fishing in Montana and things like that.  And, you know, going skiing in, in Lake Tahoe and all like that, just to give people a sense of--you know, the world is really ours.  You know, we can go anywhere and do anything.  And, sometimes it's just the matter of--you know, people always often and ask me, "Are there black folks there?  Do black folks do that?  I say, "Yeah, there's black folks there.  Some places, it's "No, there aren't any black folks.  There aren't too many black folks there."  But, you can still go there and have a very good time, or have an interested time, if you're interested in what the world has to offer.  And, I think that's what we're trying, trying to show people.  There are things that we are very familiar with and that we've done for a long time and many people's families are very familiar with.  And, we try to talk about that because it's a very important part of our heritage.  But, there also some new areas that people are going into and you might be surprise to know that, you know, if you decided to pick up and go to this area, there is somebody doing this or showing you this or can teach you this.
Story_ID: 116154
Speaker 1: At one point--did you at all do any travel writing in your younger time in your career?
Speaker 2: Well, the very first article that I wrote that I got paid for was a travel piece.  It was about the trip that I took to Africa.  And, I originally, I keep a journal of my experiences going to Africa just to keep a journal because I was going.  And, when I came back with it, I thought, "Oh, maybe I'll try to write an article."  And, so, I wrote an article and I ended up sending it to The Black Collegian magazine.  And, they decided they were gonna, to publish it.  But, as it turned out, when they received it, I think they received it in January or February and they did travel like in December.  So, I had to wait a whole year before the article came out.  I think I was paid like fifty dollars.  But, I was so proud of that fifty dollar check because that meant I was a paid writer.  And, that was like, oh, it was really--and, one of the interesting things, it's always very interesting how articles reach different people.  When that article came out in Black Collegian magazine, I got a call, I was at the time I think I was at Syracuse University when the article came out.  And, I got a call from a guy attending college in Columbia University in New York City who was from the Gambia.  And, he was just so fascinated that here was this article about his country.  And, he called basically just to tell me thank you and just to say that, you know, I read this article you wrote talking about my country and this is really wonderful and thank you for writing that.  And, it was just, WOW, you know, that was, that was kind of a nice little moment for me.
Speaker 1: So, do you travel to these places just so that you can have the information to write the articles?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  I mean, travel is one of my personal passions.  I love to travel and if you say, do you wanna go around the corner?  And, like, yeah, let's go see, let's go see what up.  I like traveling in the United States.  I like traveling in Atlanta [Georgia].  I like traveling.  I like trying to find out new things that I didn't know were there and, so, yeah, I travel throughout the country.  A lot in the Southeast.  But, also, you know, I said, I've gone on press trips to Montana.  I've gone to Mexico.  I've gone to Canada.  I've stayed at the Ice Hotel in [Quebec City, Quebec] Canada and actually slept in an Ice Hotel that was completely made of ice.  And, that, that was probably one of my most unique experiences.  And, you know, and som--and I do these things to, I'm not a person who likes the cold, so it's very interesting I would do something like that.  But, I do these things to be able to write about them and tell people what it's like to do something, what it's like to stay there.  And, I really try to give people a true sense of what these destinations are for them maybe to think about going someplace like that or for them just to, to read the article and think, Wow, it's really kind of interesting, you know.
Speaker 1: What is the Ice Hotel?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It's a full ice hotel.  They build it, they build it every December and they knocked it down every April.  And, then they rebuild ano--a new one.  And, pretty much every part of the hotel is made of ice.  They--people always ask the questions it's like, and I did to, I asked the questions before I went, it's like, "Well, what about the bathrooms?"  The bathroom is actually in a trailer.  So, you actually go into a little building for the public restrooms.  And, that's the only really warm place in the Ice Hotel.  But, the bed is made of blocks of ice.  And, there's a little layer of plywood.  And, there's a little foam mattress.  And, then they throw some type of pelt, some type of animal pelts, and then you sleep in a sleeping bag on top of the pelts.  So, it's pretty darn cold (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, it's one of those--it's a great experience.  It's a great, it's a great, it's a great thing to see, and do, and write about.
Speaker 1: So, you also have articles with chefs and decorating your home.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, are you a decorator, also?
Speaker 2: At--no, no--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I watch, I spend in my dorm room, I spend a lot of time watching cooking shows, and home improvement shows on TV.  And, and I, and I have done a bit of painting here in my home, and some boarders and things like that.  And, I do, I do like a tackle hands-on kinds of jobs.  But, I wouldn't my no means say that I'm a, I'm a decor--I like to experiment with some things and dabble with a little this and that.  But, it's, it's, it's a nice different type of thing to do to get away from writing sometimes.

Speaker 1: So, you really, at this point, it seems like you're happy with what you're doing.  Why do you do what you do?
Speaker 2: In terms of writing, in terms of the magazine and the types of stories that we try to tell, I think it's really important for us to share information about the full range of, of people and experiences and passions that African American people have.  And, through "Atlanta Goodlife" magazine, that's one of the things I get to do every month.  I get to look around the community and look for something new and different.  You know, they opened a Georgia aquarium.  We found a black diver who was part of a volunteer who was down there, African American diver who was helping to do maintenance in the tanks in his diving gear.  That may be a story that wouldn't've been told if our publication wasn't around.  Other publications may pick and choose which African American stories they're going to tell.  And, we pick and choose also, but we're gonna tell far more stories 'cause our stories are just focused on, on those people and those experiences.  And, there so many great folks out here doing so many wonderful things.  And, the calls we get in the office sometimes about people thanking us.  People who have nothing to do with those stories but who will read the story and say, "Thank you so much for telling us the story about the judge who, you know, has gone through these, these difficult times and how he's overcome dealing with this."  Or, "Thank you for the story about this person and how they did that, that, you know, touched me in such a way."  So, you know, we, we take a lot of pride in finding those stories, telling those stories, and putting out a publication where we put as much emphasis into the writing as the photography and, you know, trying to make it really something that we can be proud of and people who read our publication can be proud of also.
Story_ID: 116156
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna talk a little bit about the Champion Newspaper also.  Because, it's been around for a very long time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, people that live in the community think of it almost, you know, how black folks say the Jet magazine used to be the Bible.  If it's, if it's, if it's in there, it's true.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: If it's (laughter), the Champion magazine, I mean, I'm sorry, newspaper is an institution like that--
Story_ID: 115534
Speaker 1: I was telling you how the community feels about Champion maga--newspaper, I'm sorry.  Tell me about the, the newspaper, I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The Champion, you know, the Champion started as a publication focusing on the African American community.  And, over time, the publishers, Earl and [HM] Carolyn Glenn, extended their vision of the publication to include the entire population of DeKalb County [Georgia].  So, the "Champion" changed several years ago.  And, started focusing on trying the cover the news of what was happening in DeKalb that affected everybody.  So, today, we pride ourselves on covering all the news that is important that needs to be shared, documented--the Champion is the legal organ in DeKalb County.  So, we're the publication that all the official information that needs to be shared, you know, in corporations, foreclosures, name changes, that type of legal information has to be published in the Champion Newspaper.  In terms of the legal notices and then we have the editorial side where we go and gather information about things going on with county government, education, health services, interesting colorful people.  And, we try our best to represent the full spectrum of people living in DeKalb.  DeKalb is one of the most--is the most diverse, ethnically-diverse county in the State of Georgia.  So, we try, we pride ourselves on trying to find and tell and share those stories about the full array of folks who, who call this county home.
Speaker 1: I know that there's a section in the newspaper where you allow residents to, or, anybody I guess, to write in and you publish their articles.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, now, you're probably talking about on the editorial, the opinion pages--
Speaker 1: Opinion.
Speaker 2: Where we encourage, well, we certainly encourage people to write letters to the editor and, you know, let us know what's important to them.  And, you know, that's just kind of one of the responsibilities of a newspaper to give their readers an opportunity to voice their views on things.  It can be things that we've written about or things that they just care about.  But, give them an opportunity to write and express their views.  So, that's what we do on our Editorial Pages.  And, you know, we, we, we've been please too.  We look for those letters to come in to share with our readers.
Speaker 1: Do you ever get people who might have shared their opinion and then the next week is somebody else that has a different opinion from that?  Well, I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Does it ever get to a, I don't wanna say a battle, but?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, you know, you have, you have the times where someone takes exception to what another person says, disagrees with them, and then they write in.  You get sometimes where people disagree with what you've written.  In terms of, you know, they, they have a different point of view than what they see on the editorial pages.  Or, there's some article or the way we've covered something, and they want to come write about it.  So, you know, sometimes it just them stating their, their support or opposition to something going on in the county.  And sometimes their taking ourselves or somebody else to task for something that they disagree with, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 115535
Speaker 1: All right, is there anything else you wanna share about the newspaper?  What about the staff?
Speaker 2: Oh, we've got a--you know, we have a, we have a really wonderful, very diverse--we always kind of laugh, because we always kind of laugh about, there's kind of divide in the staff among the younger staffers and some of us who are a little more seasoned.  And, so, we're always kind of laughing like, often times when I'm writing an article, you know, I'm in my fifties, so when I'm writing an article about some, and it usually a hip hop artist whose name I can't pronounce or don't even really know who he is.  And, I'll go to, some of our younger staffers, Kameisha [ph.] Hunter, Travis Hutchins [ph.], and I'll say, "So, about this Jeezy person," and they'll kind of laugh at me.  Or, you know, I'm pronouncing Kanye West's name incorrectly and they have to correct me, or they--and, I'll ask, you know, "Is this person really [unclear], are they really doing this?  So, then he--"You haven't heard of 'em?"  Or, you know, so--and, then in time we're often educating them about things that they're not aware of.  And, often times in the newspaper business about how things used to be, how we used to have to do.  You know, now they've got Photoshop and they've got all these things.  They have their things that they can manipulate.  And, we talk about, you know, we used to actually lay the pages down on the page.  And, we used to have to cut out, and they're like, "What?" And then, you know, so, we, we're always laughing about, you know, the younger and the older staffers.  But, we have a--our staff is very mixed, you know.  We have African Americans and white reporters and editors and photographers and it's a mixed group on the editorial side and on the legal side of the paper.  Those people who handle the placement of the legals and our advertising staff and accounting.  So, we've--it's kind of a small staff but a good group of people and really work cooperatively together, with our goal being to put out the best newspaper we can, make sure it comes out.  It comes out each and every week.  You can count on it being out there on Thursdays, you know.  We have our deadlines every Tuesday and then with "Goodlife" it's a monthly magazine so we kind of work on that, producing that once a month.  But, you know, we hit our crunch times and we, we do a good job.  I'm really proud it.
Speaker 1: These publications are free.  How, how does that, how do you, how you, how are you able to make this a free publication?
Speaker 2: Well, not all of the publications are free.  Goodlife is a free publication.  It is supported through its advertising.  But, yes, you can pick it up, there's no charge.  I mean, if you want a subscription, we can.  There is a charge to have the newspaper mailed directly to somebody.  But, if you just wanna pick it up at the newsstand or at a Kroger or a Publix store, you can pick it up.  The Champion and Free Press; there is the Free Press which is free and it carries some of the stories but not all of the stories that are taken place in the county.  But, that is free and that's a smaller publication.  And, there's The Champion newspaper which it costs .50 cents.  But, in all the publications, you know, there's advertising so there's advertising through the publications.  But, with The Champion newspaper it also has the legals that, that go in there that are then paid for, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, it's a, it's a wonderful service for the community.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Well, we think so.  We, we work real hard to make it good service.
Story_ID: 115536
Speaker 1: So, outside of working so very hard --
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: To put these publications out.
Speaker 2: I know that you're on--work with a number of organizations.  You wanna tell me about those?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One of the organizations, I mean, I'm heavily involved in my church.  I got--I attend a small church here in Stone Mountain [Georgia], Crossroads Christian Community Church.  We have a small congregation but we're growing.  We have some big plans to do something and Charles Bennafield who's our pastor is planning to take us from a smaller congregation and moving us to--we've purchased some land, on 124 and we have some plans to, to build a church there.  So, I'm very much involved with, with our church and the things that we're working on.  There's also an organization, I'm not current on the board but I used to be on the board of the Atlanta Day Shelter for Women and Children.  And, I was board-chair for a couple of years.  But, that's an organization that I have, even though I'm not on the board any longer, I continue to support it, fini--in a number of ways over the years.  Sometimes financial, sometimes as a volunteer.  I've gotten my church involved and we've gone down and we've cooked dinners.  And, it's a, and it's a shelter, it's a day shelter.  Which is when a woman is homeless, when a woman and her children are homeless, and they stay at a shelter at night, when in the morning when those shelters close, they have to leave.  Well, if you're homeless, where do you go during the daytime?  The day shelter exists to provide a home where these women can come to, they can have a place to get their mail.  They have a place where they can get some job training, computer skills training.  They can get coupon--they can get tokens so they can go on job interviews.  They can wash their clothes and their children have an area to play in.  There's a close closet.  There are meals that are prepared.  And, that's where you go during the day, and, then it closes, I guess around four or five in the afternoon.  And, then you head out on a bus and go to a shelter you go to at night.  And, so, that's an organization I've been involved with and--for a long time.  And, I'm just had been very pleased with the work they do 'cause they touch a lot of lives, day in and day out, a lot of lives.
Story_ID: 115537
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you had a daughter [Imani Gay], but you also remarried, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My husband--I'm married to Cedric Gay and we, we've been married for, we married in 1989, so we've been married for quite a few years.  And, we have kind of an interesting situation at this point in our marriage in that, he is working in Maryland, and we have kind of a commuter marriage.  He comes home every couple of weeks.  We go up there.  We spend summers up there.  And, so, it's just kind of a, you know, you take a job where you can.  He's a computer programming analyst.  He works for the [U.S.] Treasury Department.  And, so, you know, we--we'll travel up there.  He'll travel home.  Sometimes we, when we were dating we used to meet in the middle, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  But, and then some, when he can and I have an opportunity to travel, we travel together when I'm doing some of the travel writing.  And, you know, it's, it's all very, very fun and very interesting.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Did he go with you to the Ice Castle [sic Ice Hotel in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada]?
Speaker 2: No, he did not (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, he did not.  But, he's--we--we traveled when I've, when I traveled to Mexico, he went on that trip with me and we had a really great time.  And, you know, he gets to--sometimes when I get to do interviews, I think, he'd probably say that, when I--when he had a chance to hang out a little bit with Evander Holyfield, when I was in the process of interviewing him, he felt that was, that was pretty interesting.  And, so, you know, he gets to kind of hang around with some the celebrity people some of the times when I have an opportunity to do interviews for 'em, doing meet and greets, and that type of thing.
Story_ID: 115538
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.
Speaker 1: That we didn't talk about?
Speaker 2: That we haven't talked about so far.  I guess, one of the things that I don't think we touched on that I think was a important moment for me was back with--and I, I'm really bad on recalling years.  Back in, I believe it must've been 1987 or maybe 1984 where there were the marches that took place in Forsyth County [Georgia, in 1987].  You know, there were, they're, one of the things that I think is that I so enjoy about living in the Atlanta [Georgia] area is that you have an opportunity to be involved in so many--it's not, it's not difficult in Atlanta to be involved, to get connected, to you know, in a way we have, it has a s--a small city feel and it's, you have easy access to get involved in things.  You really just kind of say, yeah, I wanna take a part in that, and sign up and become involved.  And, you know, Hosea Feed the Hungry or the march, when they had the march in Forsyth County.  And, I thought it was important.  I didn't take part in the first march, but when the second march when people were treated so badly when they went to Forsyth County, and they were treated so badly.  And, and I took part in that march, 'cause I think it's important for us to find those things that we think are important to us and to find a way to get involved.  And, and, and I think it's fairly easy to do that in Atlanta.  Unlike some other cities where it's, it may be a little bit more difficult to become a part of things that are taking place.  In Atlanta, it's not very difficult at all.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about the march.  Tell me what happened.
Speaker 2: Well, we boarded buses in Atlanta [Georgia].  Took the ride, which was a long ride.  And, on the ride, it was very interesting 'cause the tone went from, of kind of when people got on the buses initially people were kind of laughter and joking, and kind of jovial and all like that.  And, you know, we're going up Forsyth County and we're gonna let these people know that, you know, they can't treat--a smaller group of people had gone there to, to march and rally and they were treated badly, you know.  Pelted and, and yelled at, and kind of almost run out, run out of the city.  And, so, I think a couple weeks later a larger group, thousands of black and white and brown people went back to Forsyth County to say, "Oh, no, you can't treat people this way."  And, but, when I--when we were on the buses headed up there, the tone went from being very laughing and joking, where then I guess someone on the buses started kind of giving us orders about, you know, take off you jewelry and this, that and the other.  And, things to be careful of.  And, to stay in this type of a group when we're marching and walking.  And, you kind of got the sense of, oh, my gosh, this could be really serious.  And, you know, I've gotta be very careful and all like that.  And, but, you know, we went up there and we marched and we walked and I think we, we--there were thousands of people who were there.  And, that was I think a very inspiring things for me see and be a part of because I wasn't, at the time that I was coming up, I didn't take part in any marches or rallies or things such as that.  Because it was, you know, I was, I was at a point where I lived and where I--and the age that I was, it wasn't anything going where I was involved in it.  So, that was, that was an opportunity for me to kind of be involved.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the leaders?
Speaker 2: Hosea Williams, I believe he was one of the main leaders from what I can recall.  He, and I don't remember, he took, it might have been a couple of dozen people up there the first, the first time.  And, then when they went back it was thousands of other people.  So, it was pretty important.
Speaker 1: So, they weren't, wasn't any trouble when you went the second time, when you went?
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall and not in the area where I was walking and marching.  I don't, I don't remember they--I think they had out--there were a lot of law enforcement was out there to make sure that nothing went off.  And, to my understanding I think it went off as a successful march and rally.
Story_ID: 115539
Speaker 1: Did you see people on the side of street watching the march [Forsyth County, Georgia, 1987]?  Anybody yelling out any?--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, there were people on the sides who kind of didn't--yeah, yeah, there was, there was that going on.  But, you know, it was kind of like, we were marching, we were singing, we were--we had our slogans and all like that.  And, yeah, there was, there was some of that going on.
Speaker 1: How, how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: It was, I think it was, it was very much, you know, eye opening to be in the midst of it, not just kind of watching it from--going--watching it on TV.  Or, was seeing, but to actually be there and realized that, this is, this is, this is a tense situation and not everybody has the welcoming cart about people coming into their community.  And, it was a little, a little scary but, you know, it was kind of one of those, well, you know.  Sometimes you just have to be scared to make your point and pray for the best and everything kind of went well.
Speaker 1: Why did you pick that march to go on?  What, what were your feelings about the idea, was it the idea that this county just didn't have any black people that lived there, or why did you pick this time and this march to attend?
Speaker 2: Because the when I saw the report of the people who went up there the first time who were there to say, "This community, this county should be more welcoming.  This community should be more open" and so forth.  And, when I saw how they were treated and how ugly it was, and it was just, it was, I couldn't believe that that was happening in the 1980s.  It was, there's something very, very wrong here.  And, this, this, you know, and so, then when I heard that there was a movement afoot to, we're gonna go back and we're gonna take more folks with us.  I thought it was important for me to--I should be one of those people.  I should be--there's no reason why I shouldn't be.  I'm, I'm at a point my life when I can, I'm not too young, I'm too, you know, it's not distant, it's not--I, it's right here.  It's just a couple miles away from where I live and I should be there.  And, I think for all of us there are certain times when you kind of feel like, this is the time for me to take part, to step up, to do, you know, and, and you feel as though--and I felt as though it was important for me to go there.
Speaker 1: Did you ever write anything about this?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't--at the time, I believe my, let's see, I believe my--I wasn't working for a news organization.  I think I was, at the time this happened, I believe I was, I believe I was working for the hospital.  Either that or I was working for General Motors, I can't remember what, what as the year.  But, I, and I think I must have been working for the hospital [Scottish Rite Medical Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, no, I wasn't working for any--I don't think, I think, don't think I wrote about that.  I don't think I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 115540
Speaker 1: Just one questions, I'm curious about, do you keep a journal?
Speaker 2: I don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I don't.  I think--and I'll, I'll tell you reason why.  I write so much every day, you know.  I mean, I have to write an opinion piece every single week.  Two opinion pieces when the magazine's [Atlanta Goodlife] coming out.  'Cause I have to write an editor's message and I have to write an editorial or an opinion for the newspaper.  And, I do all that writing of a--so, it's like, no.  When I get (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, I don't do any--I don't write or keep a journal at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't keep a journal at all.
Story_ID: 115541
Speaker 1: What is something that you haven't done that you still wanna do in life?
Speaker 2: Haven't done, but still want to do.  There are still places I haven't traveled to.  I mean, I kind of keep a little, a little map where I kind of put all the place--I haven't been to every state in the United States, which is something I'd certainly like to do.  I'd like to visit every state in the United States.  And, I don't know if there's time enough to visit every country.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But, set foot on maybe every continent might be, might be goal.  I know that there is something else for me to do beyond the writing that I'm doing now.  And, I'm not sure what it is.  But, I kind of feel as though, the time is coming for me to do something else.  I've tried my hand at kind of trying to write some plays.  And, I don't think I've ever gotten--you know, people always, people always ask writers, "Are you gonna write a book one day?"  It's like, maybe, maybe not, who knows, we'll see.  But, I think there's maybe a natural progression to go on to do something else.  I do have an interest in new media, in the next generation in terms of what they're gonna be interested in.  You know, magazines and newspapers, it very interesting, a young my--among my younger colleagues, they gather so much more their information from the internet.  And, you know, they don't rely on say, you know, newspapers and magazines quite as much as my generation has.  So, I'm very much interesting in looking at some ways to developing new vehicles to deliver the same, telling stories and sharing information and letting you know what people think and do.  But, in some of these new age, you know, e-magazines, e-zines, I think they call 'em e-zines.  And, magazines on the internet, that you'd find, that you just pull the whole thing up on the internet.  That's kind of interesting to me.  So, it's like, well, maybe there's something there.  One, one thing that I have not written about, I tried to write about; a couple of years ago, several years ago, my family was the victim of a home invasion.  And, that's something I've tried several times to write about and I haven't been successful in writing about it.  So, I think in time, there'll be something that I want to share and will be able to tell it in the way I really want to tell it.  But, so far, I haven't been able to, so, you know.  I've written some opinion pieces generally about, you know, crime and youth and all that type of thing.  But, I haven't really, haven't, haven't explored it as, as much as I kind of think, well, I probably should and will one day.
Story_ID: 115542
Speaker 1: What messages or lessons do you have for, for your children [Jean-Pierre Chery and Imani Gay]?
Speaker 2: Hopefully, a lot.  But, I think, I think, for my children in, yes, I go around and when I'm speaking to, to young people whether it's at a junior high, even elementary school, and high school, and college kids, the thing that I always try to say, and I've talked about it a little bit, is finding your passion in life.  That, you know, we spend so much time of our lives on jobs.  And, if it's just a job, if you're just doing something either because the money's good or because, well, this is, this is what I found to do, if you haven't really found your passion, I think that's, that's such a shame.  Because that's such a large portion of your life that you're doing something that you, you know, you're not passionate about.  And, I always tell young people, if you find the thing that you would do whether they paid you or not, that you'd do just because you get such a kick out of it, because, you really enjoy it.  Not saying that every day is gonna be wonderful and great but that you think that's important.  The work you find is important and you know you can do it well, you basically will never have a day at work.  Even though every day won't be rosy.  You're enjoy and you'll feel as though you're doing worthwhile work.  And, that's what I think is important for all of us to try to find.  And, it's never too late to find it.  And, then the other thing is just that there are so many possibilities of things that you can do in your life, ways you can help people, things you can explore.  And, if you get used to just thinking about what do I wanna do and how can I do it, and how can find the way to do it.  And, you get comfortable with the idea of learning to ask for what you want knowing that, you know, get used to people telling you, no.  I mean, in my job with Goodlife [magazine], we, we ask everybody for everything.  We'd like to do a cover story.  We wanna do this for you.  And, and so many people tell us, no.  But, so many more people tell us, yes.  And, so if--you have to kinda get used to the idea, I'm gonna ask for a lot of things and some people--I have no problem when you say, no.  You can't do that, no, I'm interested in, in doing an interview.  Or, no, you can't come and do that.  But, then a lot of time people are telling you, yes.  So, if you learn to get comfortable with, no, it's just, no.  It's nothing more than that.  And, but, sometimes people will say, yes, you can.  Or, people will say, well, you can't do all of that, but here's what you can do, they kind of meet you halfway, or kind of meet you somewhere in between.  And, if you learn to do that, you'll--it'll kind of open a lot of opportunities to you.  And, you'll feel as though, you're in command of your life, and, and I think that's a good place to be.

Speaker 1: When you look over your life, is there anything that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting questions.  My daughter [Imani Gay] asked me that recently in the car, we were driving, she was asking me if--what would I do differently.  And, I, I started kind of naming a couple of things.  I said, "Well, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not big on regrets."  I try to live my life doing what I think really is good, is important.  'Cause I think it's--I just don't wanna live a life where I'm saying, "Oh, I shouldn't have, or I wish I'd only, I wish I could do it over again."  I, but, I, you know, I was pointing out to her.  I said, "Well, you know, there are things that were tough and unpleasant," or, maybe I could even look and say, "Well, I wasn't so smart or this and that and the other."  But, I learned something from it.  And, so, if I were to go and say, "I never should have done that, and shouldn't had that relationship, I shouldn't have done that."  Well, then maybe I wouldn't be the person I am today because some of those things helped to mold you.  So, for the most part, I can't say that there's anything.  I mean, every--there are so many things I can look at and say, "That was something that was a stepping stone, or that gave me the experience, or that taught me."  So, no, I'm not, I'm not one who, who lives with a lot sense of regrets.  So, no, not really.

Speaker 1: What do you want to see in, maybe even changes, or improvements, in relationships in the African American community?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, that's a (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh.  A little more tolerance, kindness, understanding.  I mean, it's kind of, it sounds so simple, but it breaks my heart every time, I, I read so many stories in so many newspaper and on TV about tragedies.  You know, people who have lost their lives.  Or, involved in shooting, or some type of tragic situation that has come because people were intolerant of each other.  Or, people didn't give, you know, people didn't try to be understanding of another person's situation.  Or, you know, these things where it's, you know, you hear, you hear the news report, and then you think, "That didn't have to happen that way.  That person didn't have to lose their life.  And, that person didn't have to lose their child or"--because of these very things.  And, so, I just wish that sometimes we wouldn't be--that emotions wouldn't get to the point where people would react in some of the ways that they do.

Speaker 1: Have you thought about a legacy? I know you'll still young--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You've got lots of years left.  But, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That's a very good question.  What do I want my legacy to be?  I suppose I want my legacy to be that, in terms of journalism, that I was involved in telling stories accurately, with integrity.  That hopefully, I added to giving life to the broad range of, of story, stories and experiences of African American people that, I think are so important for us not to lose sight of, not to feel as though, the things that we do, the things that we care about, how we do them, are less than what anyone else does.  I think it's important for us to hear all these great stories because without them in a publication like ours, and other African American publications, it could be easy to believe the things that you hear.  I mean, not saying these things aren't true, to believe that all that we're out here doing are the negative things that show up on the news oftentimes.  And, it's like, there are so many folks out here who are leading their families, leading their communities, who care, who are, you know, are handling things in wonderful, wonderful ways.  And, those stories need to be told and people need to know that is what's taking place in our communities.  And our--the slice of life,  of black life is a, is a beautiful, wonderful thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I'd like my legacy to be.
