Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My full name is Espriela Don Sarreals, Jr.  Espriela is spelled E-S-P-R-I-E-L-A, Don is D-O-N, Sarreals, S-A-R-R-E-A-L-S, Jr.
Speaker 1: And now there's a story behind your name, right?
Speaker 2: There is a story behind my name.  On my father's side they came from slavery in the south.  My father, my father's father, my grandfather was named John Sarreals, but he named my father Espriela to make him sound Spanish.  He thought that sounding Spanish would make it easier for him to get jobs in those days and so he passed it on to me.  But I didn't like it.  I didn't learn that my name was Espriela, Jr. till we started school and then my mother said you know you are not a boy anymore, now you're Espriela.  And that's the first time that I learned about Espriela myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you use in school?
Speaker 2: I was forced to use it in school because you have to turn in the birth certificate.  I so used it originally but later in life I switched my name to simply first initial E., middle name Don, last name Sarreals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did it, just a follow up on that, did the name work for your father?  Did it help him get jobs he wouldn't have been able to get otherwise or did people--were people confused about who he was?
Speaker 2: I think it may have helped in the first instance but more important was how he carried himself in the jobs I believe.  So he had a changeable career let's put it but I think it may have helped when he sent in a notice and the words Espri--name Espriela was there.  It probably gave him a fighting chance to get a job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now sir what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is September 22nd, 1931 in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  At that time my father was teaching in Winston Salem and Winston Salem was my mother's home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what is your title and occupation?
Speaker 2: I am retired now.  I, professionally I am a meteorologist and have served in many capacities in meteorology.  First, it was as a lecturer at the City College of New York in meteorology, then as weather radar supervisor at the weather bureau office in New York City.  After that ended, I moved to Washington, D.C. for a job with National Broadcasting Company Station, WRC TV as a television meteorologist.  When that ended, I moved back to the Weather Service but in Washington, D.C. and I undertook projects.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is January 15th, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the moment, we are in a retirement community known as Leisure World in Silver Springs, Maryland.  This is a gated community with a lot of recreational facilities.
Story_ID: 25119
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up.  But they don't--they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: First question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food right now is fish, basically flounder if I can get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is autumn.
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination was any of the southern beaches of the United States.  I enjoy that very much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess it's "Oh My God!"  I do that.
Story_ID: 25120
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father side, but separately so we can keep them straight.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Certainly.
Speaker 1: So can you give me first, your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Sadie Beatrice Sarreals, that's S-A-D-I-E Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E Scales, S-C-A-L-E-S.
Speaker 1: Then Sarreals, okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in April 10, 2003.
Speaker 1: 1903?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: 1903.
Speaker 1: Okay, right she's very young.  Yeah, all right 1903.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in North Carolina.  It was never completely identified to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you suppose it was near Winston Salem [North Carolina] or --?
Speaker 2: It was near Winston Salem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can only trace my mother's family actually back to my mother's, own mother, my grandmother and my grandfather.  I was not told a lot about what happened before that except for the fact that the Scales family came from slavery.  The slave master in question was named Scales.  In fact that person was Governor [Alfred Moore] Scales of North Carolina at one time.  And so there were a large number of Scales in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And about, do you know about what time Governor Scales was the Governor of North Carolina?  Was that--?
Speaker 2: It was never told to me but it was a generation or two earlier I believe that--and the rest of my family formed after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that should be an easy thing to look up online, yeah.
Speaker 2: It should be.  It should be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Governor Scales in North Carolina was a large slave holder you said?
Speaker 2: Right.  And so there were many former slaves named Scales and my mother's family was just one of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was any of your mother's family as far as you know, actually related to Governor Scales?
Speaker 2: They were not actually related.  Unfortunately it was through the acts of slave owners on ladies that this family was you know created.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's possible there's a biological connection to the Scales family?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, there is a biological connection between people you would call white Scales and African American Scales in North Carolina.  And we have seen some of them on the news in the past and you could see the likeness of some facial characteristics between the people in my mother's family and those who came from the slave owners.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now is there a story in that Scales history about what happened during emancipation [1863] or reconstruction [1863-1877]?
Speaker 2: It was never related to me.  I just knew the active family at that time.  My grandfather worked in a Camel cigarette factory in Winston Salem, North Carolina and my grandmother was in charge of a very large family so she remained at home.
Story_ID: 25121
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was William Mitchell Scales.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he worked for Camel cigarettes and--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I should add mainly called the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  Now did they live in the Winston part or the Salem part of Winston Salem [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I would have no way of knowing that but I only know that we only--we lived only two or three miles from the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Factory because my grandfather walked to work everyday with a lunch pail in his hand and came home walking each day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know that we were told last spring that the Salem part is the old part of Winston Salem I think or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And there's a new--that's how it's divided up.  The Salem part is the old part and the Winston part is the newer part.
Speaker 2: Right, that was, to be honest that was never you know relayed to me as a child.  You know I left Winston Salem basically at an early age.  I used to return in summers to play between school, but I did not have an adult life in Winston Salem where I gathered all of the facts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know they showed us a big coffee pot or something downtown and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's there.  Okay.  So now what about your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Pardon me.  My grandmother's name oh, my grandmother was--I didn't know her middle name.  She was also Sadie Scales.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother was a junior in some ways (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She was really a junior and I guess there were so many children she ran out of names.
Speaker 1: So how many children did your grandmother have?
Speaker 2: It must have been in the order of eight or nine children.
Story_ID: 25122
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] then grow up in Winston Salem [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in Winston Salem, went to school in Winston Salem.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your--did your mother tell you any stories about growing up, about what life was like for her when she was a student and--?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately no, she never--I, only thing I know about my mother that she was a good student and took the equivalent of some college classes.  I don't know what they called the black schools in those days but she was able to originally get a secretarial job before you know being married and becoming a mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think Winston Salem College [North Carolina] I think was a state teacher's college before the early--
Speaker 2: Well that's now in fact (unclear).  I was born on September 22nd, 1931 at 514 Brew Street in Winston Salem, North Carolina.  That property is now part of Winston Salem State University.  It once was called Winston Salem Teachers College before it expanded.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your mother go to school there or was it some other college?
Speaker 2: No, it had another name.  I would have--maybe I can find some information, fill that in for you (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's all right.  We'll just--so she had some college and then she became a secretary, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And do you know who she worked for?
Speaker 2: No, this information actually I only got from her obituary about the details of her early life.  As a little boy we never you know I never talked about that.  She was just mother, a wonderful, beautiful mother, outstanding cook and very loving.  But we never went into great personal details.
Story_ID: 25123
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let me go to your father's side then.  Can you give me your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Espriela Don Sarreals, that's E-S-P-R-I-E-L-A Don, D-O-N Sarreals, S-A-R-R-E-A-L-S, of course Senior.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth I think was October 1st, 1901.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1901.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: I believe he was born in the State of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have any idea where?
Speaker 2: No, I have no idea.   The family moved to Michigan at a very early point, Grand Rapids, Michigan, he probably raised most of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the family moved to Grand Rapids.  Is there a story about why they moved to Grand Rapids?
Speaker 2: Because of racism and slavery and you know that affects--and to have a better opportunity at life.  My father moved on to go to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and get his degrees.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there, are there any stories at all on your father's side about the slavery days and about emancipation [1863] or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.  My father was very secretive to be honest and never relayed much information.  While living in New York City my grandfather on my father's side visited twice, but we never had a detailed conversation on their past.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your grandfather lived in Grand Rapids?
Speaker 2: In Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his name was John Sarreals?
Speaker 2: His name was John Sarreals.
Speaker 1: Now did your father have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: My father had a sister named Escobedo Sarreals, E-S-C-O-B-E-D-O Sarreals and that points out to a great error my grandfather made.
Speaker 1: Oh, now what--tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well later when I went to Junior High School I found out in Spanish the O is masculine and the A is feminine.  And when I first, when I found that out I went home crying.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it does seem that that's--he got them backwards.
Speaker 2: He got them backwards.
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: So he was trying desperately to make them sound Spanish but he made a huge error.
Speaker 1: So you would have, you should have been Escobedo or--
Speaker 2: Or Esprielo.
Speaker 1: Esprielo, yeah.
Speaker 2: Esprielo.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And yeah so that's--yeah I've thought about that.  I'm not a Spanish expert but I thought that that probably--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --something that happened.  So yeah, named Escobedo they called her Sarreals.  And were there any other siblings for your father?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge.  And my father was questioned about details on his family life.  The only thing that I learned that in his youth while working, I think working perhaps in the summer in a wood factory, he cut off the tips of, some of the fingers on his left hand and he regretted that all his life.  But he was still able to play tennis very vigorously.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was he right handed?
Speaker 2: He was right handed so it did not inhibit him from you know writing and so forth and typing and so forth was not big in those days so he could write and carry out his duties on the job.
Story_ID: 25124
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your father say [Espriela Don Sarreals], did he say anything about growing up in Grand Rapids [Michigan]?  Or--now he grew up partially in Mississippi and partially in Grand Rapids?
Speaker 2: His time was apparently fairly brief.  At an early age they moved, found a way to move out of Mississippi and obviously the racism there and the limitations as to what jobs you could get.  In other words, my grandfather on my father's side did not want my father just to push a broom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about how he got, he matriculated through the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  That seems to be, that seemed to be--that should be an interesting story for those times cause--
Speaker 2: I had one picture a long time ago.  He apparently was a third string player on a Michigan football team.  I saw one picture and he told me about it but I--unfortunately he was not a person to pass along details.
Speaker 1: Now what career did your father pursue?  Was he--at the University of Michigan, what did he major in?
Speaker 2: The first thing that I knew about and how he met my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales], he was actually teaching at a public school in Winston Salem and that's how my father and mother met.  Later he was to be hired by a African American college in Atlanta, Georgia and my mother and father moved there and they gave birth to my oldest sister Satia, S-A-T-I-A.
Speaker 1: S-H--?
Speaker 2: S-A-T-I-A, Satia Sarreals.
Speaker 1: Okay, Satia Sarreals, okay.
Speaker 2: That was in 1928.  I was born in 1931.  My father was still teaching at, I can't remember the--
Speaker 1: Was it Clark Atlanta [University]?
Speaker 2: It wasn't--not Clark Atlanta.  Actually I visited there, what's the other one?
Speaker 1: Morris Brown?
Speaker 2: Morris Brown [College].  Morris Brown.  I actually visited Clark Atlanta late in my life to try to help them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he--what did he teach, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I have no idea honestly what he taught.  And the interesting thing was as part of his payroll they gave him a large one room apartment with a small bathroom and maybe a closet and the stove was in the same room and the bedroom was the living room and the dining room.  And my mother and father took my oldest sister Satia down with them but when I was born I was too young to go so I stayed with some of my aunts in Winston Salem [North Carolina].  When I got a chance to visit once when my uncle Raymond drove to Atlanta [Georgia] to bring my sister home for the summer so she could play with friends and to give my parents a break and so I saw this room, unbelievable.  The room had one giant electric cord extending from the ceiling.  There was a light on that and I think a couple of plugs.  That was the only source of electricity in the room.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was Atlanta in 1928.  So--oh (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, my sister--
Speaker 1: Oh that's right.
Speaker 2: I was born in 1931.  I would say that would be like 1934, I was about three years old when I got to visit them in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 25125
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now when you think about your parents' personalities and their dispositions, their sense of humor, their looks, how they moved, what their values were all about, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I take after my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] in many ways.  Biologically you inherit certain things within your body obviously that retain, that apply to your father [Espriela Don Sarrels].  But I think I'm about equal, split between the two of them.  I think I'm much more pleasant than he was but--for example I have a great, I had a great love of cooking and my mother was a cooking genius almost and so I inherited a little bit of that.  But I would say I'm--it's 50/50.  I think I'm a much more pleasant person than my father was.
Speaker 1: Did he have a tendency to get annoyed or was he--?
Speaker 2: My father beat me once a week.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He--the story goes that his father told him that when you married you should be very strict and he thought that discipline was finding something wrong and taking out a belt and give me a few whacks at least once a week.  That's the way I was brought up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's interesting.  I think a lot of African American households--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --had this handed as an ethic phase--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and probably too many have it now.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Finally, till I was about ten or eleven years old he said lay down on the bed and I said no.  In other words, masculinity reached me and if you're going to beat me, you're going to have to beat me standing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that about the end of it or--?
Speaker 2: That was the end of it.  He put down the belt and I walked back into the living room in that incident.
Story_ID: 25126
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have any early--?
Speaker 1: No, an earliest?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: The earliest childhood memory, an earliest one?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memories, I can, yes I can remember way back almost babyhood.  I remember once I had I guess the flu and I could barely breathe and I was tossing and turning.  And that's when my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] was down in Atlanta [Georgia] and my Aunt Lilly and Aunt Blanche took excellent care of me though and I survived that.  I remember that warmth and love.  I, and at Christmas time even though my parents were away, they would always fill a stocking with an apple and a little toy and a little piece of candy and give it to me and make me feel loved and feel the warmth.
Story_ID: 25127
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now can you describe for us the house you grew up in or if there were more than one you know tell us that.  And what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In, well first, born in Winston Salem [North Carolina], the sights and sounds were quite pleasant because all of my, many of my relatives were living there.  It was quite a crowded place, Uncle Herman, Uncle Raymond, Aunt Lillie, Aunt Blanche and so forth.  I don't know how they all slept in there.  But it was a warm place and they treated me kindly and they used to--the ladies used to tease me in the winter.  I would try to find an excuse to get into the kitchen and she would say, it's because we have the stove on you want to come and get warm.  But it was a warm feeling in that place.  After I left Winston Salem it was not so warm.  We first, when the family moved my father [Espriela Don Sarreals], my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales], my sister Satia and myself, we moved first into a rented rooms in an apartment house on Convent Avenue.  We stayed there for a year--
Speaker 1: This is in New York, right?
Speaker 2: In New York City, pardon me.
Speaker 1: Now about how old were you when--?
Speaker 2: I must have been--I wasn't quite ready for school yet.   Must have been four, five.
Speaker 1: Okay, so age four or five and--
Speaker 2: And then within--
Speaker 1: So the family, say you moved to Convent Avenue in Harlem [New York], in--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Harlem, okay.
Speaker 2: In Manhattan [New York], pardon me, Convent Avenue and strangely enough only about ten blocks away from a City College [CUNY] where I would have a great part of my career some day.  Then we moved only two blocks away to an apartment of our own at 24 St. Nicholas Place.  24 St. Nicholas Place.
Story_ID: 25128
Speaker 1: Now what brought the family to New York?
Speaker 2: Employment.  My father [Espriela Don Sarreals]  was hired let's see, what agency?  Let me think.  He was hired by the City of New York and perhaps I can look that up if you want.  I think I wrote it down earlier in the week and now I've forgotten it.  But he--my father was, you know had obtained a job in New York.  That's why we moved there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he worked for the City of New York?
Speaker 2: He worked originally for the City of New York but unfortunately he, with his personality he had a habit of losing the jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he had many different ones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] work too?
Speaker 2: At one point in our life my father had lost a job for so long that my mother had to take a temporary job just as a maid and a few hours, two or three days a week to add some income so we could eat.  And she was well liked because she was an outstanding cook, I mean exceptional, something that my daughter inherited.
Speaker 1: Okay, you say that's something that--
Speaker 2: It was cooking genius, not just she was good but I mean it was out, you know outstanding.
Speaker 1: Now we were staying before we started the interview that you said the Scales family had a knack for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know cooking from scratch.
Speaker 2: I mean it is actually something that can be biologically transferred because you know my daughter has it the same thing.  She can be cooking something.  She doesn't need a recipe and she can't tell you what the recipe is if you asked her because as she goes along she mentally makes changes to make sure that the particular item is perfect.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So how was--so you were only four or five but did you notice a difference between New York City and Winston Salem [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Very definitely the best way to describe it, my Uncle Raymond drove us to New York and as we passed the sign on the highway I looked out the window and I said, crying, no more Winston Salem now and I actually said that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you really liked Winston Salem?
Speaker 2: I liked Winston Salem and the relatives on my mother's side were so warm, attentive, would answer questions, would instruct wisely and so--so it was a beautiful situation, family situation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now kind--well in New York you didn't have as many relatives then I take it?
Speaker 2: In New York City fortunately, slowly some of our relatives began to move north.  My Aunt Lillie moved north and worked as a cook I believe.  My Aunt Blanche came up in summers.  She was a teacher and to get her masters degree she would come up, perhaps take one or two courses at a time so for many, many years she worked on that so I would see her every summer when she came up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my Aunt Blanche was a great assistance.  By the time I entered kindergarten I could read and write.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is in the--
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1937 or so?
Speaker 2: That would be it, yes.  And it's an interesting story about first going to school.  I don't know if this is a proper place?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, well go ahead.
Speaker 2: But the New York City school system based its starting date on--what's the September holiday?
Speaker 1: Labor Day.
Speaker 2: Labor Day, based on Labor Day and so it was--it had to be after Labor Day.  So one year school started like on the 5th of September.  They brought me to the school and because my birthday was the 22nd of September, they said I couldn't start.  My Aunt Blanche came to the school and said please, this boy can already read and write.  And we're talking about kindergarten, but they wouldn't let me in.
Speaker 1: So that's true you could read and write at age five?
Speaker 2: They--yes.  And my Aunt Lillie, I will back it up.  My Aunt Lillie, it was a birthday present or what but she gave me the first copy of the Superman Comic Book.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: And if I kept that, I'd be a millionaire I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jerry Segal and I can't think of the other guy.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that came up with it, but that, yeah that copy's worth a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Speaker 2: Should I tell you what I did with it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: There was a store on Amsterdam Avenue that would buy new comic books for two cents and then they would sell them for five or six cents.  So I took this comic book up there and I got two cents so I could buy some candy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you think of Superman at that point?
Speaker 2: It, oh it was wonderful but my Aunt looked inside and said they were using words that were too advanced for young children.  This is--words that although I could read I hadn't the slightest idea you know what some of those words meant in describing you know maybe his strength or whatever it was that Superman could do.  But I had no idea what some of the words meant.
Story_ID: 25129
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now here you are in Harlem [New York] during the, it's kind of the decline of the heyday of Harlem but it's still pretty much--Harlem's still pretty much in swing when you're a little kid growing up.  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was--yes.  Now St. Nicholas Place was right on what, the edge of what you'd call Harlem.  If you went over one block it was Edgecombe Avenue and then it was like a cliff that dropped off and the main part of Harlem was like forty, fifty feet below.  This is the beginning of what they call Washington Heights, just on the edge of it.  In fact, at the other end of St. Nicholas Place which ran from oh, 150th to 155th Street, it's very long, you were only a half mile from the, then the New York Giants' baseball stadium called the Polo Grounds.  It's gone now but it was a famous place at that time.
Speaker 1: Right, that's true.  Yeah, the Polo Grounds, right.  The Giants moved to San Francisco in the 50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Right.  And the Dodgers moved also.  That was heart breaking and they had many events there.  I think Joe Louis was going to fight there one day and further down the block he was sitting in a limousine waiting to be I guess driven to the Polo Grounds.  But all the children in the block were running down to see Joe Louis sitting in the limousine.
Speaker 1: So did you get a chance to see him?
Speaker 2: Yes, look in the window and see you know world boxing champion, Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: Did he say anything to--?
Speaker 2: Oh no, he was--no.  He was very, very still.  He was concentrating.  He wouldn't look out at anyone, just looked straight ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about--now Harlem was filled with celebrities when you were growing up.  What other notable people did you, you know see in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Sammy Davis, Junior's [Samuel George "Sammy" Davis, Jr., American entertainer] mother, I think she owned a restaurant or a bar near I think 155th Street.  I'm not quite sure of that.  But, and so he had been seen by some others who they told me before he became a star and his mother used to help him when he had difficulty eating I guess until suddenly he clicked you know and became a big star.  Duke Ellington [Edward Kennedy "Duke" Ellington, American composer, pianist, big band leader] at times when he was in New York would stay, let's see, 940, I think it was, would stay at 935 St. Nicholas Avenue.  In that was a doctor I later used to go to, Dr. Miller I believe it was.  Anyway, but he mentioned that Duke Ellington stayed in that building when he visited New York.  And let's see, between Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway at 158th Street, I think that's where Harry Belafonte [Harold George "Harry" Belafonte, Jr., American singer, songwriter, actor and social activist] originally lived.  This was a real, a neighborhood, explosive neighborhood for people who would move on into the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Amsterdam and Broadway, that's near Columbia [University] right, sort of?
Speaker 2: Well it runs down--yes.  It runs a long way you know north and south and very long avenues in you know in Manhattan [New York].  And so you know it went from you know poor to fairly you know wealthy apartment houses all along there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there's so many, actually there's so many famous people I can't remember all in an instant.
Story_ID: 25130
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can imagine.  Now did--well how would you describe yourself as a little kid growing up?  What were you interested in?  And now you could already read and write at age five.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Now one thing, now when we got the apartment I had to sleep in the living room.  That's where I slept all my life.  My second sister was born, sister Sonia and Sonia and Stasis slept in one room.  My father and mother in other bedroom, I slept in the living room which changes your personality some, you don't have a private place to go.  And since I had no privacy one thing I learned to do when I was young was to draw and my mother would get me paper.  First I would just draw then I started inventing cartoons, imitating the funny paper other words with a story, actually building a story.  I spent time doing that.
Speaker 1: So did you invent any characters?
Speaker 2: No.  The most famous to me, story, I--after World War II [1939-1945] started and they started you know talking about war and airplanes and so forth, I created a comic strip called the Sky Road to Freedom.  And it was about some people who were being mistreated by someone like Adolf Hitler and slowly they found a way to design the jet airplane and build them and then fight their way to freedom.
Speaker 1: Hmm, the Sky Road to Freedom.
Speaker 2: Sky Road to Freedom.  It's here somewhere but it's falling, actually falling apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you wrote the story and drew it yourself?
Speaker 2: I drew it, yes.
Speaker 1: Now did you, was it in color?  Did you color it?
Speaker 2: It was in color.  Yes, my mother was very kind and she saw I liked to draw so she went and got the little box of you know multi-colored pencils so I could draw in color.
Speaker 1: That sounds great.  I mean it just--did you--did it--
Speaker 2: I only did it to pass the time.  Other words, you know I didn't have a room where I could play and set up certain games and so forth.  So in the living room there was a desk so I sat at the desk and just drew.
Story_ID: 25131
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about sports?  Did you like--?
Speaker 2: Sports, yes.  Now my father [Espriela Don Sarreals] was an excellent tennis player but he never bothered to teach me.  But there were a lot of children on St. Nicholas Place, very long street. It's a five, six block long street so we would play after school, play tag, run.  It was no room to play ball games but we would play with each other.  And finally when I got a little older, father did give me a tennis racket although he didn't teach me, I found a place where they had a handball wall and I could go hit the ball against the wall.  One--and my father belonged to a tennis club actually further down Convent Avenue where he played you know quite frequently.  But the men said Don, why don't you bring your boy here and teach him, but he wasn't that type of person anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was--seemed like I saw a picture of Althea Gibson [champion tennis competitor] playing in, you know in that neighborhood, I mean--did she live--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The, let's see, I think--it was called the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club and there was a famous white tennis player once who came there and played an exhibit.  I think Althea Gibson came to--because they were struggling economically to survive.  But there were clay courts, not hard courts so they needed lots of maintenance so a reasonable amount of maintenance.  And so they held events to try to raise funds and the famous white tennis player that long passed, came and played and I think Althea Gibson came and played and--but it was the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club.  And the only time I was really there when they held a tournament, I served as a ball boy.  They gave you $5.00 for being there five days of the tournament.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I must--what, ten, eleven, twelve?  No, I would say, no I guess nine, ten cause I guess I was still in public school when I did that, not junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did very well in public school and--
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school?  What was the--?
Speaker 2: PS46.
Story_ID: 25132
Speaker 1: Okay.  PS46, and that's--where is that?
Speaker 2: PS46 was a--got the written numbers right here, 151st Street between St. Nicholas and Amsterdam Avenues.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I did very well I think in all of my courses.  One of the most memorable things was due to my Aunt Blanche who taught me to read early.  And my father and a book, I have a copy here, called 101 Poems and I don't know for what reason but I leaned the poem "In Flanders Fields" by Lieutenant Colonel John McCray who died in France in 1916.  And the teacher in maybe the third grade when we were going to celebrate Memorial Day asked had anyone ever heard of "In Flanders Fields" and I raised my hand and recited it.  So when they had the assembly I had to recite it.
Speaker 1: Okay, that must--did that come as quite a surprise to the teacher that someone actually knew the poem?
Speaker 2: She must have been shocked, especially African American knowing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were your teachers mostly white in PS46?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  Some were very, very nice.  There was a Ms. Helfand who--H-E-L-F-A-N-D, who prompted me to do better all the time and said that I had a bright future.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she one of your favorite teachers at--?
Speaker 2: She was my teacher specifically one term and then--but she would you know, when she would see me she would encourage me to move forward.  And when I went to junior high school I then moved into what they call not just the seventh grade, 7A but 7AR, 7A Rapid Advance class.
Story_ID: 25133
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: What was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Junior High School 164, J. Edward Stitt, S-T-I-T-T.
Speaker 1: J. Edward Stint--Stitt.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: S-T-I-T-T.
Speaker 2: S-T-I--yeah, T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now that was in the neighborhood too?
Speaker 2: Stitt was at Edgecombe Avenue and about 165th Street in Manhattan [New York].  I may be off a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so did you have any science at--
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: Did you have any science in junior high school?
Speaker 2: I believe, yes.  I, I've forgotten--yes.  It--I forgot exactly which course.  I'm mixed up with junior high school and high school but we did have some science courses because that stimulated me to think of science.  Also, I read a book called "Storm" by I think it's George R. Stewart and it described how storms came out of the Pacific Ocean and moved across the country and impacted people in many, many different ways depending on the part of the country.  Other words, in California there could be heavy rain, could affect farms or roads. You could go into the Rocky Mountains.  The heavy snow could create other problems.  Then it crossed over into the plains and for example the severe thunderstorms would start to develop and people would be affected.  And that affected me and I first thought I wanted to become a meteorologist.
Story_ID: 25134
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you read about meteorologists in the book?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was all about meteorology, about how the meteorologists at first used to get information from the pacific ocean, I guess from ships and so forth and they would name a storm just by letters A, B, C, D, E.  And he created for the first time the concept of giving storms names.  I think this is what actually led to the naming of hurricanes in this country, by giving it a name so that people could follow it.  And the whole book was about meteorology and how it affected human life.
Speaker 1: So Stewart started the convention of naming the storms after women I guess right?
Speaker 2: Well international organizations yes, perhaps they thought that was more appealing.  I do not know--there's a World Meteorological Organization and there are you know regional organizations.  I don't know but they did decide that it would be easier, people could understand the warning if you said you know this was Amy and rather than Able or Storm 1.  It would have a name and so there would be a human attachment to this storm and people were more responsive.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This convention that, I mean they were all named after women until just about maybe fifteen, twenty years ago right when they started--?
Speaker 2: It started to change and--but I'm not sure, there's a group for the Atlantic Ocean of course and then the Asian people out of the pacific, they call their storms typhoons but they also give them names.  Again, it helps to give a warning when you use a name instead of saying Storm A, Storm B is coming or Storm you know X, Y, Z.  So by giving names the response of human beings to the warning is greater.
Speaker 1: Now the convention of naming them after women, do you know why they first started naming the, all the storms after women?
Speaker 2: No, I would not--no honestly do not know how that naming came about.  It just, I saw it, heard it on the radio, you know saw it in the paper but I do not know who made that decision.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--do weather men discuss this in the weather room?  I mean cause that--I know at home people say well I thought as a kid, why are they all named after women?  I didn't--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Maybe because as I said the person who wrote Storm--I have a small--my granddaughter gave me a copy by the way.  She looked it up.  But maybe because he, maybe he started by using women's names maybe--when he wrote the book he actually started with women's names, thought that would be more effective.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's one of the--it has kind of a comic twist to it.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah it--yes.  It, it's a very human thing the question you're asking but I believe that in this book when names were first used I think the person who wrote 'Storm' used women's names.
Story_ID: 25135
Speaker 1: I was in junior high school or something--?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So, now--and you read George Stewart's book, 'Storm', right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And it's what inspired, this is where you found out about being a meteorologist?
Speaker 1: About meteorology and somewhere within my soul to be honest, the concept of saving human life appealed to me.  And later I briefly changed to medicine and then I returned to meteorology during my life, just to tell you.  But the concept of helping people and saving human life seemed constructive and registered positively in my mind as a way to live.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now tell me this now, when you were growing up, I know they didn't have television weather men when you were little but on the radio, how did they handle the weather?  Did they--did you listen to the weather reports and--?
Speaker 1: It was very poor in those days.  On the radio, merely it was cloudy and fifty-seven, sunny and seventy-two degrees.  Once in a while there might be a little more information.  But when I was young, the information was very limited.  The communication system hadn't been developed and if you went to a weather service office you would see all they received in that office were different codes and they had to take maps and plot temperature, air pressure, wind and then draw a map and then try to forecast weather.  And the same, instead of weather balloons and they would say you know at 10,000 feet for example the wind is blowing a certain way. And so the information was very limited and it came to them very slowly back in those days. So it was--the change in meteorology has been you know phenomenal from the early days when you got electronic communication and--from all over the world.  You suddenly had weather information and not just the surface but up to 80, 90, 100 thousand feet you had information about the winds and so forth.  So back then it was very, very limited.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So would they basically just describe what was going on right now outside--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --rather than prognosticating?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Unless the national weather service for example, perhaps a ship at sea, several reported a storm let's say off the Atlantic Coast or off the Pacific Coast, then they would translate, try to translate that information as to what would happen but again all information was very limited at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now I guess in terms of natural disasters, I guess you would hear about them on radio news but I--and you could see them in the news reels and at the movies, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I mean it would be like a long time after they took (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes.  The reporters and the photographers would come in and you could see what has happened.  Occasionally someone might be near and catch the breaking waves and so forth but information was limited because communication and data was limited at that time.
Story_ID: 25136
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up, what was the worst weather related disaster that you remember?
Speaker 2: There were several--when I first moved to Winston Salem [North Carolina] I think in 1938, a hurricane did hit New York City and I remember the water was coming through the apartment window and the window was howling.  And I had never quite seen anything like that you know in my young life.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now this was, recently they showed a documentary about this on public television.  I saw it on--it was--
Speaker 2: The 1938 hurricane , yes. [The New England Hurricane of 1938 (or Great New England Hurricane, Yankee Clipper, Long Island Express, or simply the Great Hurricane) was the first major hurricane to strike New England since 1869. The storm formed near the coast of Africa in September of the 1938 Atlantic hurricane season, becoming a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall as a Category 3 hurricane on Long Island on September 21. The hurricane was estimated to have killed between 682 and 800 people, damaged or destroyed over 57,000 homes, and caused property losses estimated at US$306 million ($4.7 billion in 2013)]
Speaker 1: Yes, cause I had never heard about it before.
Speaker 2: No, I remember our apartment didn't face the front.  It faced the side, faced another apartment but even with that shield, the shielding by the other building, the water was coming, even though the windows were closed, water was seeping in and my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] was mopping it with you know towels and whatever she could to stop the leakage.
Speaker 1: Now when you were young did you ever consider being a broadcaster at all?
Speaker 2: No.  That didn't seem feasible or possible, hadn't the slightest idea that I could do something like that.
Speaker 1: Now were there any black broadcasters on the radio when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: I think that in New York City a black radio station had been formed and you could tune to that.  That, you know and they would play black music and so forth.  But again we were poor.  We only had one radio so I didn't--it wasn't as though today I could turn into you know what I wanted to.  So I was limited as to what I heard on the radio.
Story_ID: 25137
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now did you have a favorite teacher in junior high school [Junior High School 164]?
Speaker 2: In junior high school no, I can't identify a single teacher but it was a blessing to be in the, in what they called the rapid advanced course where they--other words you went into greater detail you know in, on every concept whether it was you know English.  I think we started to take language, I think it was Spanish.  What--you went deeper into what they knew about science at that time.  They made learning mathematics a little more difficult but you advanced yourself.  And at that time when I was interviewed as I was coming near, into, near the end of junior high school the, I guess the person who was in charge of interviewing the graduating students asked me what I wanted to be and I told him I wanted to be a meteorologist and he was shocked.  And I told him what I'm telling you today that I had read 'Storm' [George R. Stewart] and blessedly because I said that that's how I got into the Bronx High School of Science or else I would have been sent to another school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is what year?  What are we talking about now, this is--?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And you would have been what thirteen or fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yes, right at that age.  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So 1940--
Speaker 2: So maybe about 1945 before I graduated from junior high school something like that, that I was asked and so my name was put on the list of students for Bronx High School of Science.  It was very, very competitive.  It was one of the highly rated schools in the country and a very serious school.  You know they taught science in a broad range, great depth.  Other words, biology, chemistry, physics whereas an ordinary high school it might be limited.  A student might only have to take one type of science course.  There you had to take just about everything in science to get started so you would know what, how to make a decision some day in the future about what you wanted to do in science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there very many other students from your neighborhood that were able to go to Bronx High School?
Speaker 2: No, there were not.  There were--it was scattered all over the city.  I ran track with a young man, I can't remember his name.  He lived in Brooklyn and years later I saw him at a tract meet.  He went to Brooklyn College when I went to City College [CUNY].  You know and there was one young lady I think you know she lived in Harlem [New York].  I'm talking about African Americans but there were very, very few.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you mentioned three.  Were there anymore than three you think there?
Speaker 2: Yes, but it was a large school and so you know you didn't interface with everyone.  You know you went to school, you get there on time, walk into a class and go to the next class.  And in my case two or three days a week, maybe I practiced track or cross country.  But you--there were so many students in that school you couldn't interface with them all.  So I said there were several young African Americans I think who ran track.  I met them and there was a young black lady in my class and she told me where she lived in Harlem and so forth.  But you didn't actually have time.  This was a serious school.  You didn't have time to socialize, stand around and socialize a great degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now what--with the idea that you're going to become a meteorologist, what was your focus in terms of study at Bronx High School or was there a focus?
Speaker 2: Well in the Bronx High School of Science, of course you can't specialize in that but the idea is to try to get good grades in mathematics and physics because meteorology is really the movement of air particles. It basically comes down to really being physics.  It is--there are particles in motion.  We call them raindrops, we call them air particles and wind and so forth but actually you saw what is going to happen by the laws of physics so to speak.  So physics was very important and mathematics if you wanted to become a physical scientist.  It's a form of physical science in other words, meteorology.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any special teachers there in Bronx High School for Science?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember.  The only one I remember is someone I didn't like.  In biology on all my tests I got a 98 or a 99 and New York State had a test they called the Regent Test.  It was state wide.  And while I was taking that in biology, a professor was--a teacher, high school teacher looked over my shoulder.  He said you have two wrong and I looked up at him, I said, I know.  It's a little funny story there.  I was studying for the New York State Biology Regents and my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] called me to dinner.  On one page of the book there was a one celled you know creature drawn out and inside there were parts of his body and you were supposed to learn that.  And my mother called me to dinner and I didn't move right away and then she said there will be no dinner if you don't come.  So I got up and I went.  And when I came back to the book I went from the left page to the right page, I didn't go back to the first page.  And one question was right from where I stopped and at the bottom of the page a new subject started and in the first few sentences there was something written that was the second question and so I got 98 on the Biology Regents instead of a hundred.  And speaking of teachers, she--as a term grade she only gave me 95.  So I went to her and asked, I said what are you doing?  I said I never--I got 98 on the biology regents and on some of my tests I got a hundred, some 98, 99 in her tests.  And well her attitude was she had to give somebody a lower score so she gave it to me if you--I was black in other words.
Speaker 1: So she had to give somebody a lower score to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She wanted to make somebody seem as the best in the class and I just about was.  And nobody else got--no one else got a hundred, but I always regret not getting that 100 just for a lifetime achievement if nothing else.  But it was doing well in biology that made me turn temporarily to a thought of being a doctor because I did very well meteor--in biology without even trying.  And it was later I would turn back to meteorology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But in the Bronx High School of Science, it turned me to into wanting to be a doctor temporarily.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you say there weren't many, there weren't really any teachers that you really liked that much at Bronx High School.  What--how were you generally treated, you and the other black students?
Speaker 2: I was treated fairly.  The classes were large.  Classes were very large and so there wasn't time for them to be very personal.  The only person who could be kind to you, there was a track coach, Sam Levinson for example would talk to you or something as a human being.  But the classes were so intense.  You walk in, you sat down and you did not waste a minute and so there wasn't time for you know personal considerations for example.  You just got in there and learned all that you could and then take that home and do your homework.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you ran track I know and did you participate in any other student activities or did you have time for that?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  Remember, I was a poor young boy.  I ran track and cross country in the fall and that was it.
Story_ID: 25138
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so when it came time to graduate had you chosen a school?
Speaker 2: Well I was poor.  Father [Espriela Don Sarreals] was going to give me no help and City College [CUNY] was there, I qualified for the City College of New York and the athletic department sent through word if you agree to run track for City College, we will give you support for acceptance.  And there was a lot of competition for City College because you only paid your lab fees and for your books which you did not have to pay a large tuition which I could not afford.  And so I was able to go to college because you know City College existed and I agreed to run track and I was accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you consider any other school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would have loved to--my father had said he'd gone to [University of] Michigan.  There was Columbia University.  It was supposed to be very ritzy and very classy, yes.  But I also respected City College. It had a wonderful reputation at that time.  The politicians had not interfered or told them who to accept and so forth.  It was you had to win it with your brain in other words and so it was an excellent school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now City College, you majored in pre-med, you did a lot of biology?
Speaker 2: I started pre-med at City College and was moving, taking all the biology courses you know anatomy and basic biology and related chemistry course and so forth and of course that all came to an end when my father told me that I had to go to work.  And--
Speaker 1: So this is 1949 I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, right 1949 onward.  And--
Story_ID: 25139
Speaker 1: So your father [Espriela Don Sarreals] said you had to go to work--
Speaker 2: I had to go to work and so with the help of the democratic party actually in New York City, democratic party, I got a, what they call a temporary postal clerk job for--I wasn't a full post, you know U.S. government postal clerk but--so I had to start working in the post office from four to twelve and I gave up track.  And finally, not to be drafted you had to take sixteen credits every term and I was not longer--it was just too fatiguing, I couldn't do it.  So one term I only registered for fourteen credits and the army says we got you.  I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what year is this that you were drafted?
Speaker 2: Let's see, 1953.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so how were you doing?  Were you--by 1953, were you on the verge of graduation or--?
Speaker 2: No, I was slipping because of working you know a forty hour week.  It was a full forty hour week job as a, what they call a temporary postal clerk not a full U.S. government postal clerk.  But because of that and you know and the travel back and forth to the post office, I just became so fatigued you know I started not doing well and I tried to take a few easy courses so I could take my more difficult courses but it just didn't work out.  I didn't have the physical strength to do both.  And so I dropped down to fourteen credits one term I think and I didn't know that they immediately sent that to United States Army and they drafted me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they send you overseas?
Speaker 2: No, I was well fortunate in a way that they did not--my IQ test and so forth was so good that finally when it came time to send the troops overseas, they kept me to help train others.  Other words, it was a large you know barracks full of people and I say you know 90 percent of them were assigned to go to Korea or some place and the rest of us were to stay back and train new recruits coming in so I was able to do that and not go overseas.
Story_ID: 25140
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: I was--it's called Fort--it was Camp Carson, Colorado at the time.  It's Fort Carson, Colorado now near Colorado Springs, Colorado (unclear).
Speaker 1: All right.  So is this the first time you'd been out west?
Speaker 2: Yes, the first time I--for example, yes, had been at that elevation.  That was an amazing thing.  And it's all up around 5,000 feet and you get used to it of course.  But when you first go, it is extremely difficult.  And once for training they took us to a camp that later was going to be a training camp for the mountain division I think, but it was up at 9,500 feet and we had to stay there a few days.  And we were all wondering how we were going to breathe.  But they made us exercise and exercise so that we were able to adapt to it.  We didn't stay there long but I'll never forget being at 9,500 feet and been at Winston Salem [North Carolina] and New York City and here I am at--you know at sea level and here I am at this altitude.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so you were in the army from '53 [1953] until--?
Speaker 2: '55 [1955], 1955, June 8, 19--it's, let's see July 31st 1953 to June 8, 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, anything about the army that stands out in your mind?  I mean did--now by that time they had radar right in the army?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, they--well not where we were.  I was in a, what we call 25th Anti-aircraft Artillery Battalion, self-propelled.  And they had a half track with a turret in the back that held a, what you call a Quad 50, 450 caliber machine gun barrels.  Then there was a light tank chassis that had a rotating platform for a Twin 40 millimeter cannon.  That was where I was at.  I had been offered a job at Fort Monmouth [Oceanport, New Jersey].  Somehow my name got through the system but--and I actually went there and was interviewed and they asked for me cause I had taken maybe a basic course in meteorology or something.  And--but they wouldn't let me go.  The people at Fort Carson, Colorado would not let me you know go to that which was regrettable because I could have--Fort Monmouth you could, I could go home on weekends and so forth, things like that.
Story_ID: 25141
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 19--when you--so when you got out in 1955--
Speaker 2: Right, and I returned to City College [CUNY] and then I was eligible for the GI Bill and I also was eligible to return to the post office.  So I took the number of courses that I could handle in meteorology and in 1957 I received my degree and I won the Ward Medal in Meteorology for highest proficiency in meteorology, it's right there, and a teaching fellowship for one year.  I did so well in that one year they hired me as a part time lecturer, not you know full twelve course, you know credits or sixteen or four or five courses.
Speaker 1: Now is there anyone, is there any teacher along the way here that serves as kind of a mentor to you as a meteorologist in the higher level courses?
Speaker 2: The--I don't remember the name.  Charles Storr I think it was, the teacher there, he liked me very much.  I worked very hard.  And when we had to make presentations, I did a good job and so that's why they, you know one reason I got the Ward Medal.  And so he believed in me.  He was a professor and when I actually started to teach, the students said I was excellent.  And I mean that to this day if you were to run in--I digress.  When I was assistant federal coordinator for National Weather Service, the coordinator for the Air Force went out with the federal coordinator out to Nevada and they went to a weather station and the person in charge there asked when he saw the Air Force Assistant Federal Coordinator, he said who is the Assistant Federal Coordinator for the National Weather Service?  And they mentioned my name.  And he said, my god that was the finest teacher I ever had.  This is, I swear is true.  And then the federal coordinator came back and said that.  So I enjoyed teaching, I don't know why but I enjoy it.  And I had a few secrets.  I saw how a few students, they--it was a grind sometimes from one thing to the other but I would break it up and say you don't have to write this down.  You will not be tested on it and I went into something more modern, more interesting, just five or ten minutes and gave them a break in--and so that made the classes enjoyable because I gave them the information but I said no, you're not required to know this so you will not be tested on it.  And so the fairness there I think appealed to them and also a digression into something more interesting than was just in the book.

Speaker 1: Sir, how long did you teach at City College [CUNY]?
Speaker 2: I started in 1957 with a teaching fellowship and after I completed that, they appointed me as a part time lecturer in 1958 which continued until 1969.  So I taught quite a few years.  And in 1961, of course the National Weather Service hired me so at one time I was part time teaching and working as a, you know weather radar supervisor at the Weather Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now by this time, by the time you start teaching at City College, television has weathermen now I guess by--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, they were but I never at that point ever considered the position.  I never ever thought of that position.  And it wasn't till after I finished at NYU [New York University], I didn't--I finished all the courses at NYU but they start, for one thing they started to move away, they tried to break up the graduate school of meteorology but I needed to write a, you know you have to write a thesis or something and I was worn out.  So I finished all the credits required for a masters degree but I did not finish it you know 100 percent.  And--but the National Weather Service was calling with a very nice salary and so I left that.  And of course at that time I was married and had family and so I moved on without continuing.  And as I said, New York University broke up the graduate school so I could not go back to them and try to finish up and with teaching at City College, plus working as a weather radar supervisor, my hands were full anyway and I'd had about all the going to school I could stand for a while.
Story_ID: 25143
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us, let's back track a little bit and tell us--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --how you met your wife and about getting married?  About when did that happen?
Speaker 2: Oh, actually I don't--I actually--very young.  Let's see, I think we met what about 17, 16, 17 years old and I think when I was 19 we decided in our immature way to get married.  And so we kept it a secret for a while because neither of us, neither one of us had any income.  The lady I married, Florence, she was the victim of parents breaking up so she was living with an aunt in New York City.  The parents had split up and so it was in the same neighborhood so we met you know and became friends and so forth after that.  But anyway, when I finished with NYU [New York University] in 1957, I'd had a son and in 1961, I had a daughter and so I was loaded, in other words you got two children to take care of and who I love very much and wanted to be with them and to help them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got married in what, what year was it, 19--?
Speaker 2: Oh, 19--let me think.
Speaker 1: Right after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just about.
Speaker 1: So you're in 19--so 1951 or '52 [1952]?
Speaker 2: 19, 19 (unclear) 1950, yeah.
Speaker 1: 1950 okay.  In 1950, all right.
Story_ID: 25144
Speaker 1: And--okay, all right.  So you said that in '61 [1961] you were at New York University and so you dropped out of graduate school.  You were there but you--
Speaker 2: Well I, no I finished all the credits, everything except to write the paper.  But I said there was a combination.  I was exhausted because I was at that time going to school, I was teaching and I was working at the post office.  I was getting about, during the winter I was getting about three, four hours of sleep a night and I was doing all that.  So I was exhausted.  And when 1961, because I'd studied radar meteorology in graduate school The National Weather Service, it was called The Weather Bureau at that time, The National Weather Service was anxious to get me, to finally get someone on the job who actually knew what a weather radar was and how it operated, how it functioned.  And, because the other, a lot of the other people at the office would--were technicians and they were operating the radar in a very poor fashion.  They'd only had it a short time.  And so they were anxious to get someone who understood radar meteorology and could start teaching these other people.  And it worked out very well because I was good to them.  For example, I could have worked days only since I was a supervisor but I gave the, I worked some weekends, worked some evenings and so forth so they could get a break in their lives too.
Story_ID: 25145
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now--so you were in the--you were at National Weather Service in, stationed in New York right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.
Speaker 1: Okay, 30 Rock, okay.
Speaker 2: The RCA building and national--NBC was right upstairs.  We were on the mezzanine.  Radio City Music Hall was right across the street and that was where we were located.
Speaker 1: Okay, home of the Rockettes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now, so you're doing well with the U.S. Weather Bureau Office and then in 1964 you get a call from--or did you find--you found out about the job at NBC or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well I had, well it was a couple of exciting things in the weather.  But no, the--first, CBS started looking for another weather person.  The one they had was a fraud.  He really wasn't a true meteorologist.  And Frank Field who was the meteorologist for NBC there in New York City, he found out that CBS was inviting me up, invited me over for a test you know.  I actually went out on the set, did a weather forecast and then talked to the actual anchor man and so forth and they filmed it and so forth.  And they offered me eventually a job with very low pay which I rejected and also they were unkind, let's leave it at that.  And so NBC set up a few things and next thing I know I was being interviewed by management and they offered me California or Washington, D.C.  Now I had relatives in Winston Salem [North Carolina], relatives in New York.  Obviously being in Washington I wasn't too far from either set you know of relatives so I chose Washington, D.C. and that's why I came to WRC TV in Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I want to go back a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Just to the point where you were saying that CBS was unkind and you were going to leave it at that.  But--now this is history now and we hadn't talked about, so much about the civil rights aspects of all this.  But what was the--
Speaker 2: Right, that's why I didn't say anything.
Speaker 1: Well you may as well say--you should say it because this is for history.  So--
Speaker 2: Oh, well I--they called me down to say that they wanted to hire me and a gentleman came into the room with a contract and threw it on the floor.  Okay, that's why I didn't want to go into that. And when I saw that there were negative feelings, I didn't want to risk my whole family with people who would only be trying to find a way to get rid of me whereas with NBC, a vice president interviewed me. Frank Field was their anchorman, weather anchorman, talked to me in a friendly manner. They said you know if you accept this we will pay you to move and give you, get you know money to cover your expenses coming to Washington [D.C.] to get established and so forth.  It made a lot more sense. It was a very reasonable offer.
Speaker 1: Now I believe--now wasn't Frank Field the science reporter for NBC, the--?
Speaker 2: He might have done some science reporting also but he was their regular evening meteorologist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was there on the air meteorologist every night.  And the reason I knew him since we were all in the same building, he would come down and talk to the professional meteorologists and take a look at their radar and he would get a jump on the other stations cause he would have more information.
Story_ID: 25146
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's one little thing--back track, when I was in, and I'm always proud of it.  It may not be important to you and please tell me.  When I was working as weather radar supervisor, one day I walked in and they said all of the air force weather radars are out.  There was one I think on Long Island and one in New Jersey, and said you are now primary for covering Air Force One. Shall I continue?
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah this is--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Now about what year is this and who is the president?
Speaker 2: It was July 14th, 1964.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I came into the office.  And they said, now when you walk into the radar room you may not leave it until President Johnson, Air Force One lands.  And so there I stayed and I had to--in those days we had coded--there's one computer we had coded where the storms were and then sent it out by teletype.  So finally they said Air Force One is aloft.  Then Air Force One called me and asked the situation.  I said there were moderate to approaching heavy thunder storms over Pennsylvania but there are almost strong thunder storms developing over northeastern New Jersey.  And as the flight went on the storms end--as the flight went on and it was obvious from flight time that the president and Air Force One were getting close to New York City and the storms were getting very strong, I called, I said Air Force One, this is Weather Bureau Radar and they said Weather Bureau Radar, this is Air Force One, over. I said, Air Force One, there are very severe thunder, four very severe thunder storms over northern New Jersey and then he said this is Air Force One, Roger.  I said Air Force One, you have to tell me where you are.  And he said, this is Air Force One, I'm over Rutherford, New Jersey.  I said Air Force One, there's a TRW++, that means very severe thunder storm centered over Peterborough Airport, diameter twenty-five miles, max top 44,000 feet, moving east at fifteen knots, ETA, estimated time of arrival at LaGuardia Airport [New York], his destination.  And I--and he said Roger.  And then there was complete silence.  Finally the FAA called us about thirty-five minutes later and said Air Force One is down, it's safe.  And then about twenty minutes after there, after that, they said now the--Air Force One is going to call you and they said Weather Bureau Radar, this is Air Force One.  I said this is Weather Bureau Radar, over.  He said you are most highly commended for outstanding service to the United States of America.  Thank you and have a very good day.  That was the Commander of Air Force One.  And that is as much as he could do but that is absolute truth and absolute words.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you never got anything in writing about that right?
Speaker 2: No, I never got anything in writing but all the--the supervisor was there and the meteorologist in charge was in the back.  I don't know why he didn't come out.  And so I never got a bonus or on the spot promotion or anything but I helped save Air Force One on that given day and I know that to my heart.
Story_ID: 25147
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's a good story.  So what was your reception you know at Channel 4 here in [Washington] D.C. in the studio?  I mean how did the people take to a--were you the first black on air personality?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was the first black professional meteorologist in the United States of America.  I walked into there and some were shocked.  There were black employees and they were very, very happy.  They had maybe--well you haven't met--Jim Vance was already a reporter.  He was covering Capitol Hill at the time.  He was, he's an anchor now right here.  He's been an anchor for many, many years.  He was there already.  There were several but there was no one in meteorology.  And there was one white meteorologist who was retiring.  I guess that's why I got the position.  There was another, Willard Scott who had actually been a radio entertainer and comedian, he wanted the job and would be very difficult for me later.  But anyway, New York City's vice president said I would get one to two weeks training.  I arrived at WRC the day after the astronauts landed on the moon, makes it so nice, I don't remember dates.  And they said that it was a company holiday for a lot of employees celebrating the astronauts landing on the moon, come back tomorrow.  I came back Tuesday and they said come on out into the broadcast area.  I went out and they said okay we're going to you know imitate a program and so I did it once, gave a forecast, told about the temperature and so forth and they said cut.  And I said okay let's do it one more time and so I did it one more time.  I was about twenty seconds into it.  Whoever was in charge said cut, that's fine, you'll start tomorrow.  I said wait a minute, they said I would get two weeks training.  He said are you on the payroll?  I said yes.  He said you will start tomorrow.  So I got no training and I actually started doing television.  But the blessing was City College [CUNY] who allowed me to teach and sitting before you know twenty or so students year after year and talking about the weather although I was frightened, talking about the weather and staring at people and then this other case, looking into the camera was not so frightening.  So I was able to do it without any training.
Speaker 1: Now a couple of points.  Now you have a fairly decent voice so do you think that helped you, you know you have a nice kind of a tenor in your voice and everything.
Speaker 2: Well I, yes.  I think that that helped quite a bit and yes if I didn't have that, I certainly would have failed.  And what I said, you know bless City College because years of teaching you know and you correct yourself and learn to speak clearly to the students, they, their livelihoods will be if they learn what you are teaching.  And so I had that going for me when I stepped in front of the camera.  And so although there was fear in my stomach, it wasn't in my mouth.
Story_ID: 25148
Speaker 1: Okay.  Another thing about, you mentioned Willard Scott being an entertainer.  I--you know I think people who watch television weather often wonder whether they are seeing a true meteorologist or whatever meteorology--a meteorologist is.  A lot of people don't have any idea.  Or are they watching someone who is an entertainer you know just pointing to some maps and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: That--right.  That was the problem there that he took some--they gave him some shows and he acted as a comedian.  He had people send him in cakes and he would show the cakes and he did everything but the weather.  I did the weather very accurately.  One day I was the only person including The National Weather Service.  I saw on a satellite map a storm forming off the coast and I forecast snow for Washington.  I was correct and I was the only one in all of television who got it correct.  There were some people who appreciated it and some people who didn't.  Apparently NBC in Washington [D.C.] is--I wasn't what they were looking for.  I didn't have the right type of appeal, although I was an excellent meteorologist they were looking for something else.
Speaker 1: You think they were looking for more of an entertainer?
Speaker 2: More of an entertainer.  And I tried to digress by--I loved to draw.  I learned as a little boy so I used to make cartoons sometimes and to emphasize the weather, a giant snowflake falling on somebody's head or something quick, something silly to try to be more entertaining but it didn't, you know, it didn't last.  So just before Christmas in, just before 1975, it came to an end.  But NBC--
Speaker 1: That was--
Speaker 2: NBC was more interested I learned you know in the commercials.  Other words when you are in front of that camera you are just holding people in place till the commercial comes on.  That's one philosophy of television.  So maybe I wasn't that type of person and they weren't interested in meteorological accuracy.  But fortunately Weather Service Headquarters was here and I was able to return to The Weather Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you started--and we were looking at the photos.  I mean TV weather is different now.  I think there's green screens and computer--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --graphics and you know--
Speaker 2: The graphics.  You can be standing in front of a green screen and the map's not really there.  They put it there on TV (unclear).  No, I had to draw.  They gave me a big book of giant maps of the United States and I would take a large ink pen and put in basic weather patterns and then get on the air and describe it to people.  No, we had nothing automated, nothing automated.
Speaker 1: So these--you would use a different map everyday or were they erasable?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was just like your notebook.  It was a stack of maps.  You know I'd tear off one, put it up and draw on it.  You know next time I would put up another one and that would--that was the weather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About how many minutes did the weather last?
Speaker 2: You range from a minute and a half to two and a half minutes depending unless something, some emergency came up and they would say we need you to fill more time.  For example let's say some film broke, they were going to show a story and that story was two minutes long.  They'd say, fill those two minutes.  But that--and they would do that without warning.  So I would keep something in the back of my head in case I was--they told me to extend my broadcast.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now were you ever--I know the comedians always joke about the weathermen being blamed for the weather, you know.  Were you--did people ever blame you for what happened?
Speaker 2: I think it was--yes, occasionally you missed.  If a snow storm came that you did not predict you could expect the blame.  But I was a fairly excellent meteorologist and I was never so far off that it was a disaster.  Other words I might say that it'd be light snow and it was heavy snow but I didn't complete, I didn't ever do something that was disastrous and really hurt people cause that's what I believed in, by the way.  You know, I believed in meteorology helps human life and so that's my look at it.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the worst weather you predicted and--for this area?
Speaker 2: The worst event?  Well a number of years--it's a long time.  I--there were times when there were hurricanes off the coast but they did not strike Washington.  I said the best one was I think, I mentioned that snow storm where we did get pictures of the, you know printed pictures of the facsimile machine in those days of the satellite.  And I got two of them in a row, different time period that said this storm is growing.  And I did predict a heavy snow storm.  And I got on and warned people that, dress your children properly if they have to wait for the school bus and I said drive carefully tomorrow.  I do remember you know doing that.  But it's hard to remember some things as you look back.  But since--like Air Force One, I will never forget that.  But day to day forecasts, it's difficult to remember every event.
Story_ID: 25149
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were you--did it change your life to be recognized in public?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was not used to that.  I was in a hardware store one weekend and I put on a wool cap and had on a jacket and pulled the collar up and somebody looked up says, it's no use doing that Donald.  We know who you are, and that sort of thing but not in a cruel way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they just recognize you and so you are being watched when you walk the streets and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now you did--did you do public events or charity events as (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I visited schools.  I remember once when, who was the ex-mayor?
Speaker 1: Marion [Shepilov] Barry?
Speaker 2: Marion Berry, they--a group wanted to give him an award.  They asked me to come there and I just sat there while they gave him the award.  I don't know why I was invited there.  But anyway, so little things have popped up, but I did visit schools and tell children to study and you can move forward in life, you know.  That's, that was my message.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But those things are so hectic, they come up, you dash there and you come back and it's hard to remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in 1970, you were a weather man for TV4 until 1975?
Speaker 2: Yes, just before, a few days before '75 [1975], just before Christmas 1974, that's a few days before 1975 actually I was let go.  You know I didn't know why but--and also they didn't give me a lead in so that if I'd known a year or two earlier I could just practically walked into another station cause the owner of another station who I called said "Don, if we'd known you wanted a job you could have had it."  I could have had it with a bigger salary than they had.  But I was naive.  I remember I taught, I worked in the Weather Service.  I didn't know anything about children and so I was kind of naive as to what was going on.
Speaker 1: Now while you were a weather man did you--for NBC here, did you work for the Weather Service too or--?
Speaker 2: No.  I had to terminate.  I left New York City [New York] as chief radar meteorologist and came and worked for NBC. But fortunately Dr. Richard Holgren knew about me and I called the Weather Service, I called his office and he said yes, we'll bring you back.  The only thing about the Weather Service, there was some racism there.  He offered me a job at a certain grade and he said that the people where I was going to work said no, it had to be a lower grade.  But I was immediate--I was, when I applied I was called back to The Weather Service and I worked on a project called NOAA [National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration] Weather Radio--.
Story_ID: 25150
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, I was just asking you, you were telling me about, off camera about the 7:30 news and how strong that broadcast was before you left Channel 4.
Speaker 2: Yes. It was exceptional because we were allowed first to talk to each other and not just, you know talk to each other personally in a warm way.  You know here's Don Sarreals with the weather and pleasantly say it and then I would return it.  And maybe the anchorman would ask me a question or two and the sports caster would tell a joke about Don and maybe Don would tell a joke about the forecast--the sports caster.  So it was a warm, very warm situation but yet it was very--it was an excellent news program.  And actually Walter Cronkite [Walter Leland Cronkite, Jr., American broadcast journalist] was on CBS at the same time and we topped him.  We topped him.  And that's why I could never understand what NBC was doing, but we actually topped--you know.  But they changed the format of their programs and so that terminated that particular show and that brought things near the end.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your co, your colleagues on the air when you were--?
Speaker 2: I can't remember the name of the--Maury Segal [phonetic] was the sports caster.  Oh, I can't remember the name of the anchorman but I mean, invited to his home and everything else.  I mean he was a very, very warm person, that sort of thing that we actually enjoyed being on the air together.  And in 1970 I was out playing tennis and I popped my Achilles tendon and I was back in a few days on a crutch you know and so forth and they were teasing me and laughing about it.  But that's, it's a warm friendly thing but very serious about the news.  And so it made for a lovely combination for people watching.
Story_ID: 25151
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now U.S. Weather Service, 1975, right?  I guess--
Speaker 2: '76 [1976].  There was a pause in there where I rested and looked to see what I wanted to do cause I got a lump of money so I took a little, took--we took a little vacation and then when I contacted, director invited me and interviewed me and arranged for me to return.  And I went to a very interesting program because I'd been in broadcasting, it was called NOAA [National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration] Weather Radio.  It was to be a radio warning system.  Each state would have a NOAA weather radio transmitter but it would have three or four depending on the size of the state, broadcast points.  They would have different towers in different parts of the state and you would have a different tape running for each part of the state.  So for example if extreme Western Virginia was going to have a severe thunderstorm, you could send a warning to Western Virginia without alarming the people let's say by the Atlantic Coast who weren't being threatened yet.  And so by being able to divide up the area and give more pointed warnings, it, the warnings became more effective.  If you're in a northern part of the state and they put a warning out to the southern part, you don't pay attention.  But this way people started paying attention to warnings and that was the essence of NOAA Weather Radio.  And for the seamen, the people out in fishing boats, especially the smaller crafts, they could buy a small NOAA weather radio, battery powered NOAA weather radio and keep track of the weather situation and get warnings and get back you know get back into the coast into port if bad weather was coming.  So it helped on land and sea.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And NOAA stands for the--?
Speaker 2: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, something the government created.
Story_ID: 25152
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now you worked with Richard Holgren, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Richard Holgren was director of the Weather Service.  He was very kind to me, a very brilliant scientist.  He finally left the Weather Service, became president of the American Meteorological Society.  He also for a period of time became the United States Representative to the World Meteorological Organization.  So he was a very talented person and he had an exceptional career.  And he assisted me in returning to the Weather Service.
Speaker 1: Now was he, would you consider him the top meteorologist in the United States at that time?
Speaker 2: He was excellent, yes.  He was at the top both in knowledge of meteorology but how to run a meteorological program to get the whole organization functioning so that all the people were served properly.
Story_ID: 25153
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about Storm Finders?
Speaker 2: I decided you know since--when I was not working for the Weather Service I decided to have my own corporation and so that I could perform services for private companies.  And I just invented the name Storm Finders and you know filed with I guess Maryland and established the corporation for a small period of time.  But I think I was contacted by one or two people but it never honestly amounted to much.  But I thought I should be incorporated in case anyone asked me to perform a task, I could then put the funds in the corporation and not just have it as income you know, ordinary income and so I wanted to have a corporation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you still do anything with Storm Finders?
Speaker 2: No. I terminated it after I returned to The Weather Service so that I would be just loyal to the United States Government.
Story_ID: 25154
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay.  So now from '76 [1976] to '80 [1980], it says that you were the TV meteorologist for the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  While I was working on NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Weather Radio, the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting wanted to have an agricultural program but they wanted a professional meteorologist on there.  So the director assigned me to appear on the show.  Now I did receive funds from the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting but that was permitted because I paid my own travel, I paid for my own clothes, you know to appear on the air and so forth.  And so for a number of years I appeared on 'Up On The Farm' and provided weather broadcasts.  And I had a talent which they enjoyed.  For example, when apples let's say were being harvested they would name this type of apple is 40 percent--the red apples, they're 50 percent, 30 percent harvested and they would give this to me as I walked in the door.  An hour later I would have it memorized and so I could not only do the weather but I would give this agricultural information.  The brain was working well then, that's what I--let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: So you're pretty, you had a pretty sharp mind.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, able to hold a lot of information.  Let me--tell us about, did you have anything to do with the Joint Doppler Operational Project?
Speaker 2: JDOP [Joint Doppler Operational Project], that, that's specifically not--I worked with--I've forgotten what JDOP did.  I--after I left NOAA Weather Radio, I joined the next generation weather radar project.  It was a multi-agency office for the development of the nation's Doppler weather radar system.  JDOP I believe, was an organization out in Norman, Oklahoma that was working on various aspects of Doppler weather radar.  I was with the project to develop the program, select a contractor and eventually build a system for the United States of America and that included the United States Air Force, the Federal Aviation Agency and of course the Weather Service to serve the people.  But I was with the, what they call NEXRAD.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was Chief of Operations and Requirements originally to define the requirements of all three agencies, get that information to the contractor so they could develop the system properly.  Others who had that task failed.  I also became Chief of Training Program Development so I had two jobs.  And then The Weather Service was supposed to develop Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 11, but it turned out for some reason they said they weren't able to.  So Tony Durham, the manager of the NEXRAD program said you're going to have to be chairman of this too.  So I was supposed to have one job, I wound up with three but the Federal Meteorological Handbook when finished was said worldwide to be an excellent document.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us now what is--we always hear this on television.  In fact, a few years ago all the stations were announcing, now we have Doppler weather you know forecasting and what does that really mean?  It has something to do with radar, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, Doppler weather radar was a tremendous advancement.  The original radar sent out a beam and the beam bounced off of raindrops.  The more raindrops there were, the stronger the signal so you could tell when rain was very heavy and of course the radar would identify the location of that rainfall.  Doppler went one step forward.  Those raindrops are moving with the wind and so now you had two really electronic signals coming back.  One with--if the rain is moving away from the radar, that distorts the radar signal.  Or if it's moving toward the radar, that distorts the radar signal in a different way.  When that comes back you subtract the original signal and you have well the wavelength was increased because the raindrops are moving away.  Or the raindrops are moving towards us and that made the signal returning smaller.  And so that was then put into a computer and came out as wind velocity and therefore--and they took that and were able to tell what wind speeds were but also if the wind was blowing one way and only a few miles away it was blowing an opposite direction.  That means they are rotating, it's a rotating wind and that's a tornado.  And suddenly there came the day when radar could identify a tornado and that was a tremendous advancement.  And the radar does much more but that was one of the major advances to spot that tornado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I know a lot of farmers, I mean--not farmers but gardeners who grow a vegetable patch every now and then and--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: --they rely on the farmer's almanac.  So what value, I mean I know people that swear by the farmer's almanac but what value does the farmer's almanac have and what source do they rely on for their predictions?
Speaker 2: It's a privately structured document and I imagine they have a scientist or scientists who look at records of the past and they have certain ways of comparing last year or ten years ago to what's going on now and they might say this is going to be like it was ten years ago.  And so that was rainy in the western states so we think it's going to be rainy now.  And so they would create a document based on that technology.  And at one point, people had nothing else and so they looked at it.  Now you have powerful computers who are working, that are working day and night to try to protect the American people.
Story_ID: 25156
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 1980 you served as chief operator or operations in training branch of NEXRAD [Next General Radar].  I think we talked about that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: I was originally Chief Operations and Requirements.  There were some people I don't want to name them who could not do the job.  The director walked in and said you've got to take this second job.  So I was working two jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you were a staff member of the modernization division to the National Weather Service, right?
Speaker 2: After the radar was developed they--the NEXRAD program office was no longer a multi-agency, it was only Weather Service and they took my leadership away and sent me to the modernization program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And in '93 [1993], you served as Assistant Field Coordinator in the--
Speaker 2: Federal Coordinator.
Speaker 1: Okay, for Meteorological Service, right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That position came up and finally for the first time in many, many years, the Weather Service promoted me and I became Assistant Federal Coordinator for Meteorological Services for NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], you know National Weather Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now you retired in 1997 but what was the position you held before you retired?
Speaker 2: That--it was the same position.
Speaker 1: That was the same one, okay.
Speaker 2: Assistant Federal Coordinator you know for Department of Commerce, NOAA, you know National Weather Service.  And it was a multi-task position where you interface with agencies because Department of Agriculture for example could need weather information, the geological survey needs to know how much rain is going to fall in the rivers.  And so you interface with the other agencies.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Years ago, 2002, we interviewed Waverly Person of the U.S. Geological Survey.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Do you know him, out in Golden, Colorado.  He's the--
Speaker 2: Okay, right.
Speaker 1: --he's usually the spokesman for the earthquake, for earthquakes and other natural disasters when--
Speaker 2: Exactly, and if you had an earthquake and it created certain types of damage you might want to know are there going to be any meteorological hazards coming up while we're trying to recover from this?  That's interfacing one agency to the other, that's how that works.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They need you at one time or the other.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So you do work with U.S. Geological Survey?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was a member of a Geological Survey Committee.  I was a member of the Agriculture Department Committee and I was on a committee for, I think it was the National Science Foundation as far as committee.  And I was executive secretary of the interagency group for Post-Storm Data Acquisition where we went in after storms and tried to define what had really happened.
Story_ID: 25157
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the field of meteorology seems, it seems as though we are underrepresented in that field like we are in a lot of fields in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the African American population.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for young people in terms of the field of meteorology?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I'll give you perhaps a strange answer.  I think it's up to the parents.  I think the parents of African American children have got to realize there are great opportunities out there and to encourage, encourage your daughters and sons to study and perhaps take a look at the field of meteorology because meteorologists are needed here in the United States and around the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And if you're an aspiring meteorologist, you should be taking STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] education courses I would think?  Is that--?
Speaker 2: You certainly should and the important thing is to get a good background and if you are to, you know still determined to become a meteorologist and then go into that specialty and study very hard and you will advance.  I didn't quite hear that question to tell the truth.
Speaker 1: Oh, no I was just asking well maybe just phrase it a different way.  What should an aspiring young meteorologist study to prepare himself, him or herself?
Speaker 2: Well each university picks--that teaches meteorology picks a certain area.  It could be agriculture, it could be severe thunderstorms, it could be the upper atmosphere, it could be hurricanes and so you pick a school that has the interests that appeal to you.  I happen to have a granddaughter in the Penn State School [Pennsylvania State University] of Meteorology and she is about to select which specific school she wants to go to for graduate work.  That's where you really specialize.
Story_ID: 25158
Speaker 1: Okay.  Today as we speak in 2013, there's a lot of discussion about global warming, the weather, changing weather patterns across the world.  And do you see global warming as a real problem or as a political one?
Speaker 2: Global warming is a catastrophic problem and we need to all work together to do what we can to stop this warming.  For example, at the South Pole there are millions of tons of ice and if it all melts, we don't know what will happen to the planet earth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Melting ice results in rising tides and--
Speaker 2: It will, yes.  It will rise--there will be rising tides and remember, and when those tides rise then you have a storm then the waves coming ashore, if they were ten of fifteen feet before with storms, now they'll be twenty or thirty feet and it will go much further inland and destroy more property and actually erode away the coastal zone.
Speaker 1: So you're convinced it's a real phenomena that's taking place (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It is a very real and serious phenomenon.  And the business world needs to recognize it also because ordinary people can't do anything about it.
Story_ID: 25159
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would change or do differently if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: If I had anything personally to do in life, I did not, when I was not promoted the way I should have been, I should have taken legal action.  Perhaps I should have fought harder, but I wanted to complete the task at hand because I believe in meteorology.  I believe in saving human life and I made that the major directive rather than my own personal consideration.  But maybe I should have gotten myself a few more pay raises.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Likewise when you look back over all the things you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your major contributions or your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I believe honestly because of the scope of Doppler weather radar, that is a major contribution.  You must understand that first United States, it went to the United States Air Force, Federal Aviation Agency and of course The Weather Service used it to protect people but then this has traveled around the world.  China bought the Doppler weather radar and they have I believe 118 of the Doppler weather radars in China.  This is not a local thing, it has gone around the world.  I had a call once from someone, a meteorologist in Norway, they said they could only afford one Doppler weather radar.  Should they put it on a mountain top or should they put it at sea level?  And we had an interesting conversation.
Speaker 1: What did you tell them to do?
Speaker 2: I told him that protecting the people was more important because the ocean in the winter time with storms around Norway makes it very difficult for ships to get into port and out of port and that you could still make a slight measurement of the snowfall up at ten, twenty thousand feet and still get a good estimate of the water.  That's what they wanted, an excellent estimate of the snowfall so they'd know how much summer water they had.
Story_ID: 25160
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us about your family.  Now you've, you told us when you got married right out of high school.  You had two children.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But unfortunately your son passed when he was young, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about that.
Speaker 2: I think I was looking for companionship.  As I said, I did not have a nice father [Espriela Don Sarreals, Sr.].  I had a lovely mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales] but--and all my life at home I lived in the living room and slept on a fold out couch.  And of course I was very shy about social life and I met someone who was very warm and very kind to me and I just fell in love I guess.  And it was nice to have you know social companionship and at home I had none.  And so we started out you know together.  And we--I finally--we finally wound up after I got The Weather Service job were able to buy an excellent co-op apartment overlooking the Hudson River.  It was a twenty story U-shaped building with about 900 people in it.  And one accomplishment there was they made me chairman for about two years and I helped to make life better for a lot of people there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said your son passed when he was about ten you think?
Speaker 2: He passed just before nearing his tenth birthday of a brain tumor.  We had no idea what was developing.  And I didn't know really anything.  He didn't cry or whimper or whine.  One day he came to me and said daddy, I'm sick.  And I don't know what my wife had done but I took him immediately to Columbia Medical--Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, myself and tried to find out--it seemed to be something wrong with his, there were pains in the head and so forth.  But for my action I guess it was too late in the game.  They found a fairly large sized tumor, you know after he passed away because they performed an autopsy because of the sudden passing of a child.  And they did find a large tumor had formed and it was a very sad moment because he was a brilliant, brilliant child and a loving child. He treated his sister with great love.  That's one thing we always appreciated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And his sister, now your daughter she's a lawyer and a chef?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She majored in international law but she inherited this mental power of cooking.  I cannot explain it.  All I can say is that she expressed this interest when she was young, fairly young and so as a birthday present one year when she was a young teenager now and I didn't know what to get, I bought her a lesson or a set of lessons at a culinary institute in Bethesda, Maryland and that started the ball rolling.  And she followed up later in life with some more lessons and now she knows chefs all over the world and she formed a company called Penny Candy.  Now Penny was her pet dog by the way and she formed this company to sell cookies and candy.
Story_ID: 25161
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about, the story about your granddaughter and meteorology.
Speaker 2: My granddaughter made up her own mind to be a meteorologist.  In fact she told the whole family don't tell grandpa that I'm going to be a meteorologist.  So for months after she made a decision I didn't know and finally they told me that she was going to study meteorology and in a few months now she'll graduate with a degree in meteorology from Penn State University [Pennsylvania State University].
Speaker 1: Oh that's great.  That's great.  Sir, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, I think you've done an excellent job.  It's hard you know to remember.  Well you know part of my life was--it made my life difficult (unclear).  But you know I did get prostate cancer at one point in my life and I had an operation and I've lived twenty years with it but I'm still kicking along.  But that is one reason why I retired or I probably would have worked you know five, six, seven years more.  It made life a little difficult you know to travel and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's stupid maybe.
Story_ID: 25162
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well I believe in God Almighty and in my heart I thought I was sent to this earth to help save human life and meteorology seemed one way to do this, to keep people from harm and to save their lives.  And I think that in a small way I have achieved this.  I have helped save human life in the United States and around the world and so I am satisfied.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you sir.
Speaker 1: All right.

Speaker 1: (PHOTOGRAPH SESSION)
Speaker 2: This is my son's birthday on April 15th, about 1963.  That's Martin opening the presents and that's my daughter Cheryl wondering where her presents are too.  This is a dinner at my--our apartment at 940 St. Nicholas Avenue.  On the left is my sister Satia and on the right is my sister Sonia.  This is a grand family portrait.  If we start in the back left at Christmas time a few years ago that's my ex-wife, my son's father, my sister Sonia and good old Don, and starting on the left that's David Schneider holding Emma Schneider and that's my daughter Cheryl holding Anna Schneider.  This is my sister Sonia.  I gave her a few tennis lessons.  This is a tennis park on the Hudson River at 158th Street.  The river is right over there and we practiced and she learned how to play.  This is my--me, Don Sarreals a long, long time ago being held by my Aunt Blanche as she visited New York.  This is Don Sarreals on--at the tennis courts across from Yankee Stadium.  I was playing with a friend and trying to get in a good serve.  This is my son Martin's birthday and on the left is my mother [Sadie Beatrice Scales], I'm in the center and that's Martin getting ready to blow out the candles.  This picture was taken after my TV job.  This was taken in Bethesda, Maryland and that's my daughter Cheryl on Phoenix Drive where our suburban home was.  My daughter graduated from Michigan State and while we were waiting for graduation day, that's my daughter Cheryl, our doggie Sheldon and myself.
Speaker 1: Sheldon huh?
Speaker 2: Right.  The person made us keep the name.  This is graduation day at Michigan State University, a smile on my daughter's face and a look of pride if you believe it, on daddy's face.
Speaker 1: When did she come out of Michigan State [University]?
Speaker 2: (Inaudible).  This is my mother trying to hit the tennis ball in the park on Riverside Drive.  She enjoyed that.  She'd always wanted to learn tennis.  This is my mother at her home in Winston Salem, North Carolina getting ready to serve dinner at Christmas time.  Believe it or not this is me, I was called Donnie Boy at the time at a beach in New York City.  This is Don Sarreals on the--his days in television.  I appeared in TV Guide which I was very proud of.  This is the famous anchorman on the left, Jim Vance, who is still broadcasting for WRC TV and that's me while I was a meteorologist at WRC TV.  This is Don Sarreals actually performing the weather on a broadcast at WRC TV Channel 4 in Washington [D.C.].  And in the early days of doing the weather, you had to draw your own maps and that's what I did an gave the weather just the same.  Maryland Public Broadcasting asked me to perform weather forecasting programs on Up On The Farm, an agricultural show and that's me in the act of doing so.  This is the cast of Up On The Farm of W--of Maryland Public Broadcasting and you see our anchors and Old Don Sarreals the weather guy on the side.  Believe it or not, when I was at Bronx High School of Science, I tried to learn to run cross country.  I didn't win but I had a lot of fun.  This is a track--the Brooklyn College High School Track Meet and as you can see we're doing pretty well and I'm passing off to Artie Shriver to get us home with four medals.  This is the WSR57 Radar that was located in Rockefeller Center where I was Weather Service Chief Radar Meteorologist at the time.  Again, on the WSR57 Screen, I'm pointing out a storm to one of the forecasters whose in the background.  Dr. Richard Holgren, Director of the National Weather Service welcomes Don Sarreals back to the Weather Service after his television career.  We had a special broadcast the day the Doppler radar was being introduced out in Dallas.  We invited a lot of TV forecasters in for a briefing and they're all smiles as you can see.  While building NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] Weather Radio, we went to many different exhibits and let the nation know that NOAA Weather Radio spans the nation and was there to protect them.  As Assistant Federal Coordinator of Meteorology, I had performed many tasks but enjoyed them all in serving meteorology.  This is the WSR88D, the Doppler Weather Radar out at Douglas Airport.  It's Don Sarreals with the Federal Coordinator Skip Wright.  And this is a picture created by WRC TV to advertise Don Sarreals.  Don Sarreals was a part time lecturer at the City College of New York after graduation.
Speaker 1: Now this one, now you're not in this but this is a class of yours?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Students in meteorological class.
Speaker 2: These are Don Sarreals' students of meteorology at City College.  You see them working very, very hard.  This is Don Sarreals on the 1:00 p.m. news program for WRC TV.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I just had your granddaughter (unclear).
Speaker 2: This is my daughter Cheryl with my granddaughter Emma Schneider.
Speaker 1: Okay, is this the same granddaughter or--?
Speaker 2: No, that's Anna.  This is my son-in-law Dave with his granddaughter Anna Schneider.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I think that's a pretty good sample.
Speaker 2: You should say.  You're some hard working people.  God bless you.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
