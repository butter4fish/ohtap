Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Today is October 31, 2007, Halloween, I   m in Oklahoma City. My name  is Tanya Finchum and I will be talking with Odilia Dank, who was in the  House of Representatives, elected in 1994 and finished in 2006. Termed  out, correct? And this is a part of the OSU project entitled Women of the  Oklahoma Legislature, so thank you for allowing me to come visit you  today.  Thank you. I termed out   I finished the session in    06.  You were elected in    94 and     Twelve years later        twelve years later you finished.  That   s it.  Okay, let us start by having you tell a little bit about your childhood,  where you were born, siblings, that kind of thing.  I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but we moved when I was two years old.  So I consider myself from Oklahoma and a Sooner. A type of person  who just believes in Oklahoma all the way. I have one older sister, and a  younger brother and sister who are twins, and we grew up on the  northeast side of Oklahoma City at Lake Aluma Chulosa, which was a  little township   a small lake with some houses around it. Not many  children at all, there were the four of us, and two boys that lived out  there. My dad was a radiologist, and my mother had been a dentist for  ten years before she got married, and she didn   t practice after that. I used  to tease her. She was one of the first women libbers. She didn   t like  practicing dentistry. She was the only woman in her class, but anyway,  she was a dentist.  5  I went to high school at Casady High School when it was a very young  school. I went to college at Randolph-Macon Women   s College in  Virginia. Then I came back to OU  University of Oklahoma  and got my  master   s in education, and I had taught for eight years. Then I became a  counselor. I spent five years at a junior high and my last 12 years at a  high school. So that would be my education part of it. As far as work  and career my primary job was being a good teacher, counselor and  raising my daughter. I just pretty well had telescopic or very narrow  vision at that point, just concentrating on those two things. I did belong  to my church and I also belonged to some of the education  organizations.  My interest in politics, and who would have ever dreamed I would be in  the legislature in Oklahoma, never was that ever a goal of mine when I  was growing up. But I will say that I always loved social studies, and my  first teaching job in south Oklahoma City was teaching government for  one semester and Oklahoma history for the other semester. And since I  had been in private schools, I had not really traveled around Oklahoma  much, or studied Oklahoma much. Many weekends another teacher and  I would take trips around Oklahoma, so I had a real appreciation for our  history. But anyway, I had a father who was patriotic and interested in  politics and what was going on in the world around us, and that often  generated conversation at the dinner table.  As we go along, Mary Fallin initially had this seat that I was in for 12  years, House District 85. And when she aspired onward and upward to  become the Lieutenant Governor of Oklahoma it left an opening, a  vacuum, and my husband used to always say is,    What this state needs is  some more conservative women in the legislature.    One day I said to  him,    Well, what about me?    And he said,    Well, I wasn   t talking about  you.    But anyway he has been most supportive all the way through. So  I kind of combined my love in education for social studies with thinking  that people had been so disgusted, me included, with some of the things  our legislature had done back then, that instead of complaining maybe  one ought to try to jump right in and help change things, if at all  possible.  And the first year I campaigned and knocked on doors, I can remember  so many people saying,    Why would you want to go out to that zoo out  there?    They would make comments like that. It reminded me the people  had to step in and put in term limits, they had to step in and cut the  session back and make it just January through May for us to get our  work done. Enough of this nonsense of covering up the clock and going  24 hours and going all year and whatever. So for ten years I was in the  minority, served with the minority   actually a minority within a  minority because the women were a minority, any way you looked at it.  6  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  And when I started, there were three republican women, three of us were  republican women, and in    94 thirteen republicans were elected to the  House, which gave our republican governor veto proof power. So if he  vetoed something, it could not be overridden if we all stood together,  and we did, thirty-eight of us. And so that was our little bit of power  that we had, which would come toward the end of session when he  would sign or veto bills.  The last two years, I had the privilege of serving in the majority, the first  republican majority since 1921. It was only two years long then and it  was a real challenge. It was so different serving in the majority because  all of a sudden our bills were heard in committees, and they got to the  floor, and we actually passed some things. Being a republican and being  conservative, I do believe that we were taxed too much, and we needed  to lower taxes, not at the expense of any of the things that government is  supposed to do like education and public safety and taking care of our  children. That was one thing I would hear over and over again, that  every which way you looked there were taxes. And in the district that I  represented it was, the majority was made up of conservatives, whether  they be democrats or republicans, we all seemed to think alike. So when  I was campaigning and even when I served, in my mind, I separated  between what would be conservatives and liberals rather than democrats  and republicans.  Also one other thing that I did, I ran for the vice-chairman of the  Oklahoma State Republican Party, and won that and served two terms  there. By the time I ended my career I was the chairman of the House  Education committee, and it was a privilege that the Speaker would  appoint me to that. I felt honored to serve there.  Any other women on that particular committee?  Yes, definitely, uh-huh.  More so than others, I would guess.  I don   t know if that would be true or not, because there are some retired  educators, superintendents. It seems to me in our state back when I was a  counselor so many more were male superintendents. And so you see  some men that are very interested in education. So it wasn   t  predominately women at all, but it was a nice mixture, indeed.  And how many women were in your first session?  In    94?  7  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  In    94.  Oh gee, you may have that, I   m trying to think. I know that I started  with three republican women, and were there seven or nine democrat  women?  What was it like being one of the few women in the House at that time?  At times, to me, it was somewhat lonely because you are not able to  network like the men do. That was one thing. You know you didn   t feel  like you were in with the stream of things, so to speak. I think with time,  that has certainly improved, but being one of just three republican  women was unique especially since the other two had been there awhile.  They both came from the south side of Oklahoma City, so they had a  great deal in common. I came from the north side of Oklahoma City,  and so we didn   t have a lot in common.  The other thing was as far as being able to go out and do things together,  you know you don   t go to men and say,    Let   s go to dinner or lunch or  something,    without a group-type thing. Socially I think   and me being  from Oklahoma City, it didn   t matter because I always went home to my  husband at night and we would go to things together. The other thing is,  at the very beginning, and it   s not true so much now, but at the very  beginning I still detected a few men who still thought it was a men   s  world out there. And they never said anything, it   s just kind of either the  way they treat you or their attitude or whatever. There were a few that  felt that way and there were others much more modern, whereby being a  female didn   t make a difference at all. I think that has really changed  over the years. I   ve noticed that.  Those 12 years made a difference?  Yes. And I think it   s more not whether you   re a male or female but  rather how competent you are. I   ve always been a huge supporter of that.  I did not want anybody to promote me or do anything in deference to me  just because I was a woman. I wanted them to do it because I was  competent and the best one for the job.  Let   s back up a little bit and talk about your first campaign then, did you  have a slogan?  I did and I kept it for twelve years, and when I first said I wanted to do it  my family said,    That   s so corny.    And I said that   s what people will  remember  It was,    Bank on Odilia Dank,    or,    Bank on Dank.    And I  tell you, when I knew it had caught on, one little boy was in his car with  his mother and he said    Bank on Dank.    Because we had six republicans  8  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  running in the primary, there were all kinds of signs along the roadways.  For the first time around, okay.  For the first time around because there was a vacuum, an open seat. And  so we really had to have success getting out our campaign signs. People  were very good to let us put them in their yards and whatever. And this  little boy said to his mother,    Bank on Dank, what does that mean?    And  she was telling me about that. Then a few campaigns down later people  would holler,    Bank on Dank     And so I kept that all twelve years.  Did you have particular colors?  Definitely colors. I had blue predominately and some red and white     tried to be very patriotic, and you know little things like that are big  decisions, because you put a lot of money into signs and some signs  don   t show up well. I was inexperienced with campaigning and we used  to put them up on the fire place and compare which one we liked better.  My husband was always part of the decision because he had been in the  journalism business, had owned a paper and had had some experience  with campaigning. So, yes I kept those colors all the way through.  Did you have a manager?  We did. Interestingly enough, it was a young man who was a student at  UCO  University of Central Oklahoma . But more in name, and more of  a worker to help me go through the neighborhoods. My husband really  was the campaign manager, as far as the brains behind it. He and I pretty  well did our own campaign. And the young man was very good, but he  was inexperienced and young, and so that   s the way we did it.  Did your daughter help campaign?  She   s more apolitical, but she did the first year. Of course she was  starting her own career as a medical doctor and then she started having  babies, so she really had another life and she didn   t live here. So I do  remember the first time I campaigned, she drove me through some  neighborhoods so she was involved when she could be, like that.  Do you have any favorite campaign stories?  Let   s see, I will say this, it has been so humbling to me and amazing  that people will still come up to me and say,    I remember the first time  you knocked on my door.    And that you start a day and you think    Oh,  no,    because it is such hard work knocking on doors day after day and a  lot of times people aren   t home. I would just think,    Oh I don   t know if I  9  Finchum  Dank  can do it today.    And then you   d meet one person who was at home, and  they would just energize you. I would say to myself,    I   ve got to do  more.    It really restores your faith in people, I think, because the  majority of people (what they call the silent majority) is really out there.  And most people do care.  I still trust the people, after all these years. If you give them the facts and  don   t confuse them, they will do the right thing. And so, so many  people were receptive, would take my literature. I never said,    Will you  vote for me?    I just would ask them to consider and to look at my  literature. And so people would often say    Well, what do your polls  show?    Well, I didn   t ever take polls, and I didn   t keep track either.  Some candidates put it on the computer or whatever. I just didn   t do that.  I just concentrated on talking to as many people as I could. The main  thing was that voters were remembering, like that mother telling me  about her son reading my sign.  What was election night like the first time?  Well, it was very interesting because we had to go through a primary. I  had almost won the primary. I had just missed by like point four percent  of a vote or whatever   a very slim margin. But when we got to the run-off,  it became more of a knock-down drag-out fight, and it was  surprising to me because we were both republicans. I didn   t know about  negative campaigning, that republicans really do that against  republicans. And there was a piece put out a few days before the  election. The strategy was to criticize my husband and tell things about  him to take me down. When I was out putting out my flyers, we came  across these and so you have decide whether you   re going to ignore  those kind of pieces or whether you   re going to answer them. What we  learned through experience was that if you say nothing then people  believe those as the true facts. We strained over that and we decided to  answer it and explain. You know half truths are sometimes as bad as a  complete lie.  So anyway, election night, back to your question, it was nip and tuck.  At one point I was losing, and I knew that when I looked at my  husband   s face. I had never seen that expression on his face before. It  came down to one precinct and the absentee ballots, and I did win. I  think I ended up winning by like fifty-two votes, or something like that.  When they say,    Every vote counts,    it   s the truth, and so I then realized  how close I had come. I had not paid that much attention, like I told you  I didn   t keep track of numbers or polls or anything, and so I just kept  thinking about what I was supposed to do each day, and just working  really hard. People did comment later, after I was elected, that I had  worked so hard. I didn   t really know what they meant, because I didn   t  10  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  think I was working any harder than anybody else. But a campaign takes  on legs of its own and you just eat sleep and breathe it for twenty-four  hours a day and you have to kind of put your life aside.  Then I had a democrat opponent and he was an attorney, and as I told  you my district is conservative. I would say moderate conservative to  conservative, and so I didn   t have any trouble there. But when I got out  to the legislature, I suddenly realized that it really was an honor that  people had given to me, and not many people had that privilege. I  promised myself that I would never forget that. And so every election  time, at the end of the session and we were going into the election cycle,  I would look around that house chamber and say,    Some of us will not  be here next time, and I never take this for granted. I may not be here  next time. And I have been so privileged to be here this much.    So I  tried always to be grateful for what the people entrusted to me.  Was each campaign a little different? I   m sure the first one was  probably the hardest, was the second one?  Indeed, there were two   twelve years is six elections and out of those  six, two I did not have an opponent at all. That was a blessing I never  took for granted either because I realized that meant that people still  trusted me and I could not breach their trust. The next one wasn   t a  serious candidate. I   ve never had a republican since the first election.  The next one was not too serious, but I didn   t know it. So we went after  a gnat with a cannonball   full force, hard work, and the whole thing.  The last one, which would have been 2004, was the most developed  democrat campaign against me and it was a young woman teacher. You  had an educator challenging an educator, and a woman challenging a  woman, just different philosophies. But when redistricting happened in  2000, they changed the complexion of House District 85 to where it had  more of your clear democrats, your decidedly definite democrats that  just vote democrat. Also there are some leaders of the Democratic Party  that live in our district, and still do, like Governor David Walters and  Mike Turpin and Jim Roth. They have an influence that is a predominant  presence there, and so there was more support with a democrat candidate  than there had been before. So the first and last campaigns were the  hardest.  What do you think made the difference in the last one then, the party?  I think that they fielded the best candidate that they had in those twelve  years, and interestingly enough she ran against my husband in 2006.  And lost to him?  11  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank     in    06, yes. That   s when there was this huge democrat wave coming  across Oklahoma, and republicans lost ground in many areas, especially  state-wide elected offices. In the House, we didn   t. We held the number  that we had there and the majority. So that was her best chance to win,  and he had had a very contentious primary also like I had had the first  time.  How much do you remember spending on your first time around?  I   m going to say between  35,000 and  45,000 dollars, maybe up to   50,000 dollars but definitely not over that.  And then the last one?  And then the last one, times have really changed, really changed. It takes  a lot more now a days. I   m trying to remember, I think between maybe   85,000 dollars and let   s see   it   s been a long time since I thought of  that.  So it doubled, at least?  Yes, I would say that.  Can you describe your thoughts and feelings the day you were sworn in  the first time?  I think I can because I   ll never forget. That it is a once in a lifetime,  unique experience, and it   s just absolutely overwhelming almost. You   re  sitting on the floor on the part of the seat of power in Oklahoma, and the  galleries are packed with all these people cheering and everything.  You   re swearing to abide by not only the Constitution of Oklahoma but  the United States of America. And it just suddenly hits you. It hit me  that it   s a tremendous responsibility, and that there are a lot of people to  whom you owe a very accountable two years.  And that capitol building, just walking into it is just, to me, so  overwhelming and awesome, that even sets a mood for when you first  walk in. I had been out there once before, in the gallery, to watch the  House, many years ago. I don   t know if I took some students or what.  But the first time I was to go out there, I remember I felt like an airplane  circling. I went through the wrong roads and things and had to go back  and find the right path to the House parking lot.  Being sworn in by one of the Supreme Court judges and looking around  and seeing a hundred and one members, it   s one of those experiences in  life like when you get married or you have children. It   s one of those  12  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  great    A-ha   s    of life. I guess a lot of people do those things, but this is  more unique. It   s just a thrilling, unforgettable experience. But with it  comes suddenly the feeling of a responsibility not just to my family or  my husband or anything like that, or friends, but to a whole group of  people. When you think you represent thirty-five thousand people and  they put you there, and all of a sudden it dawns on you, that this is not a  free ride. People would always say after that swearing in,    Are you  enjoying yourself?    Well (Laughs) you know sometimes you are and  sometimes you aren   t, just trying to do the right thing.  Describe a typical day. How early would you get there, how late would  you have to stay?  A typical day in the middle of the session, maybe get there seven thirty,  somewhere along in there, and maybe we   d be through around four or  five depending on what committees you had. But lots of phone calls, and  lots of reading   just tremendous amount of reading, whether it   s bills in  your committee or whether those that are going to be on the floor that  day, and stacks of mail from agencies or constituents or groups that have  legislation. Just to keep up with the reading is an absolutely tremendous  challenge. Your day   s never really planned all the way. You go to  committee meetings at a certain time or session at a certain time but  people drop in all the time and you never know how long that will take.  And so that   s always every day, never boredom, never routine. I mean  it   s a whole new day, every day, on what is going to happen that day.  Did you lunch in most days?  I did for sure because I used that time to do a lot of reading. I did not  like to leave the building. I just preferred to keep my head to the grind  and keep up because I was very big on reading bills. Now some make a  choice whether they   re going to do that or not or rely on other people to  tell them what is in bills.  I had a most memorable experience and it   ll take a little bit to explain  and then we   ll go from there. In 1997, 1998 somewhere in there, at the  end of session the routine has been in Oklahoma, that all the important  legislation is saved for the last two days. The last two days they can  bring any piece of legislation that   s come out of conference. We could  have fifty bills on our desk that are put there as we   re down on the floor.  So in that year, I believe    98, I had been waiting for the J.D. McCarty  funding, because I was very interested in that particular facility getting  its money.  We got there, and I couldn   t find the bill on my desk so I raised my hand  and said,    Hold it, I don   t have a bill.    Well everything came to a  13  screeching halt, silence. And the majority leader, who at that time sat in  the front and I sat in the back (you sit in the back when you   re new) said,     I   ve got one up here.    So I started up front because I had asked all  around and nobody had a bill. I thought maybe I had misplaced it, so I  checked first. So I start up there and he goes and leaves the chamber. I  found out later not even the Speaker had a bill.  So I began to talk about that we should have time to read the bills to  know what we   re voting on, and so I was saying,    It seems to me we  ought to have twenty-four hours to read the bills, mull them over, digest  them, let them be checked with people who are going to be affected by  it, and make sure we didn   t have any unintended consequences. Well I  came to find out in the Constitution of Oklahoma it says,    No bill will be  passed in its final form until it   s read from beginning to end at length,     and there   s where the rub was, because it became interpreted to mean  what? It   s not really practical to sit up there and read each bill like they  did at the beginning before they had copy machines, fax machines,  whatever. But to me, no matter. We needed time to see what the heck we  were voting on, especially when we were spending millions of dollars.  It   s like a blank check if you don   t know what you   re doing.  So I tried going up the chain of command in the proper way. I tried  changing the House rules. Now we were in the minority so, of course, I  was outvoted and not heard. I tried the joint rules, when we were in joint  session which was not very often, and I was tabled on that and  absolutely not. So then I went to the Attorney General for a ruling, and  his ruling was,    Yes it   s in the Constitution, but kind of   .    Of course  his ruling does not have any force of law or anything, it is merely an  opinion. So my husband and I decided we would go to the Oklahoma  Supreme Court, which we did. And we paid for it ourselves and we got a  very capable attorney. They didn   t rule, until I think it was right before  the session was to end in May 2000.  I had given them all these examples of bills that we had passed in the  last two days, and one of them was this huge truth in sentencing bill that  turned our entire criminal code upside down. Nobody had time to read it.  We had a recess of thirty minutes, forty-five minutes to peruse this when  they brought it to us. And we made it law. It was a disaster, it was to go  into effect the next July and we postponed it till the next July. We had to  have a special session in the day or two before it was to go into effect.  We undid it. It took all that work to undo something that just to me  wasn   t handled correctly.  I gave the Supreme Court examples of how at one point, the last day, we  were taking a bill every three minutes. It was being presented and  questions and voted on and the next one. Some of them were hot off the  14  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  press. They were still warm when they were being passed out. Well the  Supreme Court ruled against me. There are reasons I think that happened  but their reasoning was that this was an internal issue with the House, it  was not a Constitutional issue, and that they were breaching the  separation of powers. What was very interesting was, that after that the  Speaker always made sure that we had twenty-four hours, except for the  last two days, and that has continued. It   s continuing to this day, and that  is something that needs to be fixed.  In my opinion the last day or two days should be to clean up things,  emergencies, something we did wrong in a bill that   s got to be corrected  because of something that   s getting ready to happen soon. The trick has  been, if you want to pass something and it   s onerous, put it in a bill that  has some really good stuff in it, then how can they vote against it, and  they won   t have time to read it either. And it was jokingly called     woolly boogers    that are put in these bills at the last minute. It was a  joke  Can you find the woolly booger? And I guess I took it much more  seriously than that, and there have been some things that have been  detrimental, in my opinion, to the people of Oklahoma in this way. So  I   m hopeful, as we   re in the majority, if we ever get the Senate, that  we   ll be able to do something about the last two days. In my book it   s a  travesty.  And your husband will carry that torch for you?  I   m hoping.  So what other committees were you a member of?  I started out   I   ve always been on Education, and I   ve been on a  Children and Family Committee and Corrections. However, Revenue  and Taxation and Education were the two that were very important to  me the last two years. I have believed that with, for example, ad valorem  taxes, that we should freeze those taxes on Seniors, till they move out of  their house. They have things that happen to them that their fixed  income cannot control. One of the big things that they all seem to have is  prescription drugs which we all know cost outrageous. Seniors have  called me every year, and some of them afraid of losing their home,  because they can   t pay their taxes. That was a very important committee  to me.  And the Education committee was my love. My big thrust there was to  try education reform in certain ways for the schools, the public schools  of Oklahoma, because our kids have been behind. They couldn   t read  and they couldn   t do math when I got out there. We don   t have good  scores. And so by the end of my term we had passed a very rigorous  15  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  curriculum, and if we can just keep it intact so that kids would be  prepared to go to college, or the world of work, after they get out of high  school. That was always my goal and many other people   s because we  passed that. We have a steering committee to try and follow along with  that now, to see where the problems are and see if we can implement  that.  Any other successful deals from your standpoint?  Oh yes, parental notification was important to me. We had parental  notification passed when I was first in the legislature. Having been a  high school counselor and not being able to give a child an aspirin  without a parent   s permission, it seemed to me that a parent ought to be  notified if their daughter was going to have an abortion, because that   s a  huge life changing experience. I had some experiences, as a high school  counselor, that were unpleasant. Often parents didn   t know. They   re the  main one that can help a child, except for some unusual situations. We  had put into that bill for the exceptions that a judge could, under certain  conditions, help that girl if she was in an abusive family or whatever was  the unusual situation. The health and well being of children and the  unborn has been something that I thought was important from the  parental notification position. By the time I left the Oklahoma  Legislature we had passed into law parental consent.  Any major disappointments besides the reading the bills on the last two  days?  Yes. I got the ad valorem tax freeze on senior citizens through the  House, but the Senate would not even give it a hearing. That was a big  disappointment to me, because we all have senior citizens in our  districts. And it, in my opinion, boils down to some very special interest  groups that have a great deal of power. The argument has always been  you   re going to cause education to suffer. And it   s not taking anything  away from education and it   s only where senior citizens are concerned.  As we   re growing businesses, and at the time our homes were booming.  We had apartments being built all the time and homes and everything.  Our base has been growing and that   s, to me, the key of the ad valorem  being supportive of education, but not on the backs of senior citizens. So  I was disappointed with that. We did get tax cuts in on income tax, but  the disappointment was that   the compromise was,    Yes, we   ll put this  in a bill. We   ll cut taxes down to 5.65 percent, but we   re only going to  start it in 2010.    So that   s the way we do some things also.  Let me back up a bit. I meant to ask you if you had a mentor in the  political arena, a role model?  16  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Well I would say Mary Fallin was certainly a role model. Now she was  starting her own new career as a Lieutenant Governor but mentor as  such   not really. And maybe I didn   t seek out one either, but we didn   t  have a set up like that in the House either. I think they have more of a set  up now to do that. We had group things like orientation or members who  were always helpful individually, if you asked for help, but there wasn   t  a designated thing like that at all.  Growing up, did you have a role model?  Oh, I definitely did, my dad and mom, and believe it or not, my husband  is a role model. My dad was a self-made man who in grade school a  teacher told him he   d never amount to anything and his mother would  tell him that too. You know how boys, I guess, are naughty from time to  time, but he became a doctor, because that   s what he wanted to do. And  my parents stayed married to each other all the years they were alive,  and raised four of us that did not give them any trouble, and I think  that   s to their tribute too. But they showed us how to live, and the work  ethic, and the value of religion and what family means and things like  that.  My husband, on the other hand, I admire for his   he has a political  acumen that not many people have, I don   t think. He has a financial  human computer up there. And I   ve just observed him over the years  that we   ve been married in the way he   s lived his life. He   s always been  a fair person, a generous person. He   s always giving money, even to the  person who brings out the groceries. I have learned to do that from him,  I never thought about it before. So I feel like I   ve learned a lot of things  from him, and yet he can make a fist. People tease him and they   ll say  he   s so wishy-washy you never can tell where he stands. Actually, he is  never shy to tell you exactly where he stands. I learned to stand up  stronger for what I believed in, and he has always been supportive,  except for one time when I came home having been at the legislature late  at night. The closer you get to the end of May, sometimes you have late  nights. And he said    How did you vote on the bill so and so?    And I told  him and he said    Good, because if you didn   t I was going to run against  you     And so he even told me what he thought, but I have learned from  him.  The teacher I remember that was a role model for me was a fourth grade  teacher in a little old country school where we went, who was the  strongest grammar teacher I would ever know. And I went to a private  high school, the best my parents could find. They knew education was  the key to our future, and so they sacrificed so we could go to the best  private school they could find, because that was the best school at the  time in the area. And in all that education she was the best teacher and  17  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  the best grammar teacher.  Then I have a friend that was a counselor with me, and I still meet her  for lunch from time to time, and in some ways, she doesn   t even know  this, she is a role model. She is a marvelous woman with a lot of logical  reasoning. So I have a lot of role models and I look constantly for them.  One of the places I look is in the sports page too   looking for role  models for my grandchildren. Some of these football players have had  such hard lives, and how they have been so strong and made it. And I  guess I think on days when I   m having a bad day and you do your    poor  me    thing, and you think about other people, I think that   s when I see  them as a role model, what they lived through.  Good answer.  I   m rambling but there   s not just one role model, there are so many  around.  That   s good. I wanted to ask about the Murrah Building bombing,  because it occurred while you were in office.  Just right after we were sworn in.  What do you remember about it?  I remember Governor Keating, I mean it was his first year, you know,  just learning to be a governor, and how marvelous he was, and his wife  and how much of a leader they were, both of them together for us. But it  was kind of frightening because at the time I was on the second floor of  the Department of Labor, and there was a noise and the pictures shook a  little bit. We were wondering was it an earthquake or a tornado starting  or what? And then you looked out the window and saw that smoke.  Then I went to the Capitol. They called us into session, emergency. One  of the men had just dropped off his child down there on the street where  the Murrah Building was, and so he kind of gave us a firsthand  description of what had happened to him. And then we adjourned  because immediately the question was, would it happen somewhere  else? Would they be after the government, would they be after the  Capitol or whatever. So we adjourned and left the building, and of  course I remember, like others did you know, seeing all that we went  through after that.  How soon after that did the session start back up, do you remember?  Well I think it was the next day, after it was determined what had  happened. We did not indefinitely adjourn. I don   t know what day that  18  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  was, it might have been a Thursday, see we don   t meet on Fridays. I  don   t remember what day of the week that would have been, but it  wasn   t an indefinite thing. It wasn   t that scary once you realized what  had happened, once they pieced together. It was just frightening as far  as   incomprehensible, I guess you   d say, that that could happen.  And you were there when they were debating whether or not to do the  trial for Nichols?  Yes, and that didn   t involve us really, other than to follow it. I did serve  with Charlie Key who at the time felt like there might have been  something to the fact that there might have been more than one person  involved with that. That didn   t seem to take much hold out at the  legislature, and we just kept going about our business.  Do you have any thoughts for women who are thinking about going into  the political arena?  I just would encourage anyone that has any political interest to do it. We  do need more women in government. I think women have some special  things to offer. I don   t think we   re as easily swayed as men, or our  attention as diverted, I should say. We pay attention to detail and are  very serious about our work. But it seems to me that there are a great  amount of women in Oklahoma that put family first, so they want to  raise their family, and I commend them for that. But I say there   s life  after your children fly the coup too, and you   re not too old to do that.  You can certainly get involved when you   re younger, with the party, the  campaigns, and helping good people get elected. We must continue to  elect good people, because we know what happens when we don   t do  that. And a good example of a young woman that puts her family first,  when I term-limited we tried to convince this young woman to run. She  had been out there as a legislative assistant and she knew the system and  she was so good. She was in the private business world, so she knew  that. And she said,    Let me think about it,    and the next day she said you  know,    I haven   t completely raised my child.    She had two children, one  was pretty well on his way,    I haven   t completely raised my daughter,  and I need to do that first, that   s my priority.    And I admired her for that  so much. She   s young enough, she was a single parent but she will  someday maybe be at a stage in her life where she   ll get back into  politics again. So I always encourage them. We had a young woman in  this last campaign for David that is just wonderful and she's so  politically oriented and I think she   ll run some day. I really do and we  certainly encourage that.  And you   ll be a role model for her.  19  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Oh well, maybe so if she thinks I know some things.  That brings us to an interesting point, You termed out and then your  husband ran and won the seat. What was that like, the roles being flip-flopped?  It was certainly different. The whole time I was at the legislature I  almost felt like when I stepped into that Capitol, it was like another  world. And I also felt like it was almost as if God had some part in me  being out there. I would say,    What am I doing out here?    sometimes.  And there are the frustrations and there are the joys and the stress and all  that, but it was like I was in a different world, and in a dream land.  When I was term limited and having to make the shift back to just being  a public citizen, I didn   t have time to have withdrawals or feel sorry or  have any depression because we went immediately into a campaign. As  we   ve talked before, I mean the campaign takes legs of its own and  wants your body and soul for twenty four hours a day. We would work  so hard and be so tired by the end of the day you really slept well. So it  wasn   t until after he was elected and sworn in and started the session  that it occurred to me that they were going to go on without me and that  that was okay. It was just different, I wasn   t the one going out there  anymore, he was. And he would be the one that would be carried high  and paid attention to and all of that, which I   m very happy for him  because he worked hard and will do a good job.  The thing I really miss, I don   t miss having to be a public figure and  keeping up with the strenuous schedule. I miss the people, and that   s  what I hadn   t anticipated. I did go out for the swearing in and then I left.  I guess I   m a coward or something because I thought,    I   m going to be  sad if I start running into people.    But when I   ve gone back out there it  has been so gratifying to know that people would say,    I miss you,    and  not,    I   m glad you left. We   re glad to get rid of you       or anything. It  was just so nice that I started realizing that   s what I really missed, was  that every day camaraderie, and seeing the same people and talking with  them.  Not just men, but women too?  Oh both, oh definitely. There are some really good people out there.  And I always viewed myself as a citizen legislator. It was not my whole  life. We had a wonderful full-blown life outside of the legislature,  although at the time and especially during session it took my undivided  attention and time. Every time I ran I would say,    Well God if       I   d  say a little prayer that I   d like to do it again, but if not, we had a full life.  The world wasn   t going to end, and what has happened is I haven   t had  20  Finchum  Dank  time to be bored or say,    Oh no, woe is me. What am I going to do?     because my husband and I have traded positions. I   m now down at the  business office every day, so I   m involved with that and he   s doing the  other thing. It took me probably four or five months just to catch up with  stuff I had pushed aside or stacked and it needs to be organized. I need  to catch up with things I put off. I   m just now starting to, well probably  first of June or July, just started to relax and smell the roses, one year  after David   s campaign.  Was the campaign a little bit different between your running and his  running?  Yes, and one of the things we had to do was separate the two of us now.  You know we had run and he had always supported me, but I had always  been in the forefront. When I first ran people would say, that were  against me,    He   s going to be the one telling her what to do.    Well when  he ran then the ones that didn   t like us, or on the other side I should say,  wanted their candidate to win, would say,    You know she   s the one  that   s going to be telling him what to do.    Also they say,    Well now are  they trying to have a    Dank Dynasty    or what, what is this?    That would  be what the other side would say.  One person at the door with one of our volunteers   we had three young  college students this time that were just marvelous, three young men that  are so politically astute. They are leaders in student government, they  were at the junior college, they   re now at UCO, and they are up there  involved. They   re going to be some of the leaders in our state someday  and we just encourage them and love them. But they just worked so hard  in this campaign. One of them walked to the door and the person said,     Now I thought we believed in term limits, and I thought Odilia believed  in term limits, now why is he running? Are we just going to extend this  Dank thing?    And the young man, who is very sharp said,    You know,  David has never run before, and he is an individual, and so just look at  him and what he stands for and see what you think, if he   s the better  candidate.    And I just applauded that young man, I was very impressed.  He kept his cool, he was very poised, and he gave a good answer I  thought.  But we had a unique campaign from another angle in that David was  running against a Keating. So neither side could use the argument, well  you know he   s using her name, well he   s using his dad   s name. His signs  were just like his dad   s, and David   s were different than mine, but the  same colors. That made it kind of interesting that the former governor  was out knocking doors on weekends. So we were up against a pretty  formidable opponent in the primary, and so it was interesting from that  angle also. And his son, the governor   s son, had moved into our district  21  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  specifically to run. He had come about two years before, and of course  we   ve lived in the district for years and years and years. So it was pretty  interesting, and I don   t know if you want to know any of the specifics of  it but     Sure.     one example would be Chip Keating had on his literature, you know  he protected the public for three years as a highway patrolman. Well  David had a flyer with five retired patrolmen, one was a major and   that  have known David forever, I mean he didn   t just go find these people  and say,    Do you like what I   m doing and will you vouch for me,    these  have been friends of his forever. They spoke on the area of law  enforcement where David was concerned, so each one had an answer for  the other as far as qualifications. Chip said he graduated from Bishop  McGuiness, well he didn   t know David had graduated from Bishop  McGuiness. So we had families where, the kids were for Chip, his age  group, the parents were for David. And so we had one yard where our  sign was up, and then it was down and Chip   s was up, and then the next  week ours was up. We finally figured out and talked to them, that the  son had gone to school with Chip.  Generational differences.  Generational differences. We both went to the same church, but we had  been there for years and years and years, but he had come. So it was an  interesting campaign. David won the primary, and there were four  republicans in the primary. He skidded through there with 25 votes.  Oh gosh.  So we were calling him    land-slide Dank.    And then he went to 87 votes  in the run-off. He beat Chip in the run-off. Then he had a very  contentious democrat with the woman educator I was telling you about,  and he won that one by 127 or something like that. So he would tease  me, cause I won the run off by 52, and he only won the primary by 25,  but he said,    I over doubled mine, when I got going.    But every voter  that will go to the polls could be that one that makes a difference, and to  impress that on people is hard to do. Because, you know, we have such  a small percentage of people that actually vote in primaries and run-off  primaries.  Does he approach his typical day any different than you did?  We had a totally different style. As he says, he bounces off of walls and  he   s extremely passionate, but our philosophy is the same.  22  Finchum  Dank  Which is?  It has to do with trying to make a change out at the legislature for the  good of our kids and grandkids. We want them to live in this state, and  we don   t want to leave them with a financial burden. This state is so in  debt right now, and every time we do a bond issue we   re just indebting  our children more. He has the advantage of the Senate being even-steven  split, so he can get something passed in the House, and maybe get it  through the Senate. For example, we both have been very high on ethics,  and that is at the top of his list now. They would never have time for my  ethics bills, never had a hearing, but we both have always believed you  should not take money during the session, because of the perception.  And I   m not talking about  50 dollars or  200, but you have to make a  rule because of the big bucks that are being passed down, like a  1,000,   2,000,  5,000 dollars.  The amount of  5,000 dollar contributions from special interests gives  the perception that you   re paying to have some legislation brought  forward. And perception out there, whether you like it or not, is the  reality. Now that we   re in charge, and he makes no distinction between  democrats or republicans, this is the way it should be. You should have  plenty of time outside of that to collect money, and people will give you  money if you do the right thing. What you believe is right the people that  support you are going to be there.  The argument has been made that,    Oh, then the people running against  me are going to get ahead of me.    Well his bill says anybody running for  the legislature, whether it   s an incumbent that   s in the seat now or any  new person, anybody cannot do any fundraising there during the session  or fifteen days before or fifteen days after, that there   s plenty of time to  do that. That shouldn   t be that way because the people kind of get left  out. They don   t have lobbyists out there as such nor the large amounts of  money.  For example, one of my biggest disappointments that I didn   t mention is  the very contentious vote we had on whether to send the gambling bill to  the people to vote on. And it had to do with, in Oklahoma we had Class  II gambling, which had to do with Bingo connected type things, and the  Indians want Class III gambling, which is more like Las Vegas. And we  had at the time over eighty casinos in the state. It was all sold to the  voters as being good for education. What we   re going to do is, we   re  going to allow Class III in certain instances, in some of these card  games. Then for the first time, the Indians are going to have to pay some  taxes, on these new games, not the old ones, not all the old ones they  had, just these new ones. And they   re going to pay two percent to four  percent, maybe up to six percent to the state, if you have these new  23  games. If an Indian tribe decided not to have those new games they  didn   t have any taxes still. And we   ll let Remington Park and the one  over in Tulsa, Fair Meadows, have a certain kind of games, and they   re  going to pay 10 percent to the state, and they can   t have the new games.  And we   re going to have compact with the Indians and everybody that  this is the way it   s going to be for 15 years, and the legislature cannot  change one thing. That   s what we sent to the people and there were four  legislators who flipped over to vote to send that to the people. My side,  the side I was on didn   t feel the people would understand what all the  repercussions were and what this was going to do to Oklahoma. And so  the whole deal was for education, and they   re going to get all this money  and you remember the lottery was there too, and that was another  disappointment that went to the people at the same time.  It was projected we were going to have  300 million dollars. Then it was  projected we   d have a  150 million dollars. We have never met those.  The raise for teachers was going to be paid for by the lottery, and we  were going to put money into five percent of what was left after you  paid all the people that run the lottery and everything. So then if it is 35  percent or 45 percent, that   s left for the state, we   re going to divide it.  We   re going to give this much of our amount to teachers    raises, this  much to higher ed., this much to teachers    retirement, like that. Every  year the legislature has had to put money in, because we haven   t even  been able to pay for the raise to the teachers, because the lottery has not  met its goals, and the Indians have not gone hog wild over these Class  III. Now some of them, the bigger ones do have the card games, which  everybody supposedly loves, you know. Supposedly you   re not  supposed to be playing against the house. You   re supposed to be playing  against each other, and they just get a little percent for allowing that to     having the dealer and all that stuff.  It   s very complicated, and the amount of money that went into that  campaign to get the gambling and lottery passed versus the people who  were against it, couldn   t overcome that, couldn   t even touch it, and so  that was a huge disappointment. That   s the way it   s going to be for a  while, and the amount of money that Indian tribes have put into  campaigns is phenomenal. They don   t have to report to the ethics  commission, because they are sovereign nations and are special and are  outside. That might be an area in ethics that we need to attend to as to  during session, money should not be exchanged when legislation is up.  So that   s the argument on that side, and you know the other side has  their argument too. All the society illnesses that go with gambling now  must be addressed. But David will be very much in that arena.  He is very adamant that he is going to see if he can get this ad valorem  24  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  freeze for seniors passed through the legislature. He also feels that this  five percent annual increase in ad valorem taxes for everybody, is almost  like conscription in that we have no say. Nobody explains why they need  the increase, and he says, you know,    If they explain to us they have to  be accountable and show us, that   s one thing, but five percent is pretty  strong.    And so he   d like to see that lowered, and then let each county  justify why we need to do it. If it   s for the schools   you know like  when we did MAPS  for Kids ? The people voted for that, when we  were explained how it was going to be set up, who was accountable,  where the money was going to go, what they were going to do. And  they   ve done what they said they would do, so we passed MAPS Two.  So again, if you can give people reasons for why you either need to raise  their taxes or whatever, I think people respond and he   ll be that  direction. I was more in the education direction and couldn   t do much  with ad valorem or the ethics, so those will be his strengths.  Sounds like we still need you in there.  (Laughs) Oh, I tell you what, we   ve got some good ones there. The thing  I haven   t mentioned is that I always viewed myself as a citizen  legislator. I think there are two types of politicians out at the legislature.  There are the career politicians and there are the citizen type politicians,  that don   t view that as their job in life, or whatever. And there are some  that   s their job and that   s their life and their world, and their number one  thing is to see that they get re-elected, because they want to be there.  And this legislature right now, in the House has some really good  people, who have been out in life, had businesses, raised families, paid  unemployment taxes, paid social security taxes for other the people that  they hired. It   s such a different group of different careers coming  together, and they have so much to offer.  Not all attorneys, huh?  That   s right, that is right. One fellow is in the carpet cleaning business,  one is a retired fire chief, and one was a farmer. He is paralyzed from  here down and got elected. He   s from Enid, got a piece of new  equipment, a three wheeler, and it turned over on him. He and David sit  in the back of the chamber together, and he is remarkable. He is very  handicapped, but boy that doesn   t slow him down. So we have some  really good people out there.  You commented earlier that there was a difference. Women couldn   t ask  the guys out to dinner. Now that David   s in, will he be able to do that a  little more than you could?  Oh, listen, I can see the networking. They   ll call and David will say,    Oh  25  Finchum  Dank  let   s go to lunch tomorrow.    If I were going to meet a man for  something, I would take David with me. Now maybe I   m old fashion,  and maybe it   s the generation gap again but   I can remember one time,  after session was over, I was talking on the floor with the one I told you  was my student when I was a teacher, when he was in junior high. And I  mean people were up asking what have they got going, or something like  that, I mean he   s   think how much younger he is than I am. But, it  might be different as more women are there now.  Right before I went out there, the women didn   t even have a separate  bathroom for the House members. At one end there was a bathroom for  the men, but there wasn   t one for the women. Then they took a closet  out and put a women   s bathroom in there. Then by the time I ended my  career, we went from a brand new one-bathroom when I started to a two.  So it   s kind of interesting how things are changing but the networking, I  think there are some women now that they   re kind of with each other,  but we   re still in such a minority, that it   s not part of the bigger picture.  But that   s just my opinion. You might get a different view for some that  are newer elected than I am. But not a week goes by that one of these  freshman legislators calls David    and some of the more senior  legislators.  And they didn   t do that when you were a freshman?  No, no the three of us, (Laughs) no we didn   t call each other. However,  my last few years we would call on legislation. Yes, we started calling,  and so I think it   s changed quite a bit now. It was shocking to me the last  year I was in the House, the Speaker asked me to come up and sit in the  chair there at the very end, the last week or so. If he had to make a phone  call or if he had to go to the bathroom or whatever, he   d send somebody  down to ask me if I would come sit in the chair. He did that two or three  different times.  And then another one, who was our floor majority leader, and the  majority leader, all the legislation goes through him, so he controls  what's coming up next and what's going to be heard tomorrow and all  that. He came over to me the last day and said,    Would you feel  comfortable speaking for us on commending the Speaker for this session  and for his hard work?    because it was really a difficult end of session.  This the last one I was in. I said,    Sure, I   ll do it. I   ll try to do it.    When  they say its five o   clock, it   s over. They usually throw papers up and  everybody   s talking and you never get their attention again. But  everybody quieted down and I was able to say some things about what  he had accomplished and done for us and that as the House we should  and we did appreciate what he had done on our behalf. He spoke for all  of us when he went and negotiated. So I saw a marked difference from  26  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  when I first got there and at the end.  I   d say there was a marked difference in how you felt that day, versus  the first time you presented a bill on the floor.  Oh, I felt so intimidated the first time, and I thought I was the only one  that felt that way. It was hard to understand because when you   ve  taught   you know I was in education for 28 years, and you   re up in  front of kids all the time, I couldn   t understand it. But it is so different  and it is extremely intimidating and I found out, that wasn   t just me. It   s  true, even some of the ones that are freshman right now have  commented about that. Very nerve-racking, and you don   t know what  questions are going to be thrown at you, and they   re always harder on  the freshman and tease them.  I was thrown a curve. I had a simple little bill. It wasn   t changing  anything, it didn   t have any money in it. It was just the osteopath doctors  wanted to change a couple of their rules. And one of my own  republicans who had been there for a long time came up and said,    You  don   t mind if I put an amendment on that bill, do you?    Well being one  of my cohorts supposedly on the same side as I, I said,    Well no, that   d  be okay.    In those days you could just go up there and put on an  amendment and then everybody would be told what it was and then  you   d vote on it. Nobody knew what amendments were up there or what  we were going to vote on. Now you have to do it a few days in advance  so everybody can see it which is much more orderly. The osteopaths  about blew up when they found out what he was doing, and of course, it  ended up being voted down but they said,    What happened out there?     So this little simple thing turned into a problem. Anyway that   s the  hardest bill I think I ever did because of the initial first-time stress of  presenting a bill.  At the end of day you were glad to have your cup of hot chocolate or  whatever?  I was just glad when the vote was over and I could sit down.  Did you have to buy a new wardrobe?  You know, I did upgrade my wardrobe because I wanted the people I  represented to be proud of me. My husband was good enough to spend  more money than I was used to spending, because I was always very  frugal. He calls me cheap, and I say,    I   m frugal, very frugal.    And so I  did buy some very practical type of suits and I have watched some of the  other women that have been elected upgrade their wardrobes as they  have gone along. It   s been interesting to watch but if you   re going to be  27  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  in that sort of position you need to look professional. That   s what I   ve  learned.  Some have said it   s so they can stay warm when they   re in the chamber.  Well, it   s darn cold in there  That   s true too because I learned to always  buy long sleeves. In the winter I always had many different kinds of  turtlenecks. The men, most of them wear long sleeve shirts and then  their coats over it, and then they turn on the fans. So even though there   s  a lot of hot air in there, it doesn   t counteract. (Laughter)  We   ve covered a lot of things. Is there anything that I haven   t asked that  I need to cover? Have you stayed in touch with any of the women that  you served with?  Yes, that   s one advantage of having David there is that I run into them  from time to time.  Any close friendships though?  That I would call and just say,    Hi, how are you doing?    That kind of  thing?  Mm-hmm.  Not really, although as I think, there are a couple that I   ve called to go to  lunch with from time to time, so I think that counts in their busy  schedule and what mine has been. And I   ll tell you truthfully too, I think  I   d be more comfortable doing it now. I tried to do what David did for  me. He stayed away so I could do my thing. For years he didn   t come  out there really, and then the last year he   d kind of come up to my office  for a little bit and hang around. I   ve tried to kind of stay out of his way  too, and not even give any suggestion that I   m trying to tell him what to  do. It   s his thing, you know. But he always includes me for dinners he  sets up or lunches and especially if they bring their wives, I have now  become acquainted in forming friendships with wives of legislators  which is a new area that I   m very much enjoying.  What you   ve done since leaving office?  Since leaving office I have become the person who is running the  business. We have a Dank Consulting business and we have one  secretary. It   s a small organization, but that   s what I   ve been doing day  in and day out. So now I   m a business woman.  And you still get up early (Laughs).  28  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Dank  Finchum  Yes indeed, not quite as early, but still have to get up.  And not as much reading then?  Oh I think I ruined my eyes out there, I really do. I   m just denying the  fact that maturity sets in and you eventually have to wear glasses. I  started out in oh, about six years into the deal I was wearing the reading  glasses. But now it   s full time.  Well my last question is, when history is written about you what would  you like it to say?  Well I guess I would like to think that people approved of what I   ve  done in the several careers I   ve had. And that I have not been an  arrogant, know-it-all, egotistical person, but rather somebody who has  tried to listen and be humble and appreciate and ever grateful for the  opportunities I   ve had in my life that have just been remarkable. I just  think I   ve been so fortunate and blessed, and I wonder why. But I hope  I   ve been a good mother and a good grandmother and a good wife, and a  good legislator and a good educator. You know, from time to time you  get a little feedback if you run into a former student, and they actually  remember you and say something nice without any prodding or  anything. Then I think I get some idea that maybe I   ve been able to have  a chance to make a mark in somebody   s life. And I just mainly hope that  everybody to whom I   ve been responsible would be proud of what I   ve  done, and that   s been my main goal.  I   d say you   ve achieved that.  Time will tell, I tell you.  Time has already told.  Oh, you   re most kind.  Okay, well thank you very much for your time.  ---  ---
