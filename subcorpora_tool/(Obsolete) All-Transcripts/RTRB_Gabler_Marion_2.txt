GABLER: [looking at photographs] This is me and my husband before he died,
relaxing here at this place.

STEIN: Oh, look at that. Oh, you guys look like you were kicking back, taking it easy.

GABLER: After the rainy season was over, and we was finally enjoying the sunshine.

STEIN: Wow, that’s really nice. Okay, this is Tape 2 with Marion Gabler,
it’s still August 24.

GABLER: I think I wrote 25 on one of those papers

STEIN: Oh, that’s not a problem, don’t worry. So here’s a question. A lot
of people when you talk to them who were Rosies, or did different war industry
work, said that when they got to their job they got this feeling of freedom or
independence that they hadn’t had before. Was that something that you experienced?

GABLER: I was always independent. I was always the oldest kid in the family, and
the family was the only thing in those days. I always had confidence. So, no, I
didn’t feel anything different. It was just pleasure. Oh, boy, I leave
Hastings and go to Lansing, work in the TB Sanitarium, wonderful. Oh, boy, this
guy’s going to go down to Willow Run, and we’re all going to apply for jobs,
wonderful. I finally get married, he goes into service, we have babies,
wonderful. But he did die unexpectedly at fifty-five.

STEIN: That’s young.

GABLER: Three years later this fellow came in, and he was wonderful, too.

STEIN: That’s lucky. That’s more than a lot of people have. Two great husbands.

GABLER: Yeah, two really good guys.

STEIN: Yeah. So did you and Ralph get married at Willow Run?

GABLER: We went over to -- I left that all up to him. He got a justice of the
peace at Belleville, which I don’t how far it is away from Willow Run, but
justice of the peace. And when we got there he came in out of his garden,
sleeves rolled up, and got the next-door neighbor to be the other witness. My
best girlfriend was there for my witness. We just got married in his living
room. I recommend that kind of marriage to anybody, especially after going to
some of these elaborate ones. Then having some of the elaborate ones crash.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: You might just as well went to a justice of the peace. So the second
time I got married at the American Legion, and the only preacher that would come
and marry us was the local one that knew me. The Methodist preachers acted like
it was sacrilegious.

STEIN: Why was that?

GABLER: When they found out I didn’t want to go to their church and get married.

STEIN: Oh.

GABLER: Yeah, this fellow that we knew where we went to Sunday School, being the
youngest boy, he was Southern Baptist. He was so tickled. He didn’t know I’d
already asked four other preachers, and they had turned me down.

STEIN: They didn’t want to marry someone outside of the church, is that the idea?

GABLER: Yeah, evidently. They certainly didn’t want to marry them in the
American Legion, so we had a wedding there and a reception and square dancing
and stuff at that second one. But it still wasn’t in a church. It wasn’t
real elaborate. My husband was from here, and his sister came from Oregon
because he paid her way, and two cousins from Chicago drove up because he was
sixty-five and never got married. The curiosity got them to --

STEIN: To come all the way to California?

GABLER: No, we got married in Edwardsburg, Michigan. He came back to get married
there. That’s how come I had such a crowd. My friends and relatives were all
there. They said I had 300 people, and he had six.

STEIN: Wow.

GABLER: But it was two good marriages.

STEIN: Yeah. Were a lot of young men and women at the factory meeting each
other, going on dates, getting married? Was it a very social place?

GABLER: We were social; my girlfriend and I were sociable with who we met at the
time. Neither one of us ever knew or cared what was going on other than in our
own personal lives. So I don’t know what was going on. One of the inspectors
who had been married I don’t know how many years, we were -- of course, my
girlfriend and I weren’t married; she was an inspector there in that aileron
department, a blond, and she intimated that she was having fun. She felt
liberated. Well, I knew it was because her husband was in service, didn’t
think too much of her. But that was the only romance I ever heard of or can
remember now.

STEIN: How did you end up working on ailerons? Was there a training program?

GABLER: You went in, that’s what riveting was all about. You took riveting
lessons for a week or two, and they just assigned you to places. We got it. But
back then we probably would have took whatever they give us.

STEIN: I bet. I read that Willow Run built an entire school that was to train
people. Do you remember that school? Is that where you took your training?

GABLER: Well, if it was a school it was just like a line up there with no walls
around it. People were riveting, and you learned how to -- I suppose, the right
touch on pieces of that material, whatever, aluminum. So it wasn’t a school
set up with chairs and desks and books and all that. It was two or three weeks
of riveting scrap metal.

STEIN: Is it hard to do? Can you explain how you rivet?

GABLER: I assume that the person on this side puts the rivet in. You may put all
of them in -- I mean several of them -- and you rivet, and the guy in the back
bucks. He knows where you’re bucking, and you know where he is, and maybe once
in a while that was one of the mistakes if he wasn’t bucking the right rivet.

STEIN: What would happen in that case? Would it --

GABLER: That’s why they called on Ralph Eye, the rivet repair man. I can’t
remember that happening in our department. He came once to our department with
his freezer on wheels, but it wasn’t in our immediate area. He might have just
been up there and came over to say, “Hi.” He kept -- I suppose it was called
a gut wagon, that’s what my sons called the wagon.

STEIN: A gut wagon?

GABLER: The wagon that came around with food you could buy, a bowl of soup, a
sandwich, whatever. He’d buy a frozen ice cream bar and put it in his cart,
his freezer.

STEIN: Freezer cart?

GABLER: Yeah, then when he went to eat -- this was a period of time this went --
when he’d go open up his freezer it would be gone. It happened over and over.
He’d watch it like a hawk. It happened anyway. So he made a tiny hole in this
frozen ice cream bar, put croton oil in it. I never heard of it before, but you
could get it at the drug store. Put two drops of croton oil in there, and seal
it over a little bit, stays in there. It’s a very strong laxative. So the
candy bar disappeared, and he just waited, and pretty soon his boss was making
trips back and forth to the bathroom. So he jumped him about it, and the guy
admitted it. Just for the heck of it, the guy had been stealing his ice cream bars.

STEIN: I guess he got what was coming to him.

GABLER: Yeah. I never heard of croton oil other than that one time.

STEIN: Did you normally take your meals off of the cart, or did you have a cafeteria?

GABLER: Well, might be. I can’t remember eating, but we never ate in our room.
If we had a snack -- like one time we ate a watermelon, but we’d bought it in
town and carried it out there. I think I got a picture of a couple of boys we
picked up on the way. Somebody was sitting on that watermelon. But we definitely
ate that like out there in the yard. Other than that, we ate all of our meals
somewhere. Neither one of us was the type to starve to death. I just can’t
remember actually eating because it was such a mundane affair; you eat three
times a day.

STEIN: I know. I mean some of these mundane details are actually really
interesting to try to capture, but I don’t know if they sound boring to you.
But do you remember what your hours were, did you have a break in the day?

GABLER: Oh, yeah, we must have had a lunch break, and I don’t know about the
other times. We was on three shifts, rotating shifts.

STEIN: Were people working all twenty-four hours all throughout the day?

GABLER: Three shifts a day, I think some of them could have a reason; they could
ask to stay on one shift, I don’t know. We always took our shifts, didn’t
matter to us. This Willow Run was running twenty-four hours a day.

STEIN: Did you ever work the night shift?

GABLER: Yeah, once every three months, and the day shift and the midnight shift,
and I don’t know what’s in between. Eleven to eight, or eleven to seven, I
don’t know the day and then the afternoon, afternoon shift. Midnight shift,
afternoon shift and day shift, period. You took your turns once a month.

STEIN: Okay, that must have been --

GABLER: Fun.

STEIN: Yeah, working in the middle of the night?

GABLER: You get on that same cattle train. Cattle cars, they called it. A whole
bunch of -- you’d be gone, night and day.

STEIN: Would they have a whole dormitory, like a whole group go at the same
shift, or were there people sleeping all the time?

GABLER: Sure, we never knew, we never got acquainted with anybody in there.

STEIN: Really?

GABLER: Well, in those days when you had a girlfriend, one was enough as far as
I was concerned. I never wanted to be in a group of girls. If I was in a high
school, and there was a bunch of girls over there giggling, tee-heeing and so
forth, always about boys or what else did girls talk about, cosmetics maybe? I
don’t know, I never got in those groups. I was always uneasy. I didn’t want
to talk about boys. I didn’t want to talk about, well, anything.

STEIN: You were happy to be by yourself?

GABLER: But with one girlfriend, you could do all these things, sing songs or
take walks or whatever, there was always more relaxed. Of course, I never had a
friend I didn’t like. I don’t have friends that I don’t like.

STEIN: That’s a good quality. Were you and your friend bunked next to each
other in the dorms?

GABLER: Well, every room would have two twin beds in it, I suppose. When the TB
Sanitarium first started, we were in separate rooms because there were a lot of
single rooms there. Then we got a big room at the end where we could have sort
of a social life. We had two twin beds and the big kind of a living room. Other
girls could come in there and just spread out a little, do something besides lay
in bed. So that was fun.

STEIN: A double room, that was at --

GABLER: Well, that big double room, it was at the sanitarium before we left. It
had been just sort of like a store room, and they cleaned. They let us have it
for a bedroom and a social room. We didn’t tell them we was going to have a
party or anything, but a party would be like having ice cream from the kitchen.
It was just no trouble with -- the kind of trouble they have nowadays. Oh, there
had been no thought of having a boy try to sneak in. I never heard of panty
raids. That kind of stuff just didn’t happen, and if it did, it must have
happened in the big city. But after we got here, we had that, I suppose every
one of those rooms had twin beds. I never was in any others but our own.

STEIN: So it’s just the two people in that room.

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: Oh, that’s nice. I thought it might have been a big room with lots and
lots of beds.

GABLER: Oh, no. My husband was a lifetime member, this husband, of youth
hostels. Youth hostels has that set up in a lot of countries.

STEIN: Yeah.

GABLER: You go your separate way as soon as you get inside the door. We used
that a lot when we went to -- I finally went to England with him, and there’s
a lot of youth hostels over there. Some of them had a family room, but most of
them was dormitory.

STEIN: Own room. Were there chaperones at Willow Run for the single women?

GABLER: Nope. I don’t think you need chaperones. It just happened that those
at the TB Sanitarium, they both happened to be cooks, they both lived in that
same dormitory with us. But if they’d have moved out, we wouldn’t have had
any. Nurses didn’t have any. Of course, they were all ages, and the nurse’s
aides lived in that same dormitory with them.

STEIN: It sounds like you were not socializing with all of them, but did you
have a sense of who the other workers were? Was it mostly women or mostly men or
a little bit of everything.

GABLER: It was all women at the sanitarium, and there was no sexual division of
so many men or so many women. Those dormitories, that one, was all women.
Somewhere else on the same -- over there somewhere was the men. I didn’t see
any trafficking between the two buildings. If there was, it was certainly not
anything we saw. The married couples when they put those -- I wish I could
remember where I’d see them, in California here because, oh, maybe it was
Kansas. I went out to Kansas once because my youngest boy was out there with his
buddies working, and they had those two-piece -- well, they’re built like a
regular travel trailer, only they opened up like that. There was the two travel
trailers, side-by-side; the door’s up here in front. I had a picture of that,
and your couch made into a bed. And you had a shower, a little tiny bathroom and kitchen.

STEIN: That’s what they had for all the married couples?

GABLER: So that was the other housing that was available there.

STEIN: Yeah. Was the general population of all the people that were working
there, was it mostly young people?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Well, if a man was thirty-four and came up from the South
without his family, he seemed young. I think most of them were young people. Of
course, when Ralph came up with his folks, his younger brother was still in high
school, and he and his dad both worked at the bomber plant. His dad was on
maintenance. I saw him once or twice there. And he had a brother-in-law that
worked there on maintenance. So there was all ages, but mostly young people.

STEIN: Sometimes people talk about mothers who had grown-up children coming back
to work at factories. Did you see any of that?

GABLER: Well, if I did, why would I care?

STEIN: You weren’t so interested in that, huh?

GABLER: If there happened to be like that inspector that said she felt so free.
She didn’t have any children. I don’t know how many years she had been
married, but she was out making whoopee. Well, I hope her husband was having an
equal amount of fun wherever he was at. [laughs]

STEIN: Was there a union?

GABLER: No, never heard of that.

STEIN: When you were working on these B-24s, you were working on one really
small piece. Did you ever get a sense of how it all came together? Did you ever
see the completed planes? Or what was your --

GABLER: Well, toward the end when we were supposed to be looking busy, and when
we went for a walk way over there on the other side, we saw the plane. This was
a real wide work area. That plane inside was just about all there. But then
they’d put it all outside. I don’t know what they did outside. But it was
really big. Yeah, and never until we actually had that time on our hands. We
were not even concerned about what the rest of the factory looked like. I always
enjoyed it. But I enjoyed being a cook in the schools when I finally got a job
after many years of doing nothing.

STEIN: Doing nothing? It sounds like you were raising a huge family.

GABLER: Well, I had a huge garden, but oh, those boys would have maybe a row of
carrots to weed, or hoe a couple rows or something, and they could go play. I
liked doing the gardening myself, and when it come to canning the only time they
were help was like peeling tomatoes or peaches. I like to can myself, too. But
my husband called it a 365-day vacation.

STEIN: Well, you put in some hard work, that’s for sure.

GABLER: But I enjoyed gardening.

STEIN: Could you garden at the factory?

GABLER: Oh, no. Back then I didn’t know I liked plants. If I got a bare moment
back in those days, I was reading. I didn’t know I liked gardening until,
actually, we bought that ten acres, and I started gardening. Hadn’t thought
about it for years. If I did think about it, I’d think about the hoeing we had
to do or the weeding or the potato bugs on the potato vines. That’s an
interesting job, picking off all them and putting them in a can of kerosene.

STEIN: Oh, wow.

GABLER: Yeah, try that some time for fun. You could build a little boat and put
potato bugs in there. You find ways to play when you’re supposed to be picking
up potato bugs off of those plants.

STEIN: It sounds like you guys came up with some creative ways to do your chores.

GABLER: Ma wasn’t looking?

STEIN: Right, right, well, you were still working, so she couldn’t complain.
Do you remember, was it a well paid job working in the bomber plant?

GABLER: Well, I think it was stupendous, but I don’t know where the money
went. At the time we’d been working for the TB Sanitarium for $50 a month,
and, of course, food and board. And they furnished uniforms for the first month,
then you had to buy your own, that’s probably through them. But you could get
by with two or three uniforms. That $50 a month was free and clear. My
girlfriend was buying, oh, things for her hope chest. She bought a dinette set.
I don’t know where she put it. She was thinking of the future. Fifty dollars
on me melted. I didn’t have nothing to show for it.

STEIN: What did you spend it on?

GABLER: I don’t know.

STEIN: It just disappeared?

GABLER: Sure. Once a month you’d be flush, and then pretty soon you wasn’t
so flush. But you didn’t have no worries, as long as you was getting, as long
as you was there; that was like a home, that TB Sanitarium. So then when we got
here, we was paying our own rent and --

STEIN: You had to pay rent at Willow Run to stay in the dorms?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Then you buy all your food and so on, so it was probably broke
at the end of -- I think it was paid every two weeks -- it was probably broke at
the end of the two weeks too.

STEIN: Was it about the same salary?

GABLER: Well, I don’t remember anything about it except it was tremendous
increase over the $50 a month. If it was $100 a week, it was a lot of money.

STEIN: Yeah.

GABLER: I was pretty sure we had to stretch it for two weeks.

STEIN: Do you remember where you would go to get your paycheck?

GABLER: No. Must have went somewhere. I can’t imagine them bringing them around.

STEIN: Were there other sort of administrative places that you went frequently
with their, like a lot of people talk about the Kaiser Shipyards; they had
hospitals that were on site. Or child care. Were there other places like that?

GABLER: Well at my age I sure didn’t need a hospital. Never knew where there
was a doctor anywhere near, and who cared about babysitting jobs at that time.
[laughs] I’d had my stint of babysitting. That was just by the week. Mother
and Dad worked, and I stayed at this house and got room and board and maybe $5 a
week when I was babysitting. Go home weekends. So I don’t know anything about
the hospital, doctor; we never had to come in contact with any of that at the
bomber plant.

STEIN: Do you remember there ever being accidents? I sounds like it could have
been dangerous work --

GABLER: No accidents. So really it was just a fun time, a lot of fun time in my life.

STEIN: I remember you told me briefly when we were talking on the phone that for
your husband working there, it got really frustrating because everyone kept
thinking that he was 4F, that he hadn’t enlisted for some reason.

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: Can you talk a little bit about his experiences with that?

GABLER: Well, when he first went in there and got trained as a repairman, they
were scarce; they had to stay. Then, by that time, I think four of his brothers,
four or five of his brothers was already in service. He was tired of that
feeling of people assuming he was 4F. I knew he wasn’t going to sign up for an
extension on that; by that time he figured there was enough repairmen, they
could get rid of him. Anyway, he enlisted in the Navy. When we went over to tell
his mother, she threw her apron over her head. “Oh, you’ll be killed,
you’ll be killed,” because all of her other boys was in the Army. None of
them got killed.

STEIN: That’s lucky.

GABLER: When his youngest brother, six or seven years younger than him, when he
got old enough to -- the war was over, of course -- but he joined the Navy, too.

STEIN: Were people really ashamed if they were 4F, or did he just not want to be missed.

GABLER: Well, I think he was ready to get in it, with all those other brothers
being in there.

STEIN: Yeah.

GABLER: He wasn’t ashamed of being 4F. A lot of people -- you heard of
somebody shooting his trigger finger off himself so he wouldn’t have to go.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: There was talk of that once in a while, but no, I don’t think there
was any stigma with being 4F. The reason my dad got in was because of those
frozen jobs. He was working in Hastings at a tool and dye place, made big dyes,
and it was rated a government job, necessary.

STEIN: What were the dyes for, do you know?

GABLER: Well, they put one of these big dyes into a car factory, say, and they
might just turn out fenders, or whatever they were; these dyes were big. So the
company had all these, the regular people, and they knew -- they told them, that
if they left, they’d be drafted because they’d turn them in. So they were
working for before-war prices per hour, no benefits beyond what they’d had in
the past, which was probably nothing. Anyway, my dad, with seven kids at home --
because I was the top one. I was gone -- seven kids at home, he went down to
Battle Creek and got a good paying war job. They turned him in as “no dependents.”

STEIN: The old factories?

GABLER: Yeah, this factory turned him in down in Detroit, no dependents. So he
got down there, a middle-aged man with seven dependents, and all these kids
signing up. They had to keep him over a night or two down in Detroit while they
checked on his background. Well, he had all those seven dependents all right,
but because Bliss said, “Take him,” they did. That’s why he spent two
years in the Seabees, the best thing that ever happened to him because he used
that Veteran’s Hospital, saved his life, before he came to live with us. He
got good benefits by being drafted with seven dependents. Bliss did him a favor.

STEIN: I’m sorry, I don’t totally understand. Were they trying to keep him,
trying to make him not quit his job?

GABLER: They were keeping, they froze them jobs, the government froze them
because they were essential to the war effort. What these molds made, of course,
could have been some of them in the bomber plant for all I knew. Somewhere they
had to mold that aluminum I suppose. But anyway, that was when you knew for sure
they could freeze jobs, and you paid the consequences if you moved.

STEIN: So did he not get the salary that he was supposed to get from the military?

GABLER: Oh, yeah, he got the same pay as anybody else.

STEIN: Because they found out that he had those dependents?

GABLER: Yeah, they treated him just like any other person went in there. He just
happened to have all that benefit check went back to my mother.

STEIN: Right, which allowed her to buy that big farm. So what was it like when
your husband enlisted? Did you say he was in the Pacific when he was fighting?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. He was on an oil tanker. One torpedo, and that whole thing
would have been gone, but it never took a hit. An oil tanker was highly
dangerous if it was hit.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: Anyway, I was pregnant, and I stayed there at the bomber plant for I
don’t know how long until -- well, by that time it was getting pretty well
boring and more boring. I could quit without feeling, the war effort was coming
down some or whatever. Anyway, I went back home to Ma. She just had a baby, so
she wasn’t pregnant. The cow, and her pig, and me, and a friend that moved in
with her, all of us were pregnant and my mother wasn’t.

STEIN: You, a friend, a cow and a pig.

GABLER: [laughs] The only reason she wasn’t pregnant was because she just had
a baby herself.

STEIN: Did you keep working once you knew you were pregnant before you quit?

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

STEIN: Were you still, in that picture you’re seven months pregnant I think.

GABLER: I was living at my mother’s --

STEIN: With your mom at that point because --

GABLER: My dad was already in service. That was just a short time. I was having
false alarms. I went to the hospital once, false alarm. So that was in between
false alarms there. I had him shortly after that picture was taken.

STEIN: If they found out that you were pregnant --

GABLER: I don’t think it would have made any difference.

STEIN: They would have kept you working.

GABLER: Sure. It was more or less up to you, I guess.

STEIN: Okay.

GABLER: I hadn’t even went to a doctor yet, but you didn’t rush off to a
doctor first thing either in those days.

STEIN: Were there special clothing you could buy? It looks like all the work
clothes you were wearing might not fit so well if you’re pregnant.

GABLER: That’s what they called a maternity dress right there. It just kept
getting bigger and bigger. It was bunchy when I was little; it just kept
stretching out. That was the maternity wear they had in those days. Now you can
wear those jeans that’s got a hole cut out; you can leave your belly hanging
out now.

STEIN: By the time that you got big, you had stopped working at the plant?

GABLER: Oh, a long time before.

STEIN: Okay. You didn’t grow up wearing pants around the farm?

GABLER: This was the first era that women could buy pants. I think I had my
bandanna on. No, maybe that’s just hair. Anyway, women never wore bandannas
before that.

STEIN: Was that to keep your hair out of your eyes, out of the machines?

GABLER: Sure.

STEIN: Did you enjoy wearing these clothes? It sound like --

GABLER: Oh, yeah. Well, one winter up north it was so snowy my mother could only
-- I don’t know if she could have got the pants kind, but she bought bibbed
overalls for me to wear to school because we was walking in drifts. They
didn’t plow the roads between our house and that schoolhouse. We took
shortcuts through the woods. The teacher wore jodhpurs and those laced up boots.
She only lived a half a mile or so from the school, but that was the one and
only time that I wore pants. That was during that winter. The idea of buying
men’s jeans and wearing them, that just never happened. Nobody ever did it. My
mother wore dresses all the time; everybody wore dresses. That was the one big
thing in styling that the war changed, women’s slacks. I’ve got one dress in
that closet I haven’t worn in ten years, but it’s there.

STEIN: You were a convert after the war, you stuck to your pants.

GABLER: I do have a dress.

STEIN: A lot of people talk about Rosie the Riveter, this era, as really
changing women’s possibilities, as opening up doors that had previously been
closed. What are your thoughts on what this time changed?

GABLER: Well, it put women in the factories. They never went back en masse to
just staying at home and raising a garden and kids. So, yeah, it made a big
change in the social atmosphere, but at the time I was living it myself, and it
just seemed natural.

STEIN: Yeah. Do you think, looking back, that it maybe changed your future
decisions at all?

GABLER: No, once I started having children I never went out and worked until,
well, let’s see, my first job after years of staying home and just raising
kids and garden and whatever, my first job was -- some friends of mine said,
“Leave it to Marion to find a one-hour a day job.” I did. I was a hall
monitor at the high school for one hour a day. That was my first job after my
youngest one was in school. Then it was at the school, so I was off when he was
off. Then when he went into seventh grade, I went to work in the school kitchen
as a cook. So there again, I was off when school was off. That worked out real
fine. When I married Clark I was head cook at a school with, probably, was
cooking for about a thousand kids. I was head cook there. I thought, “Boy,
I’ll miss this job,” because it was really an enjoyable job. I took off with
him and spent the first year on the road in a little RV, and I never missed that
kitchen at all. Never missed any of my friends or relatives back in Michigan,
didn’t miss anybody at all. It was totally different, really enjoyed it.

STEIN: Is that how you came to California?

GABLER: He had a place here, but he also had that motor home. So we could just
maybe stay here in California a couple months, down in Mexico a couple months,
back in Michigan -- supposed to be there six months, but it was four -- and just
be on the road a lot. But he wanted to keep his roots, his place here in
California. So we always came back here.

STEIN: Have you heard anything about the Rosie the Riveter National Park or been --

GABLER: I went over there. I went over there with Mary, is that her name? Yeah,
the yard and sidewalk was so well planned, was covered with goose poop when I
was there, terrible. And geese had taken over.

STEIN: Oh, no. These are the shipyards down in --

GABLER: Well, it was a walk in a grass park.

STEIN: Oh, yeah, with a memorial with that big structure and all pictures --

GABLER: Yeah, a memorial, and it went into a building where they had, gee, what
did I contribute to that? Something or other. One room had shelves you could
draw out, pictures or relics of some kind. I gave them something. I didn’t
make a note of it, so I don’t know what.

STEIN: Like a souvenir from your time working as a -- ?

GABLER: I don’t know, it might have been from Clark for all I know, but
whatever it was, all this stuff was being stored with the idea that they’d
have their own place to display it sooner or later. So I don’t know if they
got someplace to display all that stuff or not.

STEIN: They have the place, and are building it right now.

GABLER: Yeah, and I don’t get over there because I can’t find it. I went
over there a couple of times, that area, but it was somebody else always
driving, so I don’t know how to get over there.

STEIN: Yeah, well, the visitor’s center is not open yet, you’re not missing
it yet, but hopefully it’ll be up soon.

GABLER: I don’t know how to find Richmond Plunge. If you go on Cutting all the
way out to the end, is that Richmond Point?

STEIN: I couldn’t tell you.

GABLER: Well, the Plunge is open now, and I want to get out there and try that.
I’m always looking for a warm swimming pool.

STEIN: So do you feel a sense of solidarity with the other women who did some of
the work that you did?

GABLER: No. If you play cards, I feel solidarity, but that’s about all. I’ve
got a lot of card-playing friends. If you read, you’re an individual. You
don’t do that as a group. I don’t anyway. To read a book and have a book
club that discusses it, never been interested in that. Reading is something you
do by yourself, and playing cards you have card friends.

STEIN: Yep. Are there any other facts you have on your time during the war?

GABLER: Not right now. If I think of something, it’ll be sometime later.

STEIN: Okay, then you can call me and let me know.

GABLER: If it was real important, I would. Did you get a picture of my plane there?

STEIN: Oh, let’s take this, yeah, of the B-24. This was a Liberator? Is that
what they called them? There we go.

GABLER: Probably. B-24.

STEIN: Did you know where they were fighting, where the B-24s were going?

GABLER: Nope. I assume they went over Europe at the time. They wouldn’t be
spending all that energy on blowing up an island somewhere, but I don’t know.

STEIN: Have you ever met anybody who flew one?

GABLER: Nope. The last time I saw one was at that air show in Elkhardt, Indiana,
and it was just sitting there. They said at the time there was two of them left,
and the other one wasn’t flying. So this one is still flying because it was
out here this past year, out here. So I don’t know anything about them,
though. I’m glad they’re trying to keep this one going, one out of all those
that we made.

STEIN: I know. I read somewhere that Willow Run made eight thousand six hundred
and something planes, and they were making them one every hour, which is incredible.

GABLER: Yeah.

STEIN: Was the pace of work very fast?

GABLER: Well, not where we were. There was always ailerons lined up there.
Nobody was cracking a whip to get them done in a short time. They was just a
routine of work. There was no urgency about it. Just seemed to be a job that
needed to be done.

STEIN: Did it seem more important than any other job because of the war going on?

GABLER: I wasn’t thinking about that. No, I don’t know if anybody felt a
patriotic urge to get in there and really do something, it was just --
everything I ever done the people were enjoying their work. I hadn’t ever
worked in an area where there was constant complaining, probably would quit.

STEIN: That’s sort of lucky. Wow.

GABLER: Well, if you have a fault-finding attitude, it can shorten your life. It
can ruin your life, actually, because it’s been proven to contribute to
Alzheimer’s, a bitchy, dissatisfied attitude. So maybe that’s why I’ve
outlived so many.

STEIN: And probably had a good time.

GABLER: Oh, yeah, I have. For the family reunion I was there for two weeks first
of August, and this particular nephew didn’t come to the reunion. I think he
was working. But anyway, since I’ve been back, he just dropped dead, my
sister’s boy, and he was probably around sixty, massive heart attack. So you
just don’t know when these things happen. But when I do go, that’s the way I
want to go. I do not want to end up in a nursing home.

STEIN: Yeah, yeah.

GABLER: My poor husband, this one, said -- hell, he was so independent, always
galloping ahead of everybody else to get there and stuff -- when his time came
that he was losing it, he was going to walk out to the Pacific Ocean until his
hat floated. Well, Alzheimer’s began to take its toll, and he had no idea it
was happening. I didn’t either for quite a while. But gradually losing every
incentive you’ve got, he didn’t have no opportunity to walk out into the
Pacific Ocean. It just came on him that slow and gradual. It was kind of, well,
an eye opener on how Alzheimer’s works because I’ve never paid any attention
to it before. They claim an active mind and good attitude and so on helps fight
that. His mind was always active. He was a mountain climber and a hiker. He
belonged to that hiking association and youth hostel over there in San
Francisco. He was always doing that kind of stuff and reading the newspapers. To
have Alzheimer’s strike him was really out of the ordinary, it seemed like,
but it can strike anybody.

STEIN: Right.

GABLER: So I think that’s it.

STEIN: Okay, well thank you so much for all of your time and all of your
memories. It’s really a great story.

GABLER: I haven’t sacrificed a thing, because I’m going to go play pinochle today.
