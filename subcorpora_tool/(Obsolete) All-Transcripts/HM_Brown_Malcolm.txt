Story_ID: 188064
Speaker 1: All right, I'd like to talk now about your family background and wanted to start by asking if you could tell me about your mother, what was her name and where was she born, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Reeves Brown--Dorothy Reeves Jackson Franklin.  My mother, just mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: And her father was Jesse Jackson and her mother's name is Lucy Jackson, and they grew up in Virginia, and what part of Virginia, I'm not sure, but I think it was Crozet, Virginia, C-R-O-Z-E-T.  That's near Charlottesville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about her background and growing up?  Is that a big city in Virginia?
Speaker 2: No, Crozet is a very small town.  It's a rural area, very quiet, not much going on.  There is a lot of cousins, aunts, uncles surrounding that area, that particularly area.
Speaker 1: Now, how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Quiet, doesn't talk very much, but she loved to cook, and very, sort of quiet person, much like me.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she share any stories with you about her growing up years?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, her father was Jesse Jackson, used to tell us a lot of stories, used to sit us down and talk about slavery time, and he actually would--I'm so sorry I didn't tape a lot of the interesting stories that he had to tell about the Civil War and that period when he saw the actual troops moving across the mountains, and I'm so sorry that I did not tape some of the interesting stories that he had to tell, but he lived in--he was born in 1860.  And he used to tell us a lot of interesting things.
Speaker 1: Okay, just before the start of the war then in 1861.
Speaker 2: Right and he used to talk about they were moving across the mountains and the battles and so forth, and all those situations that were happening during that time.
Speaker 1: So this is all in the state of Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather--your maternal grandfather was born in slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  His mother was a slave.  I don't know how much he experienced, but she, definitely, was a slave.
Speaker 1: His name again was?
Speaker 2: Jesse Jackson.
Speaker 1: Jesse Jackson.  How could I forget?
Speaker 2: He reminded me of a Kentucky colonel.  He was tall, silver hair, and walked very straight.
Story_ID: 188065
Speaker 1: Can you tell me a little bit about your father and his side of the family?  What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Franklin M. Brown and his mother's name was Callie [ph.] Brown, and we used to call her Grandma [ph.] Callie, and every so often, Grandma Callie would have these large parties in the area.  Well, we lived in a rural section, and it was sort of divided up Freetown, Slabtown, and Greenwood. And Greenwood, there was a section that a lot of people invented, there was Slabtown and Freetown, and every so often, the grandmothers would have these big parties and invite all the families down, all the cousins, aunts, uncles, and children would come; and they would have all kinds of good food.  And it was really a great time, but I lived in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, now these areas Slabtown, those are communities within the same city?
Speaker 2: Yeah, within Crozet, Virginia, just a few miles from Charlottesville, were all these little areas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And every so often, they would get together and have dinner parties, and each person would be designated to have a dinner, and everybody would bring food there, and would just fraternize and have a good time.  And also in that area, the Washingtons and the Woods in my father's side, the Jacksons, and the Reeves on my mother's side, but it was a great time doing all those events.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So both, your mother [Dorothy Reeves Jackson Franklin] and your father, were natives of Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you were born there as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 188066
Speaker 1: How would describe your father [Franklin M. Brown]?  Did he share any stories with you about his growing up in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, there were not a lot of stories.  He was a horse trainer.  He trained horses, but prior to living in [Crozet] Virginia, we lived in Warm Springs [Virginia].  You've heard of hot springs?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Yes.
Speaker 2: Where people go these hot springs to cure their arthritis.  I think there's another place in Georgia where they do certain things that they do, but we lived there for years prior to coming back to Crozet [Virginia].  And there's some--you have to sort of follow--things happened, but I went to school in Warm Springs [Virginia].
Speaker 1: In Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes and then came back to Crozet when my parents, grandfather and grandmother got older.  And during the summer, we would stay in Crozet with my grandfather, during the summers and play with cousins and so forth.
Speaker 1: So Virginia, then, it seems is home now for several generations of your family, grandparents, parents and you.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and you, all called Virginia home.  Now, you started to tell me a little bit about your grandparents on your mother's side and that your maternal grandfather [Jesse Jackson], born in 1860, was a son of a slave woman--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and so that would have meant that he was slave too because the children are going to follow the status of the mother, but do you know anything at all about your father, your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: No, because I think he died early, and there was not much information about him at all because I don't know whether my father knew him or not, but I think he died at an early age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were a lot of cousins and aunts, and my father had three brothers, Homer Brown [ph.], Franklin, my father, and Granville Brown [ph.] and one sister, and all of them lived right there in the same area, and their children grew up and went off to school, and some have become ministers and preachers and so forth.  They have since passed, they are all passed.  There's not many left down there in that area.
Story_ID: 188067
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Well, earliest memory as far of schooling?
Speaker 1: Well, if you had memories even before you stared school, just of life in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Virginia was sort of interesting--we lived in a small community, right next to--whites lived very close, and everybody knew each other.  We knew our neighbors and they were very friendly.  There wasn't that race thing as far as--there were places like the movies, where we had to go upstairs to the movies--in the back, if we wanted to get something to eat, but it was a close association with people.  There was not a lot of hostility in Virginia for some reason.  I don't know why, but there wasn't anti--like the cities were experiencing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cities in Virginia also?
Speaker 2: No, like the cities--largest cities, Richmond [Virginia]--I don't much of what was going on in Richmond at that time, which was sixty miles from where I lived, from Charlottesville [Virginia].
Story_ID: 188068
Speaker 1: We started to talk a little bit about your memories of growing up in Virginia, but can you tell me about holidays?  I know you said grandmothers would have these big dinners from time to time.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yeah.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and bring folk together, but can you talk a little bit about how holidays were celebrated or some other special events that you remember from your childhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I should've said, on Christmas, we would have all these things going on in different people's houses, you know.  Somebody would be designated to have a party and we'd do to Uncle Homer's [ph.] house or Uncle Granville's [ph.] house, or Grandma Callie's house [ph.] to have a party.  It was sort of like that-I don't know why--and Grandma Callie was very popular.  Everybody wanted to go to Grandma Callie's house for some reason, go there and just eat and have some fun.
Speaker 1: Are these all extended family members or just folks from the community would celebrate holidays together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like in Freetown [Virginia], a lot of people would come over to Grandma Callie's house, and she liked to cook, so she would have macaroni and cheese and fried chicken and candy yams and all these different things.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Can you tell me--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --It was a southern trend (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that southern hospitality. Yeah.
Story_ID: 188069
Speaker 1: Can you give me your siblings' names in birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: Malcolm [ph.] is the oldest, Jeff [ph.], and then Rhonda [ph.].
Speaker 1: No, for your brothers and sisters.
Speaker 2: Oh, for my brothers and sisters.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --We'll get to your children in just a minute.
Speaker 2: I'm a twin.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: My brother, he lives in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is his name?
Speaker 2: Milton Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Malcolm and Milton, twin brother, and your birth date again?
Speaker 2: 08/19/1931 [August 19, 1931].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we grew up having fun, fooling people.  I got into all kind of situations, especially in college, but we didn't do that much earlier.
Speaker 1: It was just the two of you, the twin boys?
Speaker 2: Yes, and I brought some pictures that you'll see.
Speaker 1: Yes, good.  We'll have those toward the end of the interview--
Story_ID: 188070
Speaker 1: As far daily life in Virginia is concerned for the two Brown twins [HM Malcolm Brown and Milton Brown], what street did you live on and can you describe your block?
Speaker 2: It wasn't a real street.
Speaker 1: A road, perhaps?  (laughter)
Speaker 2: Just a road that went by, you know.  We lived right on 250.  250, it was the main highway going from Waynesboro [Virginia], Staunton [Virginia], and Charlottesville [Virginia], and we live in Crozet [Virginia], which was right near there; and it was just a box--we had a box--a mailbox.  When you sent a letter to me, there as a box--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --No street address.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a box.
Speaker 1: So this is farm country?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--there is sawmills, farmers, and near Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, you know, near Skyline Drive--not far from Skyline Drive--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Okay.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know near the mountains.  It's a beautiful country, very mountainous, very pretty area.
Speaker 1: Well, I'd like to ask about your neighbors.  The way you describe it, it sounds like the population was pretty well dispersed throughout the area.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well at the beginning, before the road changed, they made a new road through there, sixty-four goes from (unclear) to Richmond [Virginia] and there were some neighbors who lived well not too far from us, down in the woods area there.  There was a sawmill across the street from us and the Yancy [ph.] family, we knew them well and they knew us.
Speaker 1: What was the family name again?
Speaker 2: Yancy.
Speaker 1: Oh, Yancy, okay.
Speaker 2: Yancy--the sawmill was named after the Yancy's.  There were a lot of people who worked at the sawmill there in Crozet.  Let me see what else, and right in Slabtown [Virginia], which was near---they called it Slabtown, which was near--where my aunt Francis [ph.] lived in Slabtown and in Greenwood [Virginia], which is maybe ten miles up the highway was my uncle Homer [ph.] and his folks, and Charlottesville [Virginia], there were some cousins also, but these areas were pretty close and we were able to get from one to other pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: What was the usual mode of travel?
Speaker 2: Automobile.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No horse and wagon.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: I wasn't trying to suggest it was before cars were invited, but I just wondered how people got from one family, a house to another.
Speaker 2: Drive.  It sounds like I'm painting a picture of horse and buggy days.
Speaker 1: Well, I just get the sense that's it's a rural environment as opposed to some of the big cities that we associate Virginia's history, but can you tell me, just thinking back on that time in your life, some of the sights, sounds and smells that remind you of growing up in Virginia?
Speaker 2: You come at night, and there's nothing, just pitch dark, the crickets--you know you hear all these noises and it's very quiet and the street lights--not a lot of street lights on.  You had to be careful when you come down a certain roads because you may get sprayed by a skunk.  You had to be careful of where you walked, and it's quiet.
Speaker 1: Are there pleasant smells that remind you of home?  I know the skunk wouldn't be the most pleasant, getting sprayed.  What are some of the pleasant smells that remind you of home in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's really peaceful and quiet, and very nice, not that bad.
Story_ID: 188071
Speaker 1: Well, what elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, it was Hillsboro Elementary School [Purcellville, Virginia]; it was a one-room building.  They had these chairs that, old-timey seats that you sit in and then that was the elementary school
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The high school in Albemarle Training School.  They called it Albemarle Training School, it was right outside of Charlottesville [Virginia].  It was not close, but it was in the country area-like.
Speaker 1: But within commuting distance of your home?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All of these were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'd catch the bus and go there every day.
Speaker 1: That's the school bus, the yellow school bus?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there teachers there that influenced you and if so, what are some of their names?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lady--Mrs. Snoten [ph.].  I liked Science, both my brother and I enjoyed Science.  I didn't have a very good teacher in math, but in history and science, those were my favorite teachers and also at that time, in the rural areas, you had agriculture and you made things in the classroom.  We were working in--agriculture was big in the south at that time.
Speaker 1: Would the whole curriculum be focused then on an agricultural program or was that just one of the trades--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Just one of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that you could pursue?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 188072
Speaker 1: And, what kind of student were you?  How soon in your life did you decided you wanted to be an artist?
Speaker 2: I really wanted to go into medicine, but I didn't have a good math background, and also I wanted to be a commercial artist, but opportunities for blacks weren't that good, but education (unclear), everyone valued being a teacher rather than just an artist, graphic design or commercial artist because the opportunities were very slim for African American artists.
Speaker 1: You weren't interested in starving?
Speaker 2: No, I wanted to get a good start.
Speaker 1: Like [Vincent] Van Gogh?  You didn't want to go that route?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 188073
Speaker 1: As a child, do you remember being well-mannered or mischievous?  You told me about the tricks that you and your twin brother [Milton Brown] would play on people--
Speaker 2: That was in college.
Speaker 1: Oh, more in college.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --But early on, we were great--as my mother and father [Dorothy Reeves Jackson Franklin and Franklin M. Brown] would say, people would come by and see us--you'll see in the pictures, they said, "You have two fine young men."
Speaker 1: So there wasn't much trouble to get into?
Speaker 2: There was a lot going on--a lot of space--coming up, always we used to go black berry picking.  There was a lady who would come by and take us to pick black berries.
Speaker 1: And these are growing wild?
Speaker 2: Yeah, growing wild and there was one thing that we did--and it was where we'd get these buckets and things and go pick the berries and bring them back and fix blackberry strudel.
Speaker 1: Oh. Okay.
Story_ID: 188074
Speaker 1: And your dreams and aspirations, first of medicine and then of art, now when did those really come into focus, middle school or high school?
Speaker 2: Middle school, both of us, my brother and I, both, did good drawings.  We could draw well and it was when I got to college is when I met--I had two excellent teachers, who really had an influence on us.
Speaker 1: And where was college again?
Speaker 2: Virginia State [College, later Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Virginia State College.
Speaker 1: That's historically black?
Speaker 2: Virginia State University now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Petersburg?
Speaker 2: It's in Petersburg, Virginia yeah.
Speaker 1: I visited there a few years back.  I'm testing my own memory and asking you about these things.  Okay, Virginia State, beautiful campus.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is a wonderful campus and that's where I went my four years.
Speaker 1: Did you major in Art there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then with the secondary education?
Speaker 2: Right, I went into--I had to do practice teaching and I did that in Norfolk, Virginia.  You've heard of Norfolk?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: In that area-in the tidewater section.
Speaker 1: Although I don't know what tidewater means.  I've heard of Tidewater [region] Virginia.
Speaker 2: It refers to the ocean--you know, the water area--there's a lot of water in that area--north of Newport News [Virginia], you know the shipyard--there's a big shipyard down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Virginia Beach [Virginia], right on the Atlantic Ocean there.
Story_ID: 188075
Speaker 1: I guess this would apply--this next question to both your childhood years and your college years, wondered if your family was active in the church community and if so, could you describe your experiences with the church in Virginia.
Speaker 2: Well, we were active in Sunday school, and church was right there.  Sometimes, they had church all day long--they have dinner on the grounds and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Do you recall the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Piedmont Baptist Church [Crozet, Virginia], Piedmont Baptist Church; and it was a very good experience; and I had a special teacher from Jamaica.  She was so tough and she would really--she would keep us in line.
Speaker 1: Is this a Sunday school teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can't forget her, her name was Gaida Diggerson [ph.].
Speaker 1: Gieda [ph.]--oh my.
Speaker 2: She was--her voice, you know? You could tell that she was from Jamaica, but she was so tough.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was Sunday school at Piedmont Baptist Church and the services could go all day?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any other axillaries within the church that you were involved in other than the Sunday school programs?
Speaker 2: You mean coming up?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: No, I think we were in choir.  We sang in the choir.  I wasn't a very good singer, voice person, but did sing in the choir.
Speaker 1: Was this a large congregation?
Speaker 2: Not really--small--it was a good size church.  My grandfather [Jesse Jackson] built that church.  He was the carpenter and stone maker.  He was into that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and which grandfather?
Speaker 2: On my mother's [Dorothy Reeves Jackson Franklin] side.
Speaker 1: Oh, maternal grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 188076
Speaker 1: Alright, Mr. Brown [HM Malcolm Brown], we were talking just a minute ago about your college years at Virginia State University at Petersburg, Virginia.  I'm just wondering what kind of activities were you involved in either curriculum activities, class-related, or extra curriculum activities while you were a student at the campus.
Speaker 2: We joint the fraternity while I was there, Omega--in '52 [1952], I think it was.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Omega Psi Phi?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There sometimes known as the Ques.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People will hear this and try to separate in their minds the colors and the Greek letter, Greek letters, social fraternities, service fraternity?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Combination of the two?
Speaker 2: Yes, combination of the two.
Speaker 1: Okay, Omega Psi Phi.
Speaker 2: Every so often, they would have--what they call the Greek Night, (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was fun.  Other activities on the campus--there weren't a lot--oh, music.  I played trombone and my brother played saxophone.  And I played in the college band.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my extracurricular.  They had a good band.  The conductor's name was Pops Gatlin [Dr. F. Nathaniel "Pops" Gatlin].  Everybody called him Pops Gatlin.  He was outstanding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The music at Virginia State, there was a teacher--an arranger.  What was her name?  I can't think of her name, but every time Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] to come to Cleveland [Ohio] to sing, they would have some arrangements by her and she was a teacher at Virginia State.
Speaker 1: So this is the Morehouse Glee Club when they tour, they still perform arrangements by her?
Speaker 2: Yes, I guess they use her repertoire or arrangements that--oh boy, her name escapes me.
Speaker 1: Well, what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [1950].
Speaker 1: In the 1950s, okay, in the music department at Virginia State.
Speaker 2: And they had an excellent choir.
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we can make that connection, we'll get her name.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --An excellent choir--the tidewater area sort of spawned a lot of musical people.  For some reason, great voices came out of that area down from the tidewater section.  Why?  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Can you help me with Virginia's geography a little bit?  How close would Petersburg be to Hampton--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Very close.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --because I know they have a rich history of music coming out of Hampton, Virginia?
Speaker 2: --yes, very close.  Newport News [Virginia] is north of Hampton and not far where we were.  We used to go down there a lot on weekends, just drop by at the Hampton.  It's very nice.
Speaker 1: So along the Chesapeake Bay?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  That helps me place it.
Speaker 2: Virginia Beach area is very nice also.
Speaker 1: You talked about your experiences with Greek life on campus through Omega Psi Phi and also with the music, and I guess I just wanted to ask you about something that is just sort of in between--that's the step shows that a lot of the fraternal organizations are famous for.  Now, was that part of Greek life on your campus?
Speaker 2: No, that sort of emerged as the years went on.  It got more popular.  They weren't doing much stepping in my time for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know how that evolved.  I would have to study that to find out the history of how that got in.
Speaker 1: But not in the '50s [1950], not yet?
Speaker 2: No, not as I can recall.  Maybe--I don't know whether the marching--how do you say?  You come on the sidewalk and do all these different things that they wanted you to do.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's part of the pledging?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a part of the history that we will have to investigate.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I'll be ready for the next interview.
Speaker 2: We talked about some of the teachers, especially the band director, you said was very good and very influential.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was hoping I would remember-Muhammad [ph.] --no, Muhammad was my art teacher.  I'm trying to think--her arrangements were so popular that a lot of the Glee clubs would use her arrangements.  Maybe you'll come across some of our history making inventories in--I just can't think of it.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope in our interviewing, we'll get some more from alums from Virginia State.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we--like I said, we can cross reference those years and find out who that great music maker was--
Story_ID: 188077
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask also about those major crossroads in your life, especially in the college years, I'm wondering with all those historically black colleges in that part of Virginia, how you made the choice to go to Virginia State [College, later Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] rather than Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] or somewhere else.
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know.  It was just a choice and, at that time, my parents weren't making much money and the tuition was great, easy, you know, it wasn't very expensive, and it was close, and getting us down there, the drive, and it was a good school, and I didn't have a scholarship at that time.
Speaker 1: Did you work while you were in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But your parents helped?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work at all, but we enjoyed it.  I loved those years.
Story_ID: 188078
Speaker 1: Now, what was Petersburg [Virginia] like at that point in time?  Was it sort of small town atmosphere too?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) Virginia--it had a restaurant near the campus and it was interesting, but it was a small town, not much going on, so we stayed in the books, not many places to go.
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: In '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: In 1955.  Okay, then did you begin teaching right after graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I taught for one year in Virginia, and then that was when I started--I was thinking about getting a masters and I started taking some classes and went to Boston [Massachusetts], that's where I met Ernestine [HM Ernestine Brown].  And we met at BU, Boston University.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So graduating in 1955, some time teaching and then post   work, immediately you decided that you wanted a master's degree or were you just taking courses--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I was just taking courses.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --beyond the bachelor's.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't finish until '69 [1969] at Case Western Reserve [University, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so you started the master's in Boston?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I didn't have enough there, so I just transferred some of the credits.
Speaker 1: Oh, so from Boston University to Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, but at that point, you had already met your future wife?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said you finished the master's at Case in what year?
Speaker 2: '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Oh, so after the marriage and some children were here by that time.
Speaker 2: Rhonda was coming, and I took off a full year and got my master's, just got it out of the way.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 188079
Speaker 1: Now, the Boston [Massachusetts] experience, how do you get from Virginia, one of the largest slave states in the Union, or was the largest slave state in the Union in the 19th Century all the way up to liberal Boston, Massachusetts for grad school?  How did you make that leap?
Speaker 2: You mean how--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --from one region to the next?  Or was it the school, the program that attracted you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that in the visual arts, the master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I met some people, who were--some of my instructors told me about the program up there at BU [Boston University].  So I took that leap.  I really wanted to get out of Virginia.
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: Because in Virginia, the schools were not paying that much and I was interested in upgrading and moving on to (unclear).
Speaker 1: I know Boston has a rich history as far as museum life is concerned.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a lot going during that time--(Hootenanny), there was the--as Ernestine [HM Ernestine Brown] was telling me--the Boston Strangler.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, even outside of the museum community--other things going on that were making history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that is an urban area and a lot of artists were protesting--a lot of protest going on during that time during the Boston era.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we're in early '60s [1960]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Okay, what were the artists protesting being excluded from museum shows?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is this coming from the African American community primarily?
Speaker 2: Right.  They wanted to be included in certain things.  It was just a period.  If you read Sharon Patton's book on black art ['African-American Art,' Sharon Patton], you will notice that in Boston there was a lot going on--a lot of interesting things going on as far as protesting in the black arts movement, especially in the cities, you know, a lot of people doing things on their own with all kinds of murals and so forth.
Speaker 1: Oh, more public art than just the museum.
Speaker 2: Right, outside and on the walls and graffiti and stuff like that to try to get attention.
Speaker 1: Oh, now, were you a part of all that?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: -No.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or were you basically a student?
Speaker 2: I never really got into doing that way because I was from the country.  I was more laid back and there was--in fact, like right now my work, as opposed to some of the artist's work, it's more landscape, more quiet, pastoral, whereas, I never really got into that situation where I was doing a lot of that type of art.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was wondering which artist would you associate with that movement, you say the Black Art Movements?
Speaker 1: There were a couple of artists.  I don't want to say their names because I don't have the full name, but there was a movement.
Speaker 2: I know in literature, I think of Baraka, Amiri Baraka with the poetry, revolutionary poetry coming out of the 1960s and the Black Art Movement and the Black Power Movement by the mid 1960s.
Speaker 1: Well, the Black Power stuff, yeah.  Yeah, a lot of the artists were using that on canvases and so forth.
Speaker 2: Okay, but not the country artist from Virginia?
Speaker 1: No.  I was sort of mainstream, sort of quiet, pastoral.
Story_ID: 188080
Speaker 1: Your experiences at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] and the fact that you were more traditional, as far as your approach--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I wasn't there that long--just for the summer.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a summer program.  Was there an affiliation with the Boston [Massachusetts] museum community at all through your studies?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Just the university--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I like that area.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I like the area.  I'm trying to think what was going on at that time, the jazz and the jazz clubs and so forth.  They were sort of interesting, so I was trying to remember what was going on at that time, and I can't put my finger on it, so I have to come back to it.
Speaker 1: This is the early 1960s in Boston?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So when you left Boston, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Well, after married Ernestine [HM Ernestine Brown], I came back to Virginia, got myself together and decided to come to this direction.  So I came to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And Ernestine Turner, your wife-to-be, was she, at that time, teaching in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't have a job at the beginning and I got a job at the television station.  I worked for a year and then I got a job at Patrick Henry Junior High School [Cleveland, Ohio], the largest junior high school in the state and that was something to behold.  It was interesting.  I was there just for one year--no two year, I'm sorry.  I was two years there; and then I got a call from a person at Shaker Heights High School [Shaker Heights, Ohio].  "We have an opening here.  Would you like to come?"  At first, I didn't want to come.  I said, "I don't know if I want to come to Shaker."
Speaker 1: Well, what have you heard about Shaker Heights?
Speaker 2: Well, it was upscale community--high-powered, so I said, "Well, I'll take a chance on it."  Once I got there, loved it. There for thirty years.
Story_ID: 188081
Speaker 1: I just want to make sure I have the chronology right now.  That was about 1964 when you married Ernestine Turner [HM Ernestine Brown]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we're at the beginning of the Turner-Brown family in northeast Ohio and you're both working for a time in the city of Cleveland?
Speaker 2: Well, at the beginning, she was full-time until we had the kids and then she took off.  She stopped working for a while and went back.
Speaker 1: When are the children born again?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965], '67 [1967] and '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you tell me their names?
Speaker 2: Malcolm Todd Brown [ph.], Jeffrey Franklin Brown [ph.] and Rhonda Christian Brown [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, two boys and a girl.
Speaker 2: Jeff was more athletic.  He developed into a football.  Well, both boys played football and they played junior high school.  Jeff was highly recruited after he went to university school for one year; and all the coaches from around the country were coming to look at him.  And, at one time, the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] flew in--a jet picked us up and we went to Virginia.  Another time, we got to know the coach from Virginia and his wife, and my wife got to know his wife, and we had to decide between Virginia and Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  So Jeff decided he wanted to be close, so he went to Michigan.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your other son, Malcolm?
Speaker 2: Malcolm went from here to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and he studied politics--Political Science, and went into law, and graduated from there and then went to Rutgers and got his law degree.  He played Undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania--played football there also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Rhonda at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and Wisconsin and then from Wisconsin to Chicago [Illinois], and Jeff took us through to Rose Bowl, Hall of Fame Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl, so we were traveling for four years, which was sort of exciting.  We got to meet all the big-time college coaches from all over the country, and California, when we used to go to the Rose Bowl, we went to the parade, and experienced a big show at Palladium with Bob Hope [London Palladium, London, England].  That was sort of exciting.  So it was an exciting four years of college for Jeff.
Speaker 1: It sounds like for the whole family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because every year, we were somewhere and it was some bowl game, which was sort of exciting.
Speaker 1: I heard that both of your sons have this gift, this visual arts gift, but interesting that neither one of them followed your profession.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you had been by the house, you would see two things that were made by them.  They--they--Malcolm did a painting, a nice painting, and Jeff did a nice piece of sculpture, and Rhonda went through art history at Ohio State; and, of course, after going to the museum in Chicago, and experiencing some difficulties as far as some economic, she decided to go into development.
Speaker 1: Now, which museum was that in Chicago that she worked with?
Speaker 2: Um, Contemporary Museum there in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Oh, is that the Art Institute?
Speaker 2: No, it's a new one.  It's the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it sounds like everyone in the Brown household at least dabbled in the arts and two or three of you professionals in the arts.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 188082
Speaker 1: So we've talked about college it seems for just about everyone now.  And I have to get back to my timeline because I know the children are being born between '65 [1965] and '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you're starting at Shaker Heights High School [Shaker Heights, Ohio] as an art educator in '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Over there, they have a good program in Art.  They have a fine program; and we have five teachers, good program, and a lot of the kids go off to school, Pratt Institute [New York, New York] or Rhode Island School of Design [Providence, Rhode Island] or Cleveland School of Art [sic, Cleveland Institute of Art, Cleveland, Ohio]; and they people coming from these places to the school to interview kids to come to the school.  You know, they try to get the kids to go their schools.  They have an excellent program, and it has been very rewarding.  And we also participate in the Artistic Discovery program with Congressman Stokes [HM Louis Stokes] during his tenure. And here at the gallery we have this art show.  We used to have an Art show.  We don't have it here now because it's outgrown the space.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And every year, some person is selected to have their painting be shown down in the congressman's office in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: So this is Congressman Louis Stokes who was elected from northeast Ohio.  He used to be the twenty-first congressional district.  I think it's now the eleventh.
Speaker 2: Right.  Tubbs Jones has it now.
Speaker 1: Yes, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, my soror, another Delta like Mrs. Brown, but I wanted to ask about Congressman Stokes' time in congress because it's pretty much about the same time that you were teaching in Shaker Heights, Ohio in the public high school from the late '60s [1960] through to 2000 was when you retired?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, I wanted to ask about the art department in Shaker, did you build that department over the thirty years, the thirty-one years, that you were with them or was it already in place?
Speaker 2: It was already in place--well, I was at junior high for a while.  I was in the junior high until '85 [1985] and then '85 [1985] through 2000 at the high school,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: --but they've had good support as far as getting everything that they need to have a good program, supplies and very top notch excellent program.
Speaker 1: Okay, really a fascinating time that you came into the Shaker system for African Americans and I guess all Americans, you know, coming on the heel of the Civil Rights movement.
Speaker 2: Right, when I got there--well, I was at Woodbury [Elementary School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] first and there were a lot of black teachers that they were beginning to hire there and they--and it was a good time.  It was--it was quite enjoyable, quite rewarding to go through those years--
Story_ID: 188083
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of what I read about Shaker Heights [Ohio] in the '60s [1960] and '70s [1970] suggested, at least certain parts, certain streets in Shaker, suggested it was a community in transition with upwardly, mobile blacks coming in and perhaps some others running out but we had the turnover and a majority white neighborhood becomes interracial for a while and then it tips to being majority black, but did you notice those kinds of things happening at Shaker when you moved here and bought your first home?
Speaker 2: Well, in the beginning, it was different than what it is now.  Now, blacks--like maybe five or ten years ago, more blacks were coming into the area, and it was changing a little bit.  Whereas, now, I think it is almost fifty-fifty, where before it was maybe 30 percent black and, now, it's almost half and half.  There were a lot of changes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there were a lot of housing programs, experimental programs to get people to move into Shaker and to stop the exodus of whites leaving Shaker.  Do you think those worked over the years?
Speaker 2: I think it worked and then for a while, it began to get expensive.  I think that really caused a lot of problems.  Taxes went up, and a lot of the expense, and economics took hold, and that's when things sort of got out of hand a little bit and things began to change a little bit for some reason.  I don't know why.
Speaker 1: It sounds like there were two kinds of segregation, one for race that was dealt with for a while and then the economic segregation kept a lot of people out, regardless of race.  Yeah, Shaker has an interesting history, but I know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but in the beginning, it was good--one of the models.
Speaker 1: For integration?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At the international level, yeah.  And the schools have always had a fine reputation at least for offering quality education and programs.
Speaker 2: Excellent.
Speaker 1: Was that your experience in teaching there as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The science department and the chemistry department, all those areas.  It was like college.  It was like being in college.  It was fascinating.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 188084
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. [HM Malcolm] Brown you were saying that by the late '60s [1960s] then, you're teaching in Shaker Heights [Ohio].  Are you also homeowner in Shaker Heights [Ohio] at that point in time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the whole family is here in this community, living and working.  Your wife [HM Ernestine Brown] is at home with the three little children.  She is not teaching while they're young.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're teaching full-time?--simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.--simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --at Shaker Heights High School [Shaker Heights, Ohio].  It's a fine school according to everything I'm reading about the Shaker school in the '60s [1960] and '70 [1970].  What are some of your memories of your early career as a teacher at Shaker Heights, mostly pleasant, some challenges?
Speaker 2: Pleasant--well, there were some challenges with some students coming in who had problems with adjusting with certain situations, but, overall, there were no problems at all.
Speaker 1: What kind of situations are making for the difficulty?
Speaker 2: Some students had problems adjusting to the change, you know.  There were some kids who did not want to accept responsibility or instruction, as far as rules and regulations.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it is the '60s [1960], the year of the student movement and the Vietnam [War] and power to the people, down with authority figures.  And you had someone to challenge you?
Speaker 2: There were, but Shaker was pretty tough and they took care of things, and it was taken care of, but, overall, there weren't that many problems at all.  And junior high kids, you know how junior high kids are a little bit more active than high school.  I really enjoyed the high school.  I did not care much for junior high, especially ninth grade--eighth and ninth grad, I did, but seventh graders, they were squirming, wiggling, moving, lots of energy.
Speaker 1: Yeah and probably done a lot of the burning draft cards because that would have been the Vietnam era when you're at the middle school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 188085
Speaker 1: Okay, and then in the 1980s when you moved to the high school [Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio], that's the [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan era, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: You said '85 [1985]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because [President James Earl] "Jimmy" Carter [Jr.]--yeah, that's Ronald Reagan.  You remember much about--I associate activism--social activism also with Shaker Heights, Ohio.  Is that an accurate description with a lot of the young people in Shaker that they are concerned about social issues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, especially in the social studies department, they were doing a lot of different things.  I think the social studies teacher is still there.  He was there from way back there.  He is a pretty good teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, sort of applying those history lessons that they learn in class?--simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or testing out the laws through social activism?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any special movement?  We're beyond Vietnam by the 1980s.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: There is a hostage crisis that takes President Reagan into office at the beginning of the decade.
Speaker 2: Well, I probably didn't pay attention to that, you know, being in art, I didn't--I wasn't paying much attention to that struggle or whatever it was.
Speaker 1: Is there an artistic movement that we associate with the '80s [1980], the Black Arts Movement, the '60 [1960] and '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were the artists saying in the '80s [1980s] through their work?
Speaker 2: I don't think there was much going on at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was very quiet, based off of where I'm coming from, there was not much going on at all.
Story_ID: 188086
Speaker 1: You said there was an excellent art department in place when you got there [Shaker Heights High School, Shaker Heights, Ohio] in '69 [1969].  Are you aware of any major changes that were made in the art program, any innovations, I'm thinking has a technology changed with computer graphics and all that?  Do you see that also being integrated?
Speaker 2: That within the last five years before I retired, they changed--they had introduced graphic design with computers and all that new technology was being introduced to the Art Department.  They were struggling making changes with all the computer stuff that is happening.  They were definitely making some changes to try to get new people in there to learn all this new methods of doing things.  I used to work at American Greetings.  I forgot to tell you that.  American Greetings is now all computerized and people are not doing much drawing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're doing stuff on computers, digital stuff, computer stuff is taking over.
Speaker 1: So is there room to be creative then when you're using a computer?
Speaker 2: Yeah with the Macintosh, you can.  Macintosh still has that capability for artists.  They are friendly to us.
Speaker 1: So we still need human beings to have art?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You can't just press a button.  I'm encouraged by that.
Speaker 2: But at American Greetings, a lot of people were upset because of the situation.  They couldn't create.  They wanted--it took a lot away from them.
Speaker 1: When do you start to see the shift with reliance more on the computers than on the individual artist with the pencil or the paint brush?
Speaker 2: Well, in the schools, they were saying enter the shows and use the computer somewhat.  I never did go to that direction.  I stayed away from it.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and have you yet made the transition from the old fashion way with the hand?
Speaker 2: No, I try to stay away from that, but I do once in a while try to go certain programs to try to do that, but I'm just from the old school (laughter).
Speaker 1: The old school, okay.
Story_ID: 188087
Speaker 1: --Well, let's talk about the '80s [1980s] for a minute.  I don't know how old school that is, but I know in 1980, you opened your own gallery in Shaker Heights [Ohio], a community where you're homeowner, raising a family, and teaching full-time in the schools and now you're co-owner of the Malcolm Brown Gallery.  How do you find the time to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, had a good partner with Ernestine [HM Ernestine Brown] my wife, and we used to travel around to shows.  I used to go to Virginia Beach (unclear) and that's one of the reasons we stopped--and that is one of the reasons we wanted to have a gallery to become stationary for a while and just stop.  So it helped me as far as having a body of work and having a place to show, and get things going as far as--and also helped to have a place so we can bring other people here, and people of note like (unclear) and Hughie Lee-Smith and so forth.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it helps to have Mrs. Ernestine Brown as a partner in life and also in business as far as the gallery is concerned.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Where do you find--oh, that frees you up some time that you have someone helping you, but where do you find the space to paint?  Where is your studio in the '80 [1980]?
Speaker 2: Well, it has always been at my house.  When I first started, it was at my kitchen table.  I was winning prizes from the stuff I was doing on the kitchen table even before I got a little studio at the back of my house.  I have a little studio at the back of my house.
Speaker 1: Was that something that you added to the existing structure?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you made an artist space?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I read somewhere--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but at the beginning, I was painting more exciting paintings then than I'm doing now for some reason.  I don't know what it is.
Story_ID: 188088
Speaker 1: I think I read that in the 1970s, you were elected to the American Watercolor Society.  Okay, can you tell me about the steps that led to that election?  I understand it is a very exclusive organization.
Speaker 2: Well, prior to doing that, I worked in American Greetings for one year.  That was one place I worked for one year, and that was a good experience because I met a lot of people that were into showing their work off and talking and criticizing each other, and a lot of these were in that society, so I wanted to become a member, where I could sign my name and become one of the elite members of this society, so I had to submit paintings to New York City and I had to get selected four times--be selected four times, and then they vote on you and I was elected in 1973.  And I was very fortunate because sometimes people work for you ten years and fifteen years and never get in.  I was very lucky.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, how old were you at that point in 1973?  Now, we're going to do the math.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your birth year again, '31 [1931]?
Speaker 2: '31 [1931]
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were very young artist!  Oh my goodness!
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I first started painting--simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --'41 [1941] or '42 [1942].
Speaker 2: I won a lot of prizes over the years and pretty lucky and successful as far as being in the right place at the right time, putting the right piece in the shows.  Right now, I'm in about thirty corporate collections, corporations across the country, and you've seen the resume with all the places I've shown over the years.  And that's happened within the last twenty years.
Speaker 1: Tell us some of those honors and awards that you received in addition to the American Watercolor Society membership?
Speaker 2: They're so numerous.
Speaker 1: Not that I would recognize because I'm not an artist but, you know, some of the other folks listening to the tape might and then know where they can find other information on you.
Speaker 2: Well, I've been in three--two movies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The 'Antwone Fisher' was the last one and 'Waiting To Exhale' movie in '94 [1994].  And as far as prize winners, there are so many of them.  I'm a member of Watercolor Society also and the prize that I won there.  I have to be reading something to tell you. But I can't--simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --but that one's also honorary and by invitation only?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so another high honor.
Story_ID: 188089
Speaker 1: When I think about some of those images that I remember seeing in 'Waiting to Exhale,' it's the figures of the two little girls, sisters, that I recognized immediately; and I don't even think anyone told me that your paintings were going to be on the walls in any of those scenes, but I just recognized it because you're such a popular figure with folks in northeast Ohio and I would guess across the country too.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: But I would guess painting figures, so you prefer that to the landscape, the more traditional art that you said you were more drawn to as a student?
Speaker 2: I like the landscape, but in the middle part of my life I started doing a lot of figures; and I learned to handle them very spontaneously and direct with no drawing, which I've enjoyed doing, and that has, in fact, if you look at the painting, they look very free and so they just float, and they were easily done that way.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm looking at some paintings now, in fact, there are a couple right behind you and it's hard for me to tell if that's oil, if that's water color because there is a opaque water color too, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, watercolor was the medium that I used earlier; and I've gotten into acrylics in the last five years, but of them are water-based mediums, and the acrylics colors are more opaque and the water colors are more transparent.
Speaker 1: So would say you've done more work in the water colors--simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yes.--simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --than in the other?
Speaker 2: Well, I made my reputation in the water color medium.  Most people know me for my water color, but I've been experimenting a lot.  In the '90s [1990], I started experimenting with mixed medium.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a piece in the museum was with mixed medium.
Speaker 1: Okay, what medium in case we see that museum at the Cleveland Museum of Art [Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Pastel and acrylics and some collage, a little bit of collage and the piece is 50 x 60.  It's a large piece.
Speaker 1: I think I remember this piece because the museum used to have the May Show all the time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in '90 [1990] '91 [1991], I was there, the last May Show--somewhere in the last era.
Speaker 2: This one was in the last May show--the very last one--the very last one.  Evan Turner was the director at that time.
Story_ID: 188090
Speaker 1: I've gone through three administrations.  The first director's [of the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio] name was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Was it [Sherman] Mr. Lee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lee and then [Evan] Turner and now Katherine Reid, and that's her father, Lee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard that--that Mr. Lee was her father.
Speaker 1: Now, in '82 [1982] when [Romare] Bearden was here, the first show we had by Bearden, was sold to a collector in this area.  That same painting ended up with Catherine Reed in Virginia in the '90s [1990] because he sold it for $177,000, and when Katharine Reid came to see us, we told her about that.  We have a copy of the same painting and that was bought for $25,000 and sold many years for $177,000.
Speaker 2: Well, just so we can put the names with some of the pieces of the museum collection, which I think is a world class act museum, although it's a small museum, not even close to size to what they have up in Detroit [Michigan], but it's a nice collection, nice variety.  What was the name of the piece they acquired from that May Show?
Speaker 1: 'Grooving.'
Speaker 2: 'Grooving,' jazz inspired?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Grooving' in the Cleveland Museum of Art [Cleveland, Ohio] by Malcolm Brown.
Speaker 1: Now in the 90s [1990s] I was experimenting with jazz figures--jazz and that was one of the pieces that came out of the series that I did during that time.
Story_ID: 188091
Speaker 1: I've heard a lot about Cleveland Museum of Art's [Cleveland, Ohio] collection in that they don't have a lot of works by African American artists.
Speaker 2: No, they don't (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) In fact, I can almost name the ones that are there.  There is a [Romare] Bearden piece there.
Speaker 2: They have a sculpture--what's his name.  He's from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh really?
Speaker 2: He has a studio in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There is an artist who is still working?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I know there is a Moe Brooker.
Speaker 2: Moe Brooker. They have a Moe Brooker
Speaker 1: I've seen that one and there's yours and not many other.
Speaker 2: Maybe there's an artist that does satire.  I think they have one of his.  [Robert] Colescott, I think they have a Colescott.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but I think they have a Colescott.

Speaker 1: I know in speaking with Mrs. Brown, Mrs. [HM] Ernestine Brown, gallery director, that a lot of the work that you all have done as partners with this facility in sort of pioneering and getting more exposure for African American artists, but especially show casing your work.  You feel that you succeeded in doing what you set out to do in 1980?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And it's been really fascinating--been meeting all these people.  That's wonderful to meet [Romare] Bearden, to meet Hughie Lee[ Smith] and have a friendship and networking with June Kelly, all that has really been wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so for African American artists, Romare Bearden, Hughie Lee-Smith and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --the sculptor that you mentioned before Selma Burton [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All have come through the Malcolm Brown Gallery in Shaker Heights [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And June Kelly, who is she again.
Speaker 2: She was Bearden's manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she has a gallery in New York called the June Kelly Gallery, and we've become friends over the years, maintained friendship.  Network, coordinate, talk together and talk about certain things.  Ernestine was telling me about the collection with the Grant Hill.  I have his book here.  I have to show you the book and that has my two pieces in it.
Speaker 1: Now, that is the collection that toured several museums?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, The Grant Hill Collection.  I'd love to take a look at that.  Now, when was that touring in case people want to get a copy of the catalogue?
Speaker 2: It started in December--November 4th in the Orlando Museum of Art [Orlando, Florida] and that tours over to Orlando and now it's going over to New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Oh, so it just started in 2003?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's going on to the seventh tour and I have the itinerary and I'll show it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, wonderful.  It's not coming to Cleveland [Ohio], is it?
Speaker 2: No, it's all the areas south, Texas--yeah, the collection that he has is a large--one of the largest collection that an athlete has purchased.  And I think it's going to be written up in art news soon information about this collection.  [HM] Tavis Smiley had it on his show.  He's talked about what Grant's is doing now and the things that he has in his collection.
Story_ID: 188093
Speaker 1: So how are we doing in northeast Ohio as far as art museums and galleries are concerned regionally?  I know that Cleveland [Ohio] doesn't have a high museum plan, but?
Speaker 2: You mean as far as--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, just the atmosphere--for supporting visual artists now, after twenty--
Speaker 2: It's not easy.  It's been tough.  You know, with the economic situation, it's been rough as far as doing shows and getting exposure and so forth.  And people have been trying--with the Issue 31 didn't go through.  They wouldn't pass that.
Speaker 1: There was a recent request for a tax increase.
Speaker 2: That didn't fare out with people because I think it would have increased the property taxes, and I think a lot of people didn't want that.
Speaker 1: So was that a vote against the art or a vote for keeping property tax affordable.
Speaker 2: Affordable.
Speaker 1: Not anti-art?
Speaker 2: No, I think everybody wants to see their art thrive.  Downtown area has been trying to do a lot of things too, you know, and that's been tough.  It's been rough, but--the thing I think that we did the right thing was to bring in top people to create a little bit of excitement, keep things going, just to keep things moving.
Story_ID: 188094
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. [HM Malcolm] Brown, I know you told me earlier that you had a number of teachers in high school [Albemarle Training School, Charlottesville, Virginia] and college [Virginia State College, Petersburg, Virginia] who inspired you, but I wanted to ask you also if you had a favorite artist or a group of artists who inspired you in your work.
Speaker 2: I particular liked John Singer Sargent.  He's a water colorist.  I also like the impressionist spirit of [Vincent] Van Gogh, [Henri] Matisse and [Edouard] Manet of that era.  I played with light.  I loved to play with light.  Some of the things I try to do--it's one thing--I try to look at as many of those guys while I'm working.  I keep one eye on them and my things.  It's something that--a lot of artists do that.  And it's good to do that to look as much as you can as often as you can, to make sure that you start doing some of those things with the light.
Speaker 1: Now, I have to say that just in looking at your work, it's hard for me to believe that you're looking at someone's else while your painting your own because you definitely found your own voice.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And I think that's a good thing to be yourself.
Story_ID: 188095
Speaker 1: I wonder though when you talked about the Impressionists and I always think about [Vincent] Van Gogh and how he suffered for his art.  I mean there were a number of things going on psychologically and financially in his life, but do you--you think things have gotten better, generally speaking, for artists in recent years to make a living through their art?
Speaker 2: You know, to do it without having somebody to help you along, it's tough, because a lot of artist come by here a lot.  Yesterday, I had a couple of artists come by downtown, and they're living in those lofts down there, and it's tough.  A lot of them say, "I'm going to make it--I'm going to try to make it."  I don't know whether I would have made it with a family, you know, but it's tough out there to try to make a living and bring the art along, raise a family.  If you don't have a family, it's not that bad, but I had to do both.  Mine is sort of parallel.  I sort of kept things going at the same time.
Speaker 1: I'm imagining your painting at the kitchen table with three little kids running around.  It must have been a challenge.
Speaker 2: No, they weren't that much-they didn't bother me that much.  I was pulling together some things that looked great then.
Speaker 1: Yeah because if you were elected to the [American] Watercolor Society in '73 [1973], they're elementary school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yeah, so I was hitting it.
Story_ID: 188096
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. [HM Malcolm] Brown, you said in the earlier segment that it can still be tough to make a living as an artist and do you think there is something that we can do as a society to help turn that situation around or what has to happen in America for artists to make it?
Speaker 2: Well, we have to have support as--and we need more collectors.  It's tough in a town like Cleveland [Ohio], where there's not a lot of activity like some of the major cities like New York, Chicago [Illinois], California--you really have to sort of make things happen, you know, create some interest.  And I think one of the ways that we did this was bring these other people here and try to--and that sort of spurred interest in people, and more people are coming, and more people are flying in because there are a lot of collectors out there who do nothing but sit around and buy art.
Speaker 1: As an investment?
Speaker 2: Right, to look for art--and they collect different periods, you know, like abstract art, ceramics.  There are hundreds of people, and that's all they do.  And there is a magazine like ARTnews who published 200 collectors there, and so we have to get that going, so we--and also I've seen work over the years rolling, but with [Bill] Cosby, with his program, he has created a lot of interest over the years--black art on television--by showing it on television and showing, and he has a book out, tabletop book [The Other Side of Color, African American Art in the Collection of Camille O. and William H. Cosby Jr.].
Speaker 1: On Art?
Speaker 2: Yes, [HM] David Driskell, who is a historian, did his book.  You need to see it.
Speaker 1: Bill Cosby and David Driskell?
Speaker 2: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --have a book on black art?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, David Driscoll wrote his compile of his collections.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And there are several--there is a surgeon who has a collection of art out now, and there is five or six--when you read my book--when you see that book, it'll tell you in there how many people have sort of written books on collections that they are trying to get, [Aaron] Douglas, [Romare] Bearden, [Edward Mitchell] Bannister, all African American--that is highly collectable now.
Speaker 1: So it sounds like things are getting better slowly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There is a lot of activity.  [HM] Elizabeth Catlett is going to be on CBS on Sunday morning in April.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay!
Speaker 2: And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --one of your gallery artist and internationally known now.
Speaker 2: And that helps when people see her and begin ti can talk, and there is an interest I'm looking for Catletts.  Do you any Catletts?  And that sort of spurs--trickles down to us.
Story_ID: 188097
Speaker 1: Would you say that the Malcolm Brown Gallery [Shaker Heights, Ohio] is now part of a national or international network for showcasing art by black Americans?
Speaker 2: I think so because we could call some different people around the country; and we have people coming here and saying, "I want to stop here.  I'm coming to town, doing some business and I want to stop here and see some of your things."  In fact, just a couple of days ago, a guy came from Atlanta [Georgia].  He saw the Grant Hill book and he saw my pieces in there, and he is a collector.  So it helps.  It really does help.
Speaker 1: I know that your paintings were included and some of the scenes from 'Waiting to Exhale,' and the 'Antwone Fisher' story, and then with 'The Cosby Show,' it's this mass consumption of television and movies, but still be get Varnette Honeywood, you know hanging in the living room of the Cosby family home or the Huxtable family, I suppose if we call it the TV name or I think it's Ellis Wilson with Funeral Procession.  All of those images are so familiar.  How do you feel about that?  Does that cheapen the art at all, or is that a good thing for visual art?
Speaker 2: Well, there are different levels of what you select--like the guy was talking about that the other day, a guy named Charlie Bibbs [sic, Charles Bibbs]?  Have you heard of a guy named Charlie Bibbs?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He does more prints and he's more like a machine.  He turns these things out, but that--but there are different levels to select and people are beginning to slow down and little bit and buy things that cost more, you know, collect things that cost a little bit more.
Speaker 1: So you do these one-of-a-kind?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then you do, what limited edition prints?
Speaker 2: People who can't afford--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --what posters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's getting down.
Speaker 1: To my level.
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't say that.  I started out with prints earlier.  I have seven limited edition prints when I started get going and that helped things to keep going while the people are getting themselves together for the more expensive things.
Speaker 1: So you believe offering then some art at each of those levels?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you try to educate people to what's out there, to what's better; and if you have more money, gradually work up to it.
Story_ID: 188098
Speaker 1: I've asked the question of Mrs. [HM Ernestine] Brown, so I think I'll run it by you as well.  We talked about the starving artist; and I think you've done a lot in this community.  And I don't think you're starving without seeing your financial portfolio, but would you say that it's been worth it, you know, all the balancing and support you had to do in raising a family and teaching full-time, and running the gallery, and creating new work?  Any regrets about that?
Speaker 2: No, it's been a great ride for me.  I wouldn't trade it for the experience of going through all this because meeting the people--and it's just been so exciting.  Every event has been a blast, very exciting time; and it's just been so great.  It looks tough--I mean from the outside, you might think--and you have your ups and downs and slow times, especially in Cleveland [Ohio], you have your slow times, but you work through it.
Story_ID: 188099
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. [HM Malcolm] Brown, we talked a little bit about the Black Arts Movement and the beginnings of that for you during your summer in Boston, Massachusetts, but I just wonder do you think that whole movement, which was sort of a grassroots movement, do you think it did something positive for the Arts community or do you thing the demand for art went up in the wake of that movement among African American people?
Speaker 2: I think it created some awareness and, you know, got people thinking from a standpoint of did it helped, is that what you were thinking?
Speaker 1: Yes, I was thinking of Addison Gayle and his little argument about a black aesthetic and the need to different set of standards to judge the value of black art and the role of politics in art.  It's hard to, for me, to pick out the politics when I look at a landscape, but do you think that art by black America necessarily has to be political?
Speaker 2: No, my coming from a different era or region, I might not be into that.  And, no, I really don't think you have to be--I think it's just where you're coming from and where you are, so it directs you to certain paths, certain things that you get into and do.  No, I don't really think that affects anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that is a very different school of thought than where the black artists were The Black Arts Movement artists were in the 1960s.  I don't know that it's possible to be an American and not be political, so do you think that politics has had any impact in your life as an artist in American with a base in Shaker Heights [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Um, not really.  I'm trying to put my finger on how or what--how it has affected to me.  I know a lot of politics (unclear) and certain individual you meet and see--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in the network?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but as far as helping to create something--for me, I don't think it has affected me that much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I still am trying to think what you were driving at.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's not my aim to asking any leading questions, just to get the story.  If your art isn't political, that's fine because there is surely plenty of art out there that is political and very clearly so.
Speaker 2: Robert Colescott, satire reaction against--I'm trying to think what movement might be.  You have to really get down--you see one piece in this book that meant something political, maybe the big fist and the (unclear) and the big strokes, and the shapes.
Speaker 1: And is it Robert Colescott, is that his name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay because I was just now thinking about one of the pieces by him I think I saw it at the Cleveland Museum of Art [Cleveland, Ohio] but Robert Colescott, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he would take a picture of someone floating down--paint a picture of Washington, [President] George Washington floating down an embankment with a head of--maybe something else on his head that he was wearing, somewhat different.
Story_ID: 188100
Speaker 1: I wonder then if it's not to deliver a political message, what's the most important message or value that you associate with making art?
Speaker 2: Value.
Speaker 1: Why do it?
Speaker 2: I just want to say something to make people feel good and make people--create a feeling, and just--and it makes me feel a certain way.
Speaker 1: So is it beauty?  That's the value of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah--create a stimulus, beauty, charm, tranquility.  These are just some things that I can think of.
Story_ID: 188101
Speaker 1: Now, I know that you have a grandson.  What's his name again?
Speaker 2: Avery Jacob.
Speaker 1: Avery.
Speaker 2: Avery Jacob.
Speaker 1: Avery James.
Speaker 2: Jacob.
Speaker 1: Avery Jacob.
Speaker 2: Avery Jacob Saffold [ph.].
Speaker 1: Is there a lesson or a legacy that you hope to pass on to Avery Jacob Saffold [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Well, um, I'd like to pass on my talents and my quiet, unassuming way, so he can survive in this hostile world.
Speaker 1: You have that air about you that nothing bothers.  (Laughter)  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Then that's good.
Speaker 2: I'm like my mother [Dorothy Reeves Jackson Franklin]--she was that way--very laid back.  If you want something, you got to pull it out me, pull it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 188102
Speaker 1: What's been most rewarding for you?  You've worn a lot of hats, husband, father, teacher, and artist.  Is there any one hat or area of your life that has been the most rewarding for you?
Speaker 2: Meeting Ernestine [HM Ernestine Brown], all the events that have happened from the '80s [1980] down to now have been sort of exciting.
Speaker 1: So the events that have come out of the gallery experience, those have been most rewarding?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anything prior to that, I was--didn't have a gallery.  We would go to shows.  I was winning awards then and doing things and having some success.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much for sharing your story with us.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Story_ID: 188103
Speaker 1: I was about five years old.
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  I didn't know you then so I don't know how old you were.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER) Who else is in the photo?
Speaker 2: That's my mother [Dorothy R. Brown] and father [Franklin M. Brown] and that's down in Warm Springs, Virginia.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):   That is a family visit, Malcolm is shooting us and we're at Monticello.  We took our sons and Rhonda and the carriage to see [President Thomas] Jefferson's home, which is twenty miles from [HM] Malcolm [Brown]'s home in Corzet, Virginia.  There I am, the third from the right seated at seventh grade at Madison School [Madison Elementary School, Youngstown, Ohio].
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  That is a graduation picture that the photographer at home said I was photogenic and took me in for a second shooting to take some other photographs that were in display on his window.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  That's my high school graduation from North High School [Youngstown, Ohio] in 1953.
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):   That's me at the junior--at my senior prom at high school.
Speaker 1: How old was I there?  I was fifteen back in Virginia, back south in Virginia.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER) Do you remember the occasion?
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  He's probably at Sunday school, just church.
Speaker 2: Back in Virginia, I don't know where I was here, out in the backyard probably.  I was about sixteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  It looks more like school attire, not in the backyard.  I'm sure you didn't play in the backyard looking like that with a white shirt, sweater on and a vest.
Speaker 2: That's my high school graduation.  In the service, right after ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps] in Germany.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  That's a good looking picture.  You're still good looking though.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER):  How long were you in Germany?
Speaker 1: I went through ROTC and then I had to do the time after college.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER):  So you were an officer.
Speaker 1: Yes, I was first lieutenant.  College graduation.  Virginia State College [Petersburg, Virginia] graduation, high school 19-what?
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  That's not high school, are you teaching?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Woodbury Junior High School [Shaker Heights, Ohio], probably the '70s [1970].
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Presentation with the children.
Speaker 1: I was talking to a group at the high school--presentation.  I was making a presentation to--who was it?
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Jean Young.
Speaker 1: Jean Young.
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Andy Young's [HM Andrew Young] wife, in the '70s [197s0], would you say?
Speaker 1: In the '70 [1970s].
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Someplace in the '70s [1970], end of the '70s [1970].  This is Romare Bearden when he visited the gallery in 1982--exhibited the gallery; and I think this is a conversation he is having with some people at a reception at the Cleveland Museum of Art.  Oh, and there is Malcolm there in the background, right.  I don't even know what to say there.  That was gift from Malcolm prior to opening the gallery, probably '78 [1978] or '79 1979.
Speaker 1: Wasn't that the party?
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Yeah, but I had worn the coat to the party.  You gave me that before we opened the gallery, remember?
Speaker 1: Is that Bearden?
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  We're at a special reception at Arnold and Betty Pinkney's home on behalf of Romare Bearden and we're there enjoying his conversation.  That is Fernando Vallaso [ph.].  He was minister of museums from Brazil and he was in town as part of a diplomatic delegation and came to visit us and there was some conversation about an exchange between Brazilian artists and some of the artists that we represented.  Look at my hair.
Speaker 2: Oh, this was at Byron Junior High School graduation.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  --for one of our sons.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Jeff Brown's graduation.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  That's a visit by the actor, [HM] Danny Glover came.  He and his wife, Asake [Bomani]--he was doing a shot down in Cincinnati [Ohio].  What is a term they call when they do a walk on?
Speaker 2: A cameo.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  A cameo shot and he came up to visit us as a part of his visit down.  We had met his wife earlier, and they came to talk to us about opening a gallery, Bomani Gallery--in San Francisco [California] was his wife's gallery, and we talked to him about the gallery business.
Speaker 2: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  The historian, [HM] John Hope Franklin, visited the gallery.  He bought some art work from us and we had only met him on the telephone; and when came to Cleveland for another event, he came by to visit and to look at some more things. There is Ernestine Brown and his sister-in-law in the photograph with him.
Speaker 1: Ernestine Brown: We see Hughie Lee-Smith, artist, speaking with Rowena Jelliffe, one of the founders of Karamu [House].  She is in the red jacket.  Hughie Lee has a strong Cleveland connection.  He exhibited with us.  His first exhibit with us was in 1984.  We are in New York.  What was the name of the club?
Speaker 2: Athletic Club.
Speaker 1: (ERNESTINE BROWN):  At the Athletic Club celebrating with [HM] Elizabeth Catlett.
