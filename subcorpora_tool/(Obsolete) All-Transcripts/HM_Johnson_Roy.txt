Story_ID: 661838
Speaker 1: So we want to start out, I want to start out by asking about your parents and your family background.  Can we start with your mother?  Can you give her name and her year of birth and what you know of her background?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother was born Ida Mae Brooks [Ida Brooks Jenkins] in 1920, in a small town in Oklahoma.  I believe it was Hugo, Oklahoma [sic. Wagoner, Oklahoma].  And her mother was, you know, Anna Brooks [Anna Roland Brooks], and Anna was a large person in her church, very significant person in her church.  So my mother was raised in the church as an only child.  She did go to college, went to Langston University [Colored Agricultural and Normal University; Langston University, Langston, Oklahoma] and became a teacher in Tulsa.  So when I was growing up, she was a substitute teacher and then ultimately a full-time teacher.  She taught what was then called speech, which, of course, is English now.  And I always give her credit or blame for sort of making me a little crazy in that, she gave me the first B I ever got in my life.  I had gotten all A's up until fifth grade [at Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma], and my mother, in speech class, gave me a B.  And I said to- I blame her for everything, from stunting my growth to any other mini-failure that I might have had in life.  I said, "If you hadn't given me that B then I'd--I would have turned out better."
Speaker 1: So your mother was your teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You don't see that much anymore.  But back in the day, I guess there wasn't a law against it.  My mother was my teacher, my aunt was a teacher.  It was, it was hell (laughter).  It was, it was terrible having your mother and your aunt for two of your classes, but I survived and have stories too and scars from the experience.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So that's not right.  Poor thing.  Now the--I want to ask you to describe your mother but also share with any stories that she may have shared with you about her growing up.
Speaker 2: You know, when you're young you don't know your parents like you would as adults, and our lives were really built around the fact, and I know you haven't asked about my father yet, but the fact that he died when I was twelve years old.  So prior to that, it was myself, my parents, and my younger brother [James Johnson], and we lived Tulsa, Oklahoma, and father owned a store in the Greenwood area of Tulsa, which is known as Black Wall Street.  And we had a pretty nice life.  Had a home, my father had his office in a, in a--office off the garage in our, in our house.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you give your father's name?
Speaker 2: Sure.  His name was Roy [Roy Johnson], no middle name, so I'm not a junior.  And, so my mother was a substitute teacher during that period and worked at the store [Kyle's Sundry Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma], we all pretty much worked at the store.  My first job was at the store.  I had a timecard making twenty-five cents an hour and was very proud of that and pretty much learned how to count, basically, by making change at the store.  I wasn't tall enough to reach the cash register.  They had a little bench that I would stand on to make change for customers.  So my mother was the substitute teacher during that period.  But once my father passed away and she made the decision not to carry on with the store, then she had to become a full-time teacher.  And my mother was pretty quiet.  She didn't share a lot of stories about growing up.  I learned more things later on.  She passed when she was seventy-one years old, seventy, seventy-one, back in 1990.  And by that point, she had, she had a stroke but had recovered and was doing pretty well but died from a blood clot.  She didn't share a lot about her childhood being an only child, but I knew that she grew up in the church.  I heard stories about her meeting my father, who was seventeen years older than she was, so it was a little controversial when Roy came courting little Ida Mae, as I've heard subsequent to his death and later on hers 'cause the aunt who taught me is still alive and now in her eighties.  And, so she just spills stories willy nilly.  And, so we've heard a lot of stories about my mother and that period in her life from Aunt Bobbie [ph.], who of course is not my real aunt.  She's like my Negro aunt.  You know, she and my mom were best friends, and I think I was a teenager before I found out I really wasn't related to her and her daughters who I call my cousins.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you know that she grew--was she from Tulsa, though?  Do you know if the fam- or you don't even know that?
Speaker 2: Well, she was born in a small town.  It was either Hugo or Clare- Claremore, Oklahoma.  But she pretty much grew up--she went to school, high school in Tulsa and grew up in Tulsa and that's where she met my dad.
Story_ID: 661839
Speaker 1: How would you describe her [Johnson's mother, Ida Brooks Jenkins] besides being quiet?
Speaker 2: She was very smart.  I mean, being a teacher was clearly one of those women in another era who could have had almost any other job, any other type of opportunity if she'd wanted to pursue it.  As you, as you know, during that period in America for African American women, there weren't a lot of lanes that they could pursue, nursing, perhaps, teaching, domestic.  And that was pretty much, pretty much it, the top of the food chain in terms of professional opportunities.  So she--I wasn't homeschooled, but I might as well have been, between the reading that was done to me when I was younger and the reading that I did when I was younger.  We always had books in the house and, you know, having her in school [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  So, you know, education was obviously important to her.  My father [Roy Johnson] graduated from high school but did not go to college, but he also was really a proponent of education and made sure that both myself and my brother [James Johnson] worked as hard as we could to be as good as we could be in terms of education.
Story_ID: 661840
Speaker 1: So can you talk about your father [Roy Johnson] and what you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: When your father dies when you're young, you really don't know much as a twelve year old.  What I knew at that time and for most of my life was that he was an entrepreneur.  He was a bellhop, actually, at the Mayo Hotel in Tulsa [Oklahoma] prior to saving enough money to buy this business, Kyle Sundry [Kyle's Sundry Store], which was on Greenwood [Avenue].  I describe Kyle Sundry as a kind of the black 'Happy Days.'  It was a drugstore, had a big candy area.  You know, had, you know, things that you might want, scarves, you know, minor clothing, medicines that you could buy over the counter, had a soda fountain, you know, where you could make ice cream sundaes and the floats and banana splits and a jukebox.  So it was the after school hangout for the kids, it was the nighttime hangout for the men, it was the Sunday afternoon, after church hangout for women.  So it was really a community center, and I learned a lot about people just by being in Greenwood [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  We also had some apartments in the top floor of the building, so a lot of tenants would come down, and it was a real cast of characters.  So, you know, he was, he was a smart man, did not go to college, went--finished high school.  Again, like many black men who were either train porters or bellhops in hotels, that is what he did along with his brother, my uncle Jimmy [James B. Johnson].  But he saved enough money and bought Kyle Sundry, but was too cheap to change the neon sign out front.  So he continued to call it Kyle Sundry, and I never knew who Kyle was and still don't know who Kyle is but that was the name of the store.  So he was diligent, he worked every day and, you know, opened the store, closed it, was good at hiring people. There were many people who subsequently have come to me and thanked my father for either giving them their first job or being able to work for him, and people come up to me all the time, "I worked for your dad," and I have no idea who these people are.  Some of them I may have seen when I was younger because they remember me as a little boy in the store.  But again, he was very serious.  He was very, he was, he was, you know, took his work very seriously.  But I found out something about him later in life, and this is, this is what's great about when people get old and they start revealing things.  It was someone who knew him, and I always try to talk to people just to find out a little more about my father.  And I was talking to this gentleman a few years ago, and he was giving me all these things, and then he, just out of the blue said, "Well, you know your dad ran the numbers."  I was like, what?  I said (laughter), "What do you mean, he ran the numbers?"  And I had no clue, but what I remembered was in his office off of the garage where I would often play on the floor, play with things while he was doing his books and doing whatever he had to do from an accounting standpoint, I remember this cylinder that had little capsules in it and they had numbers.  Now at the time, I just thought it was just some game.  I had no idea what they were.  But as soon as that man said it to me, that image of those capsules and that contraption flashed in my mind, and I must have laughed for a week.  And I said, "There you go and that's--." So that--you learn things later on about him.  But he, so he had a little side hustle that obviously helped the family but did not--he was very quiet about it and obviously did not share it with his, with his children.  But he was, he was a hustler, I guess.  He was an entrepreneur, he was a hustler, and if you were an African American male at that time and you wanted to be successful, you had to have hustler on your business card because society wasn't going to allow you to do anything but hustle. He ended up having prostate cancer.  He was older.  I was, he was fifty when I was born, and I have a younger brother [James Johnson].  By today's standards, that's not very old, and it wasn't really old at that time, but he contracted prostate cancer in his sixties and died when he was sixty-two.  So I was twelve, and younger brother is nine.  He was sick off and on for the last couple years of his life and pretty much worked up until about the last six months when he was pretty much just in and out of hospitals.  But I'm very grateful for him and the lessons he shared during the time he was around, and the example that he still provides just by understanding and having that memory of him getting up, going to work, hiring people, being a professional, taking inventory and keeping a viable business around and alive and pulling himself up without a college education and moving on from being a bell- bellhop, which was a very dignified position.  My--his brother, my uncle, did it pretty much until the day he died.  I mean, he was in his eighties, and I don't know how many bags he was actually carrying, but the Mayo Hotel and whatever it became after that kept him on because he was really part of the place's history.  But they had the outfits and the caps and everything, but my father moved on from that after he saved his money, and started his career and entrepreneurialism.
Speaker 1: Now that says a lot about your father.
Story_ID: 661841
Speaker 1: The thing that I, I would--how did your parents meet?  Do you know that?  I mean, there was this seventeen age--seventeen year age gap.
Speaker 2: It's a great question.  I don't know how they actually met.  Aunt Bobbie [ph.] tells me that there were times when Roy [Roy Johnson] would come around and want to court Ida Mae [Ida Brooks Jenkins], my mother, and, of course, Anna [Anna Roland Brooks], her mother, was a little skeptical about this old man coming around to see her daughter.  But I don't know exactly how they met, whether she was just out and about somewhere--something that I'll have to look into.  Maybe Aunt Bobbie will be able to share something about that.
Speaker 1: So describe north Tulsa [Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: North Tulsa was great back then, you know.  It's--I think when you're young, you don't know what you don't have until someone tells you.  You know, north Tulsa had solid schools--again, this is in the early '60s [1960s]--had a thriving business community that had everything we needed, from restaurants, barbershops, movie theaters.  I don't remember venturing outside of north Tulsa, because there was no need to.  There were certainly people who worked outside of that area, women and men who worked either as domestics in the homes of whites who lived in south Tulsa or people like Ike Jenkins [Isaac Jenkins], who later on became my stepfather, when he married my mother later on, ran a landscaping business, so he basically cut lawns and--of the big homes that were out on the south side.  But other than that, most people stayed in north Tulsa because there was no desire and no need to leave north Tulsa.  That all changed, of course, in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act passed.  I mean, clearly this was a time when the world was changing.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and many, many others, including people like Reverend Ben Hill in Tulsa, who was essentially our version of Dr. King, were fighting equal rights, just as they should and for equal opportunity and for being able to shop, eat, drive, live anywhere we wanted to, which, of course, generations now take for granted.  So on the weekend after the 19--Civil Rights Act passed and was brought into law, my father took us downtown, Tulsa, to the Piccadilly cafeteria [Piccadilly Restaurants, LLC] for Sunday dinner.  Now we usually went to Sunday dinner at Betty's Chat and Chew [Tulsa, Oklahoma] on the north side, which, of course, it was great. That mean that was, it was Betty's, and it had everything you needed.  So we went to Piccadilly, and it was a basic cafeteria.  Now, of course, he was doing that to send us a message that now we would go eat anywhere we wanted, but the food was terrible.  And in the middle of the meal, I said, "Daddy, you know, this is terrible.  Can we go back to Betty's," (laughter)?  We just didn't appreciate the historical moment which totally aggravated him to no end.  But we weren't quite ready to understand the significance of it.  We just wanted to go back to Betty's and have our regular Sunday dinner food that was much better than they had at the Piccadilly cafeteria.
Story_ID: 661842
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) It's tough to recall the earliest memory.  You know, I have flashes and when I'm around family, you know, can have flashes of moments with them.  Bobbie [ph.] has two daughters, Janice [ph.] and Patrice [ph.], who are my cousins, who are a little older, three and six years older, so they used to babysit me a lot.  So babysitting meant going when they would go on dates and they would go someplace and they'd have to take me along.  And, so I remember being out with them.  I remember the home that we lived on, in on Pine Street in Tulsa [Oklahoma], which was--now I go back and it looks about the size of a postage stamp, but it was plenty big for us, had a couple of bedrooms.  I don't think my brother [James Johnson] and I had to share a room, and if we did, it wasn't that big a deal, had a den, we had a backyard and a garage, and I said there's an office off of that garage.  I remember, when I look at some pictures, I re- I have memories of those pictures of when I was smaller, riding with my father [Roy Johnson].  Of course, there were no seatbelts back then, being at the store [Kyle's Sundry Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma] when I was as--had to be young as eight, nine years old, you know, when the guy would come with the merchandise for the store, checking off inventory to make sure we had four boxes of aspirin and six boxes of this medicine and seven boxes of candy.  I really liked it when the candy guy came delivering.  So most of the memories are from being at the store, from being at home during that time.  I do have one significant memory.  When we came home from the store after closing the store one night, pulled into the garage, my mom [Ida Brooks Jenkins] and my younger brother went into the house through the backdoor, and my brother came running back to the door and he yells out, "Can I turn on the TV in the living room?"  Now we didn't have a television in the living room, at least as far as I knew.  And my father just said, "Sure," you know, just to appease my brother, and he goes running away, and he comes back and says, "I don't know how to turn it on."  And my mom's like, "What is he talking about?"  Well, dad had just brought us a color TV and he didn't tell anybody and, so it was a big day, it was a--one of those big monstrosities, piece of furniture.  And we turned it on.  I remember the first show I ever saw in color was 'Star Trek,' and it was an episode where they had a green monster.  And, so I'll always remember the first show I saw in color being 'Star Trek' from that day when dad surprised us with a color TV.
Speaker 1: Well, you would have been in your element, all of you, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Fortunately (laughter).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Dad had his chair that he used to sit in and fall asleep while smoking a cigar which, you know, today, you know (laughter), we think is crazy, but that was--he would have his chair and everybody had their spot and that's pretty much where we spent most of our time, once we shut down the store or anytime we weren't working or at church [Vernon A.M.E. Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Now how far away did you live from the store?  Was it walking distance?  'Cause Pine Street is the, you know, street that you lived on, so where was the store?  Do you know or--
Speaker 2: Sure.  The store was probably a couple of miles, at least, from our home.  Was it walking distance?  Sure, it was walking distance, but we never really walked it.  We pretty much drove, and our church was a little bit farther down the street on Greenwood [Avenue].  So everything was within three or four miles of, of each other, but it wasn't really close enough to walk, so we pretty much drove most of those places.
Story_ID: 661843
Speaker 1: Can you describe your household, you know, what, what it was like, you know, in the household or what an average day, what time your, you know, your father'd [Roy Johnson] get up or do you have memories of that?
Speaker 2: Well, if you, if you look at all the television shows from that era, of course, they all had white families and, but our life was pretty much like that.  I said, we were very fortunate in that my father was able to earn enough either through the store [Kyle's Sundry Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma] or his (air quotes) side business.  We had a, we had a home, we had a couple of cars.  I mean, 'cause father needed one to get back and forth to the store, and mom [Ida Brooks Jenkins] needed hers.  We had a garage and there was an office off the garage.  Actually, it was an apartment where, when I was really young, one of his sisters--my father was one of eleven children, so just the opposite of my mom being an only child.  We had an aunt that used to live in that home, but it was much younger than I can even remember, live in that apartment.  So we got up and went to school.  My elementary school was a block away, so I pretty much walked to Dunbar, Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  And, you know, that was my day.  I'd walk to school and walk home, or sometimes I would walk to the store, I think because I could go down Pine Street and then up Greenwood [Avenue] to the store after, after school.  So I spent a lot of after school time and did my homework, whatever I had or anything at the, at the, at the store, which is where my mom usually was after school because she was one of the people who worked there.  So it was a, it was a pretty simple, simple life.  The father ran a business, operated that business.  My mother taught school when the opportunity was available because she was a substitute teacher at that time.  And then my brother [James Johnson] and I went to, went to school.  It wasn't much more different or exciting from that.  Occasionally we would take trips to visit relatives and exotic places like Claremore [Oklahoma] or Wichita, Kansas.  Woo-hoo (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was gonna say.  Okay.  But really, what you describe is a very middle class life environment.  It's not a lower middle class, it's a, it's very middle class 'cause, you know, teachers were at the top of our society.  You know--
Speaker 2: But she didn't have to work at that time.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean my father--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --was earning enough.  So it definitely would be considered--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --middle, middle class.
Speaker 1: Very, very much.
Speaker 2: We owned our home, owned the home, couple of cars and a business.  I mean, that would definite qualify in any era--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --as a, as a middle class existence (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Story_ID: 661844
Speaker 1: Can you take yourself back, though, to that time and tell me what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of your growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Again, it depends on which chapters you're talking about.
Speaker 1: Before twelve (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There're a couple of different chapters.
Speaker 1: Before twelve, before twelve, before twelve.
Speaker 2: Sure, before twelve.  Pine Street was a pretty business street, so there were a lot of, there was a lot of traffic and--along the streets.  I remember cars going back and forth.  Across the street from us was a home that was owned by a family named the Alexanders [ph.].  They had a daughter who was a little older than I am.  And I remember that at one juncture, they moved their house.  And it was the first occasion where I ever saw a house being moved.  They literally took it off the foundation and moved it outside of town and then they built a small building on that lot, and Mr. Alexander, who I believe was either a doctor or an attorney, built his offices on that, on that lot.  So I remember that, just that day when the house just disappeared, it went up on some stilts and was driven about five or six miles outside of town because he had bought some land.  And, so they had a big plot of land.  We used to go out there for the 4th of July and that's where everybody would set off their fireworks because they had so much, so much land.  And then next door to me was--were the Manns, Mr. and Mrs. Mann.  And if you look back in the Greenwood archives, Mann Grocery [Mann Brothers Grocery Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma] was the big grocery store on Black Wall Street [Greenwood, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  Now I don't have many memories of Mr. Mann because I believe he died when I was relatively young, but Ms. Mann--and I remember that was a huge house, at least as far as I was concerned.  And I just--that but that was right next door to us, and I was often over there.  She had some nieces and nephews who would come visit occasionally and, so whenever they would come by or whenever they would visit, I'd be able to go over there.  But Ms. Mann was very friendly.  Be playing in my yard, balls would often go over the fence and I'd have to go over there and get them.  So it was an interesting neighborhood.  It was, it was, like you said, a middle class black neighborhood where many of the people who were the entrepreneurs of Black Wall Street lived.  My home, our home was a little smaller, almost like a track home and--where you kind of go straight through, but not quite, living room, dining room, kitchen, a back room and a couple of bedrooms off to the side but, you know, we had a nice yard, had a couple of dogs that we kept in the back, dogs named Buddy and Pal.  I mean, when you're eight, how, you know, how creative do you get with pet names.  So it was a nice existence.  And I remember when the first projects were built in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  Today they would be considered townhomes (laughter).  They were, they were relatively nice, I mean, they were basically not so much freestanding, but connected homes with small yards, but it was the first instance of public housing that I remember being built for people who needed that assistance.  A lot of the other time was spent in church, in Sunday school--
Speaker 1: Denomination?
Speaker 2: Methodist, A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].  Vernon A.M.E. Church [Tulsa, Oklahoma].  Reverend Ben Hill was the pastor and another historical, very historical, significant individual in that area.  Did all the things that young people do in the school, you know, participated in, you know, Easter pageants.  And Aunt Bobbie [ph.], again, tells a funny story about my Easter speech, which I had practiced fifty thousand times with her and my mom [Ida Brooks Jenkins] prior to the program on Sunday and then I got on the stage on Sunday and stood there in front of the microphone and said, "I don't know my speech."  And my mother just was incredulous, she was--and Aunt Bobbie, who was the moderator, said, "Yes, you do.  We practiced."  And I said, "Unh-uh, I don't know my speech," (laughter).  And, so, you know, she'll constantly tell that story as well.  And, but grew up in the church.  One of my friends was the son of a subsequent pastor, so I was that kid--he and I were in the back of the church just cutting up, you know, probably would have been thrown out of church today.  But we heard, we heard just enough to where someone asked us what the sermon was about, and we could give two or three lines.  So we avoided total execution for cutting up in church.  We listened just enough, but we had a, we had a good time.  And some of my best friends at that time were friends from church that--and we shared some of the same experiences and the same ideals and certainly the foundation of my faith now is based on those experiences at Vernon A.M.E.
Speaker 1: So you were never an acolyte then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 661845
Speaker 1: Did you grow up--or any time were you--'cause you talk about Black Wall Street and that term even goes back to the Tulsa [Oklahoma] race riots, and were you aware--was there any talk in the town 'cause this may, you know, come much later, of the race riots, of what had happened?
Speaker 2: I didn't really learn about the race riots until later in life.  As you know, there was a conspiracy of silence among black people who were embarrassed by what happened.  And while I was a generation later, there was no discussion about it at all, certainly nothing in the schools and nothing that I heard among people discussing Greenwood [Tulsa, Oklahoma] or anything about that area.  Now of course, by the 1960s, when I was young, Greenwood had been rebuilt to a certain extent.  It was not as vibrant as it had been prior to the race riot and the burning down of many of those two, three hundred businesses that were there.  But it was a perfectly safe and stable area by 1960, '61 [1961], '62 [1962].  Again, churches, restaurants, theatres, clubs, barbershops, law firms, everything was there.  So there were no signs that there had been anything untoward or as tragic as that.  And I can't remember exactly when I learned about it, but it was at least by the time I was a college student [at Stanford University, Stanford, California], if not, if not later.  And I have friends who have now done a film about it, and, of course, it's now in the vernacular of Black Wall Street.  But it's really sad that we missed one or two generations of education about the biggest race riot in American history, which should be a part of the historical record of American history but still is not to the extent that it should.
Speaker 1: Right.  You know, that (cough), that speaks to the cover up and a lot of things, you know, that happened in the black community because, you mention John Rogers [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Jr.] and his family.  I mean, maybe you know this.  I mean, they--his mother [HistoryMaker Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious] (cough)--part of the family, they owned the Stradford Hotel [Tulsa, Oklahoma] and the Stradford library and, you know, then you have, you know, of course, [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin, who's--they're--John's family fled but John Hope Franklin's father [Buck Colbert Franklin] stayed and did a lot of the (mumbles).
Speaker 2: I mean, Black Wall Street and the race riot are a significant part of American history, not just because of what happened, but the enterprise and the reason that enterprise happened in that area and what inspired African Americans to build and to build their own and to own their own in a concept that this is so, unfortunately, unfamiliar to our young people today.  The, and the people that came from there, the professors, the great thinkers, the entrepreneurs, just the, just the good citizens who survived and went on to have families themselves.  Unfortunately, they didn't share the story with those children, and the story died.  That conspiracy of silence because of the embarrassment and the shame, and just the, maybe the shock of what happened and what happened to the two to three hundred black people who were in unmarked graves that they still don't necessarily know where they are.  The fact that you could go into microfilm in the Tulsa World archives and find stories cut out of the paper covering the riots.  So there's no--very little record of it.  I mean, even that in itself is significant.  But it's slowly, slowly being reintroduced to us and to--I guess, the children's children's children's children of Black Wall Street and of all of America.  I think it should be a significant part of any, not just black history curriculum but American curriculum.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 661846
Speaker 1: Let me ask you also because the other saying that Oklahoma is known for, you know, it's a Trail of Tears and the Native American, African American--were there any discussions you heard while growing up about people being, you know, part Native American or, you know, black, Indian relationships?  I mean, was that--
Speaker 2: I mean, it was, it was--the truth is probably just about every black person who grew up in Oklahoma probably had some Native American blood in them.  Of course, the genesis of that is the exodus of slaves from the South who headed west in search of better opportunities, found themselves in this area and ran into these people of color and many have decided to settle there.  So there was intermarrying that began in the, in the 1800s.  And then, as far as I've traced my own family tree, there is Cherokee on my great-grandfather's side.  So it's hard for anybody who grew up in that area not to have some Native American blood in them, which again, is part of the fabric of this nation where everybody is a part of something now.  But that really began as far back in the 1800s, particularly among African Americans and Native Americans.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 661847
Speaker 1: Your elementary school was, you said was--
Speaker 2: Paul Laurence Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Paul Laurence Dunbar.  And then--then where do you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: So this is another chapter.  In seventh grade, I would have gone to George Washington Carver Junior High School [George Washington Carver Middle School] in Tulsa [Oklahoma], which was the black junior high school.  Unfortunately at that time, it did not have a great reputation in terms of safety for students.  And there was a small private school in south Tulsa called Holland Hall, and at the time, I believe it had maybe two or three black kids, one of whom was Sandra Alexander [ph.], the daughter of the Alexanders who used to live across the street from me.  So they asked my parents [Ida Brooks Jenkins and Roy Johnson] had I ever, had they ever thought about sending me to Holland Hall.  Well, long story short, I went out there and tested and ended up getting a scholarship to attend Holland Hall.  So in--I went from an all, pretty much all-black elementary, I think there was maybe one white family and one Asian family, but to a pretty much all-white environment, and the upper middle class, if not upper class area of Tulsa, in the school where, at the time I arrived in seventh grade, I think I may have been the third or fourth black kid to attend the school, and I attended Holland Hall through high school graduation.
Speaker 1: Oh, so it went from seventh to--
Speaker 2: It actually went from kindergarten through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh.
Speaker 2: --twelfth grade, but at the time--
Speaker 1: Rea--
Speaker 2: I didn't start there until seventh grade.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a private school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was a private school.
Speaker 1: It's a private school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Private school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  I didn't, I don't think I under--
Speaker 2: Private school, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't understand that.  Okay.
Story_ID: 661848
Speaker 1: Now what age were you in, in seventh grade?  Are you eleven, twelve--'cause where does that fit with your father's [Roy Johnson] death?
Speaker 2: It was my first year at Holland Hall [Tulsa, Oklahoma] when he died, so I was twelve.  And because I've--this is one of those--you just created an image--I remember, he died on a Sunday.  He actually died on Super Bowl Sunday, the great Joe Namath Super Bowl [Super Bowl III] 'cause we watched the game at the hospital and left and, he died that Sunday.  And then I actually went to school the next day 'cause I didn't just want to sit around the house with people mourning.  But I remember breaking down in class, in one class, and just started crying.  And I think the teacher didn't know what was going on and left, and they finally figured out what had happened.  I can't remember whether they knew or not, but I remember being in class and finally breaking down and having my grief come out after trying to be strong because I was the oldest son, and he'd been sick for a while, so it was not a surprise.  But, so that answers your question, is that I was twelve years old in seventh grade sitting in class.
Speaker 1: So (cough) that's hard to lose your father, I mean, because you're at an age that you're aware.  You're not, like, five years old, but even though he had been sick because there's a reshuffling of things at that point.  So do you remember that, how it changed the family dynamic?
Speaker 2: Well, it certainly changed the family dynamic in that my mother [Ida Brooks Jenkins] had to begin to be the decision maker in the household, and they had a pretty good partnership, but again, he ran a store [Kyle's Sundry Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma], so there were decisions about the store, there were decisions about her vocation and whether she was going to work full time.  Unfortunately, and I think that unfortunately is still the case today, we didn't have the kind of--he didn't leave the kind of life insurance that you are instructed to leave today.  So when he passed away, all we pretty much had were the assets of the business and the home and the cars.  So it wasn't like there was a lot there to continue, continue living, so she had to begin working.  And we had to decide what to do with the store.  I can't remember how long we kept it open before we sold it to someone else.  But mother decided that wasn't something she wanted to do, and I wasn't really old enough to do anything with it at twelve, and it wasn't really something that I wanted to do on a full-time basis anyway.  So it required a lot of significant decisions, just as it would in any home when the, when the breadwinner, winner passes away.  And then she had to become mother to two sons [Johnson and his brother, James Johnson] at critical times in our lives.  I was just about to enter my teen years.  And, but I often say that, and this is part of my faith, is that everybody is here for the time they're supposed to be here and that he had done what he needed to do, and it was time to, for him to move on.  You know, again, I think the lessons that I learned from him still stay with me today, even though I didn't know I was learning them at the time.  They were mostly just by observing and watching and being around him and watching him interact and manage the business and go to church [Vernon A.M.E. Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  He had to leave church a little early to go open the store.  But people tell me that I--some of my attributes come from him.  I didn't see it at that time because you don't know your father as well at twelve years old.  But it was a, it was a difficult time for us, but we got through and, you know, there were no major scars, at least that I, you know, feel right now.  But it was certainly traumatic for anybody to lose their, lose their father at age twelve.
Story_ID: 661849
Speaker 1: I have two follow up questions on that.  One, did you--what attributes did you learn or, you know, you think you learned?  And second, did you feel like a lot of young people, you know, a young man, you know, that you had to step up and be, you know, in his role?
Speaker 2: Fortunately, I had a lot of uncles, some real and some not.  You know, I was actually told he had passed by Uncle Johnny and Uncle Jimmy [James B. Johnson].  Uncle Jimmy was my father's brother, and Uncle Johnny was a family friend, Johnny West [ph.], who--still alive and still, you know, still vibrant.  My mother [Ida Brooks Jenkins] was his daughter's godmother.  So family friends stepped in.  Ike Jenkins [Isaac Jenkins] was a--Uncle Ike at the church [Vernon A.M.E. Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  And later on, Uncle Ike ended up becoming my stepfather, but that's another story (laughter).  But, so they stepped in.  So I didn't, I didn't feel that weight like you might think because there were men in the, in the village, men in the community who made themselves available to myself and my brother [James Johnson] to perhaps take that burden off of the table.  So I don't reme- remember really feeling, feeling that at all.
Story_ID: 661850
Speaker 1: Your brother, he's--is it--he's--is it two years?
Speaker 2: He's three years younger than I am (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Three years younger.  And his name?
Speaker 2: His name is James Marques Johnson [James Johnson].  James after Uncle Jimmy [James B. Johnson], and then Marques after Marques Haynes, who was also Uncle Marques.  I don't know if you know who Marques Haynes is, but he was a Globetrotter.  He was Marques Haynes, who started his own team, the Harlem Magicians, and took the Harlem Magicians around the country and around the world for many, many years.  A very famous--he's in the Basketball Hall of Fame [Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Springfield, Massachusetts].  He was the dribbler.  He was the first--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --classic dribbler that made that move famous among those teams so--
Speaker 1: So you grew up around him then.
Speaker 2: Well, he was on the road most of the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All the time, okay.
Speaker 2: But when he came to town [Tulsa, Oklahoma], he would often come get me, and he would tell me to sit on the bench and be quiet.  So, of course, being the studious, you know, nerd that I was, I had a book--so if you--there's probably no footage of it, but you ever see footage of old Harlem Magicians games, there might be some little kid sitting at the end of the bench with a book and glasses and that would be me, and doing all the tricks and everything.  And I'd seen them enough to where I didn't really pay much attention.  You know, they'd be throwing the bucket of confetti and the ball on the rubber band and all that sort of thing.  But I'm sitting there at the end of the bench with a, with a book.  So, yes, I grew up around that when he would come to town.  I met a lot of the Magicians and some of the Globetrotters, Meadowlark Lemon and others.  But to me, he was just Uncle Marques and was this fun guy to be around.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know because they were--we had such pride in the Harlem Globetrotters.
Story_ID: 661851
Speaker 1: So the thing that I, you know, I want to ask about is (clears throat)--so you're--you described yourself as studious.  So when, you know, earlier, you had said you were traumatized with the (unclear), but you were always a studious child is what you're saying.
Speaker 2: I presume so.  I mean, I got pretty much straight A's through elementary school [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and did well at the private school.  I was not valedictorian or the super, super brains, as I, as I called them.  I did well enough to be able to go to Stanford University [Stanford, California].  First kid from my high school to actually go to Stanford, not because there weren't others who didn't qualify, but because California, of course, was Sodom and Gomorrah back then to anyone from Oklahoma, so the fact that I went to California to college meant that I was probably going to hell as far as most people in Oklahoma were concerned so, but I took the leap and decided that it was where I wanted to go and so far so good (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sorry.  I'm laughing at that.  But I understand.  But tell me your experience at, you know, from seventh--in school, at the private school.  So what was that experience like?  And you said there was one other stu- didn't you say there was one other student?  I mean, how many blacks are there?
Speaker 2: So my experiences from seventh grade through high school at Holland Hall [Tulsa, Oklahoma] were mixed.  I mean, in general (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because this is time of integration, too.
Speaker 2: Right.  This is the time of integration.  This is a school that clearly had a liberal policy and was trying to recruit more minority kids but more meaning one a year.  And by the time I graduated, I think there were seven of us in the high school.  We used to--
Speaker 1: How large was the high school?
Speaker 2: Two hundred and fifty so--
Speaker 1: It's small.
Speaker 2: Small school.  I had fifty-seven in my graduating class, and there was one other, there was a black woman, sister, who was in my class, Cheryl Anderson [ph.].  But it was a, it was a mixed experience.  It was a good experience, a great educational experience.  It was very challenging, great athletic experience.  We had good means.  Some of my best friends today are people that I met and shared that experience with.  At the same time, I had the kinds of experiences that you would expect from--by being nearly the only black person in a school.  Nothing overt in terms of physical attacks or confrontations, but dating was certainly a challenge.  Either I dated girls from my neighborhood and would take them out to parties and events like proms and things from out on the south side, which was difficult and challenging for then because going to the south side was just like going, you know, out to Siberia or something.  And, but when I tried to date among my classmates and, you know, there was some resistance sometimes, not just among the girls, but their parents.  And these were parents who were upstanding members of the community, businesspeople and politicians and things like that.  So it was very, it was very challenging on that front.  On one occasion, one of the--I had--a woman had actually asked me to take her to the prom.  But on the night before, she had to call me 'cause her father told her that she could not go with me.  And I felt worse for her.  I mean, I--at this point, I probably wasn't surprised.  I was almost surprised that we were going to go and, you know, her father ended up being the head of the board of trustees for the school.  And the person--so we were probably in ninth, tenth grade at the time.  So this was years later.  And at graduation, he was the man who handed students their diplomas and shook their hands, and I told the teachers or whoever it was orchestrating graduation that I was not going to shake his hand, and I told them why.  And, so they arranged for--I was getting another award--for me to get my diploma from someone else during graduation so that I did not have to shake this gentleman's hand 'cause I just wasn't going to do that.
Story_ID: 661852
Speaker 1: On one other occasion, I think I was running for class president, maybe my sophomore year.  And the school [Holland Hall, Tulsa, Oklahoma] was a very open school, so much so that we didn't have locks on lockers, I mean, it was, it was that kind of a school.  And, so one day I opened my locker and there was a note there, and it was a piece of paper, it had the noose, hangman's noose and some words on it and says, "We don't want no nigger as class president."  I said, "Okay, what am I going to do with this?"  I mean, obviously, no one had the guts to tell me in person, so I took it to one of teachers, confidante teachers, the English teacher, Mr. Sloan [Ted Sloan], who was very eccentric and liked to use a lot of different things to his teaching tools, not just books but real life experiences.  So we talked about it and went through the school, and, you know, we handled it.  Didn't know who sent it, but I didn't really care.  I mean, it wasn't like I felt threatened or anything.  And he asked me if he could use it for a class experiment.  I said sure.  So our finals each year he would--for part of the essay, he would always put a photograph up on the board and then give us half an hour to just write, you know, whatever the photograph--it could be a sign, it could be anything.  So that year for our final, when it flashed up on the board, it was the note.  And he told me years later that he thought he knew who wrote it based on the essays that were done that day.  I didn't ask him 'cause it really didn't matter to me but, you know.  So those were a couple of the experiences I had, but those were isolated.  I mean, dating is dating.  It's traumatic when you're a teenager, no matter what.  And, you know, the gutless note writer, you know, has gone into the abyss somewhere.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So all in all it was a great experience.  I would not have gone to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] probably had I not been at that school, which expanded my horizons.  Booker T. Washington's [Booker T. Washington High School] a great high school in Tulsa [Oklahoma] and on the north side, but they weren't sending kids to California.  They weren't sending, sending kids to the East Coast at the time.  Now they are.  But I'm grateful for my experiences there and have remained affiliated and associated with the school.
Speaker 2: So what is your mother [Ida Brooks Jenkins]--what did she say about the, you know, the instances at the school or the dating or--what is the messaging?  Is she messaging, bring me home a black girl or is there none of that messaging going on?
Speaker 1: It really wasn't any of that messaging that I can recall, you know.  Again, she was relatively quiet and I didn't necessa- I don't know if I necessarily shared everything--
Speaker 2: With her.
Speaker 1: --with her.  You know, I didn't, I didn't go to her and tell her what happened all the time.  I mean, I'm a, I'm a boy, I can take care of myself.  I'm not going to go run to my mommy and tell her that, you know, some guy was mean to me.  I'm not--that wasn't, that wasn't me so, and she was, you know, she struggled to raise boys.  I used--as we got older, as I got older, I used to challenge her to say the word sex.  I mean, just never--I don't think I ever heard the word sex come out of her mouth.  I would try to trick her, I would try to give her quizzes or, you know, word things, and I don't think I ever got that woman to say the word sex.  So, no, we did not have too many dating questions.
Story_ID: 661853
Speaker 1: So when did Ike Jenkins [Isaac Jenkins], when did he come into the picture (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he was always in the picture because--
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: Now again I believe he was, he was at my baptism.  There's a picture of me as a baby, and I think he's there somewhere.  So he was always Uncle Ike, and his wife was Aunt Cordelia [Cordelia Patton Jenkins].  And Aunt Cordelia died.  I do kind of remember that and then my father [Roy Johnson] died.  And, so then they began this very cute thing where, you know, "Mr. Jenkins is just going to give me a ride to the church [Vernon A.M.E. Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma]."  And I remember thinking after about the third or fourth time, I was like, okay.  That's your story and you're sticking to it.  Okay.  Go right ahead.  So it would start by catching a ride to the, to the church for meetings and that sort of thing.  And when I was a freshman at college [Stanford University, Stanford, California], he asked me if I minded if I married his mom [sic.].  And I said, "No, if I can have your car," 'cause I wanted a car.  And, so he was one of those men who bought a new car every two years.  You go to the same Ford dealership and just got Fords every year, every two years.  So it was--I think the two years was up.  And he had, he had this LTD [Ford LTD] with motorized seats.  Now you talking about motorized seats in 1974 and a, you know, just a nice vinyl top.  I wanted that LTD.  I was going to be a sophomore in college.  So we made a deal.  I basically traded my mom [Ida Brooks Jenkins] for a car, and I don't think she found this out for many, many years.  We both decided to keep it secret.  But I gave my blessing to the marriage in exchange for an LTD.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So he became an okay guy.
Speaker 2: (Gives thumbs up) Uncle Ike was all right with me.
Story_ID: 661854
Speaker 1: So what is your brother [James Johnson] like?  And, you know, how is he different from you?
Speaker 2: My brother was much quieter than I am and remains so to this day.  He actually still lives in Tulsa [Oklahoma], married.  I have a niece whose name is Hope [ph.], and he works for a company called Hilti [Hilti North America] in customer service.  So he never really left Tulsa, and I couldn't get out of Tulsa fast enough, had great people there, great friends, supported in a lot of parts of the community, given some scholarship money by local organizations, but if I could have gone to the University of Hawaii [University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii], I was trying to get as far away from Oklahoma as possible, maybe not totally intentionally, but didn't apply to any schools in Oklahoma.  The closest college I applied to was SMU [Southern Methodist University] in Dallas [Texas], and that's because I was a baseball player, and they offered me a, potentially a baseball scholarship.  But I was looking at least a couple of hundred miles away from Tulsa 'cause I guess I just knew in my gut that, at that time, was not the place to be for ambitious, relatively loud black man.  And, so I was off to California to try to find the place and space that was right for me.
Story_ID: 661855
Speaker 1: So obviously baseball you have affinity to.  Did you ever run track or do football?
Speaker 2: I think, if you're a kid in Oklahoma, you played football.  So I played football through my sophomore year when I suffered a separated shoulder.  So baseball and soccer were the two sports I played.  Once again, a private school [Holland Hall, Tulsa, Oklahoma], we were the first school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Soccer was new.
Speaker 2: --first schools that had soccer and our--the schools we played were in Texas, Kansas and Missouri.  So I got to travel quite bit, you know, travel.  Again back in that time that was quite a bit of travel to just play other, other teams, the teams in our league, this private school league were in those four, those four states.  So baseball was my primary sport, soccer and then, and then football.
Story_ID: 661856
Speaker 1: Now what, what about academic interests.  What were you good at?  Were you on the English, literature side or were you on the, were you on the math and science side?  What were you--
Speaker 2: Ironically, I was better at math than English.  I mean, I wasn't bad at English, but I was pretty good at math, but I had no interest in pursuing any kind of career that was math oriented.  And I mean, and I do believe that God leads you in certain directions, and I clearly had an affinity for writing.  I was editor of the junior high paper [at George Washington Carver Junior High School; George Washington Carver Middle School, Tulsa, Oklahoma] and became editor of the high school paper [at Holland Hall, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  And while there was no real path, at least in my mind, for African Americans in that vocation, it was clearly something that I liked to do and seemed to have a bit of a gift for it.  What I wanted to do was to be an attorney.  You know, that was something that was real.  I mean, there were black attorneys on Wall Street.  And my icon was Perry Mason.  That's who I was going to be.  I was going to go off to school--I used to watch Perry Mason, dude never lost a case.  I was going to be that guy who got up in the courtroom and, you know, sifted through all of the madness to find out the truth.  So I went off to college [Stanford University, Stanford, California] to major in political science with the hope and desire of becoming an attorney. God had other ideas.
Story_ID: 661857
Speaker 1: It's time for you to go off to college and, so what are your choices?  Where--what are you thinking that you want to apply to?  And where do you apply?
Speaker 2: I was very fortunate to get into pretty much every school I applied to and I got waitlisted at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So I had a lot of choices.  I narrowed it down to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  Similar schools but opposite coasts, opposite environment.  But I couldn't afford to go visit either one, so all I had to go on was literature.  Of course, there was no Internet, there was no searching, so the literature that the schools sent.  So one day I said, "Okay, today, I'm going to decide."  Pretty much had the equal economic financial aid package from both, so it was a wash as to which one I went to.  So I put the Penn stuff over here and I put the Stanford stuff over here and I flipped a coin, came up Penn.  So I looked at the Penn stuff and studied the catalogs and the curriculum and thought about could I see myself there.  And it was an Ivy League school.  I mean it was very nice.  I mean, ivy covered walls and Ben Franklin [Benjamin Franklin] and all that stuff.  So it was okay, that's cool.  Reached over to the Stanford pile and the first catalog had a girl in a bikini top sitting in front of the library, and I pretty much decided to go to Stanford at that point.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Marketing 101.  I guess that was my first real experience with sophisticated marketing.
Story_ID: 661858
Speaker 1: So what is the school that you, do you remember your first day on campus and the school that you, you know, what is the school that you come--'cause the--you're--you've been in--well, Stanf- I mean, Oklahoma, I consider it the Midwest sort of.  I mean, I don't know, you know.  But that--it's much different, environment.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember that day tremendously well.  I remember going to the airport [Tulsa International Airport, Tulsa, Oklahoma].  Again, you know, my parents [Ida Brooks Jenkins and Johnson's stepfather, Isaac Jenkins] couldn't afford to go, so I got on a plane by myself.  A friend of mine from school [Holland Hall, Tulsa, Oklahoma], one of my dear friends still today, wanted to come see me off, but she was late.  And I remember just by getting on the train, she comes running down the airport like O.J. Simpson and, you know, gives me a hug goodbye and get on the plane, and we go to Dallas [Texas] and ended up picking up some people, some of whom were also kids and their parents, everybody else was with their parents going out to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] the first day.  And then back then when you landed, there was somebody there right at the gate.  You can't do that anymore.  Somebody with a sign, you know, the happy, vibrant Stanford student welcome, and they had your name and they had your picture.  You get off the plane and--, "Roy [HistoryMaker Roy Johnson]," and I'm like who knows me?  And there's this person and they take you and they whisk you off and they put you on a bus and they drive you to your dorm.  And I'd never--I think I'd been to California once, maybe Los Angeles, but I'd never been to San Francisco [California].  We land in San Francisco, bussed down to Palo Alto [California] on campus.  So my eyes were just totally wide opened.  Palm trees and beautiful sky.  And I was looking for the girl in the bikini top but anyway, we get to the freshman dorm and, of course, they had to memorize your pictures and your names.  So you get off the bus and you hear your name called and, you know, everything is exciting.  You go up to your room and you meet your roommate.  My roommate's name was Gary Shamshoian, who was from Ar- an Armenian family but lived pretty much down the street from Stanford.  They liked to pair California kids with non-California kids at that time.  And that was, that was the beginning of it.  And it was a coed dorm, all the dorms at Stanford were coed back then, which today it's pretty much everywhere.  But back then again that was pretty radical.  There was one all-female dorm for those parents who just absolutely refused to allow their daughters to stay in a coed dorm.  What they didn't know was that it was adjacent to all these coed dorms and there were no locks.  So it really didn't matter (laughter) where they--but that was the trick, was that--well, you're in an all-female dorm.  It was a great experience.  It was a great day.  I ended up meeting people that some of, some of whom I still am connected with and who went on to do great things.  We ended up having an Olympic swimmer and doctors and all kinds of people, and, of course, we were all just crazy freshmen.  At that time, it was an all-freshmen dorm and did all the things that freshmen were supposed to do, which I will not absolutely share under any coercion with you.  But it was a great, a great time, beginning of a great experience.
Story_ID: 661859
Speaker 1: So what is the, the racial breakdown?  I mean, how many--are there many blacks at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] at the time?  Is it under, like--is it approaching 10 percent or is it less than that?
Speaker 2: It was less than that at that time.  Stanford was going through a transition itself in terms of its minority enrollment.  We were--I would say we were the second or third wave of African American students.  Now the first wave was really more like a trickle.  It's two or three students that came in probably in the--well, there were, there were, there had been some there for years.  I mean, there was at least one there back in the '20s [1920s], but in terms of significant numbers, maybe more than a dozen, you're talking about in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s].  Then of course, you have the turmoil in America around change and integration, which prompted those schools that were open to change to begin to open their doors and do more reaching out to black students to try to get them to come.  We had a black theme house, so there were enough there to fill the black theme house.  I didn't live in it, but Ujamaa came into being when I was there between '74 [1974] and '78 [1978], and it's still in existence today.  So it was--I would say it was probably around 7 percent, but it was enough to--we were there.  I mean, there was no time where I could look around and not see black students.  In my dorm, there were probably five or six out of maybe forty to fifty.  So that's about the ratio throughout the school.
Speaker 1: And this is 1974--
Speaker 2: This was 1974.
Speaker 1: --four [1974] that you start?  Now the, so are the black students like you or are--there is a mix.  Are they like you that they've been at a private school or are they--
Speaker 2: They were mixed.
Speaker 1: It was mixed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There was just as much of a mix as the white students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were from all parts of the country, they were from all kinds of experiences, they were from, you know, different types of schools and families, you know, single parent, you know, poor households to some who had been part military families, some whose families had, whose parents had been doctors and wanted to send their kids there or some other, you know, highly successful professional vocation.  So there were a mix of us there, and it was good because we all were teaching each other about different experiences that we had.  You know, one of my classmates was [HistoryMaker] Valerie Jarrett who, of course, is now one of the most influential people in this, in this country because of her status with President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  But she was, she was part of our freshman class, and there was many others who've gone on to do successful things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forgot that she was there at that time.  That's right, okay.  'Cause she had, yeah, 'cause she had lived in Iraq--Iran, Iran.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was in places I couldn't pronounce--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: So she actually--her family missed the Civil Rights Movement.  But I mean, at that time--I mean, they were out of the country.
Story_ID: 661860
Speaker 1: I want to ask you 'cause, you know, so you're a political science major.  Where are you spending your summers?  Are you going back to Tulsa [Oklahoma]?  Or are you, you know, progressively doing other things during--
Speaker 2: I spent my first summer after my freshman year back in Tulsa and did an internship at the Tulsa Daily World newspaper [Tulsa World].  So that's where I worked most of that summer.  But after my sophomore and junior years, I stayed in California and worked at an advertising agency, McCann Erickson [McCann Erickson, Inc.], which taught me that I didn't want to go into advertising.  I had a couple of interesting experiences there 'cause in--the advertising industry didn't know what to do with black people at that time, and this was around the Bill Cosby, Del Monte [Del Monte Foods, Inc.] era, when, you know, there were just a few people of color in ads.  And I remember one, and I won't name the wine, they had two different types of wine.  They had their high end wine and then they had their party wine.  Now the commercial that they were shooting for the high end wine was, you know, your daughter just got home from law school, you just made partner.  Let's toast the night with this particular wine.  Of course, these were all white families.  The party wine, there were black people dancing and all kinds of stuff, and this was the worst, cheapest wine you could find, but these people on private planes supposedly partying with this cheap wine, and I had the audacity as an intern to actually raise my hand and ask during--I said, you know, "Why were there no black people in the daughter gets home from law school, you just made partner series of commercials?"  And one of the people from the agency turned to me and said, "Because blacks don't drink good wine."  I said, "Oh, okay."  So I made it a point--I love great wines today, and I studied wine and, now I make it a point to at least do my part to change that.  But it turned me off to the advertising industry.  That was just one story, but that wasn't where I was supposed to be anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So you had numerous experiences like that during the summer or was that just one?
Speaker 2: That was just one.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I had a good time.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: I took the train up from Palo Alto [California], stayed on campus [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and then worked in the city.
Speaker 1: So what did you do your third summer?
Speaker 2: I can't remember--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's okay.
Story_ID: 661861
Speaker 1: So what are you thinking you're--you said you were thinking law school, so when did you stop thinking law school because--
Speaker 2: I still haven't stopped thinking law school.  I majored in journalism, but I min- I majored in political science, but I minored in communications.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So again I worked for The Stanford Daily newspaper.  I was a newscaster and a deejay at KZSU Radio station [Stanford, California].  I actually covered the Patty Hearst trial [United States v. Hearst] in San Francisco [California] for The Stanford Daily, and had a fairly unique experience because there were assigned seats, there were only so num- a certain number of assigned seats.  And, so there was a lottery to get those seats, and Stanford Daily won one of the lottery seats.  But in order to keep it, you had to be there every day.  So myself and another writer switched off going out to San Francisco every day, and I almost, I did almost flunk out of school [Stanford University, Stanford, California], but it was tough because I was still going to school to cover that trial.  And I got to see F. Lee Bailey--
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: --who was really the Johnnie Cochran of that era, very flamboyant defense attorney, who defended Patty Hearst, and I got to watch him up close.  But my seat was in between two very prestigious journalistic institutions, New York Times, and I remember the reporter being--gentleman, gray hair, gray suit, gray everything and Rolling Stone--
Speaker 1: Whoa.
Speaker 2: --and that person was pretty much high every day (laughter).  So (laughter) so that was one of my introductions to sort of the yin and yang of journalism was sitting in the courtroom between the gray man over here and the high man over here.  I found my niche somewhere in between.
Speaker 1: That was exciting to have been--that case was so, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the trial of the century.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was before O.J. [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] and before many of the trials that make headlines today.  So I mean, it truly was the, it was the heiress to the Hearst fortune was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army and forced to commit a bank robbery and all sorts of other things and was brought to trial because of it, and ultimately was found not guilty.  But it was a great experience to be able to cover that and solidified my belief that I want to be an attorney.  Unfortunately, I didn't quite know that the--my path was really leading more towards in between The New York Times and Rolling Stone as opposed to F. Lee Bailey.
Speaker 1: So what year were you in school?  At that point, were you in your junior year or sophomore?
Speaker 2: It was sophomore year probably (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow.  That's pretty amazing but that case went on for a long time.
Speaker 2: It did.  It went on for a while.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So I spent pretty much a semester driving back and forth.  Again, it was every other day.  So it was either two days a week or three days a week I'd spend a day in the courtroom.
Story_ID: 661862
Speaker 1: So what else do you think was significant about your college experience?
Speaker 2: Well, it was also the, really the--the time when apartheid came into being.  So we were one of the first campuses to protest the university's investments in South Africa.  And if you seen the movie 'Mandela' ['Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom'] that came out, you see footage of student protests.  I mean, that was really the teeth of my period there.  And, so there were protests on campus, and many of us were arrested because, you know, we were arrested and taken to the student police thing and then released, and you know, I don't even think they took down our names.  But it was, and it began--I remember that day, it began as a simple sit-in in one of the main offices to protest the university's investments in South Africa.  And I was there as a journalist [for The Stanford Daily], so I had one foot as a journalist and one foot as a protester.  And then they decided to lock the building and people wouldn't leave.  And it escalated to the--it didn't begin as a sit-in.  It just be- began as something innocent, and certainly it didn't begin as something that would end up on the nightly news, which it did.  I think if you look back, that was really one of the first significant college campus protests regarding university investment in South Africa.  It happened on the campus at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and, of course, we all know what transpired from there.  It became a national issue, a global issue that ultimately led to the downfall of apartheid and release of Nelson Mandela.
Speaker 1: You know what's also I have a question about and that is the relationship between Stanford and Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] because, you know, you have Haight-Ash- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What school?  Berk--what?  What was it?  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know that, but I mean there was a lot of activism going over on the, you know, the Oakland [California] campus.
Speaker 2: Particularly in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --prior, prior to my arrival (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prior to--well, probably prior.
Speaker 2: The generation in the '60s [1960s]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that was there before I was there.  That was really the height of, sort of the student protests, and again they were protesting, protesting racism, they were protesting sexism.  You know, it was free love, free speech.  And it was that era, which was a great era, that was, you know, the drug era, the open sex era.  I mean, it was really the era when America opened up.  It was forced to open up and to explore itself in a lot of new ways because of these students, many of, many of whom had brain damage for years to come (laughter).
Speaker 1: They did.  There was a lot going over there on that--Haight-Ashbury [San Francisco, California] and things, okay.
Story_ID: 661863
Speaker 1: When you graduate then--'cause you got hired at Sports Illustrated, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And, so (background noise)--oh, sorry.  So what are you, what are you--how did that happen?  I guess it's what I'm saying 'cause--
Speaker 2: So I'm getting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't hear--do you ever apply to law school?
Speaker 2: So I get out of college [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and decide that I wanted to try this journalism thing for a year or two before going to law school.  I think I applied to a couple of law schools, but I was, you know, put that hold and see what transpired.  I had an offer to--I had two--ended up getting two job offers.  I think I applied to every journalistic entity.  I think my resume is probably on a, in a dusty file somewhere at probably every newspaper and television station in America because I think I sent one to every--each one.  But I ultimately end up getting--got two job offers.  One was to be a reporter at the Tulsa Daily World [Tulsa World], where I would have been the first black reporter in 1978.  The other was to be a researcher at Sports Illustrated.  So you can imagine how long I thought about this, about a nanosecond and accepted the offer to come to New York [New York], where I've maybe been--well, I came for the job interview, and they brought me out twice for interviews.  Again this--there were not a lot of people of color at Sports Illustrated or Time Inc. at the time.  In fact, they sent me out to lunch with a woman by the name of Joy Wansley, who was a writer at People magazine, an African American woman, and we've remained in touch ever since and also introduced me two people at Sports Illustrated.  One was Roger Jackson, who was also a fact checker and Wilmer Ames [Wilmer Ames, Jr.], who was a fact checker.  And of course Wilmer Ames went on to become the founding editor of Emerge magazine.  And he worked at Time for a while.  So those were the only two people that I recall being at Time Inc., people of color, when I arrived in 1978.
Speaker 1: So this was like a plum, I mean a plum job because every man on the face of the earth (laughter), you know, read Sports Illustrated.
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting, it was--I didn't cover sports a lot in college [for The Stanford Daily], a lot, in part because I was an athlete, and a lot of my friends were athletes and they were bigger than I was.  So I didn't want to get into too much criticism with people who were a lot bigger than I was.  But I had fun with it occasionally writing about football and some of the other sports.  But I mainly covered politics and covered business.  I didn't, I didn't think of myself as a sportswriter.  And when they brought me out, I was actually brought out by Time Inc.  Gosh, I wish I could remember Fred's [ph.] last name.  He was the head of diversity at Time Inc. at the time, and somehow my resume ended up on his desk, and he brought me out for an interview and had me interview with every magazine.  So within two days, I interviewed with Time, People, Money, Fortune and Sports Illustrated and ended up meeting the top editors for all of those magazines.  Now this was an entry level position, and I met with the editor of Time magazine.  I met with the editor of, the editor of Sports Illustrated was out of town, so I met with his deputy.  I met with the top editor at Fortune magazine.  I mean, I guess they were really being very careful about a young black kid that they were bringing in because that was truly an entry level, fact checking job.  And it was a dizzying amount of interviews that left me very drained at the end.  I think the last one I interviewed with were Sports Illustrated.  And as Fred put me in the car, the taxi, on the way to the airport, he said, "Well, if you had your choice, which of these magazines would you work for?"  And I just said, "Sports Illustrated," because I was tired and it was the last one that I had interviewed with.  And that's where he went back and ultimately made it happen.
Story_ID: 661864
Speaker 1: So what is the organization you come into at that point, and how many are, how many fact checkers, entry level fact checkers do they have?
Speaker 2: There were at least a dozen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --fact checkers.  And it was a significant enterprise, obviously.  It was, it was the time, you know, the largest sports brand in the country and as you mentioned, a dream job for most men.  And it was, it was great.  It was--their system was the writers would write stories and they would be turned in and then a fact checker would go over everything from, you know, the color of the door [sic.] that the person drove to statistics.  And it was our job not to just check them in a library but to call the subject back and to get them on the phone to go over the facts with them.  You didn't go over quotes, but you went over facts.  And, so I remember being scared to death to talk to Tom Seaver, who was the big star pitcher for the, I believe, the Mets [New York Mets] at the time.  But you gave me a number at the stadium, they said, "Ask for this number, ask for that number."  All of the sudden the phone rings in the locker room and I ask to speak to Tom Seaver.  And Tom Seaver gets on the phone.  I mean, that would never happen today.  And met many top athletes just through that, through the telephone and fact checking articles, and all were very, very cordial and were pleased that somebody would actually take the time to do that.  So it was a great opportunity to read great writing from top writers, to understand how important it was to just be factually correct and then to get used to talking to people that were considered big stars and to be able to feel comfortable interviewing them and being in that, in that environment.  So I was a fact checker for a couple of years before I--about and a half, before I started writing stories.  Ended up writing a story, my first story in Sports Illustrated was about a gentleman by the name of Kenny Monday, who was from Tulsa [Oklahoma] and was a star wrestler.  Matter of fact, he was an Olympian and a top Olympic wrestler at that, at that time.  So ended up writing a story about him.  I had two stories in the same issue.  One was about Kenny Monday and the other was about Bill Cartwright, who was a star player who in any other year would have been Rookie of Year, but he happened to be in the same class with a couple of guys named Bird [Larry Bird] and Magic [Magic Johnson].  So those were two stories and my first stories in SI, and they appeared in the same issue.
Speaker 1: So (cough) what were you learning about, the world of journalism, you know, 'cause you've been working in journalism all this time.  Were you pa- impatient during those, any of those two years to get, you know, to be able to do your first stories?
Speaker 2: Of course.  I'm still impatient.  Patience is something I had to embrace later in life.  I mean, like any young, ambitious person, I wanted to, and felt I was ready for the next level.  But I always had to figure my way--to make the way myself as opposed to some of my colleagues who were kind of pushed on the way.  I've had many jobs throughout my career and often felt I had to move out to move up and later on de- really developed the strategy for coming up with a timeframe and feeling as if I didn't move as quickly as I felt I should, then I would have to start exploring outward and finding that promotion at another entity so--
Speaker 1: Right.  Because, you really, you had--in those day--let me ask you.  So do you know if you came through any special program at all?  Or I mean, how did you end up meeting--was that typical, that everyone met with all those editors?
Speaker 2: Oh, I doubt it was typical.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Again, there was affir- an affirmative action officer.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: There are no more affirmative action officers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're diversity--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --officers.  But there was a, there was an affirmative action officer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that was his job, to find talented, you know, potentially, you know, solid journalists for the magazines at that company.  So I give the company credit for having that person there and giving him the latitude to bring a kid in from California who didn't have enough clothes for two days of interviews and actually buying me a jacket and a shirt and tie for the second day 'cause I was planning for one day of interviews but it ended up being, being two.  So, no, that was not typical, but in an era, the post-civil rights era, when affirmative action wasn't a bad word, a bad phrase, it was something that companies like Time Inc. did.
Story_ID: 661865
Speaker 1: Were other of your class or whatever, entering class--did they find mentors and were you having difficulty finding someone who would, who would sort of mentor you along or not?  You're shaking your head (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know if the word mentor existed back then.  It wasn't a conscious thing that I did.  However, I did have mentors.  People who played that role, who took an interest in me and my career and who offered advice and counsel and pushed me towards opportunities when it was, when they could and when it was convenient for them.
Speaker 1: So who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: Well, one was Sandy--gentleman by the name of Sandy Padwe, who was a senior editor, I believe, at Sports Illustrated when I arrived there.  He left after my first couple of years and became a deputy sports editor at The New York Times and was the primary reason that I was given the opportunity to interview for a position at The Times and was ultimately hired there three years after, after being at Sports Illustrated.  I was hired to cover the New Nets--New Jersey Nets [Brooklyn Nets] beat 'cause the Nets were moving to the Meadowlands [Meadowlands Sports Complex, East Rutherford, New Jersey], closer to the city, so The New York Times was hiring its first full-time beat writer to cover the New Jersey Nets.  And, so I was given that opportunity by Sandy, and he has remained a mentor and a, and a counsel.  He's now a professor at Columbia University [New York, New York].  And then there were people along the way.  John Papanek was another, who was a writer.  He was one of the writers that I fact checked at that time.  He ultimately moved on and rose to become managing editor of Sports Illustrated and was there during some of my later tenures.  He was actually the managing editor on the day that I learned that Magic [Magic Johnson] was HIV positive [human immunodeficiency virus] before the press conference.  And of course, there was no email, there was no text messages, there was nothing.  Everybody was out to lunch, and I remember running up and down the hall trying to find somebody to tell what I knew, and my boss was out to lunch (laughter).  So I couldn't tell anybody that I had this relative exclusive that--of course, we couldn't break because there was nowhere to break it.  We were a weekly magazine. So, but John Papanek was the managing editor at that time.
Story_ID: 661866
Speaker 1: I read where you said, "I was treated fairly enough, though I didn't always agree with others' assessments.  Their perspective honestly helped to propel me.  I saw further."  But what do you mean by that?  So is that your impatience, you now, or is that your assessment of your experience at, you know, at Sports Illustrated, at The Times [The New York Times]?
Speaker 2: I think it was probably a little of both.  I think any, any person who aspires toward a higher position, when someone says you're not ready or maybe not as good as you need to be, there's probably a journal of truth--or a kernel of truth in that, but you're not always going to agree.  Now you may take steps to try to change that.  But I don't feel like I was always treated fairly there.  I think others were given opportunities that I was not given without the kinds of experiences and the kinds of relationships and the kinds of things that I had done.  But that was, you know, that's the journalism industry.  It's still--especially the magazine industry, it's still, you know, one of the whitest and most segregated industries.  Most of the people of color who work in the industry work at publications or brands that are aimed at--targeted towards people of color.  So despite the journey that I've had in magazines and newspapers, I didn't always feel--I felt that there were people who were less talented who ultimately were given opportunities at higher levels.  But, you know, look, everybody's journey is different.  I've learned not to hold it against anyone.  My path is the one that was meant for me, and I've had some great experiences, and I'm still having them.
Story_ID: 661867
Speaker 1: How do you end up--does your, one of your mentors, Sandy, I think it is--
Speaker 2: Sandy Padwe?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Does he call you and say, "I have this job," or what are, what--how does The New York Times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The New York Times?  Oh, absolutely, yes.  I received a call from Sandy saying that we're going to, they were going to hire a beat writer for the New Jersey Nets [Brooklyn Nets] and, you know, wanted to know if I was interested in applying, and I did.  Of course, The Times, you know, another prestigious brand.  And at the time, The Times really didn't acknowledge the sports department on the same level as others.  You know, we were kind of the toy store down there.  But the interview process was great, and I ended up interviewing with Abe Rosenthal [A.M. Rosenthal], who was The Times, the editor--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --of The New York Times, and I believe--you know how these interview processes go, usually by the time you get to that point, unless you walk in there with no pants, you pretty much have the job, and it's less of an interview than hearing a talk about The Times, which was great.  I mean, I kept waiting for him to ask me a question, and I can't remember if he actually did.  But I heard many stories about the time when it was, told what it was like to be a Timesman, and at the end of it, he just stood up and shook my hand and said, "Welcome to The Times."  And I went back to the sports department, and Sandy and his boss looked at me and said, "Well?"  And I said, "Well, what?  I mean, he shook my hand."  And he said, "Well, did you get the job?"  He was asking me if I got the job.  I said, "I think so.  He said, 'Welcome to The Times.'"  So that was how that went down.  But--
Speaker 1: That's exciting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, it was, it was nice to have that as part of the process.  I don't if it still is.  But it was, it was pretty heady stuff for a kid not too many years out of Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Right 'cause at this point, you're what, twenty-five, maybe?
Speaker 2: So this would have been 1982.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 661868
Speaker 1: So did they have a certain way of doing things at The Times or was that not the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.  We didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know what kind of things you're talking about--
Speaker 1: Well, I mean a certain, a cert--
Speaker 2: --but whatever things you're talking about The Times had its way--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of doing it.
Speaker 1: I mean, a certain way--yeah.  I talked to someone who was, you know, way later coming in, and she said, not--but I've talked to other Times reporters that said that they have a certain way of--
Speaker 2: Wri- writing--
Speaker 1: --writing.
Speaker 2: --writing style--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --a certain way of, you know, for attributions.  But again we were, we were the sports department, and I think we had a role in sort of changing things a little bit.  I mean, you couldn't always just do who, what, why, when and where in the first sentence, you know.  The, you know, Bernard King scored twenty-five points to lead the New York Knicks to a 105, 103 win over the Kansas City Kings [Sacramento Kings] last night at Madison Square Garden [New York, New York], period, graph.  Ugh.  You know (laughter)?  So I had many head butts with an editor trying to change that formula.  Yeah, I remember one story when I tried to use humor throughout the story in my own quirky way, and I remember being told, "There's no room for humor at The New York Times."  So of course, a lot of that has changed, but The Times definitely had its way of, of doing things.
Story_ID: 661869
Speaker 1: So who was there beside- you know, in the rest--that is black at the time?  Who's there at the time?  Do you know or you were in, sort of in your own enclave there?
Speaker 2: Because--I didn't spend much time in the office because I was out covering events (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --and covering teams.  I was at practices.  I was rarely in the office, so I didn't, I didn't have the kinds of associations at the paper [The New York Times]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that those reporters and editors would have who were there every day.  And that was unfortunate because there were some great people there at the time that I later learned about and later learned about me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because of my byline and things like that.  But I rarely was in the office and, so didn't, didn't have the same office dynamic experience as, as others.
Story_ID: 661870
Speaker 1: What did you think was significant, though, about the--your time there 'cause you were there, you said, for three? No.  You were there for three years?
Speaker 2: I was there from 1982 to 1987.  So I was there for five--
Speaker 1: Five years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) five years.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Speaker 2: The--a lot of things significant about it.  You know, covering a beat, covering a major sports beat, being on the road, understanding that dynamic, meeting deadlines in an era that was right at the beginning of the digital age.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, there's a photograph that I have in my office at home of me getting off a plane carrying this thing, and there was a tall guy next to me, his name was Truck Robinson, he played for the Phoenix Suns.  So I was traveling with the team and my kids [Edwyn Johnson and Anna Johnson] were younger at the time, and they said, "Daddy, what's that?"  And I said, "It's a typewriter."  And they said, "What's a typewriter?"  So that was the beginning of it, and by the end we were carrying these big boxy things with small screens that would, of course, die and lose your story about every two hours.  Kaypro [Kaypro Corporation]--sort of the first portable computers.  So it was a period where I had to learn--the technology was starting to invade and help us in terms of transmission of stories.  We learned to meet deadlines, you know, the discipline of writing was good.  I mean, I was able to forge my own writing style even in the midst of the discipline that The Times [The New York Times] required.  I always think it's good to have that foundation and discipline before you move off to create your own, your own voice and just the world travel.  I mean, I went to Europe to cover European championships, I covered the French Open [Paris, France] and Wimbledon [The Championships, Wimbledon, London, England] and had a, just a lot of great travel experiences and being on the road with athletes.  I was pretty much their age, too, so it was, it was unique in that I was with people that were largely my peers, you know.  Young black men in their twenties and a lot of white athletes, too, but the NBA [National Basketball Association] was changing.  It was the era of Dr. J [Julius Erving] and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and then, of course, Bird [Larry Bird] and Magic [Magic Johnson] came along.  So it was, it was an exciting time to be covering the NBA, which was not a prime beat for a lot of newspapers and that's one area where a lot of black sportswriters were given the opportunity to become beat writers because it was not the sexy beat at the time.  That was baseball, of course, and then the NFL [National Football League].  You know, there were hardly any major baseball African American beat reporters.  One or two in Boston [Massachusetts], ironically.  But not elsewhere in the country and the NFL, the same thing.  So most of us, this first generation wave of African American sportswriters, not first generation but wave as opposed to a trickle, came up through the NBA and really grew with the NBA in popularity.  And in the first couple years covering the sport, the NBA finals were on tape delay.  They weren't even on live when they were played.  So a lot has happened since then, but it provided a great opportunity for many of us to hone our skills and become national sportswriters.

Speaker 1: That's amazing when you point that out because those names, you know, are legendary, and (cough) was this around the time--excuse me--wait, are we--we're in seventy--
Speaker 2: We're in the '80s [1980s] (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're in the '80s [1980s].  Do you remember, I think it was, maybe '80 [1980], '81 [sic. 1987], was it Al Cam- Campa--
Speaker 2: Al Campanis.
Speaker 1: Campa- (cough) when he was on Ted Koppel ['Nightline']?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And (clears throat) he was talking, he said the black players, I think it was, lack certain necessities to manage (clears throat) basketball and I--oh, this was the--
Speaker 2: That's baseball.
Speaker 1: --fift- fift--baseball, sorry.  This was the fiftieth anniversary of--
Speaker 2: Jackie Robinson (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jackie Robinson.  Do you remember that whole incident and--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  Absolutely.  I mean, you (laughter)--I remember watching it and saying, "Did he say what I just thought he said?"  I mean, didn't he go off into swimming and say we couldn't swim either and that sort of thing? I mean, it--but everything happens for a reason.  I mean, Al Campanis ended up being a catalyst for a change, you know.  Certainly it cost him his career and his legacy as a baseball executive, and his legacy ends up being, you know, the person who exposed the kinds of racist thinking that permeated, not just baseball but pro sports but which led to significant change because people said, "That's ludicrous," and systems were put in place to change that.  So as much as it was obviously crazy, you know, what he said and, you know, hurtful for him, you know, things like that often need to happen before people are awakened to the realities of the, some of the barriers that are put in place.  So I, you know, Al Campanis was a--ended up being a catalyst for change, even though it cost him his career and his legacy.
Story_ID: 661872
Speaker 1: You're doing a lot of traveling.  Budget is no issue, right, back in those days?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: For the most part.
Speaker 2: --beat, I mean beat writers still travel.  I mean, that's still a viable job that's done by writers around the country.  So, but, yeah.  I mean we travel, oftentimes we travel with the team but when we didn't, we traveled commercial and rented cars and ate when we were hungry.  So, not it was not a, budget was not a major issue.
Speaker 1: So what were, what are some of your, you know, key memories from this time period?
Speaker 2: Just having a courtside seat for some of the greatest sports events of that era and games, you know.  Ended up covering the Georgetown, Villanova NCA championship game [Georgetown University v. Villanova University], which many still consider the greatest upset in NCA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] history and being around that Georgetown team, which was an iconic controversial team and around George Thompson [sic. John Thompson], who took on the burden of change for black coaches, and for black students and was una- unabashedly black and was really a proponent of change for, you know, student qualifications and things like that to try to help provide more opportunities, not just for black students but for black coaches, to be able to witness those kinds of things, to be part of the day that Len Bias, who was the number one pick of the Boston Celtics, a top star out of the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], in two days after the draft, collapses and dies from, ultimately, we learned was a drug overdose.  I covered that story as well.  So to be, to have a front row seat for some of the most significant performances and stories of that era was something that was tremendously, not just fun but beneficial to, to my career.
Story_ID: 661873
Speaker 1: And then you said, just a few minutes ago that, you know, at the beginning, it took some time for you to be allowed to find your voice as a, as a writer, so what is your, is your, is that being permitted by the person, you know, Sandy [Sandy Padwe] or are you--at what point does that happen, I guess I (mumbles)--
Speaker 2: I know, it doesn't happen overnight.  It clearly--at The Times [The New York Times], it was a transition because The Times was very strict about its writing style.  I would turn in stories, and it got to the point where I would refuse to read the paper the next day because I would be so mad at how it was edited, how they would take it back and turn it into X player scored twenty-five points to lead the, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So it was a lot of wrestling that occurred in order for me to begin to find that.  But I probably didn't define it until I, again, had to move out to move up.  I wanted to be a columnist, and The Times did not have any African American columnists at the time and didn't seem like they were going to do so any time in the near future.  I was--received a call from the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] that they had an opening for a columnist and, so I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in 1987 for that opportunity.  Bill Rhoden, William C. Rhoden, ultimately became the first African American columnist, and he's still there at The Times, and the former editor often tells me, "That could have been you.  You were just not patient enough."
Speaker 1: So wait a minute.  When did he come in?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact year, but he came in after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  But he came in after you.
Speaker 2: After I left.
Speaker 1: After you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now what is--where's--is Sandy still there at this point?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was he there--
Speaker 2: He was still there.
Speaker 1: Was he there?  For the whole five years that you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 661874
Speaker 1: So when you went to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution--now what was that exper- so you got there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went there as a sports columnist.
Speaker 1: Columnist, which is a big--
Speaker 2: Which is, which is, which--basically given a blank slate to, to, to write and to--that's where I think I found my voice--was to be able to take on issues and personalities and write a--different dynamics, different types of subjects but with more freedom and flexibility.  You know, one experience there which I found humorous but, not at the time was clearly--I think I was there--they had one other African American columnist, but I was the first one they brought in to really--and gave, and given latitude to be part of that columnist team that pretty much gets to cover--of what they, what they want to do, to cover.  And being an African American columnist, it made sense that I was drawn to many stories that perhaps had an African American twist.  Well, apparently, I was writing too many black columns.  And, so I was called in by the editor, sports editor, who gave me the advice of spreading out my subject matter.  He says, "You know, you don't want to just be a black columnist."  I said, "But I am a black columnist.  I mean, I'm a columnist, but I'm black.  I'm not quite sure what you're saying."  And he didn't want to say, "Don't write so many black stories," but that's basically what he was saying.  So there was still some trepidation.  We were in the South, and I got hate mail.  You know, I got some of the most, you know, racist mail that you could imagine, had to come up with a rule that if you didn't sign it, I didn't read it.  So when I would get mail, the first thing I would do would turn to the last page.  And I figured if I could write a column and put my face and my name out there in the public, you should at least have the guts to sign your name.  I don't care if it had an address on it or anything, but if it didn't have a name on it, then I wouldn't read it.  And that was one of the defense mechanisms I used.  I tried to read everything.  And if you left an address, I tried to respond to you, no matter, you know, how much vitriol and, you know, racist, you know, words were in there.  But, you know, it was clearly a time when some people just didn't want to see me or my kind covering sports in their, in their area.  But it was, it was an experience that I think I had to go through in order, you know, become the type of person that was more immune to that and had a better perspective, a continuing, growing perspective about the world I was in, that it wasn't the toy store.  It was a significant industry in this country that, in many ways, was driving change.  If you think about change in America, a lot of it began in sports.  Whether it was, you know, black athletes protesting, you know, racism at the Olympics or just here, whether it was Jim Brown and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, who stepped out of their uniforms and put on the uniform and of being strong black men and decided that they weren't going to stand for some of the racist things that were happening, not just in sports but in this nation.  If you, you know, how much of a role did Magic Johnson and Arthur Ashe play in us having an easier dialogue today about AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus]?  You know, what role did Title IX and women athletics play in opening opportunities for women throughout society.  So this was a period when I came to understand that I was not in the toy box.  That I was in a place where there was a significant opportunity to say things that could not only affect people's lives but could affect society as well.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your columns that--particularly true responses or that you, you know, maybe even--yeah, I'm fixed, sorry.  You--do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) During that era in the South, it wasn't necessarily the particular subject, whether, you know, you were calling out something that seemed a little odd and potentially racist in one of the local sports teams.  But even just writing a column about [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron, I mean, there were some people that just didn't like to see the black face.  I mean, that was clear, that no matter what I say, I could have said, you know, "I found the cure for cancer and here it is," and, but they would say, "You know, you N word," you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that was, that was just the time that we were, we were in.
Speaker 1: Now Maynard Jackson, was he mayor at that time or--I think he was (unclear) mayor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maynard Jackson was mayor.  And Atlanta [Georgia], of course, was a hotbed for change still in America and a place where African Americans were getting those types of opportunities.  And, so the opportunities that Maynard Jackson and others in Atlanta--[HistoryMaker] Herman Russell, you know, other entrepreneurs were getting led to the Constitution [Atlanta Constitution; Atlanta Journal-Constitution] hiring this black kid from Oklahoma to be a columnist.  So, you know, it all tied together in the, in that era, and everybody, you know, the rising tide lifted a lot of boats.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean there--and people are not necessarily comfortable with that change that's happening, you know, there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Mumbles)--
Speaker 2: But that was their problem.
Story_ID: 661875
Speaker 1: Are you looking up to anyone at this point that is a sports columnist or, you know, wanting to be a--are you, are you of that mindset?  Or you just, you know, "I'm [HistoryMaker] Roy Johnson" and--
Speaker 2: It wasn't that I was Roy Johnson, but there weren't a lot of people who looked like me in senior level positions.  I mean, at the time, I felt I wanted to be an editor--
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: --because editors had more power than writers to effect headlines and pick photographs and cover subjects and things like that.  And I didn't know if I would miss writing, but I said let me aspire to try this editor thing to see if it was something I liked.  So I got a call from Sports Illustrated, Mark Mulvoy, who is now the managing editor of Sports Illustrated, and they had an opportunity for a college basketball editor, senior editor position.  And he actually flew down to Atlanta [Georgia] to speak with me about the position, and ultimately I left the Constitution [Atlanta Constitution; Atlanta Journal-Constitution] to come back to Sports Illustrated as a senior editor.  It was my first management position--a first editor position where I was overseeing writers and overseeing the actual coverage of a sport, which again I felt where you had more power as an editor 'cause you could direct coverage, you can make assignments.  When stories were being laid out, you could, you could choose the photographs and write the headlines because all of that was part of the portrayal of African Americans in the media.  It's not--and, so you can only do so much as a writer.  You can only write one story.  You can only produce that one piece.  But as an editor, as a manager, you can affect the assignment of that story, how that story is written, how it's portrayed in that publication or whatever the entity is.  So it was something I wanted to try, and it turns out that I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Now (clears throat) how--what did he say was the opportunity when he came down?  I'm so--
Speaker 2: To be a senior editor.
Speaker 1: To sen- okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oversee- overseeing college basketball.
Speaker 1: How ma- how many--oh, that's--okay.  How many senior editors were there at the time?  Was there, was there one for each--
Speaker 2: Well, there was pretty much a senior editor for every major sport.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And some senior editors had more than one sport.  I mean, I ultimately had college basketball and tennis, which was a great time too because I covered tennis for The Times [The New York Times] as well, and covered most of the majors, didn't cover the Australian Open [Melbourne, Australia].  So I had that in my background.  So I ended up being the tennis editor during the great Jimmy Connors run at the U.S. Open [U.S. Open Tennis Championships, New York, New York] and when, you know, everybody from Chris Evert to Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf and John McEnroe, who was a (cough)--also at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] when I was there.  So I've known him from college.  So ended up being the tennis editor during a great editor for tennis as well.
Speaker 1: So (clears throat) what--you were there as senior editor for--that's what I'm just wondering about--
Speaker 2: Like '89 [1989] through about '93 [1993].  I like to work in five year intervals.
Story_ID: 661876
Speaker 1: So let's talk because the one thing you had started to mention before was the, you know, Magic Johnson, so can you tell the rest of that story 'cause you said--and I don't--let's see.  What year was that?
Speaker 2: When Magic came into the league [National Basketball Association] as a rookie (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, did you really co-author--
Speaker 2: I co-authored a book with him, 'Magic's Touch.'
Speaker 1: --in 1990?  I have it as '90 [sic. 1989].
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact year anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry.  But I just--you came back in 1989--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --(mumbles), okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, obviously Magic came in and was a star player.  Developed a relationship with him.  Obviously, they made the final many years, so I ended up covering the finals.  Again there were a growing number but still only a handful of African American writers and was given an opportunity to write a basketball book with him called 'Magic's Touch.'  And that was significant, too because a lot of athletes were not doing stor- books with black writers--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at the time--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --for the most part because the writers were picked by the agents, and most of the agents were white at that time.  So I give, I give Magic and his agent, at the time was Lon Rosen, credit because Earvin said, "I want to work with Roy [HistoryMaker Roy Johnson]," and Lon made it happen so that was a great opportunity and a great experience as well.
Speaker 1: So you're saying a year after you got back?  You know, you, after you came back to Sports Illustrated, (clears throat) within that first year, they approached you about doing this.
Speaker 2: We might have, I might have been in Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 1: 'Cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) when they started because it takes--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a while to do a book.
Speaker 1: That's what I was going to say.
Speaker 2: I mean, it's almost a two year process--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --between, hey, do you want to do a book, and the time it gets in the bookstores.  So it probably was, it probably was more than a year.  I think it took a year to actually write the book.
Speaker 1: So what was that process like, though?  I mean, did you do (clears throat)--was that book, you know, already sort of written, because you had covered him or was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Or were you doing a lot of--
Speaker 2: We spent--
Speaker 1: --interviews?
Speaker 2: Interviews on the road.  And when he would come east, I would go meet him in some of those cities and then we would sit in his hotel room, "And today, we're going to talk about this," and he was very disciplined to talk about that, and I would transcribe his, you know, his discussion and his talk and then create chapters.  And we would start our back and forth.  But it was done mostly with me meeting him during Lakers' [Los Angeles Lakers] East Coast trips in some of the cities where they played.
Story_ID: 661877
Speaker 1: You're still really young here.  I mean--okay.
Speaker 2: I'm still really young now.
Speaker 1: No, I know, but I'm just saying--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you're thirty-four years old.  I mean, you're literally almost--though you've had these moves, you're almost, you know, what, twelve years out of undergrad [Stanford University, Stanford, California] you know, thirteen years?  You know, that's--I'm just saying (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Things were happening fast in sports.
Speaker 1: There--I'm just saying--
Speaker 2: Change is happening fast, opportunities are coming along, particularly as the NBA [National Basketball Association] grows and then, of course, the Bird-Magic era--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Things just exploded.  Now at the same time, you had stories about, you know, race in sports were huge.  And I think it was--SI [Sports Illustrated] had done a series on race in sports prior to me being there.  And I was there twenty-five years later, and we did a follow up to that huge package that they, that they, that they had, that they had done at the time, and we brought in a--as part of it, brought in a bunch of people to do a round table discussion and really look at where race and sport were twenty-five years after that first essay.  Then of course, you had the contrast with Bird [Larry Bird] and Magic [Magic Johnson], which created a lot of conversation, you know, Bird being the white player from Boston [Massachusetts], which still was known as one of the most racist cities in America.  You had the flamboyant black kid out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], which was one of the most open cities in America.  It really created a platform for a lot of discussion.  Some people got in trouble with some of their discussions, but again sport provided a real platform for people to be more open about the dialogue about race, which was important to have.
Speaker 1: So, you know, and sports writing is very--it can be very demonstrative and, you know, really, really good writing that occurs in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Some of the best writing this country has ever seen has been by sportswriters, because the games provide such a great platform.  The people, the challenges, the wins, the losses, the comebacks, the victories, the overcoming of odds.  I mean, sports has everything, you know, that we value as a culture.  It has heroes, it has villains.  You know, it has comebacks, it has, you know, champions, it has people who dominate.  It has, you know, underdogs.  And, so you're talking about a forum that is just overflowing with stories and with the right skills and the right voice, you never just ran out of stories to tell.
Story_ID: 661878
Speaker 1: And during this time that you're senior editor, are you--does it take you long to learn how to be an editor?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's not a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So how long, how long did that process take because, yeah.
Speaker 2: The process of becoming an editor, it's like anyplace, where you kind of come from one role to another.  I had to learn how to manage writers and how to--
Speaker 1: And how many writers were you managing?
Speaker 2: It was a handful (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --three to four or five.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And then occasionally a writer who just wrote features, would write something in your space.  And, so you'd have to work with him.  So some of the top writers at the magazine [Sports Illustrated], who now were being edited by this young kid, and they didn't like being edited.  And, so I had to learn to balance my voice with the writer's voice and not try to change theirs because I felt something sounded better.  You know, so that was a challenge.  And just managing people who had more experience, bigger egos and just the political side of, you know, being at the table when all the major decisions are made and learning when to speak up and when not to speak up when you felt that a decision was being made that maybe was not the best one for that particular story.  So there were a lot of different elements to becoming an insider that I had to learn, and I don't know if it happened quickly or not, but it was something that certainly evolved.
Story_ID: 661879
Speaker 1: Roy [HistoryMaker Roy Johnson], do you remember anything--any, like disappointments or things when you disagreed with how a story was handled and you were at the table?  Do you remember, like one or two incidences of that, and how you sort of handled that and--
Speaker 2: I don't know if there were disappointments.  I remember being mad--
Speaker 1: I mean, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) about, about things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean--
Speaker 2: And annoyed.  You know, and some may seem relatively small, but this is an instance when we were doing to do--this is at Sports Illustrated, and we were going to do a cover story on a player named Yao Ming, who was this big, you know, seven plus footer coming from China, he's a talented player.  And this was early on.  He hadn't really done much to deserve a cover other than being tall and from China, but he was a phenomenon.  He was a, he was a story.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: And I think, you know, there were, there were--this was the beginning of other--obviously, some black players who were, who were talented.  This was kind of the beginning of the tattoo era, when people made judgments about you based on the fact that you had a tattoo.  And therefore you were X kind of a person versus that kind of a person.  So we were--they had decided to do this story on Yao Ming.  And I remember leaving the table, the meeting was over, and I asked one of the top editors at the time, I said, "Well, you know, why is it that we're--you're so excited about Yao Ming that we put him on the cover?"  He said, '"Cause he's not a thug."  And I--sort of stopped me in my tracks.  And I wanted to say, "So you mean X player is a thug?  I mean, what does that mean he's not a thug?  Is somebody else who's a star a thug?"  And he, just of course, kind of walked away.  But the mentality, you know, again this is, you know, a room of white men covering an industry that is increasingly black.  And this dates back to the '70s [1970s] and, you know, the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers] and teams starting to embrace black culture, the vibe of black culture, the dance, the style of movement.  Things were starting--the hairstyles, the wardrobes, you know, Walt Frazier in New York [New York Knicks], and starting to see that permeate sports.  And a lot of people were not happy about it.  Some of them were commissioners, some of them were owners, and some of them were sportswriters.  So again that's an era of change and being at the table and seeing people who were free enough to not--he didn't necessarily know what he said was racist, but he was very clear about the reason he wanted Yao Ming as opposed to another player because he wasn't a thug and, therefore, in his mind, this other player must have been a thug because they had tattoos.  That was the kind of attitude that too often permeated some of the decision making, and most of the time I spoke up, which is probably why I didn't get promoted as fast as I wanted to (laughter).
Story_ID: 661880
Speaker 1: It's hard a lot of times, you know, because the whole issue of whether you're a player and then the issue of ownership, you know, and--was ownership being discussed or management (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Not only--
Speaker 2: But management was but--
Speaker 1: Management--we had, we had not gotten to any kind of ownership--
Speaker 2: I mean, it was lightly being discussed, but it was more critical, was there baseball managers and head coaches.  You know, it's interesting that when Tony Dungy, head coach of the Indianapolis Colts and Lovie Smith, who was head coach of the Chicago Bears, reached the Super Bowl [Super Bowl XLI], well, there's two African American coaches.  My kids, my son [Edwyn Johnson] at the time was probably about twelve years old, thought that was no big deal.  I mean, that--to see two black men as head coaches was not significant for him, just as now for kids having an African American president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] is just like, is just having a president.  But back then, just every little opportunity, every little breakthrough, a milestone, the first manager, the first coach was--were significant stories.  And we're still having firsts in sports but that was an era when you really had the first men, and they were mostly men, to break through in management.  And it was very difficult for a lot of them.
Story_ID: 661881
Speaker 1: Is there a change in the newsroom?  Is there a change in the locker room, is there a change in ownership in the way that, if you look back to the time that you were--
Speaker 2: Well, progress is always relative.  And if you compare the state of African Americans in sports measured by coaches and managers and front office people, yes, there's been a significant change.  Has there been great change?  I'm not sure.  We see change reflected, like, you know, African American coaches being fired but still getting ano- a second job, which wouldn't have happened a few years ago.  We have had African American ownership, and we now have Latino ownership.  You know, we've had female ownership in some sports.  So that is progress certainly.  On the, you know, the field has always been relatively democratic, but, you know, the issue of a black quarterback is less so today than--I remember writing a story about Willie Thrower, who was the first black quarterback in the NFL [National Football League].  And all of those quarterbacks who had to fight to stay quarterbacks when coaches were trying to change them to become players in other positions, you don't, you don't see much of that anymore now.  I mean, so the issue of a black quarterback, a black head coach in the NFL, an African American manager in baseball.  I mean, there's still not great numbers but, so there has been progress.  We still have a long way to go, and not just in those areas but, you know, in the totality of sports where you have CFOs, we have general managers, we have marketing managers and, now you have myriad jobs opening up in the area of social media.  So there are a lot of, there's a lot of ways to go, but still we made some progre- I will acknowledge that we've made some significant progress--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the last thirty years.

Speaker 1: You went to work briefly for Money and then you came back.  Is that, was that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So again, you know, going back to my impatience and my five year windows, I had a goal of being an assistant managing editor at Sports Illustrated and actually went to Mark Mulvoy, the managing editor after my third or fourth year and said to him that this was something that I aspired to be.  And he looked at me and said, "Well, that's going to be on somebody's watch, somebody else's watch because that'll never happen as long as I'm here."  And people have asked me, was I mad, and I was probably a little annoyed, but it was like, okay.  Thank you.  I know exactly what I need to know and that is that I need to get out of here if I want to do that.  So at five years and that was what I had told myself, I was going to be there five years, I had an opportunity to move to Money magazine, not so much because I was interested in Money, but because I had developed a relationship, and I always believe that relationships are critical.
Speaker 1: So what relationship (mumbles)--
Speaker 2: This is with an editor by the name of Frank Lalli, who was at the time, the managing editor of Money magazine.  I think we had served on a committee together.  I was actually on the Pathfinder committee.  Pathfinder was Time Inc.'s first digital effort.  Just as AOL [America Online, Inc.; AOL, Inc.] was created, there was a committee that was put together to figure out how to leverage the brands of Time Inc. in this new emerging space, and the project was called Pathfinder.  So I met many people outside of Sports Illustrated and began to develop relationships with people at other publications because I was serving on committees like that.  And, so Frank became a bit of a mentor and shared with him some of my frustrations, and he said, "Well, why don't you come work for me at Money?"  And what I did at Money was begin to create television programming in acco- association with CNBC, a new burgeoning business network to get Money on TV.  So my job was, essentially was to figure out ways to get Money on TV.  And, so that's what I did working for, working for Frank.
Speaker 1: Okay.   That--so even Money, wasn't Money relatively new at that point in time or not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think it was new.  I think it had been around for a--
Speaker 1: It had been around.
Speaker 2: --for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  But CNBC and those--that was the start of the new cable channels at that point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I don't know exactly when it started.  I mean, it was, it was a viable entity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was, that was the beginning of trying to cross promote your content on other platforms.  And, so the idea was to create this Money magazine segment on CNBC.
Speaker 1: So what--'cause you had never produced anything before.  What did you learn from that experience?  Or did you--how many episodes (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had started the--I mean, there was--we started to learn that storytelling is storytelling no matter the platform.  There were different tools that you have to use and different techniques when it's visual.  But at the end of the day, it's about the information and the content.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And just leveraging other platforms to get it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But how many episodes did you do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: Don't ask.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was thirty years ago, you're asking (laughter)--
Story_ID: 661883
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Then you go work there briefly and then what happens after that then?
Speaker 2: So what hap- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because I have you--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So let, so just--
Speaker 1: Because--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Just stop for a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Nope.  Because I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Norman Pearlstine came to Time Inc. as CEO.  I'm sorry--as editor-in-chief.  And during his, one of his luncheons, his sort of meeting people luncheons, he had all the senior editors.  And one of the things that he said he wanted to do while he was there was to address diversity, not just in hiring but in publications and content.  A few years before, I had come up with a concept for a magazine that I felt was something that could exist and be successful.  It was an African American basically lifestyle magazine, and I did a proposal, and I sent it to the men who were running Vibe.  Vibe had just started.  It was a entertainment, black entertainment, hip hop, you know, that generation, that industry was just starting.  I think Snoop Dogg was on the first cover.  A friend, [HistoryMaker] Keith Clinkscales was the CEO.  Gil Rogan, who had been a managing editor at Sports Illustrated, was sort of the white guru in charge of making sure those black people over at Vibe don't get too out of control.  And, so I sent it over there to them, and then they sent it back to me saying that this has no hope of success.  So I put it in my drawer and let it collect dust.  And when Norm mentioned that he wanted to diversify content, I sent him a note, and I think we actually had email at this time and said I had an idea.  I'd like to come and talk to you.  You know, I'm senior editor sending a note to the editor-in-chief, and he calls me up and says, "Well, let me see it."  And I dusted it off and I updated it.  The date was probably three or four years old, so I may have changed some things, and I showed it to him.  And he said, "Well, this sounds interesting.  Let's find out whether or not this is a business."  So I got this very, very unique opportunity to have an office, an assistant and essential- essentially take a leave from Money to build a business plan for what ultimately became Savoy.  And it was great because it exposed me to all aspects of the company, from the people who bought the paper, to marketing people, to finance people because I had to build the business plan, and I didn't know really know much about the business side of magazine to the Time.  I knew that, I knew the content side.  I knew that I had gotten tired of reading magazines like GQ and Vanity Fair and not seeing us included.  So my vision was for a magazine that was on that level of quality, but who, but that--which was about us and our stars and the people that we valued.  And I was, I was in that position for over two years. For over two years, I came to work pretty much reporting to Norm Pearlstine and building a business plan and ultimately was able to present that plan to Time Inc., which ultimately decided it was not a big enough property for them, that they couldn't see it being at least a million plus circ [circulation], which is what they kind of required at that time in order to invest in a new brand.  So they turned down the opportunity to do it.  And we explored doing it in partnership with Black Enterprise.  We explored doing it in partnership with the gentlemen who were running Essence at the time, and both of those entities didn't want to do the joint venture with us.  So ultimately without that support, Time Inc. turned it down.
Speaker 1: Okay (cough).  Oh, so you tried to get outside support?
Speaker 2: Well, they asked me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They asked, okay.
Speaker 2: The Time Inc. executives said, "Well, couldn't we do this in partnership with one of the"--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --"titles that are already in this space?"  So John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] certainly wanted nothing to do with Time Inc.  Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] was intrigued but did not want to do it either.  And then Ed Lewis [HistoryMaker Edward Lewis] and Clarence Smith at Essence ultimately turned down the opportunity to do it as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in that two year period, talk about what you were--I mean, besides upscale life (unclear) magazine, what were you--who was your demo [demographic] and what were you, what did you put together in that two year period with the business plan?
Speaker 2: Well, I put together a mark up, I put together financials.  You put together everything you need to put together for it to make projections about the viability of this brand.  We did market research, we figured out where the niche was based on the publications that were already out there.  And at the time, I believe there was really only one, and that was Ebony, that was over a million circ.  And even though it was, you know, well presented, it was a beautiful book that I, that I created that ultimately the numbers just didn't work for Time Inc., and they decided to pass on the opportunity.
Story_ID: 661884
Speaker 1: So what did you do next then?
Speaker 2: Well, I had also through my research, had met a gentleman by the name of John Huey, who had worked with Norman Pearlstine at The Wall Street Journal and came over with Norm to run Fortune.  And he had been part of, total group of advisors that were sort of helping me through the process and vetting some of my ideas, and ultimately said, "Well, since you can't do Savoy, why don't you come work for me at Fortune and do some of those stories for us."  So I ended up leaving Money and becoming an editor-at-large at Fortune magazine, which allowed me to not only step out of the sports arena for a minute and to test my skills, you know, in another industry but also gave me an opportunity to do some more what I consider groundbreaking pieces.  You know, they didn't really do much sports business at the time.  So the first major story on NASCAR [National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing], which was a growing, exploding sport at that time, I was able to do that and get it on the cover.  I did a cover story on Tiger Woods, which again was a huge get, and someone I had actually known for a long time because his father called me before Tiger went to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] and wanted me to speak with him to let--give him some ideas about Stanford.  So I've actually spoken with him for a long time and got to know Earl [Earl Woods] very well, and Earl ended up being kind of a mentor for me as well.  And then I was--the big, the big sports story that we did was one on Michael Jordan, when we decided we wanted to assess his economic impact on sports.  And through months of analysis with economists and some researchers, came up with this billion plus figure that ended up being a story on the nightly news everywhere.  When we released that, and Fortune magazine estimates that Michael Jordan, you know, the billion dollar man 'cause this was, you know, videos, sports videos, the beginning of the Nike [Nike, Inc.] wave.  You know, the fact that whenever he came to town, arenas would fill up.  This was the beginning of the clothing and the sneakers.  I mean, it was the beginning of a burgeoning industry that's still paying him over a million dollars a year.  So the impact that he has had on the NBA [National Basketball Association] now is almost immeasurable.  And then of course, the big story that I was able to do at Fortune was called 'The New Black Power.' And the essence of it was just to reveal the fact that there were, there was a rising wave of African Americans in business that just was not being covered by traditional media.  So I was given this great opportunity to--okay, fine, let's go find them do that, do the story.  And it ended up being a several story package, a triple gatefold cover of several people from different industries, from finance to beauty to sports that ended up being an iconic cover, not just for Fortune but for African Americans.  I mean, for years--people still come to me and talk about 'The New Black Power' cover.  It was a triple gatefold, it was elegant, it was, you know, a Vanity Fair-esque type of cover.  But it really revealed the fact that we were doing things that Fortune and Forbes and other business publications weren't covering, and here's who they are, and it was really, I think, a catalyst for change in the coverage of African Americans in business.
Story_ID: 661885
Speaker 1: The back story on that.  How hard or easy was it to bring that to fruition?  'Cause it is, you know, you have the, you showed the threefold and, I mean, was that, was that hard to bring that or you were in a position where you could do that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I don't know, I don't know anything but hard.  I mean, I don't know what hard means.  I mean, it was a challenge, obviously.  It was a lot of significant stories, trying to figure out what the stories were to try to get the right writers.  And in some cases, try to get the people to agree to do the stories because a lot of these successful African Americans were successful because they were below the radar screen.  And, so getting some of them to agree to speak to even Fortune magazine was not an easy task.  And in some cases, I just leveraged personal relationships.  I had begun to play golf and there were many African Americans who were playing golf and kind of had our quiet little groups, and some of them I had to twist some arms and beg and do a lot of things to get them to agree to do this because they said, "Look, our--my--I don't want to be on the cover of anything.  I don't want to be, you know, I'm doing, doing well," but I persuaded them that this was important and that they would be treated, you know, in a, in a, you know, in a way that would enhance what they, what they were doing and that--I sort of told them the concept of the bus- but the hardest thing may have been the cover. And it wasn't hard.  I mean execution is always difficult at the highest levels, but you find talented people and you make it done.  The cover was shot in New York [New York], two panels to the left were shot in New York, and the one on the right was shot in California.  So we had replicate lighting and background and things like that.  And there were twelve people all together on the cover.  Now I didn't travel to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for the L.A. shoot.  And one of the people in L.A. was Magic Johnson, who was beginning of--he had just developed his deal with Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation, Seattle, Washington] and was just starting to develop Magic Johnson Enterprises [Magic Johnson Enterprises, Inc.].  Now when you see the cover, you'll see everybody is pretty much in business attire.  And for some reason, the photographer because Magic Johnson was in the shoot, brought a basketball to the photo shoot.  Now again I wasn't there.  So the photographer takes the shots, we come back and we have what we call a photo show, when all the pictures--showing up on the wall.  So I'm in a room with the editor-in-chief, John Huey, and a photograph and just a couple of other people.  First picture comes up, Magic with a basketball.  I'm like, okay, I'm not going to use that.  It's not a basketball story.  It's a business story.  Second picture.  Magic with a basketball.  Third picture, somebody else with a basketball.  Third picture, basketball on the floor.  Every picture that this photographer took had a basketball in it.  And I'm sitting there going, well, this could be really bad.  This was, this--why did he do this?  You know, nobody told him to put a basketball--he said, "Well, I just thought 'cause it was Magic--." I said, "Nobody told you to think."  And, so as I was walking out of the room--I didn't say anything in the meeting.  When I was walking out of the room with John, I said, "John, we have a problem."  He said, "Why?"  I said, "Can't put twelve people on the cover of Fortune with a basketball.  It's not a basketball team."  He just (laughter)--his eyes just lit up.  He said, "You're absolutely right."  And we ended up doing a major Photoshop job (laughter) just to find the right images and moving things around to find that image that we could create without a basketball because there was not a single image that didn't have a basketball in it but--
Speaker 1: Are you--
Speaker 2: My line was, "You cannot put twelve people on the cover of Fortune with a basketball," (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You mean that whole--all that we see there, they were all basketballs?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Just on that one panel (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, on the, one the one.
Speaker 2: --there was a basketball in the, in every one of the shots that the photographer took.
Speaker 1: I see, I see, I see.
Speaker 2: So we had to find an image where he was not holding the basketball and use him.  So all the images with him holding the basketball had to be moved.  And then we had to find one where the other people looked good.  So we had to take the three of them and merge it with him, and it was just a, it was, it was a mess.  But there were not twelve people on the cover of Fortune, twelve people with a basketball (laughter), which would have been a disaster.
Story_ID: 661886
Speaker 1: So the other thing is that the, that issue ['The New Black Power'] was very successful.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, it was one of the highest selling--I think it was the highest selling, non-Fortune 500 issue--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --of the year.  Sold out.  Was widely covered and chronicled and like I said, had an impact, I believe, on the way blacks in business were covered, not just by Forbes and Fortune, but I think Black Enterprise elevated its game as well.  I mean, they've been doing a great job, but to see, to see Fortune magazine do that, I think was a, not so much a wake up call but a nudge for Earl [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] and his team that there was some great opportunities out there, and I think they've done a great job of covering them.
Speaker 1: Because they, because Black Enterprise really had been the only game in town up to that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, to that point.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then the other thing that you touched upon, and I just would like you to explain a little bit more, was people af- you know, their fear.  Was it that if they were there, maybe they would get in trouble.  I mean, was there any of that or they just wanted to be under the, you know, the radar screen?  Was there any like I, you know, I just want to be low key about this?  I--
Speaker 2: There's no question that in order to rise during that era, you had to manage yourself.  You had to manage your thoughts, you had to manage your words.  And a lot of publications or a lot of entities, a lot of businesses, didn't want you getting too much attention.  You know, it's totally different now, when they pretty much trot all of their diversity out front.  But back then, people got jealous if you got attention and they didn't.  If somebody was your peer and they were white and you were getting coverage just because you're a person of color in that position that didn't sit well.  So those men and women who were able to rise during that era understood that and pretty much stayed below the radar.  So it wasn't a fear.  It was just a reality that it wasn't always the best thing to be noticed outside of the walls of your, your business.
Story_ID: 661887
Speaker 1: Fortune becomes a very significant part of your story, really, because of the position you held--had there, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know if it's the position.  It becomes significant based on the content I was able to produce.  So I mean, I was an editor.  I had already been a senior editor, and I was editor-at-large there.  So I mean, it was, it was a good position but, you know, I think that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But they had never had an editor-at-large who was African American, had they, up until that point?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they've had many editors-at-large anyway.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I mean, it was kind of a new position.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --it wasn't like, it's not like it was (gesture) an assistant managing editor or a senior editor.  It was--
Speaker 1: Well, what is an editor-at-large then?
Speaker 2: It was a hybrid--I edited stories and I wrote stories.
Speaker 1: I see, I see, I see.  But what--did that mean that you would a whole--the--that didn't mean you would get the whole publication?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The--okay, okay, okay.  That's--I was just trying to understand it.
Story_ID: 661888
Speaker 1: You know, I, I would like to go back a second because you had started to talk about the day that--if you don't mind--I'm sorry.  You had--this is back to Sports Illustrated. You had talked about the day that you got the call, I think, or you were there or whatever about Magic Johnson.  Can you talk about that?  'Cause we went to the book but we, you know, we sort of missed that.
Speaker 2: Well, I had a relationship with Magic from having written the book ['Magic's Touch,' Magic Johnson and Roy Johnson] and a relationship with his management team and specifically Lon Rosen, who was his agent.  And that morning, one of our reporters who reported to me 'cause I believe I was the basketball, pro basketball editor at the time, called me and said, "There's a rumor around here that Magic is retiring."  I said, "What do you mean he's retiring?"  We knew he was having a press conference.  So this just didn't make any sense.  We knew he'd been out for a couple of days because of an injury.  We didn't know at the time that they had discovered this in an insurance policy, so they hold him out while they went and double checked the blood.  So I called Lon.  I ended up calling his office and speaking to Lon.  And I said, "I hear, you know, Earvin is retiring.  You know, what's up with that?  Does," and I don't know why I said this, but I said, "does he have AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or something?"  And Lon said, "You didn't hear that from me."  And I'm like, "What are you talking about?  Like what are you talking about?"  And, you know, he basically told me.  And that's when I got off the phone and started running up and down the hall, but everybody was out to lunch.  The one person I did call was my wife [Barbara Johnson], who at the time was a producer over at WABC [WABC Radio] in New York [New York].  But I said, "You cannot go on the air with this.  You cannot absolutely go on the air with it."  But nobody knew what the press conference was about, so it would give you an opportunity to kind of find some experts to talk to.  But, you know, so this was a couple of hours before the press conference.  And, but again there was no internet, there was no way of conveying the news.  But it was, it was clearly a significant and seminal moment, not just in sports, but in America.  And I think a critical one in the advancement of the dialogue about AIDS and HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] in this country.
Speaker 1: Oh, totally, because he was a success case, and I mean, he's gone on to have this fantastic career as a businessman.
Speaker 2: I've often said that Earvin took AIDS out of the closet and put it on the kitchen table and made it easy--easier for us to talk about it as a society.  It still wasn't an easy period, and there were ups and downs and challenges that he confronted because he tried to be a spokesperson for the disease but just too many people and too many agendas, from the president to various organizations.  And ultimately his best role was just being Earvin.
Story_ID: 661889
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you think he made it through?  Because I remem- there was even this--when he came back to the team [Los Angeles Lakers] and he was, he played, but people were afraid, you know, they didn't want to touch.  There was--becau- because they were concerned at that point about the contact.
Speaker 2: Again Earvin's [Magic Johnson] experience mirrored that of the country and watching the NBA [National Basketball Association] handle it, watching players handle it, was really vital for the rest of us.  And I think what we saw were the same fears and attitudes that people had in society 'cause remember, there was--I think his name was Ryan Smith [sic. Ryan White]--there were, you know, the young boy who had HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and was ostracized in the classroom and things like that.  So, you know, Magic's experience mirrored that.  But also when he played in that All-Star Game, when he was voted in by fans--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and the players finally embraced him and made him the MVP [Most Valuable Player] of that game, was significant, in that the NBA was saying, "Look, we're cool with this."  So of course, not everybody was, and there were still some people, but from a corporate standpoint, from most of the players, they were out there playing, high fiving, rebounding, doing all the stuff, saying, "If we can do this, then you can have kids in the classroom, you can have co-workers who are HIV positive."  So, you know, that experience helped us to advance our comfort level with HIV and AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], not just as a discussion point, but as something that we all live with.  If--and most of us all do know someone who is either HIV--or has AIDS, but helps us live with them because of what Magic went through.
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I hadn't asked you was--about because you did a book for Magic ['Magic's Touch,' Magic Johnson and Roy Johnson] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Okay.  I just want--let me just speak.  You did a book with Magic, but you also did one with Charles Barkley ['Outrageous! The Fine Life and Flagrant Good Times of Basketball's Irresistible Force,' Charles Barkley and Roy Johnson].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And was that around the same--were those around the same time 'cause I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Charles Barkley was later, probably a couple of years--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --later.
Story_ID: 661890
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Vanguarde.  You join Vanguarde, right?  Vanguarde Media, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Isn't that after Fortune?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Sure.  What do you want to know about it?
Speaker 1: Well, no, just how the whole, how did it happen?
Speaker 2: Well, I received a call from [HistoryMaker] Keith Clinkscales, who at the time, I believe, was still the CEO of Vibe, gave me a call and said, "Len Burnett [HistoryMaker Leonard Burnett, Jr.]," who had been his partner for many years, "and I are leaving.  Don't say anything.  We're going to go and start something and we're going to give you a call in a bit."  So a few weeks later, maybe a couple of months later, I can't recall, Keith called me, and he had been part of helping me develop the business plan for Savoy and asked me to join the team, to sort of oversee editorial.  And, so I joined Vanguarde early in the, in the process as editorial director, you know, overseeing the content for the publications, which at the time included Heart and Soul and Honey and some business titles and then there was the beginning of the dotcom boom, so there were a lot of digital brands floating around, but we got some office space down on Park Avenue South [New York, New York], and we're off and running.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that whole experience and those two publications?  Why was he leaving?  Where did, where was he going?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: I think it was a great experience.  I mean, in the context of that era, there really had not been a sig- another significant black owned media company other than Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], Essence, Black Enterprise and then there was BET [Black Entertainment Television] and, so Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson], BET, one of our investors.  And, so this was--he had emerged already in a couple of other magazines.  So this was an effort by him to figure out a way to make those properties profitable, which they weren't for him at the time.  So bring in Keith, who was a well known magazine executive, bring in myself, Len Burnett was a salesperson.  So, you know, we were sort of the Young Turks of that era, era in black media.  So our vision was to create the next great black owned media company.  And we saw no reason that we couldn't do that and that was why we all left.  That was 'cause we saw an opportunity, you know, with Bob as an investor and a partner to create something that hadn't been created for a generation.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that whole process and--you know, there's a phenomenon, I think, that a lot--all the women's publications, a lot of them have men as, you know, as head of them.  You have Essence--
Speaker 2: I mean, the process of doing it, it was like launching any business.  I mean, it was tough.  It was a challenge in many ways.  But it was exciting.
Speaker 1: Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were, we were, we were doing something that a lot of people had talked about doing but hadn't really done.  We were doing something that didn't always sit, didn't sit well with the established entities.  So we really got no support at all from, you know, the leaders in those, in those companies.  But we didn't care.  You know, we had the, we thought, the funding, we had the vision, and we had the team.  And, you know, we were going to, we were going to be the Yankees [New York Yankees].  This was back when the Yankees were good.  We were going to be the Yankees of black media and, you know, create new level publications, to create a lot of buzz, give advertisers new options, give consumers and readers new options to see themselves in new ways that they hadn't seen about, seen themselves before, to read about themselves with a kind of prose, the kind of writing that they hadn't seen in a long time.  And, so we just put our blinders on and tried to just make our footprint in what was a relatively small but crowded arena.
Speaker 1: So how much--where did your funding come from?
Speaker 2: Well, most of it came from BET (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From (unclear), right.
Speaker 2: And then there was a black owned venture firm [Provender Capital Group LLC] that was run by Fred Terrell [HistoryMaker Frederick Terrell] and Derek Jones that was also part of that so that's where most of the money came from.
Speaker 1: 'Cause Fred Terrell had formed his own venture--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --firm at that time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from (unclear)--okay.
Story_ID: 661891
Speaker 1: Talk about the process.  So you--what are you proud of that you accomplished there?  Because, you know, we were looking at the covers, you know, you know, earlier.  You were talking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm proud of the fact that black men came together with a vision and as a team and tried to do something that hadn't been done in an long time and gave it our best shot in faces, in the face of some pretty stiff winds.  Not long after we launched and got publications off the ground, the dotcom crash happened, which I think, affected everybody.  But, you know, those small start up companies were hit, were hit hardest and made it very difficult to get more funding, made it difficult to grow and ultimately being, you know, ended up being a significant factor, you know, in Vanguarde's [Vanguarde Media] ability to survive.  But I'm also proud of having created a brand that still resonates with people, even though it hasn't existed for almost a decade.  You know, the--Savoy was my idea, it was that notion that we deserved to be showcased in a publication that was as good as Vanity Fair, that was as good as GQ.  And, you know, the, you know, the original names, you know, weren't--Savoy wasn't the original name, and we came up with it through some brainstorming.  And it was one funny story about a focus group.  One of the original names was Strivers Row, to sort of replicate of the Vanity Fair's.  Strivers Row, a place in Harlem [New York, New York], a significant, you know, middle, middle upper class population, your residents, you know, poets, artists, when they were going to call it Strivers Row.  But we were in this focus group, and I'm sitting behind the glass with some other people.  And we showed them names with a bunch of titles on them, and this one black woman looked at this man.  She's staring at the title, and we told the moderator to ask her what's she's thinking.  And she said, "Well, ma'am, you seem to be staring at that.  What do you, what do you think?"  She says, "Why we always gots to be striving," (laughter)?  So we nixed Strivers Row right then and ultimately came up with Savoy because the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem was one of the first places in America where blacks and whites socialized together and came together to discuss the issues of the day, but in a, in a safe, friendly environment.  That's what we wanted the publication to be.  So I'm immensely proud of the fact that was able to bring that to fruition, the vision and the idea to fruition and believe that, you know, given different economic circumstances and conditions, it would still be a viable, thriving property today.  And it's unfortunate that the Vanguarde did not survive.  It was, oh, to me one of the last opportunities to create a great black owned media company.  But we all gave it our best shot, and everyone who was there has great memories and fun memories of trying to make it happen.  And it was really a significant effort by a lot of people.
Speaker 1: You know, I do want to tell this that I thought it was very well done, you know, very well written, and what you're not saying, you're not talking about the gap that you were really trying to fill, you know, in some respects, okay.  With the, with the competition that had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, if you were--
Speaker 2: I was not, I was not, it was not a knock on anything that was currently out there, but I was part of a generation that, while respected Ebony, didn't necessarily read it to the extent that our parents did.  You know, I--being in my business, my reading library included the Vanity Fairs and the GQs.  And at that time, we were not in those publications.  And, so my motivation was simply to create something that was as good as those titles but that featured us.  And some of my early mock up co- cupper- covers had people like Samuel L. Jackson and Angela Bassett that--people at the table at Time Inc. didn't know who they were.  But we knew who they were.  You know, they were our young stars coming up that we knew about and, of course, Halle Berry.  So the point was that we--while Vanity Fair liked to make stars, that we could make stars as well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, thank you, okay.
Story_ID: 661892
Speaker 1: So you return back to, you return back to Sports Illustrated again.  I mean, you like--for the third--now this is the third time.
Speaker 2: But, as I've mentioned before, my goal was to be an assistant managing editor, and Terry McDonald was a new managing editor at SI and when he came onboard, he reached out to me, and we had lunch and a conversation, then he ultimately asked me to come on as an assisting managing editor and that is something that--it was, it was difficult to leave Savoy.  You know, I think everything has its time and its place 'cause certainly it's like leaving your child.  I mean, that was an idea that I had tried to birth a decade before.  It actually happened and it was still going through its growing pains, but it was time for me to leave and to pursue another opportunity.  So it wasn't easy.  But I felt it was the decision, the right decision for me at the time and, you know, helped me to gain another level of experience that ultimately would help me in my quest to become an editor-in-chief.
Speaker 1: Now you--at the time you come back, you are the highest ranking black journalist at the, at Sports Illustrated?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: But I had been that before.  I mean was, you know (laughter) (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was just thinking, maybe things had changed.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I think I was that when I was a senior editor.  I had--that was, it was (laughter)--
Speaker 1: But what are the things that you--you're proud of doing that your third--oh.  Can I ask the question, though?  So Savoy files for bankruptcy after you left.  Okay, because--
Speaker 2: No, Savoy didn't file for bankruptcy.  Vanguarde [Vanguarde Media] had filed (unclear).
Speaker 1: Vanguarde, I'm sorry.  Vanguarde filed for that and Savoy ceases publication.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, Savoy--yeah.  It was sold to a woman in Chicago [Illinois].  And I can't remember her name right now.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Hermene Hartman (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hermene Hartman, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We were--it was very well written, I do want to say.  It really--there could still be a space for Savoy in the world.  But anyway, (clears throat) but, so what are the things that you're proud of, you know, through--at--when you, you know, 'cause you're there, you're there--when you come back, you're there for--
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: For three years.  Okay.  Two years I have.
Speaker 2: Two thousand [2000] to 2003.
Speaker 1: I have 2003 to two thousand and--oh, maybe I'm wrong.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry, 2003 to 2005?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay (mumbles).  So what are the things that you did there that you're, you know, that ha- was there anything different?  I mean, first you're assistant.  That's what you had wanted to be.  So it sort of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was, it was the next step that I wanted to--
Speaker 1: It was the next step even (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --take.  I mean, ultimately I wanted to be managing editor.  But in order to do that, you know, I had to be assistant managing editor.  So it was, it was, it was a good experience, again, working with people that had a lot of different biases.  I mean, that was during that period when I heard the comment about Yao Ming not being a thug.  So, you know, it was, it was--that's when the political crap really hit the fan.  What--the higher you get to the, to the mountaintop, the political starts to fly.  And, you know, sometimes you win and sometimes you don't.  I was given a unique opportunity to oversee the creation of branded digital and--radio, television and broadband content for the company, for the brand.  So we--this was the beginning of the next dotcom boom.  I helped to oversee the development of the best si.com, you know, bringing it up 'cause it was run by CNN down in Atlanta [Georgia], and they wanted to bring it up to New York [New York].  We created 'SI Monday Night Live' ['Sports Illustrated Monday Night Live'], which was a syndicated radio show featuring a young man named Josh [Josh Elliott], who is now one of the co-anchors of 'Good Morning America.'  You know, that was really his first broadcast job.  He was a young writer at Sports Illustrated teamed with an announcer named Dave Sims, who is a significant play by play announcer here.  So they did 'Saturday Night' or Monday--'SI Monday Night Live,' developed the relationship with HBO [Home Box Office] where 'Real Sports' ['Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'] had its Sports Illustrated feature in it every week, produced the twentieth anniversary, twenty-fifth anniversary Sports Illustrated special, featuring Bob Costas, produced the NFL [National Football League] preseason shows that were on FOX.  But the most fun thing I did was to produce the 'SI Swimsuit Model Search' ['Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model Search'] that was on NBC, you know, right at the same time 'Lost' came out, which was our downfall 'cause we were up against 'Lost.'  But the toughest job I had was being executive producer of the 'SI Swimsuit Model Search.'
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Somebody had to do it, and thank God, it was me.
Story_ID: 661893
Speaker 1: See, this reminds me of your first--or why you even went to Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], but that--your--this is a whole (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bikinis seem to keep coming up.
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  So it's come up again.  But, you know, but Sports Illustrated is known for its, you know, bathing--
Speaker 2: Right.  And that was a significant brand.  It generated, I believe, almost 25 percent of the year's profits was that one issue.  So this was a significant brand, and this was before reality television was really just starting to peek out and be tried.  And this was one of the first sort of the reality shows.  And we ultimately did auditions and found these aspirants who wanted to be in the issue [Sports Illustrated Swimsuit].  And it was a good experience.  I mean, not only from a production side but really changing the lives of a lot of young women who, you know, were very good people and aspired to this, and ultimately the woman who won [Alicia Hall] was from Las Vegas [Nevada], and family lived in a trailer park.  And, so this was a significant event for her and her life.  So unfortunately, when the economy started to change and the company decided that it needed to do layoffs, at least my understanding is if you didn't work on the core publication, then you were expendable, which, of course, was very shortsighted because to grow the business ultimately you needed to grow into digital and to other areas.  But at the time, this was still the early freak out period in major media when they didn't quite know what to do with digital, and it wasn't viable economically.  It really wasn't producing the dollars that people thought it should given the impact it was having on the business.  So because I wasn't working on the pages and on the print, I guess I was considered expendable and in December of 2005, was part of the first wave of layoffs that occurred at Time Inc. that ultimately went on for years.  They laid off 125 senior level executives in that one day, and I happened to be one of them.
Speaker 1: And this is the beginning, as you say, really, I mean, of really of cataclysmic change that would happen over the next--
Speaker 2: Over the next decade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, right.
Speaker 2: And to a certain degree it's still happening.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean, the ship has settled to a certain degree, but we'll look back on the last decade and the impact that digital has had on media and outside of, you know, well, it's had an impact on every industry, on the music industry, the film industry and on the television industry.  Changed the way that consumers access information, access video, changed the way it was delivered and trying to monetize it has taken years for big businesses to figure out.  Many of them have collapsed under the weight of that change, and Time Inc. happens to be, happens to be one that hasn't collapsed to the extent that it doesn't exist.  But that is certainly a different company than it was in 2005.
Speaker 1: Oh, you--I mean, it was the behemoth.  I mean, it was, it was the gold standard on the, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and especially with publishing.
Story_ID: 661894
Speaker 1: At this point, when that happens, what are you thinking you want to do?  Are you sort of take, you know, are you, like are in you a point of reanalysis?
Speaker 2: Well, being laid off puts you at a point of analysis, at least, if not reanalysis.  I still felt I had a viable career in the publishing industry.  And, you know, beyond taking the time to just enjoy myself and breathe for a little bit, started to explore opportunities, continued to explore opportunities in the publishing industry.  But I've always believed that, you know, things happen when and how they're supposed to happen.  It took over a year for me to land somewhere, and it wasn't by necessarily anything I did other than--and this is why I tell people there's someone always watching you.  So when I was at Time Inc. trying to get Savoy done, there was a very quiet man in the finance department who helped put together the business plan, he was a numbers guy, didn't really know much about--he knew the publishing industry but didn't say much at meetings.  And I get a call one day.  Turns out he is the CFO at a company called American Media [American Media, Inc.].  And he reported to the CEO, David Pecker [David J. Pecker] and that they were going to make some changes at this magazine called Men's Fitness, which I had not really heard of at the time.  But he said, "Would you mind talking to us?"  And I said, "Sure."  Long story short, I received a call from David Pecker's office, went up to meet him and ultimately was given the opportunity to be editor-in-chief of Men's Fitness magazine, which was significant A, in that I got the opportunity to, like at Savoy, be the editor-in-chief again.  But it was a broad market magazine, and something that I believed, at the time, never would have happened at Time Inc., and I still don't believe has happened where an African American or person of color has been named top editor at one of their publications.  So I give David credit for that and, you know, gave me an opportunity to enter a space that I was passionate about but one that be- ultimately became the foundation of a business [Fit!Live!Win!] that I ultimately started several years later.
Story_ID: 661895
Speaker 1: Talk about your business.
Speaker 2: So my company is Fit!Live!Win!.  And we do employee wellness solutions for municipalities.  You know, employee wellness is something that's relatively new.  When I was at Sports Illustrated, I remem- or at Men's Fitness, we talked about doing the fittest companies in America and found out it was mostly cutting edge companies that were building gyms onsite, were paying for people to have gym memberships, were changing the food in the cafeteria.  But those were far, few and far in between.  But as insurance costs, health insurance costs began to rise, companies began to, not only invest in employee wellness but began to see that clearly a healthier workforce means more productivity and fewer claims and therefore an ability to manage, if not lower, healthcare costs.  So this was probably around 2006.  And over the next five years, Corporate America--employee wellness in Corporate America exploded.  So where it hadn't quite made much progress, it was in the areas of municipalities.  The municipalities have significant numbers of workers.  They have teachers, they have administrators, the people that, the sanitation workers.  There's a lot of people in those, in those positions.  And because they're worried about potholes and schools and other things, cities haven't really focused on employee wellness.  So it created an opportunity for someone with expertise to come in and to create and manage their employee wellness programs and that's what my company does.
Speaker 1: So who, so your clients are municipalities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are cities, right.
Speaker 1: Are cities, okay.  And, so how long have you been doing this now?  For--
Speaker 2: I founded the company in late 2012.  In--pretty much, you worked out the kinks, developed the bo- the business model, made adjustments where I've had to make them and am now at the point of really trying to grow my client base.
Speaker 1: So who are your clients so far?  Who--
Speaker 2: I don't talk about the particular--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) individual clients.
Speaker 1: But you feel strong about this, what you're, what you've embarked on.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  There's no question.  I mean, not only do I feel strongly about it as a business, but I feel strongly about it as a, as a mission.  You know, there's no question that obesity is a major concern in this country and, you know, if I can educate and motivate and aspire one person to eat more vegetables, drink more water and get exercise three times a week then that's a great thing, you know, 'cause it's one of the few areas where we have control over our lives, what we eat and what we do.  And if you can get people to think about that and to take better care of themselves, you can have a significant impact, not only just as them, in them--individuals but in their children, the choices they make at the grocery store, the choices they make when they sit down at the dinner table.  And it's particularly important in the black community.  I mean, obesity is the number one killer in our community because it leads to all of those diseases, those cardiovascular diseases that we over index on, whether it's heart attacks, high blood pressure, you know, all the things that we're dy- strokes--that we're dying from are caused by us not taking care of ourselves and being, being overweight.  So just getting that message out and trying to get people to change their lives is something that I've taken on as a mission and something that I really am committed to trying to do.
Speaker 1: That's excellent.
Story_ID: 661896
Speaker 1: So where are you at this point in your life then?  I mean, you're beginning to start--you really have a new entrepreneurial--actually your third, but outside of publishing, though, you (unclear)--institute some aspect of that in there, but where are you and what do you want to accomplish with, you know, the rest of your life?
Speaker 2: I think everything I've done up to this point has prepared me for this.  You know, not only am I doing this entrepreneurially but I'm also overseeing history content for a company called Scout [Scout Media, Inc.] that creates content and products for enthusiasts, pass- people who are passionate about certain things, gardening, cooking, you know, handi- you know, do it yourself home stuff, hunting and fishing and then history buffs.  So I love doing that.  So I'm still in the media realm, overseeing the history brand and learning something new and great things every day about history and how it not only affected people then, but how it changed our lives today and still affects us today.  But in terms of the business that I've launched, we're really just getting started.  You know, we're, you know, we're exploring and having conversations with new cities.  They get it.  You know, they understand that they have a need for this.  So I'm excited about this next wave and feel that I'm prepared personally.  And again everything that I've done up to this point has prepared me for this.  And looking back at that picture of my father [Roy Johnson] working in his store with Kyle Sundry [Kyle's Sundry Store, Tulsa, Oklahoma], I feel that that's, that was kind of in my blood or in my DNA from the beginning to go the entrepreneurial route.  So I'm excited about it.  It's scary.  Starting a business is scary.  But, you know, fear is the biggest factor that we all have that prevents us from doing the things that we were meant to do.  So I'm excited about it more than I am fearful of anything and feel that, not only is my mission to have a great business but to try to inspire people to lead healthier lives and ultimately affect, not just them but their families and their communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how are you planning to--are you, how are you going to be working with municipalities?  Is it that the facilities they built or working with, you know, coaches?  You said coaching?  Right?  Did you say--
Speaker 2: You know, the business essentially comes in and creates a comprehensive program based on your needs.  And what that could entail is anything from exercise and yoga classes onsite that are free to employ- employees, includes seminars on healthy eating, stress management, you know, help work life, balance.  Those are things that also affect our health.  I also create a customized e-newsletter that is distributed to employees on a monthly basis that provides content on fitness and nutrition and focuses on employees that are, that are doing well.  And then if you want to explore outside of your base of employees and create a--programs that can be community wide to try to promote healthy living in your community, we can do that as well.  We put on a fit fair every year where we bring in trainers and massage therapists and local hospitals that come in and do everything from diagnostic testing, from blood pressure and other things that they do to, you know, as I say, to introducing our yoga classes and our exercise classes.  And then we are going to introduce what we call sports day, where we have employees and their families come out and compete in games and have fitness contests and have healthy food trucks out so we again, just trying to promote healthy lifestyles and healthy living so that people are inspired to make better decisions about their own lives.
Story_ID: 661897
Speaker 1: So I want to ask some philosophical questions and then, you know, we'll be done because (mumbles).  You know, where--you spent, and you've talked a little bit about this but, where do you see the publishing, you know, industry and journalism, which is what you decided over the legal profession?
Speaker 2: Well, there is no publishing industry.  There's a content industry.  The industry is the distribution of information through whatever platform consumers want to receive it.  So if you have a word that represents the millions of words that you want to distribute, you would distribute them possibly in print, whether it's in a newspaper or a magazine.  You will, undoubtedly, distribute them digitally.   And then you'll distribute them on a mobile device, which is part of digital because you want to be able to reach consumers when and how they want to be reached.  And you want them to be able to access you when and how they want to do so.  So, now there are some publishers that are all digital.  Huffington Post [The Huffington Post] and others that are developing out of the digital space that will have to figure out a way to get the kind of numbers the need in order to make themselves a viable advertising platform.  Obviously, there's the YouTubes and entities like that which distribute content, video content in ways that make that make it accessible.  So I don't think there is a publishing industry, per se.  There is an industry of content distribution that everybody's trying to figure out their particular model.  Journalism is in an interesting space.  I mean, clearly there is a need for it, and I'll always feel they'll be a need for it, whether it is to hold our public officials accountable, to continue to cover the stories that matter to us as people that change our lives, that affect us in a positive or negative way.  And those stories will still be told because fortunately, you know, the organizations that value that will still do that.  But they'll have to balance that with entertainment coverage and cute puppy videos.  It's not really journalism, but a lot of it is the sort of--what are people watching, what do people want, you know.  Journalism will survive because, even though, six days a week people may not want to hear that important story but on that seventh day, somewhere that story about the contaminated water in West Virginia that was covered by the nightly news but didn't break through so much in social media for a few days will finally kind of break through, and people say, "Wow, this is important.  What happened?  How can we make sure it doesn't happen in our community?"  You know, that story will be much less read than what Beyonce is doing with Blue Ivy's [Blue Ivy Carter] hair.  But that's the dynamic in the world we, we live in.  So there will always be a place for journalism as long as there are stories and things that happen that matter to us.
Story_ID: 661898
Speaker 1: You have two children, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what are their ages?
Speaker 2: My son, Edwyn [Edwyn Johnson] is nineteen, and my daughter, Anna [Anna Johnson], who everybody calls Missy, is sixteen.  She's a junior in high school.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My son is a freshman in college at Johnson and Wales [Johnson and Wales University, Providence, Rhode Island], where's he's studying culinary arts.
Speaker 1: So I ask this question in terms--because you came from a strong family structure even, you know, 'cause, as you spoke of, there're a lot of people helping, you know, raise you.  What are your hopes for your children and the next generation of African Americans coming behind?  And can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think my hopes for my children mirror those of just about every parent in America, that they become self-sufficient, productive citizens and good people, that they are prepared to weather the vicissitudes of life and build lives for themselves and their families that are gratifying and fulfilling and that they're able to have an impact on the lives of others.  You know, that doesn't happen overnight.  It doesn't happen without setbacks but, you know, the more people who succ- people who succeed are ones who are able to endure failure.  You know, Edison [Thomas Edison] said he found 105 ways to fail before he finally figured out how to do it the right way.  So you just try to prepare them for life's ups and downs and move them in a direction that--where they're inspired to do their best and to just be good people along the way.  You know, as far as our generation of, or their generation and their peers, you know, it's the same thing.  They're going to, they're going to have challenges.  They're going to have confrontations and times and, you know, perhaps still when their color will matter and may be an impediment to something they're doing, but they shouldn't let one setback become a permanent setback.  We try to, without burdening them with all the baggage that we've had, try to at least prepare them for a world that still may not see them totally as equal, which is hard for them to hear because their world is totally, totally different.  But also to be compassionate, too, to understand that they've been very blessed and very privileged to live the life that they live and with that comes an obligation to treat people the same, no matter their status, no matter their, you know, neighborhood they came from, no matter what country they came from but to also utilize the resources and relationships that you are being, you know, anointed with to help others.  So it's a, it's a great burden on them but, you know, every generation carries its burdens, and it's the job of the parents to prepare them for that.  Our parents I think did a decent job of trying to prepare us against some tremendous odds.  You know, thank God, I'm not in prison.  You know, thank God, you know, a lot of things have not happened to me as has happened to many black men of my generation, things that'll take us generations to overcome if we do at all.  Single parent households, the lack of men and what that has done to our young boys who haven't had the proper training to understand everything from, you know, how to open a door for a young woman or walk on the right side of the sidewalk, or simply what it means to be a man that wears his pants around his waist as opposed to his ass.  So there's some challenges that our community faces that we're going to have to deal with in part because of this prison industrial complex and the drug era that put so many of our men in prison.  And it's unfortunate but, you know, we've--we're resilient people, and we survived a lot of things, some that are much worse than this, and we'll continue to fight in battle and try to be that community that we need to be in order to help our young people.
Story_ID: 661899
Speaker 1: I have two more questions and one ties into what you were just saying, and the other is a personal--what do you think--you know, you have talked about the legacy of your, you know, our parents.  What do you see as a legacy--when all is said and done, what will be the legacy of our generation?  And then I want you to talk about what your personal, what you would like your legacy to be.
Speaker 2: I wish I had a crystal ball to see what our generation, just nationally, will ultimately mean to the generation behind us.  I think there's been some tremendous change.  There've been changes in attitude.  You know, the things that they have been able to see and experience.  I mean, going up in space is no big deal (laughter) to them.  So that the vistas and horizons are just unlimited for them.  A lot of it--entrepreneurial.  I mean, I think that we've infused in our young people the idea that you can start something and you can, you know, we come from the era of Steve Jobs and Silicon Valley and Yahoo! [Yahoo! Inc.] and Twitter [Twitter Inc.], and seeing young people create major brands and major businesses is something that I think our generation is leaving to them and that idea that hey, you can go create something big and have an impact on people's lives by giving them jobs and creating something that fills a need in their, in their lives.  In terms of the African American community, you know, certainly the emphasis on education we've passed down from our own parents, the lessons we've learned in our own ups and downs in our careers and try to pass those on down to our children, the openness about talking about sexuality and relationships that, I think, wasn't there with our parents.  Hopefully, we've been able to better prepare them to love, to be hurt and to deal with the challenges of having relationships in a world that is continuing to change.  And then understanding what does the American dream really mean.  For us, the American dream was having the big house, having a nice car, et cetera, whereas at least in my mind, the American dream is different.  The American dream shouldn't be about things.  It should be about, you know, your family, it should be about your faith.  It should be about your impact on your community and your family.  You know, you don't have to be a multimillionaire to be a hero.  You don't have to be a multibillionaire to be a success story.  So find your path and, you now, certainly earn enough money to live the life you want to leave.  You know, I would never discourage anyone from doing that but--whereas we were challenged to make money.  We were challenged to have careers and be successful and wear suits and get titles.  All of our kids don't necessarily have to do that.  So I think of the legacies we left behind with them was that legacy of choice, to become something you're passionate about.  Certainly you want to be able to sustain yourself and earn a living and be self-sufficient.  But my kids [Edwyn Johnson and Anna Johnson] don't have to all be multibillionaires to be successful.  They don't all have to go to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] to be successful.  There are a lot of great schools and a lot of opportunities for them to find something that they are passionate about that can make them have a significant impact on society.  And, so that option and that opportunity to step outside of the traditional soaring up the corporate ladder is something I think we've left with our, with our kids.  You know, as far as me personally, I just want to do what my parents [Ida Brooks Jenkins and Roy Johnson] did for me and try to be a good example and someone that they can think back and say, "I remember my dad doing this.  I remember my dad doing that.  I remember him working.  I remember him starting a business.  I remember him taking me to swim practice.  I remember him coming to my games and what that meant to me," so that they replicate those things for their children, or when they hit a crossroad and things don't necessarily happen well for them.  "Well, my dad was laid off twice and survived.  When he wasn't able to get a job, he didn't stop being a good father, he didn't stop being a good person.  He kept putting one foot in front of the other to persevere until something came along that ultimately ended up being better than what was left behind."  So again I wish I had a crystal ball.  But hopefully they'll be able to look back at their lives as young people, and despite the fact that I'm sure I'm a pain to them, I tell them, "That's my job, to annoy you (unclear) your pain," that they have memories that allow them to endure whatever they're going to have to endure in life and to become the people that God means them to be.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead, sir.
Speaker 2: So during, during my second stint at Sports Illustrated, we decided to look at race and sports twenty-five years after the groundbreaking story that SI had done on race and sports and then part of that--we convened a group of people representing various aspects of the sports industry, some famous, some not so famous, for a Q and A [question and answers] that was very illuminating, very enlight- enlightening.  It included people, people like Buck Williams, who was an NBA [National Basketball Association] player, Vivian Stringer [C. Vivian Stringer], one of the winningest college coaches.  Of course, [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron, who goes without any other, you need of description.  We had Olympic sprinters.  We had Anita DeFrantz who is part of the IOC [International Olympic Committee], Bill Walton, the former NBA player and Richard Lapchick, who annually does a survey of each of the pro sports leagues and grades them on their level of diversity in management.  It was a great discussion, one that provided a lot of new insights about the issue of race in sports, and this was just a group gathering that we did in the midst of that discussion.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year you think?
Speaker 2: I have no idea (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: You know, if you'd given me some time, I could have (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Sorry.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: What year does that say?  Nineteen- what?
Speaker 2: I think this is 1990, 1990.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: In the late '80s [1980s] and early '90s [1990s], there began to be a series of crimes where people were being held up for their sneakers.  You know, this was the beginning of the sneaker craze when sneakers were beginning to cost over a hundred dollars.  You know, Jordan sneakers [Air Jordan] and other popular brands, and unfortunately a lot of desperate young people were stealing them from people who simply, you know, were either wearing or carrying their shoes.  And it became such a national story and such a national phenomenon that at Sports Illustrated, I proposed doing a story on it.  It was controversial because we don't normally do covers such as this that are so striking and so definitive about what they're trying to say.  We usually put, you know, athletes doing great feats on the cover or portraits of people.  So this was a very significant story for SI.  It was very controversial, internal and external because here you have a young, clearly African American man with a gun holding up someone else for their sneakers.  So I give us credit for doing it despite the risk because that was the story, and it was something that needed to be addressed.
Speaker 1: Was that well received?  There you go.  Was it--okay.
Speaker 2: During my time at Fortune, diversity was really becoming an issue in Corporate America, and companies were finally starting to embrace diversity in ways that they hadn't before, particularly at the beginning of the wave of the growth of the Latin American population and their rise in Corporate America.  And obviously, you know, the Asian influx, the influx of Asians in Corporate America.  So companies were finally hiring diversity chiefs and people who were responsible for, not just finding talented people but changing the culture of their companies to be more open to diversity.  Some places it worked well, some places it didn't.  And what we sought to find was companies where it was really working so that other companies could may emulate what they were doing and how they did it in order to achieve optimum diversity in their own workplace.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Good.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: And this is going to be--so this is August of 1997.
Speaker 1: Is that going to work for you?
Speaker 2: It's going to--well, we're going to have to do this in stages.
Speaker 1: You know, I went to Fortune after unsuccessfully getting Time Inc. to launch Savoy.  So I went to Fortune to try to bring a little bit of Savoy to--what had been a very traditional--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Just hold the other corner, Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], then take your left hand away from the other one.  Take your left hand away.  Okay, good.  Keep going.  Sorry, I'm sorry to interrupt.
Speaker 1: --What had been a very traditional business publication, to bring a little bit of Savoy to that.  And the big story we wanted to do was how African Americans were rising in Corporate America but really weren't being chronicled on the pages of the primary and top business publications in the country.  And, so I was able to find men and women in areas from finance to beauty to sports and entertainment, who represented that new wave of African American leaders in the business community.  And these were not the same faces that most of us thought about.  We thought about successful people in business.  These were the new faces of black achievement in American business.  So I was very proud to be able to pull this together, and it was really well received in the, in the publishing community as well as in the African American community.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Could you just hold it for one minute?
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think that's Yvette Lee Bowser up there.
Speaker 1: Oh, that is?  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think the gentleman here was the CEO in Silicon Valley.  I can't remember his name right now.  I'm sure there's a key thing in the back.  The one sitting in front of Yvette, he's from Silicon Valley.
Speaker 1: Okay, he might be.  Oh, here it is.  Yep, that is.  He's with Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California], but there's a Carl [ph.] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Very good.  Okay, sir.
Speaker 2: When I came to Men's Fitness, one of the mandates I had was to try to grow the audience and to expand it.  Fitness was obviously a growing industry at that time and one that more and more men were embracing.  And, so the opportunity to elevate the cover subjects to include people like Matthew McConaughey, Jamie Foxx and LL Cool J and others who had not been on the cover of Men's Fitness was something that I'm proud to have done.  You know, people think that celebrities are easily gotten from any publications.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Go on, you can keep talking.
Speaker 1: But before I arrived, a lot of these stars did not appear on the cover.  So the fact that we were able to get many of these stars to appear on the cover was really a turning point for the issue and one that they continue to build on today.
Speaker 2: That's Matthew McConaughey, McConaughey.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.
Speaker 2: And this is Cool J.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this.  Who's this?
Speaker 1: That is Charlie Hunnam, who is a star of 'Sons of Anarchy,' one of the top cable shows.
Speaker 2: That's a nice picture, okay.
Story_ID: 661901
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Tell us about this picture (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is myself and my mom, Ida Mae Johnson [Ida Brooks Jenkins], born Ida Mae Brooks.  Obviously proud of the fact that I had a jacket made out of the same material as her dress, which clearly was not the most thrilling thing for me at the time.
Speaker 1: Year?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know when this is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) okay.
Speaker 2: I was born in '56 [1956], so what was that, probably '57 [1957]?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], okay.
Speaker 2: Seven [1957], '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: My father, Roy [Roy Johnson], in the backyard of our house on a, on a winter day.  My dad, as like a lot of black men in that era, wore brimmed hats.  And I still try to keep that tradition alive.  I did not have a brim on this day.  I had the little earflap cap but, you know, it was--I guess it was picture posing time in the snow in the back- backyard of our house.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Right.
Speaker 1: It was a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in the black neighborhood, the Hutcherson branch [W.L. Hutcherson Branch YMCA, Tulsa, Oklahoma], and my father was on the board of that.  And as part of the membership drive, in order for him to reach his goal, he sold me my first YMCA membership and presented it to me in my dapper sweater and pants.  And obviously I was thrilled about getting my Y membership from my dad.
Speaker 2: And look, he's on the chair (laughter).
Speaker 1: Back in the days before courtside seats were sold to the highest bidder, reporters actually sat courtside and covered the games.  So we all were able to have a front row seat watching some of the great sports events of the world.  This was actually at The Summit in Houston [Texas], which was the arena where the Houston Rockets played.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is just a portrait of myself and Marques Johnson, a player for the Milwaukee Bucks who was a star at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], taken for the editor's letter page at Sports Illustrated during, you know, I think, for probably announcing that I was going to be the senior editor covering the NBA [National Basketball Association].  This was taken at Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] when the Bucks were there to visit and play the Knicks [New York Knicks].
Speaker 2: This was taken probably about seven or eight months into--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --into my time at Savoy.  You know--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Actually put the (unclear).  There, oh, nice.
Speaker 2: That was actually the first--this cover, this Halle cover was actually the first cover where we had to use a stock image.  We really wanted Halle Berry.  She gave us permission to use it but wouldn't pose for us at this time.  She later did.  But when we first launched the magazine, African American stars would not appear on the cover.  Our first cover was a young actress that many people had not heard of, a woman by the name of Gabrielle Union of--
Speaker 1: (Unclear), hold on one second.  Now she's not.  She's got a, she's got a show that's coming out.
Speaker 2: So when we first, when we first launched Savoy, our biggest challenge was getting African American stars at that time to pose for us for the cover.  It was a new publication and their publicists didn't trust us and, so we went with an emerging star, woman by the name of Gabrielle Union, who most people did not, had not ever heard of.  And we called her Hollywood's best kept secret.  We took a lot of criticism for it in the black community.  "Who is that?"  And, "Why you putting her on the cover?"  What they didn't know was that the stars that they loved and supported refused to support the issue.  The second cover was Eriq La Salle, who at the time, was the star of 'ER,' one of the top shows on television and had signed a huge multimillion dollar contract.  But three issues in, we were able to get--get the Chris Tucker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: We were able to get Chris Tucker.  And I will always give him credit as being the first A list African American star to agree to be on the cover of Savoy.  And not only that, but he came to our offices and vowed to help us get other people.  So this was right in the middle of his, you know, stardom with Jackie Chan and, so he was definitely one of the hottest stars out there.
Speaker 1: Oh, that says a lot.  You appreciate people who do that.  Maybe we should do it this way?
Speaker 2: You know, once we stepped outside the film industry for covers, you know, clearly Luther Vandross was one of the people that we wanted to feature.  And, you know, most covers, they tell you that you're supposed to have the cover subject looking at the camera and, you know, giving eye contact to the reader.  But, you know, when he started singing during the photo shoot and gave us this, you know, it just represented, you know, the joy that he feels when he sings and really, I think, the joy that listeners feel when they heard his music.  So we went with something that was a little, little different than what you'd traditionally see, but something that we think really represented him.  Do I have to talk about each of them or can he just shoot them?
Speaker 1: No.  You can--I can just, you can just, we can just shoot them (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's Tiger Woods (laughter).  I had to see (laughter).
Speaker 1: Are you sure (laughter)?  Just in case, you don't know who's processing again.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, what I will say about this issue is, we wanted to replicate the Vanity Fair Hollywood issue, which traditionally and to this day--or traditionally had only white, featured only white actors or actresses, and now features maybe one or two black actresses on the cover.  So this was our version of the Hollywood issue.  And Samuel L. Jackson agreed to do the cover and had some significant stories, not just celebrating men and women behind the scene who were power players in the industry but really asked the question about whether Hollywood was still for whites only.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Here we go.
Speaker 2: Ice Cube (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  Oh.  I've been very fortunate to have a longstanding relationship with Earvin "Magic" Johnson [Magic Johnson], from his early days as a rookie in the NBA until today.  And this was just a candid shot of me talking to him.  I think this was taken in Chicago, Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois] when--at a postgame, after the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] had played the Bulls [Chicago Bulls].  But this is, as reporters, what we, what we did back in the day when there weren't a thousand reporters covering games.  This actually might have been before the game.  This actually looks like it was before the game.  Getting his ankles taped.  Gentleman on the, on the right is working to help somebody else get their shoes ready.  So it doesn't look like this is postgame.  This may have been pregame, before they were getting ready 'cause the locker rooms are open up until forty-five minutes before game time.
