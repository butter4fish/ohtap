Julia Hyun: [00:00] This is Julia Hyun about to interview Susan Semonoff at her office in the
Medical Center of the University of California at San Francisco. The date is March 31st, 1988,
3:30 pm. OK, why don’t we start off with some information about your family background, and
your parents, and some of the motivations for going to Pembroke.
Susan Semonoff: OK. My parents were both born in Providence and my parents both went to
Brown. My father graduated in 1939 and then went to Harvard Law School. My mother went to
Pembroke for two years and then transferred to Simmons when she could afford to go to school
away from Providence, and graduated from there in 1942. [01:00] And my paternal grandfather
had graduated from Brown in 1911. I grew up in Pawtucket and my parents were both very
active in Brown alumni activities, and I had never been that interested in going to Pembroke
myself; I thought I would prefer to go somewhere away to school. And then when it was time to
apply to college I applied to Pembroke and a number of other places, and Pembroke was, I think,
the best school that I applied to, and was accepted, and I was able to live in a dormitory, and
decided in the end that that was where I wanted to go.
JS: Oh, great. So, [02:00] because a lot of the other women that I’ve talked to said they
commuted back and forth, but you actually lived on campus?
SS: Mm-hmm. Yup. Right from freshman year.
JS: What was your freshman year like? What was your first impression?
1

SS: It was pretty overwhelming. I think the first thing that I realized was that academically I was
nowhere near as well prepared as most of the students in my class.
JS: Did you go to public schools in Providence?
SS: Mm-hmm. Actually I grew up and went to school in Pawtucket, not in Providence. I went to
Pawtucket West High School and it wasn’t then, and I’m sure it isn’t now, a particularly
challenging academic institution. So I felt like I was at a real disadvantage when I got to
Pembroke academically and I was never [03:00] a particularly good student. I got more involved
in social and extracurricular activities than I did really in becoming stimulated academically.
JS: So what sort of classes and stuff did you take at Pembroke?
SS: I majored in American Civilization and fulfilled what was in the basic distribution
requirements [laughter] and stayed away -- the most scientific course that I took was psychology.
That was how I fulfilled my science distribution requirement. I think you had to fulfill seven out
of the eight distribution requirements and I didn’t fulfill the [04:00] physical science
requirement; that was the one that I skipped. And in the life sciences I took psychology.
JS: So what was the atmosphere like going to school at that time, in the ‘60s, and also at Brown
and Pembroke?
SS: A lot of different things occurred to me when I was thinking about this and looking over the
questions on the list. I think that the impact of the Vietnam War protests was probably one of the
biggest influences on the experience that people in my class -- or people there at our time -experienced. One of the things that looking back on the experience, and I think even then, was
really [05:00] remarkable was the difference in rules for men and women students, and that
changed somewhat during the time that we were there, I think partly influenced by the general
protest environment. But now thinking back over things that we were faced with, 10 o’clock

2

weeknight curfews freshman year, only I think 11:30 one night on the weekends, a limited
number of overnights -JS: And the sign outs?
SS: Oh yeah, always had to sign out if you’re going to be out after I don’t even remember what
the hour was.
JS: Who did you report to for the sign out system? Were there people in the dorms that -SS: There was a, like, a time clock [06:00] case. There wasn’t a clock there, but it was just a case
on the wall, and everybody had a card with their name on it, and if you were out I don’t
remember if you flipped it over or what. I do remember if you were away overnight it had a red
stripe on it that would be showing. And then somebody checked the board at the hour that you
were supposed to be in to make sure that everybody who had signed out had signed back in. I
don’t remember if that was students who were responsible for checking that. There was a guard
in most of the dorms. I think it must have been a student, but I can’t really remember. At least
when I was a freshman and I can’t remember how far through, [07:00] you had to wear a skirt to
dinner every night. We had sit-down dinners, no male guests allowed, except Sunday dinner,
which was at noontime and I think one evening during the week you could have male guests for
dinner. When you went on the Brown campus you had to wear a skirt or if you wore pants you
had to wear a long coat over your pants. No blue jeans. And none of those restrictions were
imposed on Brown students, only on Pembrokers.
JS: Wow.
SS: Yeah, it’s pretty amazing.
JS: So that was just -SS: Oh, no, we couldn’t live off campus.
3

JS: Oh really?
SS: No one.
JS: [08:00] But the men could right?
SS: Yes, although not -- I’m not sure at what point in their academic career they could live off
campus. I think all freshmen had to live on campus, and then I think seniors definitely were
allowed to live off campus, but I don’t know about sophomores and juniors.
JS: I was wondering, because I was reading in one of the Pembroke records about sign outs to
men’s apartments or something, and there was this huge thing about that the university said
that’s not what we meant when we said you could sign out overnight [laughter] and, you know,
Pembrokers were saying, “Well, but, you know, why not?” And so it was this big thing about
debates back and forth.
SS: Right. That was definitely not allowed. The whole concept of the university being in loco
parentis [09:00] was real important. That was the environment. Your parents wouldn’t let you
stay out overnight at a man’s apartment, so they certainly wouldn’t.
JS: So the whole atmosphere at Pembroke was -- were the women fairly secluded away did you
feel at all or...?
SS: No, not really. We had all of the classes were coed at that time, except for gym classes was
the only thing that wasn’t, everything else was coed. There weren’t any restrictions on classes.
But eating was segregated. You had to have a meal contract and you had to eat in a Pembroke
dining hall. I think you had to eat [10:00] in the dining hall in your dorm, but when we were
there, there was only the Andrews Dining Hall. There wasn’t any dining room -- whatever that
dining room is now between (inaudible) whatever. That dining room is new. I think it might have

4

been there possibly by our senior year, but when we started I don’t think that that dining room
was open. I’m not sure. Anyway, but you had to eat on the Pembroke campus.
JS: And were all the counseling systems and stuff separate too? Women’s advisors, and deans,
and so forth?
SS: Women’s deans -JS: Academic deans and stuff?
SS: Yeah. I don’t remember [11:00] academic advisors, whether the freshman -- I don’t
remember. I don’t think there were different advisors for freshman women than there were for
freshman men, but I don’t really remember that.
JS: So what were the relations between the Brown men and Pembroke women like? Because I
was just reading this -- this was from an article, I guess, that was in a 1966 paper, The Record,
and the article was entitled “Pembroke’s Identity Crisis,” and it read, “The Herald has launched a
broadside attack upon Pembroke, which underestimates and misconceives the essence of this
college.” And then it just went on and on, and it talked about how Pembroke seemed to be
having an identity crisis every couple of years, and that the [12:00] men were taking advantage
about that.
SS: That’s interesting. [laughter] I think it was very variable. I think that partly because there
was such an imbalance between the number of men students and women students that some
Brown men probably didn’t know any or very many Pembrokers at all. And on the other hand
there were some crowds, which were pretty mixed between men and women, and I don’t know
exactly what characterized those. There certainly were a lot of people whose stereotype was the
Pembrokers were all grind, and that they were all intellectuals, and that [13:00] if you wanted to
have fun on a date you should definitely not date a Pembroker, that you should go to one of the
junior colleges around, and went to Wheaton. I don’t really remember a lot of where else they

5

went; there’s some junior colleges in Newport and around other places that people -- I guess
some went to Boston.
I think most or almost all of my women friends dated Brown men, but because of the
imbalance I would say that most Brown men probably didn’t date Pembrokers.
JS: So what was the social life like for Pembroke women?
SS: [14:00] I always found it to be very good, but I think it was variable too. There were regular
mixers Friday nights. Are the gates still there?
JS: Mm-hmm.
SS: There were gate mixers, and there were -- so there were mixers at Pembroke that were just
open to anybody, and I can’t really remember, there must have been mixers at Brown that people
went to, or dated people that they met in class, or in some extracurricular activities, although
some of those were separate. You know, having two student governments, two newspapers, two
yearbooks, separate athletic facilities, but then there were a lot of things that people worked on
together. Lots of women, [15:00] or some women anyway, were on the staff of the Brown Daily
Herald, and WBUR, and stuff like that, you know, a lot of the other Brown activities that women
participated in or that were for everybody.
JS: I know you were involved -- you, let’s see, replaced Laurel Limpus as president of the SGA.
And then right after that there was one other term, I guess, and then they merged, the SGA and
the [CAN?] Club merged, so could you tell me a little about that? Like, what it was like being
president of SGA and, you know, what was going on then, because there were so many...
SS: Yeah. I don’t really remember a lot of what the issues were. I think that most or many of the
issues related to social, [16:00] you know, were sort of socially-oriented: parietals, and curfews,
and all the -- some of the things that we talked about earlier. But I really can’t remember what
any of the other substantive or non-substantive issues might have been. I know I met on a regular
basis with Dean Pierrel, and I’m sure I had my wisdom issues to discuss with her, but I really
6

can’t remember what any of them were, and I don’t have -- I mean, I never saved anything that I
could look back on and see, you know, refresh my memory. I know that there was a lot of feeling
at that time that Pembroke shouldn’t be separate, that we were part of the university, and that
[17:00] the idea of a separate women’s administration was antiquated. And it’s funny, I think at
the time I was really in favor of the merger of Brown and Pembroke, and I think subsequently I
had real second thoughts about it as I thought back on the benefits that I had from not -- from
having our own activities and not competing with men, given the fact that in our society women
are socialized and acculturated to sort of take a back seat in coeducational activities. And I think
one of the reasons that that was true, and people felt that it was true at Pembroke, was that
women were more academically-oriented, it was harder to get into Pembroke, and that was
certainly something that people focused on, [18:00] both men and women students. The women
tended to do better academically than the men, and just the imbalance in numbers, because there
were three times as many men students in each class than there were women students.
So I think I’ve sort of gone through cycles in what I think about not having a separate
identity for Pembroke. I think it’s wonderful that there’s a comparable number of men and
women students, and I’m sure that that has changed the environment even more than having just
a same role administrative structure and housing structure, probably more than anything else.
And I’m sure that that makes opportunities a lot more available and just the fact that expectations
for women have changed [19:00] so much in the last 20 years that I’m sure that doesn’t happen
as much now as it did back then.
JS: What do you see as the greatest change for women in the past 20 years?
SS: At Brown or in general?
JS: In general.
SS: Change in expectations. That when I went to college and when I graduated, the expectation
was that women would get married, have families, and be primarily responsible for raising them.
And while I think that’s certainly still true for lots of people, there’s much more of an
expectation now that women will have independent careers, and while they might also have
7

families, and be equally or primarily responsible for those families, the expectation is very
different.
JS: I’m just wondering if -- this is kind of for [20:00] my own benefit for my project -- but do
you think that the changing expectations have put more pressures on women or has it made
things easier?
SS: Different pressures. Pressure to succeed professionally, financially, as opposed to succeed in
getting a man. I used to think early in my career that I had a lot more flexibility and I was a lot
more relaxed about my accomplishments professionally, because I knew that I wasn’t solely,
primarily responsible for [21:00] the family finances in perpetuity, [laughter] but I was for a
while. And a lot of the men that I worked with when I started out had the expectation that for
their whole lives they would be primarily responsible for the financial security of their family.
And I think that put pressure on a lot of them that was very different from the kind of pressure
that I had. And maybe that means that it’s different for men now too, because their expectation is
that they won’t be solely responsible for their family’s finances, assuming that they marry, but
that they and their wife will share the responsibility, and that they will hopefully have balancing
cycles in their careers. So I don’t know. I think that the pressures are different. Certainly the
professional [22:00] pressures are greater, but I don’t know. I guess I would used to have said
yes, that there’s definitely more pressure on women now than there was then, but I think that it’s
probably balanced by other changes.
JS: So what did you do after you graduated? What sort of work did you go into?
SS: I was a banker. I went to work at what was then Industrial National Bank, and it’s now Fleet
Bank, in their management training program. When I was graduating I was interested in finding
a job. I didn’t have any particular career aspirations. I had never been particularly interested in
business or finance. In fact, I just remembered this, I had [laughter] kind of thought I would like
to be a librarian [23:00] and looked into some opportunities both at Brown, where I had worked
in Rockefeller Library part-time as a student, and also I guess at the Providence Public Library,
as well as looking into banking -- partly because a classmate, who had graduated the year before,
8

had gone to work at this bank, and banks were one of the kinds of companies that recruited at
Pembroke -- and ended up deciding that, because I was getting married and needed to support me
and my husband, that I would take the job that offered the most money. And I knew I didn’t have
to do it forever -- medical school is only four years -- and if I didn’t like it I could quit then and
do something that [24:00] interested me more. As it turned out I liked it a lot. My husband and I
lived in Providence for two years while he finished up at Brown in the medical program, and
then moved to Boston so that he could do his last two years of medical school, and I got a job in
a bank there -- different kind of job, but also in a bank -- and discovered I loved it.
JS: So did you get married right out of college?
SS: Right. The day after graduation.
JS: Oh really?
SS: Yeah, while all our friends were still there. Yup.
JS: So, let’s see, and you continued in banking in Boston, and then?
SS: Four years ago we moved to San Francisco. We had stayed in Boston while Steve finished
medical school, did his internship, and medical residency, and a [25:00] neurology residency,
and a couple of fellowships, and became a junior faculty member at Harvard Medical School,
and all those times when he had opportunities to change -- you know, when he was changing
where he was with each residency and fellowship, we continued to stay in Boston so that I could
stay at the bank. A couple times we considered other opportunities, but not really too seriously,
and decided that we would stay in Boston, because I really liked what I was doing, and I was
doing well, and I didn’t really want to move. And then ultimately I decided that I would be
willing to move and he decided that it was time [26:00] for him to move. So he looked around
and decided that an opportunity here in San Francisco was the best one for him and we came out
here, a mighty move.

9

JS: Yeah, it was a big move.
SS: And I decided that I did not -- that I’d like to try something other than banking. I had been a
trustee of a small hospital outside of Boston for a couple of years, that one of my customers at
the bank was chairman of the board, and because I’m not an academic person, but wanted to
learn more about healthcare financing, I decided that I would look for a job in a hospital out here
and see whether there was some position where I could use my financial skills and learn about
healthcare. [27:00] And I fell into this job here through a friend of a friend and learned what I
wanted to learn about healthcare. I started out as assistant to the director of finance in the
medical center, and did sort of general financial projects for her, and after about six months she
took on the responsibility for some personnel activities and didn’t want to have another person
reporting to her, so made me responsible for the specific activities that she had taken over. And
then since that time I’ve added on a number of other related responsibilities. We’ve been
working with a consultant for a couple of years on a program to improve our service to [28:00]
patients, and physicians, and other staff members, and I have a lot of the responsibility for
coordinating that.
JS: That’s great.
SS: It’s pretty interesting.
JS: OK, I think I’m going to turn this tape over, because it’s about to run.
Track 2
JS: [00:00] OK, so we were talking about your work and your job, but going back to your
college years at Pembroke, let’s see. These are some of the big social issues, which seem to just
come up again and again in the newspapers that I was looking through and I was just wondering
what you remembered of it. First of all, there were the changes in the SGA constitution and so
forth, and then also I guess there was a big issue about a student who was dismissed and the
complaint on the part of the students was that it was an academic penalty for a social offense,
and the whole issue -10

SS: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) student who spent the weekend at her boyfriend’s
apartment?
JS: Yeah, I think so. Right. [01:00] And it led to marches on the dean’s house, and
demonstrations, and all that. So I was just wondering if all of this was sort of the events, which
led up to the formation of the McGrath Committee and -- or what do you remember about all of
these things that were happening?
SS: Gosh...not really a lot. Now that you mention that, I remembered the student who had been
expelled for spending the night at her boyfriend’s apartment, and it was even before the year
began. It was during freshman week and she wasn’t a freshman. But I didn’t remember how
much of a ruckus it had caused. And I don’t [02:00] know if that’s -- I assume that’s one of the
things that led to the formation of the McGrath Committee, but I don’t really remember the
specifics. I remember a couple of other incidents, and I think one at least predated this, because it
happened during my freshman year, when a couple of Brown students and a number of RISD
students were arrested by Providence police for possession of marijuana. And they were expelled
from school and that was a big flap before drug use was at all common by anybody. Pretty
amazing to look back on it and what a ruckus that created. That was my freshman year though.
And the other one incident that I remember [03:00] was a student -- I don’t remember which year
it was -- who had an illegal abortion and started hemorrhaging in the dorm. And I don’t
remember any of the details of it, I just sort of remember the rumors flying and the stories going
around, because at that time premarital sex was definitely not -- it may have been common, but it
certainly wasn’t spoken about and it was something you really tried to hide.
JS: So it seems just from the things that I’ve been reading about those couple of years -- I don’t
know if this is just the newspapers, you know, the student newspapers are always stressing this
or not, but -- it kept talking about this [04:00] polarization between students and faculty -- or
administration and -SS: And faculty? Or administration and students?
11

JS: Administration and students, actually. So and that there was just this real pulling away and
division between the two. So let’s see, the committee was formed -- was it formed in 1967?
SS: I think it was in 1967.
JS: And it was appointed by President Heffner at the time?
SS: Mm-hmm.
JS: How many other students were on the committee?
SS: There were -- I know Peter Billings was on it. And maybe, possibly one other student. Let’s
see...[05:00] there was a graduate student, [Vikram Tashjian?], who was also, with his wife, a
resident fellow in Miller. I don’t know how he was chosen, but Peter and I were each president
of the Student Government Association. And then there were three deans -- Pembroke dean,
Brown dean, and the dean of the graduate school -- and then three faculty members, including
Peter [McGraw?], who was the chair of the committee. I’d really forgotten all about this. I can
[06:00] sort of picture in my mind a lot of the meetings, where people came and gave testimony
[laughter] (inaudible)
JS: So what would you say were the events, which led to -- was it just a general feelings on
campus overall that there was just, like, a need to review the regulations and so forth dealing
with student conduct?
SS: Well, I think there was a feeling among the students that the nature of the rules was not
appropriate anymore. A lot of the feeling that it was appropriate to question rules like this
[07:00] must have been related to the concerns that people had about the war in Vietnam and the
fact -- just sort of the whole atmosphere of protest and concern about still being treated like
children when our fellow students and peers were being sent off to war to die. I think that

12

probably the disparity between the regulations governing women students and men students
probably played a part in that as well.
JS: What do you see as a significance of the committee’s reports and recommendations then and
also [08:00] in retrospect?
SS: I guess at the time it was the recognition that Brown had to change as societal expectations
for young people were changing. I think within a fairly short time the changes were very radical.
And I have a sister who graduated from Brown I guess six years after I did, and by the time she
finished I think that the whole social environment was entirely different, just in that short span of
time, that things really loosened up. Students were given much more responsibility for their own
conduct and much less university responsibility for [09:00] their social lives.
JS: Just as, you know, looking back at that time and looking at it from my perspective, it was sort
of the beginning of the end of Pembroke, you know, as a separate entity from Brown, because it
seems like a lot of the clubs -- well, when the two student governments merged, and you already
had coed classes, and, you know, just in name only were they being separated sort of, so...
SS: Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, really the differences were housing, and a separate admissions
process, and a separate administrative structure. I guess I would say that the student
governments, while there were two student governments, student government’s not a very
powerful institution anyway, so I don’t think -- while it was symbolic of [10:00] having a
separate administrative structure, I don’t think that that’s necessarily what -- I wouldn’t think
that that had a big impact on the end of Pembroke as a separate entity, but I could be wrong.
JS: What sort of impact did the report have? I mean, how was it received by the school?
SS: I have no recollection.
JS: Yeah. I might have to go back and look at the papers after (inaudible).

13

SS: Yeah, I think it was printed in full. I can’t remember what year, but I’d have to go back and
read the editorials, and even that’s only one perspective. I don’t know. I really [11:00] don’t
remember what people -- you know, if I kind of speculate I would say that students would have
thought it didn’t go far enough and the administration thought it went too far, but I really don’t
remember. It’s funny, because I’m sure at the time I felt like it was really crucial and now I never
think about it.
JS: So were you involved in anything else besides the student government and this committee?
SS: Let’s see, maybe it says in here...I guess I wasn’t on the (inaudible) staff, [12:00] since I’m
not listed there. I had part time jobs. I worked in the library and I worked as a secretary in the art
department, and had my social life...
JS: It’s really funny, I was looking at the pictures of spring weekend, and it’s still the same.
SS: Is it? [laughter] I had been a junior counselor my junior year...
JS: Do you remember the Campus Action Council?
SS: Yeah, I was just looking at this. [13:00] Nope. I think it must have been a radical
organization though, was it?
JS: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
SS: Yeah.
JS: Because they were just in the papers constantly. And I think they organized the delegations
from Brown to go on marches, and the protests, and demonstrations in Washington DC and so
forth. Oh, there was this really funny one that I read about -- I don’t know if it was the CAC or
not, but another group protesting the Egyptology department or something, or the building
having been bought by bad money or dirty money, so it was really funny.
14

SS: Oh, that’s great. I think I was involved in giving tours to prospective students. [14:00] But I
can’t really remember any other -- let’s see if I wrote anything down that I missed here, things I
was involved in...I don’t think so. Going to class, studying, working, finding a husband, student
government...
JS: Do you remember anything about the Pembroke traditions? You know, what is it, May Day?
Or May Queens?
SS: May Queens.
JS: And [15:00] gosh, what else is there? The sophomore masques and stuff?
SS: Yeah, I was part of the group that did the sophomore mask -- oh, I was on the freshman week
committee when I was a sophomore and not sure if I was any other years after that. There was
the father-daughter weekend freshman and junior year, I think, and the mother-daughter weekend
sophomore and senior year. My mother and I won the prize I think sophomore year for the
mother and daughter who looked most alike. But I have it, but I think my mother still has a
Pembroke mug about two inches high that we got as our prize.
JS: Do you remember [16:00] the decision to stop with the May Day tradition in ’68?
SS: No, uh-uh. Is that when it ended?
JS: That’s when it ended.
SS: No, I don’t.
JS: When you think back to Pembroke what are the things that stick out in your mind the most?
Or just your college years in general?

15

SS: My friends, the Vietnam War...I guess those are really the two things that stick out the most.
Not academics, unfortunately. [laughter] Oh, let’s see, I just remember something else, speaking
of academics, which I’m not sure what the connection is. The famous blackout in 1966, in the
fall. There was a big electric blackout on the whole east coast, and we were without electricity
from, I don’t know, maybe 4:30 or 5:00 in the afternoon until 10:00 or 11:00 at night. So we
went to a party in someone’s apartment. [laughter] That was an unusual experience.
JS: What was -- Dean Pierrel?
SS: [18:00] Mm-hmm.
JS: What was she like? You said that you had to deal with her every once in a while because of
the SGA and stuff.
SS: I don’t remember that specifically what she was like, kind of remote, although later I found
her to be very warm, but when I was a student I remember thinking that she was remote. That
really all of the administration and the few -- I think there were a few single house mothers -just sort of just real stereotypical of what you would think of administrators at a women’s
college, sort of the idea of a bunch of frustrated old maids. [19:00] And I don’t know how much
-- rigid, frustrated, old maids -- and I don’t know how much of that would be an accurate
perception if I knew them as adults and how much of it was just the conflict that was inherent in
the relationship that the structure set up at that time, and the idea that they were responsible for
us rather than that we were responsible for ourselves. I don’t know how much of that is still -it’s part of any institutional structure. It’s certainly, you know, a little bit a part of any enterprise
where there’s management and non-management. People don’t like to be told what to do no
matter how old they are, whether there’s any reason to think that the people telling them what to
do might know better. [20:00] But I think that the administrators in general didn’t really serve as
effective role models. They were mostly older, they were mostly traditional, they were pretty
rigid, they didn’t -- at least they don’t reflect what I would think today would have been good
role models. And maybe for their time they were appropriate, but certainly if they drew back on
them today I wouldn’t think that. I think that there were a few people -- I mentioned before the
16

Tashjians, who were the [21:00] resident fellows in Miller. I think that they served as good role
models. Another couple that were resident fellows, who were both graduate students, [Nate and
Nan Summer?], I think were pretty good role models of what turned out to be a better model, or
sort of the more typical model for people at Pembroke at that time.
JS: So in what ways were they good role models?
SS: They were married couples, who had some balance in their relationship, both professional in
some way as opposed to the older administrators who either weren’t married or, [22:00] if they
were married, seemed to have a much more traditional type of relationship. I guess that’s my
bias.
JS: What do you remember of graduation?
SS: That I was getting married. [laughter]
JS: Oh gosh, that’s right.
SS: (inaudible) This is great. Here’s the picture of them. Do these women represent a role model
to you?
JS: They look a little old.
SS: Yup.
JS: It was really funny, when I was looking through [23:00] the newspapers and stuff, every time
they had an article about Dean Pierrel they had this one picture -SS: It’s really awful, isn’t it? [laughter]

17

JS: And they just had it along with every article, the same picture and she’s, like, making a face,
right?
SS: Yup, bad news. I remember, you know, my memories of graduation are all tied up with my
memories of getting married at the same time, and sort of balancing both priorities, both
activities, but I remember it as being a lot of fun. I had -- living in Providence particularly -- had
stayed around, I think, all the other years to go to campus dance and to go to graduation, [24:00]
so it was something that I really looked forward to, and participated in, and really enjoyed. Sort
of bitter sweet saying goodbye to all our friends.
JS: Have you kept in touch with many of them?
SS: Intermittently, some better than others. But I still feel very close to most of them, and I feel
like when I do see them that we can pick up pretty fast right where we left off. I’ve been doing
some fundraising for our 20th reunion and when I’ve talked to people on the phone there’s an
immediate connection, which I think is really nice.
JS: What was it like at the 10th for you when you went?
SS: The thing that I remember the most -- [25:00] I don’t know so much about the 10 year, but -JS: Or any of the reunions.
SS: -- certainly the 5th is the one I remember the best. People were caricatures of themselves.
What I found was that I remembered one thing about people, or the thing that I remembered most
about them was their most pronounced characteristic, even five or ten years later, which was
very interesting -- mannerisms, or attitudes, or looks, or whatever. Come in. (side conversation;
inaudible) [26:00] Whatever it was that kind of characterized people was the thing that stood out
in seeing them again after such a long time.

18

JS: What did you see with the women? What kinds of things had they gone on to do? Like, as a
class, how would you characterize that, if you even can?
SS: A mix of -- I would say I guess it’s that sort of time of transition. A lot of people went into
professional pursuits and a lot of people seemed to be mothers and housewives, but I guess more
than I would have expected -- [27:00] certainly more than I would have expected at the
beginning of freshman year -- pursued professional activities, pursued careers, and I guess fewer
became academics than I might have thought at the beginning of freshman year. What do you
think the mix is in your class?
JS: Of?
SS: What people will be doing?
JS: Gosh, I don’t know. I mean, everyone I talk to has definite ideas of what they want as far as a
career goes, and I think that’s one characteristic in my generation. And marriage is something
really far off for almost everybody that I talk to. They can’t really imagine even thinking about
marriage at this point, [28:00] you know. So it seems like career first and marriage later is kind
of the trend.
SS: There’s a bunch of pictures in here of demonstrations.
JS: I read in one of the papers that Martin Luther King spoke at Brown in ’67, I think at the
spring weekend or something. Do you remember that? I just saw that and I just thought oh my
gosh, you know, wow.
SS: I don’t remember. Gosh, that’s terrible.
Track 3
JS: [00:00] This is tape two of the interview with Susan Semonoff, March 31st, 1988. (break in
audio) Well is there anything else that you can think of or you’d like to -19

SS: I can remember that we had to protest Bob Hope being given an honorary at our
commencement. And all or many of us wore white armbands, and when he was given his degree
we stood up and turned our backs on him. Felt very righteous about it, and felt that that was very
characteristic of the insensitivity [01:00] of the Brown administration to what was going on in
the real world or (inaudible) corporation, what was going on in the real world. (inaudible) Oh, no
men in the dorm rooms.
JS: So if you did entertain men, you’d have to come down to -SS: You could entertain them in the lobby, in the lounges. You could have men in your room on
Sunday afternoon from 2:00 to 4:00, or 1:00 to 4:00, or something, with the door open and three
feet on the floor. [laughter] [02:00] Gosh. That’s pretty much all I had written down on here...I
remember the Pembroke library. Great place to study. Is it still there?
JS: Mm-hmm. OK, well thank you so much -SS: Oh, you’re welcome.
JS: -- for volunteering to do this.
SS: Well, I hope it was helpful.
JS: I’m sure it was.
SS: What are you going to do with this?
JS: I’m using it as part of a journalism project and it’s also going to go into the archives for the
oral history. And I think part of this being compiled for the centennial of women at Brown,
which is coming up, and they’re writing a book on this stuff too, so I think they’re going to be
taking pieces from different oral histories and from the men.
20

SS: [03:00] What’s your journalism project?
JS: It’s supposed to be an immersion project, which is an in-depth article on something, and so I
chose to do it on the history of women at Brown, spanning from the ‘20s to basically now.
SS: Do you get to write about your own experiences for that?
JS: Yeah, he wants us to sort of take a personal angle and relate it to something, so that’s what
I’m doing.
SS: That’s great.
JS: OK, well, I’m going to stop this tape now.
