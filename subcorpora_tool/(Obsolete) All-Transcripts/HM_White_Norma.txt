Speaker 1: The first part of this interview will be used for a documentary about the Alpha Kap- Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  So, I'm gonna start there is that okay?
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: On your election, what influenced your decision to make or seek the position, I'm sorry, can you stop for a second.  What influenced your decision to seek the position of supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: I had served as regional director and at the end of that term I was encouraged by the present supreme basileus to run for office.  I did and I was not successful.  So, I continued to work and do other things in the sorority chair, serving on committees, chairing committees, and I never stopped working and then when I was selected as the international program chairman I was encouraged again by the supreme basileus at that time to seek the office and I did and was successful.
Speaker 1: Who was the supreme basileus that encouraged you the first time and the second time?
Speaker 2: The first time it was Bernice Sumlin [HistoryMaker Bernice Irene Sumlin] and the second time [HistoryMaker] Mary Shy Scott.
Speaker 1: So how would you describe your ascension to supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well, I started at the bottom and worked my way up the ladder to the top.  You know I started out as an undergraduate and the first office that I held was tamiochus, which is treasurer of the undergraduate chapter.  When I graduated from college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], I immediately transferred to the graduate chapter and served in various capacities.  My mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] was a basileus of that chapter, and I followed her as a very youngster as basileus, and then after that time I became regional director.  When I ended my term as regional director, they needed someone to run for basileus again, and they asked me if I would do it.  I said for two years only, but I served another four year term.  And so from there you know I just continued to move.  Mattelia Grays [HistoryMaker Mattelia B. Grays] appointed me to the first real big national appointment as a member of the national program committee and from then on I just moved from serving on committees to chairing committees and on up.
Speaker 1: So what really propelled your candidacy for supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: What propelled your candidacy for supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: At that time I was serving as chairman of the International Program Committee and in that position I had an opportunity to network with members of the sorority all over the world, and so this sort of helped me to be in the limelight.  You know I was on programs, I participated in regional conferences at national conventions and so I was very visible and from this it just sort of took off.
Story_ID: 589267
Speaker 1: You had a vision for the sorority.  What was your vision for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Leadership was the thing.  I felt that we needed to prepare members for leadership in the community as well as in the sorority and so my theme was blazing new trails because I felt that we needed to blaze trails and lead the way.  I am the only supreme basileus who has served in two centuries.  I closed out the 20th century and carried them into the 21st century, so I felt that leadership was very important as we moved from one century to the next.  And I felt that we needed to train our members so that they could move like I moved, and if we don't prepare someone to be ready to take over, then we're gonna fall apart.  So, we wanted to do it at the chapter level, so that we would have people in chapters who were prepared to lead at that level, at the regional level, and then at the national level.
Speaker 1: Who or what influenced your vision for the sorority?
Speaker 2: Well many things.  First of all, my mother was initiated two years before I was.  I was in high school when she was initiated.  And so when I went to college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], you know, that's all I wanted to do get there, make good grades, and be able to go into the sorority.  So, I had seen the things that she had done, the leadership examples she had set for me all of my life.  You know she was a leader, she was a teacher, a leader in the church, a leader in the community, so I wanted to follow in her footsteps.  And then in traveling around and meeting members in various chapters and various regions this inspired me to want to do the best that I could and to want to set the best example that I could for them.
Speaker 1: And tell me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Ruth Cummings Solomon.
Speaker 1: In what ways was your vision designed to ensure that Alpha Kappa Alpha, of Alpha Kappa Alpha's survival?
Speaker 2: Well as I said if, if we prepare members for leadership, then we're gonna make certain that the sorority is in good hands in the future.  If we have people who move into this position who are not properly prepared, and we've seen this not only in organizations but in our country.  When we get people who move into positions and they're not prepared for it, then things are not going to move forward and we will not be successful in the things we want to do, so this, this is what propelled my, my vision for the leadership training.  Let's get everybody prepared.  You know there's a saying that leaders are born, not made.  Well if they're born, they still have to be stroked and trained and helped along the way so that they can be better leaders.  And then there's another school of thought that says that everyone can lead, everyone can follow.  You have to be a good follower in order to be a good leader.  So, if we took a person who really wants to do something, wants to be a leader and we give them the proper training that they need and the proper nurturing, then I felt that we would be able to have a cadre of members who could step into leadership sponsoring sorority.  Not only supreme basileus, but as regional directors and as committee chairs.  It's, it's just as important to have people who know what they're doing working as committee chairs as it is to have them in top leadership positions.
Story_ID: 589268
Speaker 1: How was your vision communicated and carried out throughout the sororities programs during your administration?
Speaker 2: At my election [to supreme basileus], the program was presented at the boule to everyone and then I had the first international program lunch after I had been in office a couple of months where we invited all chapters to send representatives to a central spot so that the total program, the total vision could be presented to them and in this way everybody went home with the same information, with the same enthusiasm, so that they could go back and motivate their chapters.  It was also communicated through our Ivy Leaf.  Every issue of the Ivy Leaf carried my message and information about program, what it is and how it should be implemented.  Another part of that vision was preparing our students, and so we had a program called ON TRACK and the goal there was to keep twenty thousand students on track during my term of leadership.  And we wanted to keep them on track academically, socially, physically, spiritually, and chapters were asked to conduct programs around the country that would help to do this and we were able, we were very successful with the program.  We didn't reach our twenty thousand goal, but we did keep fifteen thousand on track.  At the end of the four years, the chapters who had implemented the program were, should have proven to us that the children stayed in school, they were not suspended, they got promoted, you know they were good citizens, they felt good about themselves because self-esteem is so important with young children.  We started with the children in sixth grade and worked with them over the four year period.  So, that, that worked out very well for us.
Speaker 1: So you told me some things that you did to communicate your vision, was there anything else that you specifically did to successfully communicate your vision and effectively institutionalize it as a guiding principle?
Speaker 2: Well, I went around the country speaking in and out of the United States to chapters and to various communities, to all of the regional conferences.  We have ten regions in the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] and so I went to all the conferences every year and talked with the members there about what we were doing.  We started with the state of the sorority and in the state of the sorority speech, that's where I would tell them what the goal, goals were for that year and what we had accomplished during that time.  And so this helped members because I would say we have about ten to twelve thousand members who go to regional conferences, you know when you combine all of them together, so to be able to reach that many people.  And then we also have cluster meetings.  Every region has from six to eight or ten clusters, so I was able to go to many of those and talk with the members because that, to have a national president there so that they can look eye, eye to eyeball it makes a difference.  And of course you know it's good to read about it in the Ivy Leaf, but then it's also good to see that person so that they can talk with you and feel in touch and hug and kiss.  And then we made, well at that program launch, we did video on sisterhood and that was shown at all of the meetings and various chapters purchased the video.  So in fact all of the chapters were given a copy so that when they brought new members into the sorority they could share this with them.  And in this video it talked about the sisterhood, what it really is, and what is expected of members and what the sorority has done and can do and how they can connect and communicate and be able to inspire others through what we do.
Story_ID: 589269
Speaker 1: What leadership style did you use to bring your vision to fruition?
Speaker 2: Well, you know you have to combine various styles in order to be able to get people to participate.  Some people have to be pushed and some all you need to do is make a presentation to them and let them know what is expected of them and they will do it.  So, I had to combine many things in order to be effective.  But I'm, you know I'm a very low key person and I love to, to be with people and to talk with them and to--you know they always called the touchy feely supreme [supreme basileus] because they felt that I was approachable.  They could come to me, anybody could come to me and talk with me and they appreciated that.
Speaker 1: As the individual with the ultimate responsibility for making decisions which would shape the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], what was the fundamental test you apply?
Speaker 2: In order for a sorority to, to be successful, it takes vision and it takes participation.  It takes doing something, doing something about it.  You know I don't do a lot of talking, but I do work very hard in order to accomplish my goals and so I was able to look at what needed to be done.  Being in Florida with the national office in Chicago [Illinois] you know I knew I had to spend some time there.  I wasn't there around the clock because we have an executive director who is there to run, to run the office and carry on the business of the sorority, but I did spend a lot of time there because you do need to look at, at all parts of the sorority.  Program is the heart of Alpha Kappa Alpha, so we wanna make sure that our program is intact and that chapters are doing their share towards participating in the program.  But then membership is important, so we need to make, I had to make certain that the members felt good about the sorority because it doesn't matter how good the program is, if the members don't buy into it, then they're not going to implement it.  So, that the implementation by the membership is important, the leader has to have the kind of committees working with her who are going to make certain that the program is carried out and the members are participating.  And then, of course, everybody needs, has to have the financial backing.  The sorority has to be solid financially.  And so the national president has to be the overseer and make certain that things are going right there, because if you don't have the finance that you need to back the program, then it's not gonna work.  So, putting all of these things together, the program with the membership, with the finance, and being the overseer and making certain that all parts are functioning.  There are very, several committees in the sorority, and if everybody is doing their part then it means that the, the president doesn't have to be a micromanager.  You know you can just delegate the responsibility and feel certain that it's going to be done, but you do have to do some checking now because there are some people who have to have a little more pushing than others.
Speaker 1: Now you talk about the leadership styles being combined, which former supreme leadership style, if any, did yours parallel?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say because you know when I look back all of us had different styles of leadership and so I, I won't compare.
Story_ID: 589270
Speaker 1: Well, tell me what did you learn about leadership while serving as supreme basileus?
Speaker 2: Well the first thing I learned was if you think you're the leader--I heard someone say this once when I was a very young member--and you look over your shoulder and nobody is following you, you're not the leader.  And so I learned that total involvement is very important and that everyone has to feel that they are part of the team.  It's, it's team work, and the, the team has to be committed to working together.  And when you have a team that's committed to this and they all feel that they're just as important as everybody else.  You know I didn't ever try to make anybody feel that I'm the supreme basileus so I'm above you, you look up to me.  We were all sisters, and I wanted everybody to feel that what, that their, their vision should lock into my vision, but their vision was important also.  And so I, I stressed team work and for them to work together and to get everyone totally involved.
Speaker 1: What lesson or lessons learned was most instructive for you?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes I can get impatient if things are not going just as I want them to go just at that time and I get a little impatient.  And so I learned that you have to be patient and you have to realize that no one person can do it all.  You've got to depend on someone.  That's why I like the song that Hezekiah Walker says we need each other in order to survive ['I Need You to Survive'].  Well, that's a lesson that I learned.  You do need each other and so I couldn't do everything.  I had to depend on other people, so I had to develop that patience and be able to wait.  You know I wasn't gonna wait too long now, but that was one lesson that I did learn.  And another lesson I learned was that the sorority is bigger than any one person and so we have to work for the good of Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  It's not about me and it's not about somebody else, but it's about the sorority.  We're, we're building a sorority for eternity.  We've been around for 100 years, and if it had been operated in such a way that is just to satisfy the needs of somebody when they're in office, then we would not have made it this far.  So, we've come a long ways and no one wants to get in that position and feel that they have caused it not to make all the progress that it could make.
Story_ID: 589271
Speaker 1: Was there a greatest challenge or controversy that you faced, and, and if there was how did you respond?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the greatest things that I faced and I guess most of the other presidents faced is the issue of hazing in the organizations.  All of the sororities and fraternities have been guilty of, of hazing incidents and my goal was to wipe out hazing in our lifetime.  Of course I didn't accomplish it, but we did work towards that end.  I was the first person to establish an anti-hazing taskforce and that taskforce wrote a manual that we distributed and communicated with the chapters [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], had workshops on it, talked with them and I think we made some inroads and that program has continued.  And I hope that in my lifetime I will be able to say that we wiped it out, but it take, it didn't just start yesterday, so it's not gonna end in a day or two.  So, that was a great challenge for me.
Speaker 1: Who did you rely on for counsel and guidance during that time?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two judges, Judge Peggy Quince is now a supreme court justice in Florida, the first African American woman in the State of Florida and Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange who is now regional director for the midwestern region.  They were the two people I called on to help with this project, and of course Carolyn House Stewart who is an attorney was my national program chairman, and so she helped a lot because anytime a hazing incident came up, any, any legal issue came up she was the first person I would call what should I do about this because I'm a person who I don't know it all, so whatever I don't know I will go to the person who has the expertise or the experience to give me the help that I need in order to get that job accomplished.  But, they were the ones who really worked to help in this area and of course they're still working with the program and of course the present supreme basileus [HistoryMaker Barbara McKinzie] is doing some more work with the (unclear).  They've changed several things and so she's hoping that she will be able to fulfill the dream of eliminating hazing.  And all of the Greeks are working on, on plans to eliminate hazing.  Many of them have done various things in various communities to, to conquer this task, but we still find that there are people who find ways of getting around anything you've planned.  Whatever the law is, there are some people who feel that it doesn't apply to them.  So, that's still a great challenge for all of us.
Speaker 1: Was there something that irritated you that spurred you to action?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I found that we had done all that we could to communicate and to say this is where we are and now this is where we want to go and then to find that there were some chapters or some people who were still operating under four, five years past.  You know they hadn't come up to where we are now.  They were still quoting themes from two or three administrations before, and to me you know if you can't move forward and progress with the times and that was one thing that irritated me.  Another thing was tardiness.  I cannot stand people being late and so any time I was at a conference and it's time to start I would say listen we were supposed to start at this time let's start.  And all people are not like that, some people go on their own time schedule.  Of course I have to touch myself now because I, when I go to things and they're late I say it's time to start, then I think you're not in charge (laughter).
Story_ID: 589272
Speaker 1: Now looking at your achievements, by what standards would you measure the success of your administration?
Speaker 2: Okay now what do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: How would you look at--
Speaker 2: How successful were they?
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The majority of the efforts were very successful.  For example, we decided that we were going to build a school in South Africa and at the end of my first two years, 250 people went on a trip with me to South Africa.  We have the post-boule trip after every national convention each year and it's up to the supreme basileus to decide where you're going.  So, we decided we would go to South Africa and so many people wanted to go.  Well, we built the first school in South Africa then, and the members were so excited about it until in 2002 we were able to dedicate ten schools in South Africa, various chapters donated money and some built a whole school.  And so we went back to do this dedication and to pla- put a plaque there to be placed in each of the ten schools.  So, this was a very successful program.  And the news had the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] coat day and this was something the chapters really took hold to because we said they don't have to be new coats, but there are people in places like Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York], well all the cold places where there are people who can't go to school because they don't have a coat.  There are people who can't do anything because they can't stay warm, so we asked chapters to do this and thousands of coats were donated by chapters and given to homeless centers and to other agencies and their various hometowns.
Story_ID: 589273
Speaker 1: You can continue talking about the coats (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. So, all of the chapters were able to participate in this program and project.  But, then we found that in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands they came up with a unique idea that we had not thought about as program people and that was they don't need coats over there.  So what they did was to do uniforms and socks, so they were able to do this for, for their people over there who needed them.  So, I thought that was a very unique idea because you know when we first started talking about program and involving our international members, one of the things that one member said is that we don't do the same thing over here that you all do in the states.  And so I said well don't y'all have health issues over there?  Yes.  I said well you know whatever your health issue is you know we may say that we're emphasizing a particular health area, but health is health, so whatever fits your community, then that is the thing you do.  We know there are some things common everywhere, but then there are some things that are more prevalent in one place than the other.  The same thing with education in some areas, well everybody needs tutorial programs because we know that there are some slow learners everywhere, but then there may be some other things that are needed more than others based on the particular section of the country.  And so the program was flexible enough so that wherever you are you can fit in and fit in well.
Speaker 1: Was there one thing, if any, that you were unable to accomplish [as supreme basileus of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Well one of my visions was to do a lot of homelessness, and I don't feel that we did as much as we could.  You know we did the, the coats, but I just feel that when, you know when I go through the various cities and I see so much homelessness and I see so much waste that we're doing, I just wish that I could have done more to help to eliminate homelessness.  So, that was one thing I was not pleased with.
Story_ID: 589274
Speaker 1: It's said that we do not remember days, we remember moments.  As supreme basileus [of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.], what was your greatest moment?
Speaker 2: You know what I had several moments of experiences, but as I think over, over my life I guess one of the great moments was being able to pin my granddaughter.  I wasn't supreme basileus at the time I pinned her; I pinned in 2007.  But everybody looks forward to doing this.  I was the first legacy supreme basileus and so that was a great moment when I was installed to have my mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] there with me and to have my granddaughter who was a little girl at the time there on the stage with me and then to look ten or eleven years later and now she's a soror, so that, that is a great moment for me.  Another great moment was when we sealed the time capsule in 2000 and we had members and chapters from all over to come and put a message in the time capsule.  And at the time I wrote a letter that it's supposed to be, the time capsule was supposed to be opened in 2050.  So, I wrote this letter and I said to my granddaughter then, I said in 2050 I want you to be able to be there when the time capsule is open and read the letter.  And she said oh grandmother you'll be there.  I said no, no, now grandmother will not be there fifty years from now, but that was an exciting moment for us to have, and we brought all the little children on the stage and you know I was shown holding some of the babies because they're the ones who will be there in 2050 when the time capsule is, is opened.  So, that was a great moment.  And then to be--another great moment was to be able to stand there in the school in South Africa and know that we were providing something that those children had not had.  There were two hundred and something children who were in one school room over there, this big building that they had.  And to think that we could provide something for them that they had not had.  One little boy walked up to me and all he wanted was a pencil.  He said, "Lady would you give me a pencil please," and I thought I said now you know this will make him happy.  And I compared that with our children and no children over here would ask us for a pencil, you know they want a dollar or five dollars or you know what are you gonna give me.  But, they were so grateful.  And then when I went to visit the schools in the Bahamas and in the [U.S.] Virgin Islands all of those children wore uniforms and their behavior was just wonderful.  And I was so happy when many schools over here started with uniforms because I had a principal once who said you know you rise to the level of expectation and if you don't expect much out of the children, they're not gonna give you much.  And if you come to school looking like you are coming to work, coming to do your best, you do better work.  And every school I have been in where children wear uniforms they seem to be so well behaved and so that, that was inspiring to me.
Story_ID: 589275
Speaker 1: If you can compare Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] that you inherited from your predecessor [HistoryMaker Eva Evans] to the one that you left, your successor [HistoryMaker Linda M. White], what would you say?
Speaker 2: Well you know I think all of us want to leave the sorority better than we found it and you know we all want to improve, and I was able to leave the sorority in very good shape financially.  We were able to start, restart our investment program and so we were able to leave the sorority well endowed, and I think that was, you know I was very pleased to be able to walk out knowing that I had left a legacy and left something that we could all be proud of.
Speaker 1: Which of your contributions had the most impact?
Speaker 2: I guess I could say, you know my nickname now is the Flying Supreme because I use as my theme song, 'I Believe I Can Fly' and the members bought into that and still now people see me and they say we still flying because it made them feel that they, they feel good about the sorority.  They feel good about the things that they were doing.  And so I think the fact that I was able to leave feeling that this was the best years of my life, the best experience I could ever have had.  You know when I look back over everything and there was a movie once I think called 'The Best Years of My Life' or something like that [sic. 'The Best Years of Our Lives'], and I thought about I said you know I have enjoyed every minute of it.  I have flown over a million miles, and I never regretted any minute of it.  I never complained.  You know some people complain that this is just so much, well I knew that it was a lot when I ran for the office and so I was willing to do what it took in order to provide the kind of leadership that the sorority deserves and so I never regret any of the things that I did.  I just enjoyed all of it.
Speaker 1: Well, what accomplishment of your administration do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I want to be remembered for involving the total membership.  I want to be remembered for the kind of support and service that members were inspired to render in the community.  I want to be remembered for the monetary contributions we made.  We gave so much money to the United Negro College Fund [UNCF], the Urban League [National Urban League], and the National Council of Negro Women.  The Educational Advancement Foundation gave over $100,000 in scholarships each year during my leadership, and that has continued.  They continue to do that.  We capitalized our foundation at a million dollars just as [HistoryMaker] Mary Shy Scott came in office and of course we've now capitalized it $2 million.  So, we're, we're continuing to move there and so I think that is important.  Another thing that I will, I will be remembered, want to be remembered for is 'A Legacy Supreme' ['A Legacy Supreme: Voices of Leadership in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,' Norma White].  This is a book that I authored where all of the supremes [supreme basileus] were asked to share their favorite speeches with the membership and so this was published just before I went out of office and we went around to all of the regions autographing the book and the members were just so appreciative and they still, well we sold out, and they're still asking do you have any more copies of that book and so this is something that they will always remember.  And now people still tell me you need to publish your speeches and you need to video your speeches.  I said we've done that once.  Well you need to do it again, did you have some new speeches.  So, those are the things that happened.
Story_ID: 589276
Speaker 1: What key elements of the sorority's heritage or legacy have been powerful enough to keep AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] vibrant through the test of time?
Speaker 2: I think I'm your motto, service to all mankind, says it all because through the years when, when I look back over the things we've done there are some programs that we've doing since the very beginning.  For example, vocational guidance is one of our early programs.  Scholarships--we started out giving scholarships in the early years and so we've continued to do the things that worked well for us in the beginning and we've built, added on to it and done more and more each year.  And so the fact that we've been able to continuously give quality service in our various communities is what has made Alpha Kappa Alpha what it is and what it will continue to be as we look to the future.
Story_ID: 589277
Speaker 1: Well then tell me what one thing is essential to ensure that we walk rather than back into the next 100 years?
Speaker 2: I think if we look at where we've come from and to think about a favorite expression that says think little of the past, merely reminisce and think of the good times for the future is what is most promising.  And so if we build on the good things that we've done, but then if we build those up--for example, we started out giving scholarships for five hundred dollars.  Well five hundred dollars, and a child could go to college probably in the '20s [1920s] with five hundred dollars, but today that is, that isn't even book money.  And so when we look at that--I was at a program just this past weekend and I remember when I first got in that chapter the top scholarship was five hundred dollars.  Well Saturday that top scholarship was ten thousand dollars.  So, that shows how we are building on the past and moving into the future.  That's just one example.  And then when we look at program--years ago we were helping the people with learning to read and then we developed into various other programs and now we have what is called the Ivy Reading Academy, and so that's another program that started small, but it has developed into a big thing.
Speaker 1: Has the sisterhood dimension taken a backseat to our pledge to be of service to all mankind?
Speaker 2: Has it taken a backseat to that, I think not.  I think that we're even more inspired now.  Because when we look at our country today and the needs that we have, the fact that we have so many children for example who should be succeeding who are failing, and so we step in to see what can Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] do to help eliminate this problem, what help can we give these students to move them forward.  At one time we had the Job Corps; we no longer have that.  But, then there are other things that we can do in our various communities that will help our students.  We need to concentrate on these students developing self-esteem because I think that probably is one of the things that they have the most problem with.  Now they don't think well of themselves, so that's why you know look at the shootings and killings that we're having going on in the country.  That's something that we didn't have fifty years ago, and now almost every weekend you're reading about something.  So, this is something groups like Alpha Kappa Alpha will have to step in and see how we can help children to move beyond this.  If they love themselves, then I feel that they gonna love other people.  They're not gonna want to do anything to someone else.  But most people who are doing things are people who don't think well of themselves in the beginning, so if I don't love myself what do I care about someone else and I see us moving more in that direction.  Our program now is focusing on economics because that's, that's the key.  If I am poor, if I don't have anything, then where am I gonna get food from?  Where am I gonna get the things I need from?  I don't have a job, so you know I just will go and break in and steal what I need and then go to jail.  So, when we put our emphasis on economic empowerment and helping people to do better than they've done, better than they've ever done in their lives, I think that we're moving in the positive direction.

Speaker 1: What do you perceive as the greatest threat to the survival of the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: The greatest threat would probably be the fact that we, we don't do a thorough job with bringing in members who will come in and adopt the same mission that we have and if, you know if we get people who come in and they're just coming in to be pin wearers, then we're gonna have problems, so we have to do a very good job of--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: What you perceived as the greatest threat to survival.
Speaker 1: Oh greatest threat, okay the, the bringing in members and giving them the proper orientation at the graduate and undergraduate level so that they will adopt the mission of the sorority, feel the same way that our founders felt that, that is the legacy of the sorority, always want to walk in their footsteps and the only way the new people will know is for us to tell them, and so I feel that we need to do a very good job of bringing in new members and giving them the proper orientation.
Story_ID: 589279
Speaker 1: What elements of the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] must be maintained or changed to ensure a perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: Well, it all depends on us, the members.  The members have to be able to live up to the aims and the goals and objectives of the sorority in order for the sorority to survive and you know if we don't do this, then all is lost.  And we say to, for example when people are hazing we say we're not going to let you destroy the sorority because that's what it will do and when you hear of all of the lawsuits that are going on all over the world you know that could be an end to sororities and fraternities and we cannot let that happen.
Speaker 1: What is your vision of a perfect sisterhood?
Speaker 2: My vision of a perfect sisterhood is us working together as a team with us doing all that we can to make certain that we are doing the best job of serving others because we're here for service.  Service is what it's all about, and so that is my vision that we're going to work together as a team, we'll going to pull together all in the same direction in order to protect our country in order to protect our sorority, in order to protect the world.  And with two hundred thousand of us with this goal and with us working and then if we can encourage and work with our other organizations, the other nine organizations then there's no reason why we can't be successful.
Story_ID: 589280
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your family and I want to start with your mother's side of the family so we can learn about your legacy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me your mother's name and where she was born.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Ruth Alma Cummings Solomon [Ruth Cummings Solomon], and she was born in Aiken, South Carolina, on May the 6th, 1914, so she is ninety-three years old now.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories about her growing up in Aiken, South Carolina?
Speaker 2: No, not in Aiken because they moved to Jacksonville [Florida] when she was a very small girl, so I don't know if she remembered anything about Aiken at all.  All we ever know about is (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well did she share any stories about growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  There were eight of them.  Her father [William Cummings] was a minister, and of course during those days you know mothers didn't work, so her mother [Lela Cummings] was a housewife and she was the third child.  There were two boys, and she was the first girl.  So, she became like the mother because she was in charge of doing all of the things that the girl does and she took care of her brothers and of course through the years she became the family matriarch.  Everybody went to her for everything.  So, there were four boys and four girls.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Her oldest brother's name was Admiral Fairbanks [Fairbanks Cummings], and his nickname was Buster.  The second brother was Taft Cummings, and then of course my mother, and then she had two more brothers, Daniel [Daniel Cummings] and David [ph.] and their three sisters, Ruby [ph.], Lillian [ph.], and Thelma [ph.] and of course Thelma's nickname was Betty.
Speaker 1: And they grew up in Jacksonville, Florida?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Jacksonville.  And I sort of grew up with the three girl, with her brothers and sisters because her youngest sister is two years older than I am, and so my mother was a teacher and I would stay around with my grandmother when she was at work and then she would come and pick me up in the afternoon.  So, I sort of grew up with them and it was like I was the baby sister.
Speaker 1: Tell me about where they lived, was it rural or was it in the city?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was in the city.  They lived in the church parsonage, and of course that was right in the core of the city.  And we lived around the corner, which was about two blocks from my grandparents.  I was the first grandchild, so they just you know I was the apple of their eye.  And until the next one came along I was it.
Story_ID: 589281
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your [maternal] grandmother?  Tell me your grandmother's name.
Speaker 2: Lela Cummings.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh my grandmother was my favorite.  I nicknamed her Bama because when I was a child I couldn't speak plainly and so I just, I, I guess I couldn't say grand.  I just called her Bama.  And I just loved her to death and she loved me to death.  I remember that my grandmother would cook.  She wasn't a good cook, but I didn't know it at the time (laughter), but she fixed whatever everybody wanted, that's what she fixed.  And with eight children, of course my, my older uncles were, you know they had gone then, but with all of the others whatever anybody wanted that's what they got.  If they wanted syrup and bread or somebody else wanted eggs, it didn't matter, but I, I remember that and I remember wanting to always help her do things and she always used to tell me that I was a blessed child.  If somebody had an ache or a pain she would give me some liniment to rub them and they would get well, and she said you are a blessed child and oh I just loved that to death.  And of course I would always want to stay with my grandmother, but because she, you know she was not strict.  The grandfather [William Cummings] was different.  We were all afraid of him 'cause he was a minister, so he never had to say anything.  He never raised his voice at anybody.  Neither one of them ever raised their voice at anybody, but we just had that kind of respect.  We knew what we had to do.  And so my mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] knew that I was not gonna stay there all the time.  When she got home, I was going home with her.  So, that was just a matter of fact for her.
Speaker 1: Was there any lessons learned from your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I learned how to share because we had to share with each other.  She, she used to be a dressmaker, not, just, you know just making the children's clothes and so she would make all of our dresses to be just alike and so we learned to sort of be together all of the time and there was just certain things that we all did together.  It was just a part of the family life.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather you said he was a minister and he was stern.
Speaker 2: Yes he, yes he, he worked for the railroad and then he was a minister also and of course everybody called him Papa, all the children called him Papa, but I called him Bampa because I still didn't do that grand, it was Bam.  And of course being the first grandchild he loved me to death, and I remember when he never smoked or drank, but he had lung cancer and he suffered so much.  And I was getting ready to get married and we were just so afraid he was gonna die before the wedding.  And he, he didn't.  He, he held on.  He died the week after the wedding.  But, when I got ready to go to the church I had to go over to the house so he could see me all in my wedding gown, and he was as proud as he could be.  And I remember before he, well we were the first couple to move into our new home when we got married and when they were building the house, this was before he got very sick, he would go out there every day and stand around and watch the people building things.  He just loved to do that, and he would just watch to make sure that everything was going up right.
Speaker 1: Now your, your grandfather and your grandmother do you know anything about their parents?
Speaker 2: Not really I just, you know I've heard things about them, but I didn't really every meet, know them.
Speaker 1: What have you heard about them?
Speaker 2: Now you know what I, I can't remember now.
Story_ID: 589282
Speaker 1: So, back to your mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon], what other stories did she share about her growing up in, in Jacksonville [Florida]? They were in the city. What types of things did she tell you about her childhood or her high school and tell me about her education.
Speaker 2: Well, she was the first one in the family to go to college, and so that was, you know she was a very special person.  Her nickname was Cutie and ever, people still call, half of the church [West Union Baptist Church, Jacksonville, Florida] still calls her Cutie today.  She was very smart.  She was a good writer.  She played the piano, and she just, you know she was the kind of person who could just do everything.  Anything anybody wanted done, they just went to Cutie and she could do it for them. She could sew also, and she was an excellent cook.  I don't know where she learned to cook so well, but she was a very good cook and I, I remember how she used to cook lemon pies and I dearly loved lemon pies.  I like the meringue off the pie.
Story_ID: 589283
Speaker 1: So you were telling me that your, your mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] was the first to go to college.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What, what college did she go to?
Speaker 2: She went to Florida Memorial [Florida Memorial College; Florida Memorial University, Miami Gardens, Florida] for two years, and during that time you could come out and teach after two years.  So she went, she came out and got a job teaching and then she went back to summer school to get her B.S., and she did that every summer until she finished.  She went to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes; Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And then of course later on during the summer she went to Columbia University [New York, New York] to get her master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Was your mother in the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes she was in, inducted in 1950, and she became basileus in the '60s [1960s]. I think late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Now do you know how much education her parents [Lela Cummings and William Cummings] might have had?
Speaker 2: I guess just high school.
Story_ID: 589284
Speaker 1: Now tell me your father's name?
Speaker 2: Gilbert Solomon.  He didn't have a middle name, so he used to say Gilbert None Solomon.
Speaker 1: And where was he born and when?
Speaker 2: He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1808.  No, excuse me 1908.
Speaker 1: And what did your father do?
Speaker 2: He was a dry cleaner.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories about his growing up in Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was the only boy and he had three sisters, and of course his nickname was Buddy.  They all loved him to death.  He was spoiled, and you know he just sort of could do whatever he wanted to.  And when he was sixteen, his, well his mother [Emma Solomon] had died and his father [Edward Solomon] left Alabama and moved to Jacksonville [Florida], moved to Jacksonville and about a year later he followed him to Jacksonville, so that's how he got down here.
Story_ID: 589285
Speaker 1: What other stories can--and his parents tell me about his parents, your grandparents on your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay I never knew my grandmother.  Her name was Emma Solomon, but his father was Eddie Solomon [Edward Solomon] and he was, he worked for the railroad in Jacksonville [Florida] and he was a part-time minister.  You know he, he was one of the assistant pastors at my [maternal] grandfather's church.  And of course I called him Grandpa Solomon.  And he was a great fisherman and so was my daddy [Gilbert Solomon].  They used to love going fishing.  And of course he was very soft spoken, very low key.  He would go fishing and come home and sit in the chair, and that's how he died.  He, he rocks himself to sleep one night after going fishing and never woke up.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any special times that you might have spent with him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, they lived around the corner from my mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] and father's house and so we would go around there to see him all the time.  And then of course his wife had some sons, she he had some stepchildren who lived around in that area also.  So, it was all in the same neighborhood and we would walk around there to see them.
Speaker 1: What do you, what one thing stands out in your mind about your grandfather and your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather went to the same, we all went to the same church and so I remember he would come in very quietly and he always called me, my daddy also they called me the baby.  They never called me anything else but baby.  Somebody asked my father once what was my name and he hesitated and then he said baby.  He nev- I've never heard, I never heard him call me Norma [HistoryMaker Norma White] the whole time he lived.  He died in 1971, but I just remember my, my grandfather loving to come and see his little granddaughter 'cause I was the only granddaughter, so he just loved that.
Speaker 1: Now what church, what was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: It was West Union Baptist Church [Jacksonville, Florida].
Speaker 1: And your grandfather was a minister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The pastor.
Speaker 1: --a pastor there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 589286
Speaker 1: And tell me about your father's [Gilbert Solomon]--tell me the names of your aunts and uncles on your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay he had the three sisters, one was called Eddie May [ph.].  I met her.  One was Carrie [ph.], but she was the oldest.  Carrie was the oldest.  And then he had one named Marie [ph.].  He had another sister.  It was four, four girls, but she died before I was born, and I you know all I ever knew we all called her Doll.  That's all I ever knew, Doll, and she had about seven children.
Story_ID: 589287
Speaker 1: Now when you think about the neighborhood that you grew up in, what really, what comes to your mind?  What, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: When we were in the core of the city and we lived on the main street called Beaver Street and of course there was a market right across the street that was called the city market and of course I remember sitting on the porch on the swings just swinging, swinging, swinging watching the people go over to the city market all of the time and with it being a busy street and of course at that time we had no stoplights or anything.  I was not allowed to go over there without my parents [Ruth Cummings Solomon and Gilbert Solomon] or some older person taking me across the streets, but I would look forward to the time of going over there.  And of course we walked to school, all of us in the neighborhood walked to school.  There was a train that divided one section of the city from the other, and my mother always told me there were trains that would stop on the track and just stay there for an hour and the children would crawl under the train to get to the other side so they wouldn't have to wait, and she always told me to never, if I had to wait two hours, just wait, but don't ever do that because one child crawled under there and got killed one time.  And so I remember how we would just stand there and wait for the train to pass by and then we would walk home and everybody sort of lived right, right around in that little circle.  One of my good friends now told me that she never could understand why I could walk straight down Beaver Street and turn the corner and I was right there at the church [West Union Baptist Church, Jacksonville, Florida].  But, she said I would come down her street, which was about three blocks away.  She never could understand why I did that, and she said every time I passed by her grandmother would say, "Oh there's that Solomon girl [HistoryMaker Norma White], and she is just so, look how she walks.  She has so much poise and dignity."  She said, "I would get so angry with you." I said, "Why did she come down this street?"  I said, "I was going to pick up this other little girl who went to our church" 'cause they didn't go to our church.  I said, "I would come by to pick up Monty [ph.]." She said, "Well I never knew until now that that's why you came all the way down there."  I said, "Yeah I would come to get her and then we would walk on to church together."
Story_ID: 589288
Speaker 1: Was there a story that your mother [Ruth Cummings Solomon] might have told you about how she met your father?
Speaker 2: He would come to church [West Union Baptist Church, Jacksonville, Florida] with his daddy [Edward Solomon], and of course he saw her and he said, she said that everybody said that they were selecting some preacher's son for her to marry and of course he was not the one because he didn't belong to the church; he would just come with his daddy, but he never joined the church.  And he said that he, she said he just decided that that's who he was gonna marry.  So, when he asked her to marry him and she agreed and my grandfather [William Cummings] was not the pastor at that time, there was some other pastor there.  And when they introduced him, they introduced him as Gilbert Solomon, sinner man, and he said from that point on other than the wedding he never, her wedding and my wedding and somebody's funeral that was the only time he went to church.
Speaker 1: I, I, I'm sorry I missed the middle part they introduced him as?
Speaker 2: Sinner man.
Speaker 1: Sinner man.
Speaker 2: Yes, and my mother said she doesn't remember that.  She said, "You just said that.  That's not what they said." He said, "Yes they did."  She said, "That's your excuse."  But, he was just determined that that was going to be his wife and it was.
