 Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program.  Today   s date is February 8, 2016. I   m doing a Cowboy in Every County  Oral History Project with the O-STATE Stories collection. I   m talking to Bill  Kosanke in Lone Wolf, and Bill   s son, Brad Kosanke, is also here with us.  That   s about as formal as this whole thing gets. Just to get me started, tell  me a little bit about where you   re from, and I know that should be easy  because it   s not very far from here, who your parents are. Do you have  siblings? Just give me a little picture of how you all landed here.  Kosanke Okay, this country was opened by lottery in 1901, Kiowa County   Oklahoma  that they   d, where we lived, and my grandparents, both sets  (one set came from Kansas and one from Texas) came here at the opening.  Neither one of them drew a claim. We   ve never been lucky, but they bought  out somebody that had one, a relinquishment, they called it. My  grandparents Kosankes settled up here north of Lone Wolf on a quarter  section of land, and my mother   s family, about ten miles up the road. Then  they raised families. My dad had five siblings, two of which died in World  War I two days apart with the Spanish influenza in the Camp Dix, New  Jersey. There   s more people died in World War I with the flu than they did  the combat. That was the family tragedy, but all of them stayed around here  and raised families then eventually started leaving and staying away because  the community didn   t grow. We don   t have jobs. It   s agriculture, and people  migrated, most of them, to Oklahoma City. They   ve got more people. All of  my kids are up there in that area, but anyway, that   s how this community  started. I had one sister that died before I was born in a house fire, which  was a tragedy. They got her out, but she died. I was already on the way. I   m  raised as an only child, and then later on when we got married and then  raised our family here. They   re here and there and     Milligan    scattered around     Kosanke This is home. It   s not much different to me than it ever was because I never  did really leave to stay.  5  Milligan Your mom was pregnant with you when your sister died.  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan How old was she?  Kosanke Less than two. She was a month short of two years, and this funeral home  over here is the result of something that had to do with that. My dad was on  the co-op board. Then 1934, in the heart of the Depression, when this  tragedy occurred, they had an undertaker in this town, but he couldn   t afford  much merchandise. They ordered a child   s casket, and I guess when they  finally got one, they got ripped off royally. The undertaker was going broke,  and he told my dad, said,    Why doesn   t the co-op buy this and hire me? I   ll  work because I   m going broke.    They got their heads together and decided  to do it, and as far as I know, this is the only cooperative funeral home in the  world. (Laughs)  Milligan Well, that   s interesting, yeah.  Kosanke We own it and all of that. That was part of it coming into being. It   s been  here since    36, and some of my friends that come by and then look around,     What   s that over there?    I said,    That   s the funeral home.    They said,    My  gosh, how can you stand to get up every morning and look, see the sun come  up over the funeral home?    and I said,    Let me tell you something. That   s  when you   re having a good day, when you can see the sun come up.     (Laughter) I don   t want to talk about what happens when you don   t see the  sun come up. (Laughter) I   m getting off the beaten path here, but that   s one  of the local deals.  Milligan No, I think that   s perfectly fine. What did your parents and grandparents  do? Tell me a little bit more about what they had done here.  Kosanke The men were farmers.  Milligan What   d they farm?  Kosanke They farmed wheat, cotton, and everybody had a few cattle and milk cows  and chickens. You raised a garden. You can   t really say that everybody  made a living, but in those days, you lived on what you made. It   s different.  There wasn   t any welfare or that. The people stayed, the farmers, and they  branch off into related things to agriculture. Well, I left twice. Of course, I  went to college, and then I went through the Air Force. In the    50s, we had a  draft, and you pretty well knew when you got out of high school, if you  didn   t go to college, you were going to be drafted   the guys. I was going  anyway, but then when I knew I was going to be drafted when I got out of  college, that wasn   t what I went to college for, that go in the Army as a  6  dogface for two years after I got a college degree. We had mandatory  ROTC. At Oklahoma A M as it was then, you had the Army and the Air  Force. I didn   t figure I   d ever be a pilot or anything like that, but I noticed  that the people in the Army of ROTC had to go over to the Army and clean  their weapon every week. (Laughs) The Air Force didn   t do that. I went the  Air Force route, and we went to summer camp after junior year.  Milligan After junior year of high school?  Kosanke No, college. The first two years was mandatory. You could quit after that     Milligan Of ROTC?  Kosanke    or you could go into advanced. When you graduated, you had a  commission, second lieutenant. I went that route. It was a three-year thing,  but sometime before, between my graduation and the Air Force calling me,  they changed the rules. They were tired of bringing people into the Air  Force for three years and training them to do this and that, and then they got  out and went to commercial airlines and all that. They raised the tour to five  years. Well, to somebody twenty-two years old, that   s a long time, but they  had to give me the option of going to navigator school and being in the Air  Force for five years or    we   ll send you wherever we want to or whatever we  need for three.    I took that option. They sent me to Blaine, Washington,  which is thirty miles south of Vancouver on the Canadian border in a radar  station, and our mission was to pick up the Russian Air Force, the    bear,     they call them. Scramble the planes, go up, and shoot them down, that was  our mission. Well, thankfully, it never happened, but I spent my three years  and got out and got a job with the New York Insurance Company and going  to be a farm loan man. Somewhere along the line, I got up one day. I wasn   t  too happy with my boss, which means he wasn   t too happy with me.  (Laughs) I said,    I think I   ll just go home.    I came back here and floundered  around and picked up something here and there.  Milligan Are you still in Washington at that point, or did you     Kosanke No, I   d come home.  Milligan No, when you were selling insurance.  Kosanke No. Well, they hired me, and they sent me to the corn belt, Cedar Rapids,  Iowa, for three months to get me indoctrinated in that. As fate would have it,  here, years later, Brad   s employers bought these John Deere dealerships in  Iowa, and he went to Cedar Rapids. (Laughs) I said,    I was up there fifty  years ago, and all I remember was they had a big Quaker Oats mill in the  middle of town,    and he said,    It   s still there. You can tell what flavor  oatmeal they   re milling today.    (Laughter) Then they sent me to the  7  Mississippi Delta. I lived in Memphis, Tennessee, for a few months, and  then Oklahoma City, and this was supposed to be my home territory. It just  didn   t work out too well. I decided I   d just come home and do my first love  and make it or break it. Here we are.  Milligan Back full circle. I have a couple more questions about what it was like  growing up here when you were younger. You said that your family, they  were farmers. You grew up on a farm. Did your family have any problems  since they were doing wheat and that sort of farming? Did they have any  problem with the Dust Bowl-era stuff? They may not have down here. I don   t  know. I   m just curious. Do you have any memories of your family having  problems with the Dust Bowl time period?  Kosanke Oh, yeah, they had big problems with it, but I came in on the tail end of that.  I was born three weeks after that biggest dirt storm in United States history.  My mother talked about putting the wet rags on the windows and all of that,  but I was just a kid. What happened was the population of the town slumped  by half in ten years in the    30s. They had a special census here in 1925. If  they had 1,500 people, they could get mail delivered to the houses. Well,  they had 1,400 and something, but ten years later, we were down to 700.  The trend is you can go to school here, but you   ve got to leave to amount to  something, unless your family   s   we   ve got basically about ten farmers  now that are doing the job that a 100 did a few years ago and doing it better,  but the downside is that those ten people replaced a 100. That affects your  churches and your school. We grew up going to church twice on Sunday and  all of that, and we didn   t know. I guess practically everybody was poor, but  they didn   t know it, I guess. They knew it, but everybody else was in the  same boat. You helped each other. If a farmer got down (we   ve done this  forever), you   d get together and go put their crop in or something, and  they   d do the same for you. It   s a good place to grow up, but   .  Milligan How big was your school or your classes in schools?  Kosanke Well, I started at first grade. There   s forty-two of us in this room, and the  teacher cried every day because one of them had a problem. He made noise  all day long. We didn   t know the difference, but he made John Deere sounds  and talked all of the time. She was getting whipped out, and one Monday  morning, we came to school. She was crying before we even started, and I  thought,    What   s Gene Tucker done now?    (Laughs) What we didn   t know  was that the Japanese had bombed Pearl Harbor over the weekend, and the  world had changed. Her boyfriend was going to be drafted and go to war.  Our lives changed over the weekend. We didn   t even know it, but people  went off. When they came back, the late    40s, it wasn   t anything for them.  More people would   ve stayed here, but there wasn   t any industry of jobs.  8  Milligan Do you remember a lot of young men then leaving from Lone Wolf to go to  the World War II?  Kosanke Oh yeah. They had a grocery store downtown, and in the front windows,  they had benches set up. They had pictures of the Lone Wolf men in the  Army and the Navy and all of their pictures on there, and then every so  often, they had a gold star. They were killed in battle or died. We had  probably a dozen people who graduated here that was killed in the war. One  was sunk in the Mediterranean Sea. One was blown up when the Japanese  bombed the Pearl Harbor. In the Philippines, they also bombed in the  Aleutian Islands, and there was a Lone Wolf boy up there. He was one of  the first people killed in World War II. Every able-bodied man from  eighteen to thirty-five was in the war. Some came back and managed. My  father-in-law didn   t have to go because he was and my dad was a year over  the draft limit. They weren   t in the World War, but most young people were.  In the school, forty-two in the first grade and twenty-one graduated. We had  50 percent. The people just weren   t here anymore. It wasn   t that they  couldn   t make it in school.  Milligan It wasn   t that they dropped out, just that their families left?  Kosanke If the people were slow, they just kept them an extra year or two. (Laughs)  They didn   t throw you out on the street.  Milligan Well, do you remember much about going to school? Do you remember  what it was like? In high school, did you feel challenged or interested?  Kosanke You know what? I was satisfied with being in   we played football, and we  played basketball and baseball. We had FFA  Future Farmers of America   and all of that just like other people, and we had people come out here and  play college sports. My cousin, Dale Meinert, two years older than me, went  up there to A M and played football for four years. He went to Canada and  played for a year and two years in the Air Force and went on to play ten  years in the NFL and came back here and coached for a while, but  unfortunately, we know now that he was a victim of concussions. They  caused brain damage, spent the last twenty years of his life with just nothing  there.  Milligan Who was that, your cousin? What was his name?  Kosanke Dale Meinert. He   s in the hall of fame up there at Stillwater, and he was an  academic All-American, maybe the first one. He was a hero.  Milligan Tell me about what got you interested in going out of high school from here  to Oklahoma A M.  9  Kosanke Well, I guess I was vaccinated with that needle when I was old enough to  walk. You   ve got to start getting ready for college, and there was only one  college. I never had heard of OU  University of Oklahoma . (Laughter)  Milligan Tell me why there was only one college.  Kosanke My dad, he was dyed-in-the-wool orange and stayed in touch because I  remember when I was probably ten years old, we   d have speakers come  down here to our annual co-op meeting, and they   d get people who had  something to say. Dr. Bennett, you look back    20s and    30s, and he was the  president up there. When my dad was president of the co-op board,  somehow or other, they talked Dr. Bennett into coming down here and  speaking. Of course, we had him out to the house. He didn   t have his wife  with him. I think we invited a couple people. I was about ten years old. My  dad sat at the head of the table, and my mother spent most of the time  bringing food in and out. The women didn   t engage in the conversation a  whole lot in those days, but she did. She liked to mingle with the people.  She was a schoolteacher, and my dad was worried about my etiquette, I  guess. I was taught to be seen, not heard, and here   s the big man. He   s  sitting where you are, and I   m sitting over there. My dad   s here. I wasn   t  encouraged to participate, but they grilled me on what to do, be polite and  all that. Then I   m sitting there, and Dr. Bennett, just to acknowledge that I  was drawing breath, I guess, turned to me and asked me something. It was a  yes or no answer. It was a    gimme,    and I said,    Yes, ma   am.    (Laughs) Oh,  I thought,    I   ll never be taken out in public again.    Yes, ma   am. (Laughs)  Ugh. (Laughter)  Milligan What did he do? (Laughs)  Kosanke I don   t remember what he did, but there were some open mouths there. I   d  realized immediately, but I overcame that.  Milligan (Laughter) That   s good. (Laughs)  Kosanke I met the great man once after that. (Laughter) He didn   t remember it, didn   t  change his life any. (Laughter)  Milligan That   s good to know. (Laughter) What made your dad choose to go to  A M? Did you ever talk to him about that?  Kosanke I don   t know that I did because nobody in his family had ever been to  college. Well, there was five of them after those two died, and the older kids  just went to the country school. They were through after the eighth grade.  Well, the last three, my dad and his two sisters came to Lone Wolf and  graduated, and they went on to college. It was like it was a different family  and all. My dad got on a train over here on this Rock Island Road to  10  Chickasha  Oklahoma  or somewhere and took a bus to Stillwater. Why,  what motivated to go there, I don   t know, but they all graduated and were  successful. We were expected to follow.  Milligan You and your two aunts    kids?  Kosanke Yeah. Well, Aunt Pauline, she didn   t have children, but they adopted two  kids. She taught home-ec onomics  down here for years until she retired,  and those kids are in Oklahoma City or doing something. My other aunt, her  daughter lives out here on the farm. She wanted to stay at home, got married  at sixteen and did the best they could, and they   re here. Then the boy that  was three years younger than me, he went to college, Southwestern   Oklahoma State University , I think, got a degree and taught school and this  and that and then went to work for the state, and he   s down here in Altus   Oklahoma . He comes up here every Thursday. He   s got a farm he inherited  out here. He calls it the ranch. It   s mesquite trees and rocks mainly, but he   s  got him a little hideaway out there. He calls it the ranch, and his wife calls it  the money pit. (Laughter) I saw him this morning, but then the next  generations, they   re here and there. I doubt that there   s over three farmers  here under forty, and they   re with their parents and all. The opportunities are  somewhere else now. If you   re ambitious and want to do the most you can  with what you   ve got, they   re all welcome to come back any minute.  Milligan Do you think whenever your parents expected that you would go to school,  you and maybe your cousins that were expected to go to college, that they  thought that you might be the same, that you might not come back?  Kosanke Well, yeah, they probably did, but they might have wished that. I don   t  know. (Laughs) It was just something I was going to do after high school,  and they were all supportive. They might have hoped I came back, but they  wouldn   t have stopped me if I didn   t. There wasn   t any pressure,    You   re  coming back here    and all of that, none of that. The world   s out there, and  we   re here. I went around enough to know when I came back, this is what I  want to do, and I started borrowing money and all of that. My friend in the  bank that went to A M two years ahead of me, I   d go in. He   d see I had  some clothes hanging in the car there. I was single, which means I was  leaving town for the weekend or something, and he   d check, make sure I  was coming back. (Laughs) He got this paper here, you know, to deal with.  No, I never felt any pressure to leave or pressure to come back. Life   s what  you make.  Milligan Tell me a little about then moving from Lone Wolf to Stillwater. When was  that, and how did that go?  Kosanke That was probably September the 13, 1953. (Laughs)  11  Milligan Maybe somewhere around there?  Kosanke (Laughs) Give or take. My parents took me up there, and they enrolled. I got  a room in Cordell Hall.  Milligan Who was with you? Did you say Raul?  Kosanke My mother and dad took me up there and left me, told me I could come  home with my cousin, Dale, at Thanksgiving. I didn   t have a car. They  didn   t want me to have a car. I moved into this dormitory, and that  building   s still standing there next to the football stadium. I don   t know  what it is now. I was in 108, and here   s a boy from Thomas, Oklahoma. We  spent three years together in that room, Lone Wolf and Thomas. He broke  up the relationship. Oh, there   s junior year or something where he got  married, and I wasn   t welcome. (Laughs) I could say something, but it might  not, you might have to edit it. I   m going to say it anyway because it is  funny. (Laughter) Those Thomas guys, if they had a saying, they thought it  was the biggest one in the world, and Larry Jones always, they talked about  dates or something.  Well, there   s twelve guys to one girl up there, and we didn   t even call  anybody, didn   t have a car, wasn   t going to get a date. He had always had  that Thomas expression, says,    I   m okay. I sleep between Fay and Bessie  every night.    Well, that   s two towns. Thomas is in between Fay  Oklahoma   and Bessie  Oklahoma . He got married, and they invited me over there one  night. I went over there and blew that deal. I said,    Well, Jones, you still  sleep between Fay and Bessie every night?    He got red in the face, and she  got mad, I guess, and never invited me back. (Laughter) We   re still friends.  They live up there in Thomas, and here I am, just got to be careful what you  say, I guess     Milligan    or when you say it. (Laughter)  Kosanke Then after three years there, I made a lot of friends, and three of us decided  our senior year that we   d cramp our style. We   ve got a car now. We might  actually have to get a date or something and go to a movie. We rented an old  duplex house down on North Main  Street . It   s fallen since, fallen down,  went down the creek. These guys, one of them was really intelligent, gifted,  I guess. He got a PhD and taught something out in New Mexico. All those  were successful, but that year was a disaster. It   s a good thing we didn   t  move out sooner, but that was part of the education.  Milligan What was the disaster about it?  Kosanke Well, we discovered that there was a pub across the street from our house  there, and we could eat a chili hot dog or something and drink a brew. From  12  time to time, there was a little too much beer and not enough hot dogs, but  we got through that. I   d never even told them that deal. (Laughter) They  knew that we were getting a little more liberal education. We   re going out in  the wide world. We   ve got to blend in. We all went our separate ways, but  we   ve pretty well kept in touch. My old roommate   s still up there at  Thomas, and his son   s farming with him. I   ve lost touch with some of them,  but that   s a long time ago.  Milligan That   s true, but you still know where everybody is. That   s impressive.  Kosanke When we had our fifty-year reunion, which was nine years ago (that   s hard  to believe), there was about forty-five of us in that class of    57 in agriculture  that come back up there. That was a big occasion, and we really enjoyed it.  You know full well you   ll probably never see most of these people again,  but that   s not today. Here we are, and what I know as well is it didn   t make  a difference if somebody was a bank president and one guy was a dean of  agriculture at Texas A M, which is high as you go there, people, different  careers, lawyers and all of this, but nobody talked about what you   d done,  what you   re going to do. You just turn back that page about fifty years. For  a day, we were back in the good old days. (Laughs)  Milligan Was Stillwater an adjustment for you when you first got up there? Do you  remember your first couple of weeks moving to Stillwater from here?  Kosanke It wasn   t a great deal of adjustment because I was in that dormitory, and we  walked to classes. On Tuesday, we were going to march out there, and  campus corner was the closest thing to, if you was afoot, walk up there to a  movie or something. We were just isolated there from the   we weren   t in a  fraternity somewhere, and we kept in touch. That was neither here nor there,  but I didn   t do a whole lot of adjusting, I don   t think, because you just  settled into your routine. That   s about what you could do.  Milligan You majored in the agricultural school.  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan Was there ever any thought on your end of going to anything else besides  agriculture? How   d you land on that?  Kosanke Well, I landed on it because that   s all I knew when I went, but then I didn   t  go into the cattle part of it or the field crops. I really left the school of  agriculture because I was in agriculture economics, and about half of our  courses is over in business school. I got a little bit of orientation to  something besides agriculture. I don   t guess I ever had a five-year plan or  ten-year plan. It was,    Here   s what we   re doing now.    I didn   t get married  until I was thirty-four. (Laughs)  13  Milligan That   s old. (Laughs)  Kosanke Yeah, it was old, and Ann   s eight years younger than me. Last year, one of  our friends came up here and was talking to me about her condition and all  and how bad that was. She said,    I   m going to tell you something I   ve never  told anybody. I tried to talk  Ann  out of marrying you.    (Laughs) We   re out  here in the cemetery. I   m helping her trace some of her ancestors. She   s in  Texas.    I wondered why I never was around you much. They said,    Janie  Hicks is coming,    but I never did see you.    She said,    Now she   s lucky to  have you.    I said,    Well, thank you.    (Laughs)  Milligan Did she tell you why she felt that way?  Kosanke I was older. She said,    I told Ann, I says,    He   s going to be an old man, and  you   re going to be wanting to go places and do things. He   s not going  to   .       Well, she was right. (Laughs) We did pretty much what we want to  do, that you could do with a family, should have take more vacations, seen  more, done more, but there   s always something else to do, I guess. We took  a family trip or two. I guess they remember it. Do you remember when we  went up there to Idaho and I took a team back?  Brad Kosanke Yes.  Kosanke It was a wheat commission meeting in Idaho. We took the van, and we went  through all the places I had been on the trip when I was a kid. We went to  Denver and saw the dinosaurs, and we went to Yellowstone. We went on up  through there to Idaho and then out to the ocean and back down. I had  wanted to make sure they swam in Great Salt Lake like I did, get salt in your  eyes and all of that. (Laughs) What a disappointment. A 1,000 miles, we  drove. My two cousins was with us. They were a little older. We had ran out  there and jumped in that lake and went under and got our eyes full of salt  and our hair standing up. (Laughs) What a letdown, but you got in there,  didn   t you?  Brad I sure did.  Kosanke It   s something you   ve got to do.  Milligan Did he throw you in? (Laughter) It sounds like he was so eager for you to   .  Brad (Laughter) No. I just remember floating in it. That   s what I remember is  floating in it. It   s very salty.  Kosanke You had to go out there far enough to float. There   s just two places in the  world you can do that, Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea. (Laughs)  14  Milligan Did you do it when you were a kid? Did you go out there and float?  Kosanke Yeah, I went when I was twelve years old. We took a trip through the eleven  western states, and this Dale Meinert kid was with us and another older  cousin. If there was something on the map, we did it. We went to Grand  Canyon and the Boulder Dam and the Golden Gate Bridge and the ocean  and the Great Salt Lake and the whole bit.  Milligan How long did that trip take?  Kosanke About two weeks in a    41 Chevrolet. (Laughs) I don   t know how we got  three kids and two parents and any luggage in that thing. It was a two-door     but we did, didn   t know any better. We saw the Redwoods, and  everything on that map of interest, I think we saw it.  Milligan That   s an epic vacation.  Kosanke Yep, been there and done that.    Oh, yeah, I remember that.    (Laughter) Las  Vegas wasn   t any big deal then. They didn   t have any strip or any of that.  They had the Golden Nugget  Hotel   Casino  and a few deals downtown.  We went through there, stopped at about every pottery or Indian blanket  place on the road, I think, all that stuff. The free zoo, you paid to have some  handle on the back of you. It was free to go in, but you had to pay to get out.  (Laughs) I hadn   t thought of this stuff for years. (Laughs) That   s enough of  that, I guess. I made sure they saw some of those things that I   d seen, and  now they   ve been places I   ll   never dreamed of. See, I   ve got Irish  ancestors and had German ancestors.  Brad   s  been to Ireland and Germany.  Didn   t John Deere have a factory in Germany or something?  Brad Yes, yep.  Milligan They sent you to go check out the factory in Germany?  Brad Yes.  Kosanke Then the Irish, I think he won that trip, and I told him, says,    When you get  over in Ireland, if you get a chance to go to a pub, see if there   s any Dunns  in there because if there   s any left, they   ll be in the pub    because they was  all pretty good to bend their elbows. (Laughter) He came back and says,    I  made two pubs. I don   t know if there was any Dunns in there, but if there  were, they was having a good time.    (Laughter) I think they starved out in  the Irish famine probably.  Milligan Well, that   s some big families, though. I   m sure there   s some stragglers.  15  Kosanke I don   t know how much of this you can stand. (Laughs)  Milligan No, I   m totally fine.  Kosanke (Laughs) Okay.  Milligan If nothing else, I   m entertained, but it   s also interesting. When you did go to  OSU, I know you talked a little bit about, you got used to it pretty quickly. I  guess the campus wasn   t, it was pretty contained at that point.  Kosanke Yeah, yeah. Downtown was too far to walk unless you really wanted.  Milligan Did you end up dating much? You talked a little bit about that, but not  really. You alluded to everybody around you. (Laughs)  Kosanke Yeah, yeah, not for two years, no, couldn   t get too excited about going and  walking a girl to campus corner and back. (Laughs) Most of us got cars after  two years, and then I made an effort. It was pretty tough because you  consider twelve guys to one girl, and we figured out pretty soon that some of  those girls had a boyfriend back home. Some were pinned to a fraternity guy  or something. We got acquainted the best we could. I remember having a  blind date with a girl for the senior prom, and we got down there. We had  the Four Lads. They were the big deal then, singing    Moments to  Remember    and all this, and we   re out there mingling around. Everybody  just stopped, went down in front. Jan Garber    His  Orchestra and the Four  Lads, this was bigtime stuff. Everybody sat down on the ballroom floor  there, the girls with their formal prom dress and all of that, and I   m sitting  there thinking,    I   m probably going to have a cleaning bill over this, this  girl   s dress.    (Laughs) I thought,    Oh, I bet she   s sick of this,    and I  remember her because her name was Anne. I   m thinking,    She probably  thinks this is a downer,    and she says,    This is a moment to remember. I   ll  remember this.    I said,    Oh, okay. We   re all right here.    (Laughter) Of  course, I left and never saw her again, but in that directory there, I look up  people that I wondered what happened.  Milligan The alumni directory?  Kosanke That girl was a principal or something in a school or department head or  something and did well     Milligan    and probably still remembers that.  Kosanke Yeah. I do. It was one day out of many.  Milligan What were some of the things that happened on campus? Did they have  Homecoming? Did you go to sports? What were some of the things you did?  16  Kosanke Yeah, biggest homecoming in the world just like it is now, but I wasn   t too  fond of it the first two years because ROTC had to march down there  downtown and all of that. One year in the dorm there, we got Danny  Williams, who was a WKY Oklahoma City icon over the years. We spent  the night before Homecoming putting crepe paper in chicken wire. We made  this rocket. Danny had this show,    3-D Dynamo        The Adventures of 3-D  Danny     or something. This was    53. Anything would seem like nothing  now, but we made this rocket. We got him up there to ride in it. He had a  robot, and we   d put one of the guys in the dorm in that thing and marched.  We didn   t know the shoes were lead, and he ended up getting an operation  after that, two miles in that. (Laughs) Old Danny, he was whistling at  everybody. We won the Homecoming float deal because we had a celebrity  there. (Laughs)  Milligan It   s a good strategy.  Kosanke Oh, we all went to sports. We had tickets that were paid for with our tuition.  We could see football or even basketball games, but it wasn   t room enough  for everybody for every game. When I was a senior, OSU had a great team,  but Kansas had a better one. They had Wilt Chamberlain. You   ve heard of  him. They had beaten OSU up there in Kansas, and everybody   s all,    Wait  until we get to Stillwater, Mr. Iba.    Well, we figured around, and I had the  right ticket. People were waiting and waiting for Wilt Chamberlain.    Get  Wilt Chamberlain down here in Iba-Gallagher  Gallagher-Iba Arena ,    and  people came from all around, those Kansas people coming through the  dormitory with twenty-dollar bills for a student ticket. Some guys were  taking it, and I said,    That   s a lot of money, but they   re only going to do this  once.    I   d had an instructor tell us when I was a freshman, says,    You   ve  got to establish priorities. You   re kids. When I was up here in 1934, we  played pool at Swims. We were getting ready to leave class and go over  there and get a pool table, and I said,    I   m going over to the college  auditorium since Will Rogers is speaking today.       Ah, we can see him  anytime.    I went to hear Will Rogers. He didn   t come back. He was killed in     35, but I was there. Those guys can   t remember who won that pool game.  You establish priorities.    That was a priority to me. I was at that game, and  we beat them.  Milligan Tell me about the game. Do you remember? Were people excited when he  came out?  Kosanke Oh yeah, yep, but Mr. Iba put two people on Wilt, one in front and one  behind. They didn   t have any shot limit then. I think we were tied with about  six minutes to play, and we got the ball. People wouldn   t stand for this now.  They   d throw things and walk out, but they stalled the ball for six minutes to  take one shot. If you hit it, you   re going to win. They said Eddie Sutton shot  17  it, but it was a boy  Melvin Wright  from Amarillo  Texas . He hit that two  seconds left in the game. We won and stormed the court and all of that, and  then when, oh, the college president demanded a walkout and didn   t get it,  somebody threw an egg and hit the dean of men. That didn   t help the cause  any. (Laughs) I came. Bob Willis and I decided we going home, just got in  the car, and I forgot to get gas. We run out of gas out there between Thomas  at two o   clock in the morning, went home the next day, and my parents got  all over me.    You cut class,    but as luck would have it, they gave us a  walkout. (Laughs) I didn   t miss a class, but that seemed like a big deal. I still  remember it, but it doesn   t amount to anything. It was a basketball game.  Milligan Sounds like a pretty rowdy experience, though.  Kosanke Yeah, it was. That was probably the wildest thing that ever happened when I  was in school. The    50s, we were pretty well-trained to   we knew what  rules were, and we knew we was supposed to obey them. We knew the  penalty if you didn   t, and we pretty well walked the line. It was the    60s  when the guys burned their draft card and the girls burned their bra and all  of that, but we weren   t into that. The wildest thing, I guess, that ever  happened was they had a panty raid up there. That was starting. (Laughs)  Milligan Wait, wait, who did, where? (Laughter)  Kosanke Okay. It made the press. One girl threw their pair of panties down, and one  guy picked them up. They took his picture and put it on the front page of  Daily Oklahoman. He was expelled, and that girl, she was from Roosevelt   Oklahoma , I think, and just did it for, egg somebody on, didn   t tear the  doors down. Nobody got raped, but it was against the rules. Everybody  knew it. This girl  Judy Johnson  from Roosevelt, she told us this later, says,     This came out in the Daily Oklahoman, and my mother got the paper and  read that and this girl and all.    She called Judy, says,    Judy, were you in  this?       Yes, Mother. That was me.       I knew it, I knew it,    her mother said.  This girl told us this later.    Yeah, it was me, Mother.    (Laughter) They  brought the firetruck out and turned the hose on everybody, and it was the  end of that. (Laughs)  Milligan Did they really?  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan (Laughs) Was this just a group of guys that went to the girls    dorm just to be  ruckus?  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan Okay. (Laughs)  18  Kosanke That was something that was going on on campuses at that time. We just  happened to be   well, it was the only time it happened there. (Laughs) That  was risqu  . I mean, that was outside the limits there. (Laughter)  Milligan That would be memorable...  Kosanke Yeah, it was.  Milligan    especially since it made the state newspaper.  Kosanke You know by now that I   ve got all these stories. My lawyer over here at  Hobart  Oklahoma , he   s ten years younger than I am, but our dads went to  school together. We do things together besides, well, he   s related to Ann, I  guess. I   m bringing up some of these deals, and I says,    There   s a lady  coming down here to get some information from me, and I don   t know what  I   m going to do or what can I do.    He said,    Well, your stories are more  entertaining than anybody else I know from up there,    and I said,    Yeah,  they   re entertaining, but they don   t have any merit. They don   t go  anywhere.    (Laughs) That   s just something that I remember. (Laughter)  Milligan Those are the most interesting ones. Well, if you think of anything else like  that that you want to share, please just jump in, but I wonder if now isn   t a  good time to talk about what you did after you got your degree. We talked a  little bit about it because you mentioned the whole shift in the Air Force, but  maybe let   s talk a little bit more in detail about that. You opted for the three-year  plan with the Air Force, and you got shipped to Washington. Is that  right?  Kosanke Washington State and at the jumping-off place with the   . It was a radar  station, but I wasn   t trained for radar. They made me supply officer for that  deal, and we had this big radar thing. That was our mission. We had a  technical supply, and we had a unit supply. The unit was basic, everyday  things, supplies and all of that, but our mission was to keep that thing on the  air because we   re defending our nation. You don   t want to slip up and not  have the part for something that goes out there. We   d had inspections and all  of that to remind us that we   re not up there just to put in a day, but my job  was, nothing glamorous about it. It took them nearly a year to find  something for me to do and someplace to send me because they were used to  sending everybody to flight school. I ended up, was a supply officer, which  was fine with me because I wouldn   t ever have been a pilot anyway. We  knew we were in the military, but it was pretty laidback. We had a 180 guys,  and our little town was about the size of Lone Wolf and had twelve beer  joints and stuff. (Laughs) There wasn   t anything to do there     Milligan Supply and demand.  19  Kosanke    unless you went to see, I don   t know, Vancouver or somewhere. It was  just something to do for three years, and I   m ready to move on. I could   ve  stayed in there, but it wasn   t something that stimulated you. You gathered  up the laundry on Tuesday or something and all that kind of stuff. (Laughs)  Anybody could do that.  Milligan When your three years came up, you took the exit.  Kosanke Yeah, and then I got that traveling job through the university. They had  these deals. People were looking for this and that.  Milligan Like a job fair?  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan At OSU?  Kosanke Well, one of my professors gave me this lead, and I interviewed with a  person from this company. They hired me to   well, I was a trainee. I was  going to be trained to be a district manager. My boss had four states,  Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico. It would   ve been a big deal, I guess, if I   d  stayed with it, but I wasn   t getting along too good with the man in  Oklahoma City. I got along good with these others. Come to find out he had  fired three trainees before me because he was turning sixty-five, and he was  forced to retire. They were making him train his replacement. That doesn   t  work out, and I   d been in the military three years and thought I   d taken  enough orders to last me for a while. (Laughs) I just went in there and  requested transfer to Denver, and he said,    I want you to do something.     He handed me a tablet, and he drew a line.    I want you to write everything  over here that you like about this job and everything over here that you  don   t.    Well, I got hung up on what I didn   t like because I wasn   t happy,  and over here, I liked the money. I   d looked at that, and I said,    I   ve  answered my own question.    He did me a favor because I wasn   t going to be  satisfied doing this. I just went in there. He said,    Well, let me see what  you   ve got.    I showed him what I had. What I had was I   d turned in for my  two-week notice I   m leaving. (Laughs) He admired me for that. He said,    I  just had a feeling that I wasn   t your problem, that you weren   t going to be  content doing this.     Milligan What did you not like about it? Do you remember? What was in that  column?  Kosanke Well, no, I really don   t. I just decided that my personality wasn   t   this job,  you went out, and we had a limit. We didn   t loan anything under a  100,000  20  dollars. You   d better know what you   re doing because there   s people out  there that, some of them will default, and that   s going to come back on you  and all of this. I just decided, I guess, that I didn   t, at least at that time, I  didn   t have the drive that I needed to succeed at that, and it was the right  thing because I   d put in an application to Prudential. They had the same  thing at Prudential, and I had three college friends over there that worked for  them. They said,    Man, we got a good deal here. You apply for that.    Well,  I did. I didn   t hear from anybody for about three months, and I   d come  home, borrowed money, and bought a few cattle for the farm. They called  me up and said,    We   ve got a county for you in Kansas when you want to  report.    It was the state manager, and I said,    Man, I appreciate it, but I   ve  already committed to something. I   m going to stick with it.    If I   d have gone  up there, I could   ve done that, but I   d be out of my territory, I guess, or  something. (Laughs) I just didn   t want to be in an office every day in Kansas  somewhere and with my heart somewhere else.  Milligan Were your parents still here when you came back and decided and borrowed  some money to buy some cattle?  Kosanke Yeah. My dad was managing his co-op by then. He   d been on the board  forever, and we had a manager that, he had been a pilot in World War II and  Korea. He   d flown missions. He came back here because this was his  hometown, retired and was managing that, but he had a reserve flight that he  had to make every month somewhere. Three of them went up on the  mission, got in a thunderstorm, and those planes went like this. His plane, he  bailed out. It was crashing, but he was dead when they found him. Here it is,  the middle of the year, and they had talked my dad into finishing out until  they could hire somebody. When he retired fifteen years later, they did.  (Laughter) He was a natural for that. I   d opened up the farm for me because  he had a job, and of course, he helped me. I was the only child and all of  that. It wasn   t like I was going to sink or swim here on what I did today. If I  mess up today, you fix something tomorrow.  Milligan How old were you when you came back here?  Kosanke Twenty-seven     Milligan The ripe old age of twenty-seven.  Kosanke    and the first thing that happened to me was I hurt my back. I had this  surgery in Oklahoma City that, where I got the staph infection, which I have  yet. (Laughs)  Milligan That was in your twenties then?  21  Kosanke Yeah, twenty-seven years old, and I   m lying there in a hospital for two  months and looking at the ceiling and wondering,    What next?     Milligan What happened for you to get a back injury?  Kosanke We raised sheep, and we had to get sheered every year. We had a man from  Hobart come over, and he would stay and sheer as long as, however many  you had. I was picking up this wool, putting it in the sack, tromping it, and  bending over all day. I hadn   t been exercising for anything like that, and I  pulled vertebrae or messed up or something. I went as I could go with that  and had the surgery, and they took a bone out of my hip to graft it in my  back. I got staph infection in surgery.  Milligan That was in the    60s?  Kosanke That was    63, 1963. That   s stayed with me, but     Milligan You were in the hospital for two months?  Kosanke Yeah, in isolation, the fourth floor of Saint Anthony   s. At night, I could look  out that window and see the beacon on the First National Bank, and that was  it, that and the four walls. That was the low part of my life right there  because I found out later they   d crossed me off. I wasn   t going to live.  (Laughs)  Milligan Because of the staph infection?  Kosanke Yeah.  Milligan Oh gosh. Were your parents able to visit you? Did your parents come up to  stay with you some?  Kosanke Oh yeah. My mother was up there practically all of the time, and my dad  was there when he could. The guy that, one of my best friends now, they  hired to be an undertaker, and after two months, he told me,    Ah, just go  home.    My dad sent him up there to get me, and I   d never seen him. Here   s  the funeral director coming to get   . (Laughs) I drank coffee with this guy  this morning. We laugh about this, and I say,    God, if they   d told me you  was the undertaker, I   d have stayed up there.    Somebody else come get  me,       Malcolm. (Laughter)  Brad Tell them what they brought you home in.  Kosanke It was a car that the funeral home picked up bodies in. (Laughter) It wasn   t  an ambulance. (Laughs)  Milligan It was a hearse, the long     22  Kosanke It wasn   t a hearse, but when they went to pick up the body, bring it in, that   s  what it was.  Milligan Oh. (Laughs)  Kosanke I   m lying there, and they gave me a shot where I was feeling no pain. We  started home, and the alternator went out on that thing. It was getting dark,  and my dad drove in front of that thing. He followed his lights, and we got  over to Hobart. You go down Iris  Avenue , there   s dips, and Malcolm there  hadn   t been down that street. He hit that first dip, and I went up and hit that  ceiling. I said,    There   s five more.    (Laughs) We hit every one of them. I  said,    I don   t know what kept me from killing you when I was able.     (Laughter) Now we   re best of friends. (Laughter)  Milligan They had you stretched out, then, in the back?  Kosanke Yeah, yeah, gave me a shot of morphine or something and sent me home.  (Laughter)  Milligan How did you adjust when you got back because it   s   .  Kosanke Well, slowly.  Milligan Were you still farming then?  Kosanke Yeah. I wasn   t much good for six months or so, and I had lots of help. One  guy came to see me up there, and he   s three years older than me. He   s the  toughest guy in school in Lone Wolf. He was up there. He sold for US  Gypsum and heard I was over there, and he came over there. He met a girl  down there at the nurse   s station that he knew, and he asked where I was.  She said,    I   ll take you down there.    Well, here Don Godfrey shows up, was  a stranger to me, but I   m laying there, 104 fever or something, out of it. He  looks at me and says,    You   re in the best shape a person can be. You   re  broke. You don   t have a job. You   re sick.    (Laughs) I says,    When will we  get to the good news here?    He says,    You   ve got nowhere to go but up.     Then I heard him down the hall. This girl told him, says,    I guess you know  your friend   s going to die,    and the old dog just looked,    Kosanke   s not  going to die. He   s from Lone Wolf,    like nobody from Lone Wolf ever dies.  (Laughter) I   ve told him a few years ago, I says,    You know I bought into  that nonsense that I was, there was nowhere to go but up. I was a lot closer  to going six feet under than I was up, but I took strength out of that. This  guy, he   s the toughest guy I know, and he says I can whip it.    (Laughs) We  drink coffee two or three times a week, and every once and a while, we  bring that up. He   ll go,    Ho, ho, ho.    (Laughter)  Milligan Where do you get together for coffee in Lone Wolf?  23  Kosanke Right up there on the last place in town, at the convenience store, CJ   s.  Milligan Just curious. How long did it take you to get back up to full strength or as  full as it got?  Kosanke Oh, probably a year, probably a year, but my dad was doing what I couldn   t  do. He would have been doing that, been doing it all if I hadn   t have come  back here. When he retired, it was all mine then.  Milligan How   d you meet your wife?  Kosanke I really don   t remember meeting her. I was in the eighth grade when she  started school. I knew the family, McConnells. They built this house, but  they were younger than me. When I came back here, she was already  finished college, and she   s teaching school in Denver. She   s home for the  summer, and I looked around.    Well, I don   t know if she   d go with me, but  nobody else is going to   .    She would be the best I can find, and  interestingly enough, she went out with me. I don   t know if we were in love,  but we were spending time together. She went back to school. I went up  there to the western livestock show  National Western Stock Show , rode up  there with Emil Grieser, and I spent time with her up there. She came home  for Christmas, and we got engaged and got married the 21 of February. I  better write that down, 21 of February is our anniversary. (Laughs) I  remembered, but it just happened. I don   t know if she thinks she could have  done better, but I couldn   t have. (Laughs) I   ve never asked her. (Laughs)  Milligan Was she okay with coming back down here?  Kosanke Yeah, because this was home. Her dad was a big farmer, and I remember,  well, I was thirty-four years old. She says,    You   ve got to go, my dad is in  there. You need to talk to him.       What about?       Well, you   ve got to ask for  my hand in marriage.       We still do that?    (Laughs) She says,    Yeah, we do  it here.    Well, he   s a tough guy. He   s a self-made man. I walked in there,  and I told him I loved his daughter.    Well, you would take care of her,  yeah.    He told me two things, says,    You   re not getting any of my land, and  you   re going to take that damn sheepdog there with you when you  get  married .    (Laughs) They had a big sheepdog. It was the girls   . He was  wanting to get rid of that. Well, I came out of there, and a year later, even  now, I said,    I don   t know if he ever gave me your hand in marriage or not,  but he gave me a dog.    (Laughter) She said,    We just got married.     Milligan Was the dog in the wedding? (Laughs)  Kosanke Ugh, no. (Laughter) Mopsy, my bad experience there was that she got  arthritic, and she was laying out here under my pick-up one day. I backed  24  over her, and she went into shock and passed. We had a little service there  and cried and this and that, but she was given to me. (Laughter)  Milligan A concession. How many kids do you have?  Kosanke Three. Kristen, Suzanne, and Brad, and what, you   re thirty-nine?  Brad Yep.  Kosanke He   s the   can   t call him the baby. He   s taller than I am.  Brad (Laughs)  Milligan All raised in Lone Wolf?  Kosanke Yep. All of them went right across that stage right down here, went on out  then to the big, wide world and did well, but they all know they could come  back anytime. You don   t have to, but you can. That   s the way it was, and  man, it worked. Don   t feel like you have to do this or that. I   ve got a  daughter that   s a doctor, and when she comes home, she sees what   s going  on at the nursing home and all.    Maybe you ought to do this.    Suzanne  works with children, and I say,    Yeah, I   ve got these people in the medical  profession, but they   re pediatricians and childcare. I need a geriatric  daughter or something, something for us old heads.    (Laughs)  Milligan How long did you end up farming?  Kosanke Well, I   m still doing it some. I came here    63, and I   m still here. That   s  fifty-two years. I   ve rented out most of it, but we farm this place here. One  of the kids have already got down there for the summer. I rented out the rest  of it to people in the family and good farmers, but it gives me some reason  to get up in the morning. There   s something to do, hope you do it right.  Milligan What are you still farming?  Kosanke Wheat. I don   t have any cattle anymore, and it   s a good thing I don   t  because I   ve started having this back trouble. I couldn   t have taken care of  them, go out there and feed and break ice and all of that, and didn   t have to.  Milligan How long did you do cattle farming?  Kosanke Well, forty years, I guess.  Milligan Oh gosh, yeah.  25  Kosanke Raised sheep for over thirty years, cattle and sheep both. Sheep require a lot  more work and care, and when my dad started managing the co-op, that was  a little much. He didn   t need that, and then he got colon cancer and lived  about a year-and-a-half. We got rid of them then before because he couldn   t  get out there and do what he wanted to do. I don   t know. Time, when you  stay in one place and do the same thing, it all runs together, and I can   t tell  you what kind of wheat crop we made in 1978 or what year we had the  worst drought or any of that. It   s there. Whatever it is, you do what you can.  Milligan What do you think some of the biggest challenges to the Lone Wolf  community is? I   m asking because you   ve talked a lot about people leaving,  and that   s a common thing for a small agricultural town.  Kosanke Oh yeah.  Milligan What do you think some of the challenges, and what might bring people  back, if you   ve thought about it?  Kosanke Oh, I   ve thought about it for years, but there needed to be some industry  somewhere. Altus is probably the closest town where there   s any. They   ve  got that Air Force base that pumps them up and irrigated cotton and all of  that, but even Altus doesn   t have things where you could live here and  commute and all of that, very few jobs like that. Hobart   s got a plant over  there that   s, I guess they   ve employed two hundred people for years, and  some of the people here work over there. Now they   re going to close that  plant, headquarters in Chicago or something, and I thought it was profitable.  There   s just not anything coming in here that we need to promote.  Milligan Well, what do you think   s going to happen to the town?  Kosanke It   s just going to dry up and blow away, I guess. I   ve got a feeling it   s the  last year for our school because of this Oklahoma 10 percent deals. Like I  said, we   re the last one on the, we   ll be the first one on there probably.  Milligan Yeah, you were saying, I think, before we started the interview that Lone  Wolf Schools right now is the, is it the smallest school in the state?  Kosanke Yeah, 425 or something, and we   re the last one. I don   t know how we made  it this far really, but the quality of education hasn   t suffered. We   re on a  four-day week now. They go Monday through Thursday, come earlier and  stay later. Now the governor says other schools are going to have to do that  to get through this, and we   re already there.  Milligan Have you seen much influx with immigrant families or anything? A lot of  times, in agricultural towns, you see that.  26  Kosanke No, because the farms here are all family farms. One man or two people can  farm a 1,000 acres or more. You   ve got the equipment and all of that, and  we don   t have the row crops like Altus down there where they have to  irrigate and that. Hardly anybody got hired people here. They do it  themselves or the family maybe. I   ve got a cousin down here that helps me.  He   s sixty-five this year, I guess, but he can still do the things that I don   t. I  don   t have to tell him what to do, and he sees it. If you   ve got a problem, he  goes and gets it fixed. I don   t worry about the farm. We   ve got our plate full  over there at the senior citizens    and my problems, and the farm   s the least  of our problems. It   s doing well. You   re mostly dependent out here on  rainfall, and we   ve had more rain this year than any year on record, should  have prospects for a good crop. Wheat is laid by. You don   t do anything  until harvest time unless you have spray for insects or something. He   s in  the business, the equipment, and the equipment, it gets more sophisticated.  You can do more on one person, and you   ve got GPS in there and things that  I don   t understand. It   s big business, but there   s not room for many people.  Ten people are farming now what a 100 used to. Before my time, it was  horses and mules. I can   t imagine that, but my grandpas farmed with horses  and mules. When they got their first tractor, they thought they   d never see  another poor day.  You look at one of those tractors now and wonder how anybody could ride  that thing, steel wheels and pulling a three bottom plow or something.  Everything changes and high-tech. It   s past me, but best thing to do is try to  keep the battery charged on this thing. His kids and the rest of them, they   ve  got something there doing things. They have to take it away for them to eat.  (Laughter) I don   t know what they   re doing. Then he gets some of them  down here and said some of these things. (Laughter) Everything   s, well, I  guess it   s changing faster than it ever did. Apple and all those, they   re  coming up with a new wrinkle every year, and then the competitor does  something that, well, Bill Gates. That was about as far as you could go.  Apple, I don   t understand any of it, but I get a call there every day from  AT T, a recorded message that says,    You   re a good customer. We   re  offering you the faster internet.    I pulled the plug on that computer a year  and a half ago. I said,    I   m not even on the internet.    Well, I   m not talking  to a person, but he   ll call today. Then the Carman calls.    We need to talk  about a credit card.    Well, they   re going to raise the interest rate, but they   re  going to give me a special deal. I   ve never paid interest on a credit card.  When I get it, I pay it. That   s Carman. Well, today, the land phone rang, the  AT T deal that I   m considering taking out, except Suzanne   s husband is an  AT T engineer. (Laughs) I feel like I owe him something, but anyway     Milligan Lots of changes.  27  Kosanke    I won a cruise trip to the Bahamas there today right before you came up  on my BU. I answered the phone.    Congratulations. You   ve won a cruise to  Bahamas    or something. That was a recording, but golly. (Laughter)  Milligan Well, you   re not going to be bored. (Laughs)  Kosanke No, I just tell people I   m a dinosaur when I   m the last one. I   m not going  where you   re going. (Laughter) Guy that came here the other day with Dish,  well, they, kids gave me this big screen in there, and the only thing I have to  worry about is when the kids come put their games in there or something  and leave and leave it on that other stuff. I   ve got to call and see how to get  back on channel four, five, nine, and thirteen by five o   clock. (Laughter)  One day there, that screen pulled in. I had punched something, and here I   ve  got the fifteen channels. I   m watching three feet and Suzanne and Frank, her  husband, were on a vacation. They were in Connecticut, and they was going  through New England. Here I am. She calls to see how we were. I said,    I  need to talk to Frank. This picture   s pulling in.    Kristen was here. He says,     Get Kristen to take a picture of that and send it to me on her phone.    I says,     She can do that?       Yeah, she can do   .    Well, she did it, and then he  called me and says,    Push that asterisk number down here on the last   .    I  pushed it, and the screen came back. (Laughs) They   re in Connecticut, and  I   m sitting here in the dark.    What am I going to do?     Milligan The world keeps moving.  Kosanke Yep.  Milligan The world keeps moving. That was the area I wanted to talk about. I don   t  know. Is there anything that you wanted to make sure that you talked about  that we didn   t talk about, for you or for me?  Brad I don   t know that there   s anything else specific. I mean, he   s obviously  used   .  Kosanke I just get farther out there in left field somewhere, and you have to pull me  back in. (Laughter)  Brad No, he   s been a huge OSU fan, posse club supporter a few years, and     Kosanke    probably a chartered member.  Brad Things that they   ve done down here with Alumni Association in this area,  he   s been involved in that. Just anything involving OSU, he   s been  supportive of that.  28  Kosanke We   ve got a deal coming up in two weeks. Kiowa County  Oklahoma  and  Greer County  Oklahoma  have had this honors banquet for years with the  junior students, and all of them went through it. Both of us, both counties  are about to fold up. We got together, and we   re still doing that. It still  works, I guess. I don   t know what the university thinks of it. They might just  as soon pull the plug, but it   s good for us.  Milligan Why are you so supportive of getting kids to OSU? What   s the draw for you?  Kosanke Well, I guess it   s just because it   s been so important in my life, and I know  what kids can do if they have a little guidance and support. I want to be a  help to somebody. If I can help somebody help themselves, that   s good  enough for me. Otherwise, some of those kids, they just get out of school  and wander around a while, and I think we   re doing a good thing by  encouraging kids to pursue their education, whether it   s OSU or where.  That   s something that the people from university towns, says,    Here   s things  you need to do as a junior, to get to work on your SAT or any of that when  you   re a junior.    If something slips or something, you can go back and get  back in line and all of that. It doesn   t have to be our school, but you need to  do this or that and encourage them to do it. That   s what I like to do. I had a  coach one time, says,    The secret to coaching, some kids you have to pat on  the back, and some you have to kick in the rear. The secret is knowing  which one,    and I   d like to pat somebody on the back if I can.  Milligan Is there something that you take away from your time at OSU that  encourages you to push people in that direction?  Kosanke I guess what I took away is probably any place I would have gone is the  connections you make, the people you meet, and the people you stay in  touch with. That can be in business, or it can be sports. It could be anything,  but to me, it   s a group thing. You belong to something you can be proud of  and try to make it better. I hope I   ve done some of that. I   ve tried.  Milligan Well, it sounds like you   ve been an active part of a group that   s done a good  job with that. I know there   s a lot of kids that come from this corner of the  state at OSU.  Kosanke Really?  Milligan Yeah. There   s a good encouragement in that, good encouragement.  Kosanke I get calls from the student college. Of course, I contribute to the Ag   what  is it now?   CSR or something, anyway, whatever that is. (Laughs)  Brad CASNR  College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources ?  29  Milligan Yeah, CASNR.  Kosanke Yeah, and football and the seats, you   ve got to buy your tickets. Then you  pay for the seats. I   ve done that for years. That all goes in that pot. My dad,  there   s a scholarship up there in his name that the co-ops that he worked  with put together when he died. He was instrumental in the cottonseed oil  mill in Oklahoma City. He was on that deal for years and the grain dealer in  Enid and the cotton compress, and they all went together and set this  scholarship up. Well, Ann had always, didn   t want to go to that bank, which  she says   . We get credit for that, but that   s not our money. A couple years  ago, I put some money in it, and I said,    We   re not paying handlers now.  We   re invested in this.    I turned that over to  Brad , go up and present that.  He can   t make it every year, either, but that   s helped a bunch of students.  Milligan The scholarship?  Kosanke Three or four a year get a  1,000 bucks out of it or something. They all have  to write a letter and thank you for it before they get their money. That   s  good, but all of them were appreciative. That   s all the satisfaction I need.  One of those kids that   s calling a couple years ago said,    You   re from Lone  Wolf.    I said,    That   s right.    She said,    My grandmother graduated Lone  Wolf,    and I said,    Who is it?       Jane Smitherman.    Yeah, she was about  four years older than me. That was her married name, and this was her  granddaughter. I said,    I know your grandmother very well.    She says,     Well, I   ll tell her I talked to you,    and I said,    Yep, you tell her I sent my  best, and tell her to behave.    (Laughs) I   m telling somebody to tell their  grandmother to behave. (Laughter) Oh, she   d be the first to laugh.  Milligan (Laughs) That   s a good connection. Well, do you ever make it up there very  often anymore, Stillwater?  Kosanke Not as often as I   d like to. We made one game this year. I   ve had season  tickets for fifty years.  Milligan To football or basketball?  Kosanke Football. Three years ago, Ann and I went up there, Homecoming, I guess,  and I knew she   d been falling. I really didn   t want her to go, but    I can do  that.    We got over there in the stadium, and when we got ready to leave, she  fell on one of those concrete steps where you have to pull yourself up.  Stayed up and a couple of guys   .We got her up and walked across the  street toward the car. She stepped off the curb there at the Farmhouse and  fell in the street, and we never talked about it again. She knew that was it,  but about once a year, they will work it out where I get up there to a game.  One of them will come out here and stay with their mother and do whatever.  It   s home away from home to me. I always said if I was going to live  30  anywhere but Lone Wolf, it   d be Stillwater. (Laughs) One day, twenty years  ago, we were going up there to a game, and there was an old bachelor here  that, big supporter of OSU. He was riding with me. We got up there, and  they   d taken dorms down that they   d built. I said,    Used to, we marched out  here, ROTC, where all these buildings are. Elmer, we need to do something  to get a place for old Aggies or something, assisted living.     Ann  said,     Nobody but you   d think of something like that.    Well, now they   ve got that  deal up there. What do they call it, the     Brad I can   t remember the name of it.  Kosanke    the Ranch or something there?  Milligan Yeah, the retirement   .  Kosanke Brad said,    You was just twenty years ahead of your time    because now  they   re building this thing. Wes Watkins is out there, I think. I see his name  associated with it.  Milligan He is, yeah.  Kosanke Everything changes, and it   s still my alma mater and always will be. I don   t  know of anything else I could shed any light on. (Laughs)  Milligan That was pretty good. I don   t know. Brad, one last chance, do you have time  to think of anything else you want to talk about?  Kosanke He   s heard my stories forever.  Milligan Well, that   s why I   m asking him. (Laughter)  Kosanke He knows I was up there the year Pistol Pete shot a hole in the wall. You   ve  heard that, haven   t you?  Brad You were outside of the Classroom Building.  Milligan Oh yeah, I   ve heard about that.  Kosanke I   m on tape somewhere about that thing. On the fiftieth anniversary,  somebody said something about that and wanted to know...    Bill was out  there. He know   .    because somebody came and took, this is up there  somewhere. We were just sitting there, and they said,    Oh.    You know who  Pistol Pete was, Frank Eaton, the U.S. Marshall. Some say Rooster Cogburn  in True Grit was patterned after his character. He was supposed to have  killed six people who avenged, he avenged his father   s death and all of that.  Some say those stories are embellished and all of that, but he was talking to  31  our Oklahoma History class. There   s boys and girls both in there, and when  he got to the end,    Any questions?    All of a sudden somebody said,    Pete,  let   s see that famous fast draw,    and I actually wasn   t in there. I was in the  section waiting to come in outside, and he pulled that gun out and shot a  hole in the wall of that classroom building. Nobody had any idea the gun  was loaded, this ninety-year-old man out here. (Laughs) When it was time  for that class to change, some people was running out, and some was staying  in there. We were marching in with,    What happened?    They told me. Then  he made his talk to our section, but they   d had his gun. (Laughter) I   m glad I  saw the old man because he died the next year. I saw Pistol Pete up close.  Milligan Do you remember what the kids outside the hall did when that gun went off?  Did you know what it was?  Kosanke No, we didn   t know what it was. We knew he was talking, but we didn   t  even know when they were coming out that   some of them was afraid to  come out, I guess. It was something different.  Brad This is probably not suitable for print, but tell them the story about the old  infirmary that   s back before the student health center and your friend that  tried to get out of marching.  Kosanke You probably don   t want that on there. (Laughs)  Milligan I might.  Kosanke The old infirmary, you   ve heard the song    St. James Infirmary    where the  people all died and all. Well, that thing up there was pretty weak, but they  had two policies. Anybody that came in there for anything, they did two  things. They gave them a shot of penicillin and an enema. (Laughter) That  cured a lot of sprained ankles where guys got out of marching. My friend,  Homer,    You go out there and march if you want to. I   m going to get an  excuse, sprained ankle.       Homer, don   t go over there.    I was a year ahead of  him. Well, he called me. They didn   t have cell phones, but he got to a phone  somehow. They had put him in there, took his clothes away from him, gave  him a shot of penicillin and an enema. He said,    Billy, you   ve got to get me  out of here. I   m in this first, I   m going to raise the window, and you come  through that flowerbed and get me some clothes and get me out of here.     Well, he bragged. I says,    Homer, if you   re sick, that   s the best place for  you.    (Laughs) Well, the next day, he came in. He had a few choice words  for me, but he never went back. My roommate and I had a pact that if either  one of us got down, we would take the other one to the hospital. (Laughter)  Brad Stillwater Hospital.  Milligan Skip the infirmary? (Laughs)  32  Kosanke Yeah, but now it   s all different. It   s first-class now.  Milligan I haven   t heard of that one yet. That   s good. It   s been an hour and forty  minutes.  Kosanke Well   .  Milligan Told you.  Kosanke    I don   t know about you, but I   m going to take a break...  Milligan No, we   re good.  Kosanke    see if I can stand up.  Milligan We   re good.  -------  -------
