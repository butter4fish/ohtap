Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for the History Makers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns, observing is [HM] Glennette Tilley Turner from Wheaton [Illinois].  We're very glad to have her with us.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Madeline, M-A-D-E-L-I-N-E, R. S-T-R-A-T-T-O-N, M-O-R-R-I-S.
Speaker 1: And the R stands for Robinson?
Speaker 2: Robinson, that was my mother and father.  That was the name I was born under, yeah, Madeline Stratton Morris.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any other names or nicknames?
Speaker 2: Nicknames?  Not that I know of.  Madeline, they say called me "Mad" sometimes, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: August the 14th 1906, Chicago, Illinois.  I was born at 3736 Dearborn and my second sister Edrona [ph.] was born there, and the rest of the family, Vivian, Robert, Zana [ph.] and Edith all Robinsons, born under the name of John and Estella Robinson.
Speaker 1: Now, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a teacher or was a teacher I should say.
Speaker 1: So you're a retired teacher?
Speaker 2: I'm a retired teacher.  Yes, I'm a retired teacher, and I love teaching, and I remember in grammar school, I was always head of something.  And my--before going to grammar school, I was in Sunday school, and I was involved in Sunday school work.  You remember they used to give out cards to the class and I had to receive the cards for my class.
Speaker 1: So you were--you've been involved in education in one way or another for a long time.
Speaker 2: I've been involved in education, and I just love it.
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to get into detail later, but we're trying to slate this now.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is what?
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, today is August the 28th, 2003.
Speaker 1: Right, and this is the 40th Anniversary of the March on Washington.  I just wanted to point that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]--Is that what you're referring to?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That day I did not attend that meeting.  I wish I could have, but I didn't.  He was a great, great leader.
Speaker 1: All right now, ma'am, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You mean in the emphasis on our advancement and improvement?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, just where are we now, sitting?
Speaker 2: Oh, in my home--oh, in the living room of my home.
Story_ID: 186687
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask, and they just require a brief answer, okay?  The first question is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food? (Laughter) Well, I like food.  I enjoy--what do I enjoy?  I just enjoy food.  I don't have a special food that--I like vegetables, and I like chicken, that sort of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Well, I like green and I like purple, and I like white, and blue.  I like colors.  Yes, I like colors.  I like colors.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year?  I like spring very much.  I don't know that we had such a favorable spring this year.  We've had a lot of rain, unusual, but I think that's due to the fact that the emissions into the air has maybe stirred up some problem that we're not familiar with or the scientists haven't found.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation?  Well, I like traveling, just travel.  My husband and I, Sam, took a vacation in 1965 I guess it was '65 [1965] or '64 [1964] and we were gone for a year, and we traveled to many of the countries.  It was a pleasant experience.  We had a beautiful time.  I think--when I think about the travel, I think about when we were in Jordan--I think it was Jordan--and I put my hands down into the Dead Sea.  Isn't that where the Dead Sea is?  Yeah.  And it's just like putting your hand down into some syrup.  It's so heavy and you know that's salt.  When you go to the doctor, we rinse out mouth out with salt water, and we preserve food with salt; and they say you're the salt of the earth, you know, individuals, you know, so I don't know that I have a favorite.
Speaker 1: But you like to travel?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, I love to travel.  I wish I could travel now.  Sometimes I think I ought use my American Express and go on, you know, and travel, but I'm afraid to at this particular time.  There are so much--so many problems now, and I'm aware of that.
Story_ID: 186688
Speaker 1: Can you tell us if you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I have one, and I taught my students, and I use it for myself.  "Knowledge will forever govern ignorance.  If you wish to be in power, you must have knowledge."  That was [President James] Madison [Jr.], our 4th president of the United States.  And I had that statement up on my bulletin board for every class.  Knowledge--that's why we go to school--to improve upon whatever we're studying, whatever is our area of hopefully expertise, but I had a principal who called me into the office and wanted to know why I didn't change my bulletin, and I told him, "Well, that's one of the great statements, and it's James Madison, the 4th president of the United States. And I see no reason to change it," so he didn't like that, and he asked me to send my classroom into another classroom and he passed out a sheet of paper.  And this paper, he asked the children to write the--a statement on your bulletin in your classroom; and I stepped up to him and said, "I know who will not be able to do it, but the rest of the class will."  I said, "All of them will know James Madison, 4th president of the United States," and--so that disturbed him to no end.  He kept bugging me all the time about, you know, my bulletin, why didn't I change that bulletin, so he called me to the office; and he told me he was going to take me downtown to the office to the district superintendent, and I said, "Okay, it's all right."  I said, "I see now we're in a cold war," and I think he did not like that.  So I made an appointment to go downtown to district superintendent.  His name was Dr. Smith, and he lived not too far from the University of Chicago in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and so when I was there, Dr. Smith said to me, "I see, Ms. Stratton, you have some papers with you."  And I said, "Yes, I have."  He said, "May I see them?"  I said, "Yes," and I handed them over to him.  And he said to me, "Did he write this to you?"  I said, "Yes, he did."  "On this paper?"  I said, "Yes."  And he turned quickly, picked up the telephone, called the principal and wanted to know why did he write on that piece of paper the message that he did, and so I didn't know what he was doing really, but I told him, I said, "Well, I thought maybe he would like to see this," so he called the principal and told him, "Don't you send a note to Mrs. Stratton unless it's on your principal's stationery."  Now, he had used the paper towels that you dry your hands with to me.  He said, "He sent you this information on these paper towels?"  I said, "Yes, he did."  And this disturbed him, and from that time on--his name was James Berk [ph.]--James Berk didn't like me.  I was in trouble with him.  So he did everything he could to make things bad.  I wanted to take the children on trips.  I always took them to Springfield [Illinois], and I took them to the University of Chicago every time they had a great lecture because we could walk over there.  We would walk over to the university, and hear these find people, black and white, who were giving us a message, something about our country.  And so that brought on a terrific brick from that time on.  There was this demise in relationship.
Speaker 1: Because of that phrase?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Because of that phrase being on the bulletin board.
Speaker 2: Because of that statement--it was a great statement.  I said, "You know, we have statements all over the country, and they don't change them."  All over the country, we have monuments--monuments stay that way.
Story_ID: 186689
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're gonna--I'm going to get back to your teaching career, but I want to ask you about your parents and about growing up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--can you--I'm going ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, and I'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother Estella, E-S-T-E-L-L-A, Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.  And my mother's name and what else did you say?
Speaker 1: Just your mother's name and her--her married name--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --where she was born?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Her married name was Robinson, right.
Speaker 2: Robinson, yes.
Speaker 1: Where was she born and what was her birthday?
Speaker 2: She was born in Ohio.  I think it was Zanesville, Ohio because when my aunt would come to Chicago [Illinois], ma would send me down with my grandma down to get the--so that grandma would be sure to get on the right train because grandma could not read, but she knew how to count her money and she made good money, and she worked for the Meads, Mr. and Mrs. Mead, and Mr. Mead's parents owned a plantation in-- plantation was--what is that plantation of --it was food.  I can't think of what food that was now.
Speaker 1: Oh, they grew food in the South?
Speaker 2: No, it was in one of the islands.
Speaker 1: Oh. Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were very wealthy people because she spoke a doctor as a poor man, but she had the money.  She was on the wealthy side.  I don't think I did that correctly.  I don't know that I did.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --That's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Does it sound right?
Speaker 1: If that's as much you know about it, that's all right.
Speaker 2: That's all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, they Dixons, they were Irish.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry.  We didn't establish her date of birth.
Speaker 2: Mama?
Speaker 1: Her date of birth--your mother--
Speaker 2: Mama was 16 years younger than pa and I can't establish the--she was 16 years old when she married my father.
Speaker 1: And do you know when that was-- when they got married?
Speaker 2: I think that some of your papers indicated, but I don't recall.
Speaker 1: I don't remember what--
Speaker 2: Well, if you can just give us a rough estimate.  It doesn't have to be an exact date.  What do you think it would be?
Speaker 1: It would be 17--18 something--around 18--um--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Around 1880s, you think maybe?
Speaker 1: Maybe.  Now, ma couldn't vote, you know, because women didn't have the right to vote until 1820 [sic, 1920], the 19th Amendment.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So ma could not vote, so--but she was sixteen years old at my birth, you know.  Then girls married young, you know, because you were an old maid when you were eighteen and not married.
Speaker 2: Wouldn't you think then maybe around 1890?
Speaker 1: Well, 1890 something, you know, yes.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --You were born in 1906, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Nineteen o' six [1906].
Speaker 2: So, yeah, your mother if she was sixteen when you were born, yeah, she would have to be born about 1890 (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 1890, something like that--
Story_ID: 186690
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's [Estella Dixon Robinson] side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I can't trace it very far because they were Irish, Dixons, they seemingly were amenable to the family and they got along all right, but I can't tell you much about it.  I think most of the people were ashamed to talk about that period, you know.  There was some dislike, you know, because you weren't certain.
Speaker 1: They were part black and part Irish?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are there any stories from that side of the family that you remember?
Speaker 2: Stores?
Speaker 1: Stories?
Speaker 2: Stories?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: They talk about life in Zanesville or in Ohio at all or--?
Speaker 2: No, they seemingly got along all right.  I don't think ma had any problems so far as racial discrimination was concerned.  I never heard her talk about--
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Her parents?
Speaker 1: How your parents happened to meet each other.
Speaker 2: My father and mother?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No, I don't know how they met.  I don't know how ma and pa met, but I know that pa was brown-skinned and he looked like an Indian somewhat, you know, and he was born in Ronceverte, West Virginia and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Well, I'm going to ask you about him later.  I wanted to find out about your mother's side of the family first as much as you know about that side and how far you can go back, you know, on that side.  Are there no stories about the Emancipation Proclamation or the 13th, 14th or 15th Amendment, you know when they got the right to vote--when black people got the right to vote?
Speaker 2: No, not on--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or any kind of those stories?
Speaker 2: No, but my mother was living when the 15th Amendment was, you know, when she could vote.
Speaker 1: Well, that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --women suffered, isn't that what you're talking about?
Speaker 1: No, I was talking about when black people got the right to vote.
Speaker 2: Oh, when black people got the right to vote.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --back even further.  I was trying to talk about the older history before we got to your mother's actual life.  I wanted to talk about where her people came from.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --They didn't vote, you know.  They didn't have a right to vote.
Speaker 1: Well, women didn't, right before 1920.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories at all that your grandmother told about growing up in Ohio or about life in Ohio?
Speaker 2: No, except that somebody was teaching in a college.  Now, I don't know who that was, but I know that when this lady would come to Chicago [Illinois], my mother would send me to go with grandma to the Illinois Railroad Center--Illinois, what do you call it?
Speaker 1: IC--Illinois Central [Railroad].
Speaker 2: Illinois Central station because I could read Illinois Central and I knew what grandma should get on, and she trusted me.
Speaker 1: Well, what's the story about someone teaching in Ohio (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, somebody was teaching in a college there.
Speaker 1: Some other relative (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A relative to ma--a relative to my mother.
Speaker 1: Was it at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] or?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know if it was--does Wilberforce sound familiar?
Speaker 2: Wilberforce?
Speaker 1: Would they be teaching at Wilberforce?  I think that's about the only place you could teach in Ohio in college in Chicago if you were black in those days.
Speaker 2: Well, there was something involved with Wilberforce.  They used to talk about Wilberforce all the time.  So but I didn't know, you know, except that I knew it was a colored college, and usually was--or we had it because of these children, who were children of the plantation owner, or the person who owned the land.  And they wanted their children to be trained and educated.  I do know that much that they were trained and educated, and the father would come, you know, to the city to check and see if his children were being educated.
Story_ID: 186691
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother's [Estella Dixon Robinson] life, and tell us about, you know, what she was like and what she had to go through, and if she was able to go to school, and what she did for a living.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to Raymond [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: She finished grammar school, but she did not go to high school.  My uncle Johnny went to high school, [North] Division High School [later, Lincoln Park High School, Chicago, Illinois] was the only high school in Chicago, the whole city, for the whole city, the white and the black went there.  And Uncle Johnny, I have a picture of Uncle Johnny on my mirror.  He was pretty well trained as far as, you know, that period in time because nobody had too much education, black or white.
Speaker 1: Okay now--How did your--did your mother ever tell you the story of why her family moved to Chicago, or the story of how they got to Chicago from Ohio?
Speaker 2: Well, for money, you know, for better jobs, you know, training, but I really don't remember ma telling us, or telling me, she might have talked more to the other children because she was so young, herself, you know. So I don't think she talked too much, not to me anyhow, because I was her firstborn, and I think that she was concerned about me; you know, here, she was so young, herself.  I remember we used to play jacks together on the floor, you know, things like that. I don't think that ma had--
Speaker 1: She didn't tell you how--why she and your dad came to Chicago (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't think--I know she didn't.  She didn't tell me.  I would remember that.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker except there was a place near Farren School [Chicago, Illinois] that a pencil, the bright right yellow pencil, and you could make money there, you know.  And she worked I think a couple of weeks there, but she didn't stay, you know. But I could go down there and get a job at this pencil shop, and that's where I would work in the summer time, or if I had a week off, just one week, Mr. Livingston [ph.], I think it was his name, would hire me.  When he'd see me, he'd say, "Well, you go back there and sit."  You know, then I would do it and I knew that it meant for me that I could work for a week.  And I'd get, I think, fifteen dollars or something like that.
Story_ID: 186692
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your father's side of the family now and--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know too much about Pa's side of the family either.
Speaker 1: Well, if you can give us his name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: John, J-O-H-N, H-E-N-R-Y, R-O-B-I-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what his date of birth of place of birth, do you know?
Speaker 2: It'd be 18 something.  Pa died when he was--you see this what I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --He was older than you mother.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) by ten years.  He was ten years old than ma.
Speaker 1: He was born in 1880.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: -- Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was ten years older than ma.
Speaker 1: Where was he born, do you know?
Speaker 2: Ronceverte, West Virginia. West Virginia withdrew from the union because of segregation
Speaker 1: --After the Civil War.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After the Civil War--
Speaker 1: --I mean during the Civil War.  Now, tell us what you know about his side of the family.  Did you ever meet your grandparents on that side?
Speaker 2: I met his mother.  I never knew his father.  In fact, I don't think pa knew his father.  You know how that was done, like some of the people are doing today, you know, so I don't know anything about my father's father, but pa, my father, was a very, very strict person.  He had a lot of class.  He did not have the education.  I think he went to fifth grade education; and I remember him telling us about having to stand in this classroom with an umbrella over the teacher as she taught or he taught if it was a man, well whatever, this umbrella sticks in my mind as--while he taught, and so pa didn't have formal education, but he was a very dignified man.  "You must walk straight; you must stand straight; you must sit straight; and I never want to see your back against the back of a chair.  You sit up straight, and" (laughter) "you behave and you must make good.  I didn't have the training, but you have a chance.  I expect you to get your education," so books were not free when I came along, and my father would walk with me to 51st Street and State [Street, Chicago, Illinois], where there was a big book store, and north of that book store was the police station, and then there was another place for health, health center, or something like that.  They were all combined there, but my father was very, very straight, tall, slender, very courteous, very mannerly, and so he had within himself things that he wanted us to do. And he, especially--I think pa thought sometimes I was a boy because he taught me everything that he knew and taught me how to, you know, act.
Story_ID: 186693
Speaker 1: Ms. [HM Madeline Stratton] Morris can you tell us what your first childhood memory was?
Speaker 2: My childhood memory?
Speaker 1: No, your first one.
Speaker 2: My first childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Can you remember that one?
Speaker 2: Well, I should.  I remember that one night I dreamed that I walked up on the boulevard at 54th and 55th Street [Chicago, Illinois] and turned to the sun and raised my hands and said, "Am I saved?"  And the sun bowed to me and that was a great experience, and I have never forgotten it.  And I said, "Well, maybe all of these things that are happening is, you know, an indication that maybe I had been born for a specific purpose," but life is purposeful, and that I have been sent to this earth, ordained to do a job, and I think every person in the world has been sent to this earth to do something for other people, and as long as we live, we should always think of other people and do all the good that we can to all the people that we know and to every phase of this human experience.  So, life is purposeful, and we should do our best at all times.  And my father was very much like that.  "You must do your best," and although in the classroom there were maybe forty-eight students and most of the time that's the number that we had in this classroom, I would be thinking what I was supposed to do.  My father always said, "If you--if these other children make ninety," he was referring to white children, and we were very few in the classroom, "you make ninety-one.  You can do.  I expect you to do--I expect you to do your best in everything that you do," so that was my father, and pa was dark.  He used to put water on his hair because it was straight hair and sleeked down, you know, very straight, pressed his clothes all the time.  They used to call him the two-cent dude because he didn't make money but he was always immaculate so far as his experience was concerned.
Speaker 1: Now, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked at Butler Brothers, a big corporation, and they liked my father, and had him to--when Mr. Butler, the owner of the Butler Company on downtown--I forget the name of the street.
Speaker 1: What did they do?  What did Butler Brothers do?
Speaker 2: Butler Brothers was a warehouse, was a warehouse and pa was the person who that--Mr. Butler, who was the owner of this big company, when he was leaving the city or wanted something special done, he called upon my father, and pa would have his special money or special--not money, or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --keys or--
Speaker 2: -- (simultaneous)--things that were important to him, and pa would take care of that for him until Mr. Butler came back to the city; and he was that kind of--he was a trusted person, and they believed in him all of the time.
Story_ID: 186694
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Some of the what?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --The sights and sounds--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Sights?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Stock yards (laughter) The stock yard--you woke up with the stock yard smell.  It was always around, and it was very heavy and thick.  And so stock yards was a part of it, and we really didn't think anything about it because that's where most of the people came to Chicago [Illinois] to work.  They came to Chicago to work at the stock yards, Armour [and Company], Swift, all of those children lived at 37th Street and Michigan at that time; and that's why Raymond School [Chicago, Illinois] was important because those children went to that school, too. So my mother had that kind of association, you know, with those people; and we were--I was brought up with a little of all of that culture.  That was a great mixture of culture.  And those white kids, they didn't pay any attention to, you know, us.  There was no fussing and fighting about color and all that kind of stuff.  They were just friendly and went along with us, you know.  We went along with them.  I didn't think anything about it.  I know in eighth grade at Farren School, the principal, Mrs. Livingston, gave a girl some lines to study and know because she wrote the story for graduation, and the story was about the "real American girl," and she had given this to this girl, whose name I don't recall, and told her to learn it.  After two weeks, she hadn't learned it, so she just gave it to me, and told me to learn those lines.  And I learned them, I didn't know what they were going to be.  I just learned them, but the interesting thing is, that when the program was written instead of "the real American girl," they named it "the average American girl."  That was a step down, but I didn't know it, you know.  I didn't mean anything to me.  I just learned the lines, so there was this point, I know some of the children were very friendly and I'd go to their homes and swing.  We had all kinds of swings and (unclear), her father, had an oriental rug place.  And the oriental rugs were on top of this roof of a place.  And out all night, nobody ever bothered those rugs--oriental rugs, but I would go to her house, and we would swing, and laugh and talk, but I would never go--went in.  I was never invited into the house, but I didn't know, you know because-- I thought it was a normal thing.  I didn't realize that--I could play with her, but I couldn't be too intimate, that is-- I guess, would have been go into their home would have been a little bit too much, but that is the way it was during those times, and State Street was the main street there, and street cars were the thing of that time.  No buses.  There were no buses.
Story_ID: 186695
Speaker 1: Did you see a lot of horses in those days?
Speaker 2: Horses everyplace.  We saw horses all the time.  Yes, horses were up and down the streets [of Chicago, Illinois].  In fact, the fire department had horses to pull the fire engine, and it was a--I guess you've seen the fire apparatus over at the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --the [Chicago] Historical Society?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yes, the Historical Society, they always had that so that you could see what they looked like.  And I remember we had a fire on the first floor at 5440 Dearborn and the firemen would have to put out the fire in the engine of this firemen's apparatus and then they would pour water on the ground because our streets were not paved at that time.  They were blocks, wooden blocks, you know, round, tree trunks, you know.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Okay, I never heard that before, yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember seeing that, and when they would have a fire, they would just get those and pour those spots, those places, where the firemen had to dump their ashes, but that's my early experience.  I guess I was around seven or eight years old something like that.  Then in a few years, of course, they put down paved streets and lights.
Speaker 1: So they were like wooden blocks or something?
Speaker 2: It was a tree trunk.  You know, they just sliced across it so they just had a stump like that--a round stump.
Speaker 1: And they got to bury that in the ground?
Speaker 2: Buried it in the soil, you see.   And that's what our streets were.  And then later years, they had pavement, you know.  They put down tar, you know, instead of having just plain wood.
Speaker 1: Now, was there a lot of--did you notice a lot of construction work in Chicago in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, there was a lot.  Yes, they were moving houses.  They would move houses.  I remember the house would move from one street to another, and they would move it on some kind of--it wasn't a slab but it was something like a large board, or something like that.  And they would move that house on that whatever that thing was, and move it over to--In fact, let me tell you.  There is a house that was moved to 18th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois]--isn't there a house down there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's 18th and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --State [Street, Chicago, Illinois], I mean Wabash, I think Wabash--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I think it's Indiana [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Indiana.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Is that the John Clark house?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Is that the John Clark House?
Speaker 2: That might be.
Speaker 1: A white house?
Speaker 2: A white house.
Speaker 1: That's the John Clark House.  That's the oldest house in Chicago.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's it.
Speaker 1: They moved it from its original place?
Speaker 2: Yes, they moved it from its original place, and that's how that happened.  I remember seeing it--doing.
Speaker 1: Where was it originally?
Speaker 2: It was--well, I don't know the street, but I know that State Street, it went across State Street, I know that much. I don't know where it was originally, but I know it moved from one street west of State Street over to Indiana, or whatever street that was.

Speaker 1: What did your house look like, the place that you lived, yeah?
Speaker 2: Where I was raised up?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: See, I was born at 3736 Dearborn [Street, Chicago, Illinois], but my mother [Estella Dixon Robinson] and father [John Robinson] moved to 5440 Dearborn and that was a framed house.  And we lived on the second floor and a German family lived on the first floor, and Mrs. Heintz [ph.] would come upstairs and ask pa to come downstairs and make Heiny [ph.] behave himself.
Speaker 1: Who is Heiny?
Speaker 2: So pa would go down.  I don't know what he did, but he would go down and, whatever, Hinny would behave for a week or something.  I don't know what that was all about, but that was part of.
Speaker 1: Who was Heiny?  Who was Heiny?
Speaker 2: Heiny was Mrs. Heintz son, and so.  And she lived there until she sold her house to a colored person by the name of Mrs. Foster [ph.], and I don't remember her first name-- Mrs. Foster's first name-- but Mrs. Foster was a colored woman and her husband, and he was a tall, thin, fellow, but they were from the South, too.

Speaker 1: Tell me about the things that you liked to do as a little girl.  What kind of a little girl were you and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Oh, I liked to teach.  I was always teaching in Sunday school or some little club, or something like that.  I was always involved in something, whether I was involved as a teacher, or helper, or something like that.  I used to--and I would work.  I remember my mother was in the A&P store on 55 Street, and some lady asked ma [Estella Dixon Robinson] if she knew of a young girl or somebody who could wash dishes and ma said, "Yes," and so ma let me go to work for this woman; and the woman was a nurse, her husband was a doctor, and they lived up between--I don't know, well, anyhow it was up on the boulevard.   We call it "the Boulevard" now.  So I went there, and the woman had so many dirty dishes in the sink.  I told ma, I said, "That lady has so many dirty dishes.  I can't wash all those dishes."  And so ma said, "Well, you don't have to go back," so I never went back to her home, but that was one of my little experiences, but most of the time, I enjoyed participating what kids did at that time, and that was run to the store for people.  We'd go for a nickel or a penny or two pennies; and sometimes it was nothing, you know, just go to the store.  But I always enjoyed in participating in whatever young kids were doing, you know?
Speaker 1: Was the neighborhood crowded in those days?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't crowded, it wasn't a crowded neighborhood.  We didn't have a big crowd until after the great--I think 1917, a great number of Negroes came north to work at the stock yards; and that's when pa got a job on the stock yards.  And ma sent me up on the boulevard, that's what we call that area, "the Boulevard," to see if I could see pa because he was never late, but he was late, and he was so tired because he had worked at the stock yard, and he had never done that kind of heavy work, whatever, they had to do.  So I told pa that ma wanted to know, you know, where he was, and so he said, "Well, tell her I'll be there in a few minutes," and then he got up and walked on home.

Speaker 1: What church did you attend? What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Berean Baptist Church, at 52nd Street [sic, 51st Street] and Dearborn [Street, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Dearborn?
Speaker 1: No, the name of the church.
Speaker 2: Berean?  B-e-r-e-a-n, Berean Baptist Church, 52nd and the minister there was William S. Bratton [ph.]--William Samuel Bratton, and he was from the South, and his--he was a Shakespearean.  He spoke every Sunday in church, he gave a big lecture, and you always got [William] Shakespeare.  And he was born of a white and colored parentage.  And when he--when his mother died, they didn't tell him because they didn't want him to show up because he was brown-skin.  So that's why William S. Bratton, but he also joined the [U.S.] Army, The Armed Services, and he was always concerned about soldiers, and he had troops, they had boy scouts troops and all that sort of situation at the school--at the church, boy scouts, and girl scouts, and we were all involved in some phase of life with our country, so that was Reverend Bratton, but we had a good training under him.  Most of us--I remember that Shakespeare was something that we just had to know--we just had to know, and he was a very wonderful instructor in religious beliefs, but he was Baptist.
Speaker 1: That's kind of unusual to have a Baptist minister who quotes Shakespeare.
Speaker 2: Yes, he quoted Shakespeare.  Yes, he did.  He quoted Shakespeare, and the last of them, Joy Bratton [ph.] is the last of that family, and she died about three or four years ago, maybe more than that five maybe, but Joy Bratton.  I don't know whatever happened to her children.  She had children, too.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember any of the Shakespeare that he taught you?
Speaker 2: Shakespeare that he taught us?
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you remember any of it?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to--no, I don't-- off hand, I can't think of anything right now, but I know it was always Shakespeare.
Speaker 1: Now, was music a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, music--we had such beautiful music! Beautiful music and no hollering and that sort of stuff, (unclear) was one of their great songs they sang practically every Sunday.  Mrs.--what is her name, oh I can't think of her name--beautiful voice.  She had a gorgeous voice, but sang (unclear) 'How Sweet Thou Art,' and all of those beautiful songs.  It was no hollering and making a lot of noise because he didn't believe in that.
Speaker 1: People didn't get happy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, don't get happy because he would tell them, you know, "Sit down, you're disturbing," and, you know, that was Reverend William S. Bratton.  He was a great leader for the whole city of Chicago.
Speaker 1: So he was an international--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a soldier, though
Speaker 1: --I mean he had a Chicago-wide presence.  He was known as a leader (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes.  Yes he was a great leader.
Speaker 1: Let's see--now, was music a part of your life at home, too?  Did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, my parents--
Speaker 1: --anybody play the piano (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Now, my mother [Estella Dixon Robinson] and father [John Robinson]--now, how pa and ma played piano, don't ask me because they did, but they didn't take me to music lessons or anything like that, but on my mother's side, Uncle Will, became a musician, and he wrote 'Brazilian Dreams,' which became a big piece of music, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, what was his full name, Will?
Speaker 2: Will Dixon, on my mother's side.  And so that's, you know--and Frankie Dixon became a teacher--Frankie became a teacher at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Frankie Dixon.
Story_ID: 186699
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about school now?  How did you like school and what was the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I loved it. Oh, I never wanted to go--I always wanted to go to school--I always wanted to go to school.  I never thought about not going to school.  A friend of mine said, "Mad"--Genoese said, "Mad, I'm not going to school today."  I said, "Where are you going?"  She said, "I'm going downtown."  I said, "Well, what's downtown?"  And she said, "I'm just going downtown."  I said, "I got to go to school," so I did not want to not go to school.  I wanted to go to school.  I always went to school.  I never came out.
Speaker 1: Okay, what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked Reading and liked the books, I liked my text books.  They were interesting stories.  I'm trying to think. I liked my text books.  They were interesting stories.  I'm trying to think.  We had a teacher, who read to us at the last half hour every day, so that was always a pleasant experience for me because she was reading and I wanted to read like that.  I wanted to read like she read.  And there wasn't a sound.  If we were noisy or did something, she would stop reading, and I was always disturbed if anybody kept us from hearing her reading.  So I wanted to read, and I loved reading; and I did well in my reading.  Mrs. Dolton [ph.], who was the principal when I was in first grade, called me into her office--maybe I just told it, called me into her office and told me to read some passage she had for me to read, and I read it. And so when she sent me back to my classroom, they had put me up.  She put me up into 1A I think it was.  They had 1B and then 1A--, 2B, 2A in every classroom, and in all of my classrooms at Farren School [later, Attucks Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], I would do the B class work and the A class work or the A class work and the B class work, whatever situation I was in, I always did both.  So the teachers got to know that I was going to do both of the--you know, and I did well, but I loved teaching, and I loved school.  I just loved it.  I didn't want to go anyplace else but that.
Story_ID: 186700
Speaker 1: Now who were some of your favorite teachers at Farren [School later, Attucks Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, at Farren School?  Ms. Lady [ph.], she was first grade teacher.  I didn't know she was white, but she was, but I wanted to be like Ms. Lady; and I can see her now, she is just a lady and then Ms. Mason [ph.], and Ms. Mason, and Ms. Lady and Ms. Eberstein [ph.], and all, all, just all of the teachers.  I enjoyed all of them--all of the teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We had no mean teachers.  All of them were good, good teachers.  Most of them were Irish and Jewish, a lot of Jewish teachers, Mrs. Stein [ph.], she was good, and she was a very good teacher.
Speaker 1: Were there any black teachers in the school?
Speaker 2: There was one, yeah, this was-- her name was Mrs. Patton, P-a-t-t-o-n.  She was a petite lady and very thin, and very proper in her grammar.  She was a lovely person.  She was never my teacher, but she was one of us in that school.  And then another teacher came in later, up in the seventh or eighth grade, I forget, but she wasn't my teacher, but she came in as a math teacher.  So it was very nice.  I didn't have any unpleasant experiences in school.  School was great for me.  I loved it.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were thirteen in the eighth grade, I guess, or maybe it was before you started the seventh grade, the riot in Chicago took place, 1919, right? Were you in the seventh or eighth grade, ma'am, when that happened?
Speaker 2: When the riot took place?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the exact age.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to be about thirteen, I think.
Speaker 2: Now, it seems to me I graduated--let's see I graduated from high school when I was fourteen--no, no; I graduated from high school when I was seventeen.
Story_ID: 186701
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois] riot--race riot of 1919.
Speaker 2: I tell you, we had 5440 Dearborn [Street, Chicago, Illinois], we had a living room, and off the living room was a bedroom, off from the dining room was a bedroom and off from the kitchen was a bedroom, so we had three bedrooms. And my father [John Robinson] sat in the front window, and he would communicate with other fathers in their windows during the riot at night.  And pa was very disgusted with the man who lived on the first floor because he left the city or left wherever he was--he wasn't downstairs, and pa was then having to sort of supervise whatever was going to happen or happened on the first floor and the second floor, but my father and the other men in their windows would call and say, "Bob, are you there?"  And pa would respond, and someone else would call and pa would respond and they would talk with each from window to window, but this man who lived on the first floor disappeared and pa never liked him thereafter, you know, because that left pa to supervise.  He couldn't imagine a man leaving, you know, and all of that, but, yes, I remember that riot, and my father had to come home from Butler Bros. in a police wagon.  They had brought him to 55th Street, and then he could walk around the block to home, you see, but that was a scary period, very scary.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) you know, because there was shooting.  We would hear the shooting, and the fellows would get up on--what do you call that thing--the viaduct, you know, and dare white fellows, the Irish fellows, to come through.  They were going to come over and clean us out, you know, that sort of thing. And Raymond [ph.]--his name was Raymond, I can't remember Raymond's last name, but anyhow, Raymond came running down the street hollering, "I'm shot, I shot," and Raymond was a light-skinned colored fellow, and his mother came out, you know, and he had been shot, so that was Raymond's experience, you know, so we knew one boy in the community who had been shot during the riot. But I'm not-- her name isn't Irene--her name is--I can't think of her name right now, but her brothers got up on that viaduct and dared the white boys to come through, and that broke up that running after the Negro, and I wish I could think of her name, but I can't think of her name and the boy's names, Duke--Dukes--the Duke [ph.] boys, that was their name.  Those Duke boys really stopped those Irish kids from getting up on the viaduct and shooting at black boys.
Story_ID: 186702
Speaker 1: Did you--did anybody ever explain what happened to--why there was a riot, to you in those days?  Did anyone explain to you why there was a riot?
Speaker 2: Well, there seems to have been somebody at 31st Street who had been--let's see what happened at 31st Street?  There was a riot down there or something happened.  I don't know.  I can't remember just what that--instigated the rioting throughout the city.  I can't remember that, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I think it was a black boy on a raft who was stoned by some white teenagers at--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --down at 31st Street, at the beach.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --at the beach, right.
Speaker 2: Right, it was a beach thing.
Speaker 1: His raft had floated into the white part of the beach, and the white boys stoned him to death.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew it was at 31st Street that started.
Speaker 1: And the fight started at the beach and as a result.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.
Speaker 1: That's the official version.  I just wondered if you had heard something different.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was it.  It started at 31st Street, but that was it, 31st Street.
Speaker 1: How long did it last?
Speaker 2: Well, it seems to have lasted about two or three weeks or something like that.  We had it for a little while.  It wasn't--it didn't cut down--then one thing would lead to another, you know.  Then the next thing we knew the Catholic Church was involved, and I liked this eighth grade boy because--his name was--what was that fellow's name?  He--Maurice Vernon [ph.], that's it--I liked Maurice because his mother and father could play cards on Sunday and in our Baptist church we weren't supposed to but, Reverend Bratton [ph.] played cards anytime he wanted to, and we all knew that, and we had card playing at our church.  We had dinners for the poor, you know, as if we weren't poor.  And so--that was--But those Duke boys were the ones who broke up the gang business up, shooting at our colored fellows.
Speaker 1: Now, do you what happened to the Dukes when they grew up?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't know because the sister I don't think claims that.  She doesn't want to be associated with it--
Speaker 1: What was the sister's name?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I'm trying to think of her now because I don't know where she is or anything like that, but she doesn't want to be associated with that in some way or other.  Somebody called me and asked me about her, but I can't think of her name right now.
Speaker 1: Well, so it lasted for a -- people had to be vigilant for a couple of weeks, you see, because of that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 186703
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about high school.
Speaker 2: High school, Englewood [Technical Prep Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois], that's where I went to school, at Englewood High School, we were really segregated, but I didn't--you know, we weren't aware of this, you know, what was happening.  We knew that we weren't wanted, and we--instead of going thru the front entrance of Englewood High School, they had a beautiful entrance to the high school, both sides, beautiful entrance to the-- We came in thru the back.
Speaker 1: So they required the colored students, the black students, the African American students to come in the back door?
Speaker 2: We came in the back.  We came in the back.  Now, whether they required it, I don't know, but I always went in the back because that's the way--I came from that side of the street, coming into the school, and so that was the easiest way for me, I just followed on into the school but that's the way it was at that time, and we couldn't-- when we had our graduation exercises, we walked --we couldn't walk with the--we walked with the procession, but if you were black, you walked alone, unless you were fair you could walk with the person ahead of you, and I walked alone at my graduation, but Mrs. Mead [ph.], this person I was telling you about, was there at my graduation, and she told me, "Now Madeline, you walk with you head high and you walk alone, I'll be there," and she was, she was there.  She gave me some blue, crystal beads, and I had them for many, many years.  I don't know what I ever did with them, but that was from her, and but they--I had encouragement from so many people that sometimes I wasn't quite sure of what was happening, you know, except I remember when in--at Englewood High School, I took French and I--Mrs.--what was her name?  Mrs. Hop [ph.]--no not Mrs. Hop, I can't think of that woman's name, but anyhow, she always gave me an F or a D, fair or D, you know, and I didn't expect anymore, until a woman who was here, exchange teacher from France, a French teacher, French woman, who did not know about segregation and discrimination, and I was put into her class, and then I began to get a S, superior, and I couldn't understand what had happened that I would get a superior, and I had been getting D all the time, you know, but that's what happened. So then I began to think, Well I guess, you know, We don't--we cant have a passing grade, you know, I just lived with it, it didn't--it bothered me, but it didn't bother me, you know, one of those things, you know.  I was learning, so, you know, and I had to hear what she was teaching, even though she wasn't addressing me, I heard what was being said to the white kids.
Speaker 1: Did she ever call on you in class?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't call on me, no.
Speaker 1: She just sort of ignored you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, ignored. I was completely ignored, you know, but when I had to write, you know, when we had an examination or something; I knew my grade was going to be D or an F.  It was either you fail or your--D, I don't remember what D stood for now, but I know it was failure, it was F or D. I never got anything other than F or D, but when this French woman came I began to get superior, and I couldn't imagine what had happened.  She just didn't know what was going on, and I sure didn't know either, you know, that things were so bad.
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any teachers at Englewood that tried to help, other than the French teacher?  Were there any that took an interest in you and tried to encourage you?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was at Englewood High School, let me see now, it seems to me that there was, but I can't think of it right now.  I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, at Englewood, when you were a senior now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Mr. Zeke [ph.], Mr. Zeke, was a physicist--a physics teacher, and he was helpful, Mr. Zeke.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: I don't know, Z-E-K-E, seems like that was the way I spelled it at that time. Z-E-K-E, I think his name was Zeke, I know how--I know, he taught us to make--we had to make--we had formulas, and he taught us to make chocolate, and so I made chocolate, and I put extra--an extra something in it, he said but, "You see what happened when you don't follow directions?" he said, "I told you the quantity to use and you didn't do it," and I put a little extra in see, so it didn't turn out right. I remember that about him, but he was nice to me.

Speaker 2: Go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I immediately knew I wanted to go to, that's all I heard about teachers college, so I went to [Chicago] Teachers College [later, Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] right away.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)-- Ok, now what year?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I had finished grammar school and went to Teachers College, I mean high school and went to Teachers College.

Speaker 2: I was older than that, I was--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Let's see, 1917, oh yeah.
Speaker 2: I know I was, I wasn't over age, I was on target, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were born in 1906, you would've graduated from high school and, in 1922 or '23 [1923] if you were on target for 18. Or did they graduate at 16 now?
Speaker 2: Oh they graduated--we could graduate whenever, you know, your time came. --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Oh, whenever your time, oh whenever you finished your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yes whenever you had finished. It seems to me, I was a little ahead of that, it seems to me that 17 comes to my mind, but I'm not clear, I'm not positive.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, '17, [1917] you'd only been 11 or 12 though, you know, you'd only been eleven years old then.
Speaker 2: Oh no, that isn't right, no that isn't right then, but because I was--I graduated on time.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that experience. How was that?
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College? That was--it had its bad periods, too.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of discrimination?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was, and this--Mrs. Howl [ph.] was a music teacher and she, she, we knew that, if---what's that girl's name?  Nell Matilda, Nell Matilda Woodard [ph.], Woodard, was a great violinist, and Mrs. Howl failed that girl over and over again.  She failed her in everything, but when Mrs. Howl, I don't know how it was, but Nell passed an examination, and became the great teacher, that even today the Chicago choir goes on--into the most beautiful music, because of this colored girl, whose name was Nell Matilda Woodard, you ask some of the girls who were, or people who were in school in there--in the--well, the years that they had this big choir, Chicago choir, it became a great choir, and it still--I think it still exists, we have a Chicago choir, but they don't give Nell any recognition, but she did, she made a change in the whole system.  There were a lot of nice changes that came because of some white person who did something, opened up, you know, and in spite of all that would happen to us, things would happen.
Speaker 1: So, things would change in spite of some of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yes.
Speaker 1: The teachers who were persecuting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Yes.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --black people, there were some that would help.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that helped you at Chicago Teacher's College that you remember?
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College, I can't think of any right now.  I can't think of any right now.  Let's see what happened, when I went out there. I know I lost my, my graduation, my diploma and that was a sad experience for me, when I lost that, but that's about all I can remember about Teachers College.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)-- All right, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I had a nice experience though, I enjoyed my experience with Teachers College.
Story_ID: 186706
Speaker 1: Was it [Chicago Teachers College, later Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] located in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] in those days?
Speaker 2: It was not too far from there, I remember we would pass on the--on the "L" [elevated train], and I would always look into a home, and the dining room always looked so interesting to me and I used to think, Oh I am going to do that sort of thing, I'm going to have a dining room table like that, you know, some of these days.  You know you go some place and you see something and, that's and it sort of impresses you, you know.  I had that experience, I remember I once, one Christmas--this is digressing I guess, at one Christmas, I was not at home and my father [John Robinson] was very disturbed about it, for Christmas dinner because he wanted his whole family to sit there with the family. But when we went up to this place up-- Winnetka, Winnetka or Wilmette, some place up there--and when I walked into this dining room, with Aunt Edith, this man, white fellow, was up on a ladder in the dining room with a house coat with a jacket, a black jacket, or something like that, and, and he was fixing something, a light or something, on the Christmas tree, and I said, "Oh, look at that Christmas tree, I'm going to see if we can't have a tree like that," and went to the dining room table, and there was a Santa Claus, I mean a--they had a path showing the Santa Claus coming down on this path, and you know, and so, the next year at our home, and pa had told me "Never be away from this dinner table."  Next year, I had Santa Claus coming down the, you know, in center of our Christmas table with cotton I got from the five and 10 cents store, and I suppose they got theirs from one of those big stores, but I saw things going into these homes that impressed me and I wanted a home like that.  You know, I'd say, "I want to have a home like that," so I was impressed by what I saw.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it's important for young people to see the better side of life, you know.  We had no money, but we had nice things for what--for our poverty level, but this impressed me so much to see this Santa Claus, so I had that Santa Claus.  But I'm saying--what I'm really trying to say, I guess, is that it's important to have surroundings that influence your thinking--lifts your sights.

Speaker 1: After [Chicago] Teachers College [later, Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], did you start your teaching career?
Speaker 2: Teaching career?  Yeah, immediately. Immediately--
Speaker 1: Tell us about your teaching career.
Speaker 2: Oh, I had a beautiful teaching career--beautiful teaching career. Yes. I taught on the west side at Emerson [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].  Emerson School on the west side, that's where Francis Matlock's [ph.] sister, Edna [ph.], was teaching in first grade on the first floor, and there were practically all white teachers there except for maybe three or four of us, and I remember that they were all very kind and polite, you know.  I just enjoyed being with the children and with the teachers.  And Ms. McCullum [ph.], at that time, was the principal of the school, and there was an Irish girl, who I guess she wanted to get rid of, or something, I don't know, or dismiss her, have her dismissed if she could.  They couldn't dismiss us, you know, after you became a teacher.  They can now, but not then, so I did very well with my teaching career and I was constantly moved up--constantly.  I started off in fifth--sixth grade and then I was moved up until I got to the seventh and eighth grade, so that's where I stayed until I changed--
Speaker 1: I was just going to ask how long it took to get to the eighth grade level.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, every year, you know, you're promoted, you know, moved up.  So that's all that I know.
Story_ID: 187112
Speaker 1: Tell us about the Negro history curriculum and how you fought to get it passed?
Speaker 2: Well, it was-- Chicago [Illinois]--We didn't have trouble here in Chicago.  They accepted it here, the Chicago group.
Speaker 1: The Chicago Board of Education.
Speaker 2: I may be digressing when I say that all of the textbooks that are used in a school are adopted by the state, and Illinois had adopted the books, but Alabama did not adopt, and that's where the problem arose. And this is the place where I speak of as the mustard seed, because Alabama, where [George Washington] Carver's name came up, they would not adopt a story about Carver, Dr. Carver, who--the peanuts, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes, George Washington Carver.
Speaker 2: George Washington Carver, that's it.  And so books are adopted by states for the state and that being the only state that did not adopt, then--I'm completely--I don't know how to say it.
Speaker 1: Well just-- if you could just tell us how the struggle was like here in Illinois.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, the struggle wasn't difficult here.  We adopted it--it was adopted under Corneal [A.] Davis.
Speaker 1: He was a [Illinois] state representative.
Speaker 2: He was a state representative.
Speaker 1: Black?
Speaker 2: Yes. And the state went along with the adoption, so I call that "the mustard seed" that the adoption just was present all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now I want to go back to the beginning of this idea and-- because every idea starts somewhere, and so whose idea was it for us to have a Negro History curriculum in the Illinois public schools?
Speaker 2: Well, I did. That I have no problem with.  I know that.  That's the mustard seed.  I speak of that as "the mustard seed," because that made it possible--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Well, I wanted to ask you another--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --because that made it possible now throughout the whole United States there are no books for a person belonging to the United States of America without blacks included in the curriculum.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Okay, now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --So there's always a black story someplace.
Speaker 1: Right, I wanted to ask you too like what influence you to do this I mean because it hadn't been done before?
Speaker 2: No, it had not been done before, but I wanted to have the children, my students, know that some of the people of our group had done something the makings and blessings of this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had done our part.
Speaker 1: Now, were you then a member of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History [later, The Association for the Study of African American Life and History] when you started--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, when did you join the association, do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see now who got me in,
Speaker 1: Yeah, who got you in?
Speaker 2: Beatrice Steel [ph.], B. Steel.  She was head of this, Beatrice Steel.  Now, what year, don't ask.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it during the '30s [1930s] do you think?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But B. Steel made me a member.  She was in charge of the--that phase of history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when did you meet--or tell us about meeting--just tell us about meeting Carter G. Woodson.
Speaker 2: Oh, now I have--don't I have a letter or something where he told me that--he expected me to--to carry on, and this was your job or something?
Speaker 1: This is your duty to abide--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Don't I have a letter in there?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought I did because I can't remember.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --chapter--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Do you have the letter?
Speaker 1: I do.  I have to--
Speaker 2: Well take a look for it while we continue.  She'll take a look for it.
Speaker 1: He said, "I expect you to do this."  He expected me to do this.
Speaker 2: Okay, had he attempted to do anything like it similar, himself, in other states?
Speaker 1: I don't know about that, but I know he told me he expected me to do it.
Story_ID: 187113
Speaker 1: So how did you get started?
Speaker 2: Who? How did I get started?
Speaker 1: How did you get started with this project, I mean if you're--?
Speaker 2: In my classrooms, you know,
Speaker 1: You started teaching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and then I started teaching.
Speaker 1: Did you have any opposition in--from the school for teaching black history in the classroom?
Speaker 2: No, not really, you know.  It was slowly adopted, you know--but
Speaker 1: Well, it was something new.  You know, no opposition against teaching black history when you started?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't seem to have that.  I didn't have that.  Some people ignored it, but they didn't put up a big fight about it.  And--do you have that story?
Speaker 1: She's looking for it, but we can keep talking while she is looking.  She is looking for it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--so you had no opposition to it at all?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have support?  Did people like the idea?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't like it, but they just didn't fight it.  That's the way I have to say it.  That it just went in quietly, and the books came out, and they were accepted.  And nothing was said about it.  They may not have read the stories--they may not have, you know, insisted that the children read what they should read, but I usually asked them questions that I thought they might want to know: "How many schools are named for Negroes?"; and "How many stamps are out for Negroes?"; and "What's happening," you know?  For instance, I would be very concerned, and I am now to think that they haven't told who this black doctor who is making it possible for the blind to see again.  What is-- can be happening?  What is greater than for a person to regain his sight?  It's bad enough being old, but having no sight must be awful. It must be an awful experience.  It must be a very sad experience.
Story_ID: 187114
Speaker 1: What were some of the stories that you wanted your children to learn, or your students, to learn?
Speaker 2: Well, I have a list of them.  Don't--do you have the listing now?  See, I can't remember all of this stuff.
Speaker 1: Well, people like, I'm looking at the book here, the curriculum, and you have Benjamin Banneker, Crispus Attucks--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: Phillis Wheatley, people like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all of the people.  Who were some of the people?  You know, those stories have been told by us, you see.  We're sitting here.  Did any of us do anything, you know?  And we did.
Speaker 1: Well, in those days, I know there was a lot talk about black people not having contributed anything to the world.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: In fact, that was the instruction in the classroom quite often (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  They hadn't made that contribution, but we have, see?  But we have to dig it up.  We have to find it.  We have to know it.  It's our business to find it and reveal it.
Speaker 1: Nobody is going to tell our story.
Speaker 2: No, no.  If you expect to have knowledge and power, then you're going to have to get out there and get it, and learn and read for yourself.  Mary McCall [ph.] said when they grabbed this book from her and said, "You can't read?"  And she said, "Oh, it's reading that makes the difference, reading" and she set out to read, and they didn't know when she said, "Read this.  Read this to me," that they were teaching her how to read. But that is the innocence of youth, children, you know.  Sure, they taught her how to read and they didn't realize they were teaching her how to read, but that's the innocence of children.
Speaker 1: Now, how did children--how did your students feel when they read these stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, they felt good, they felt good.  You know, I had an interesting experience at lunch hour I usually sat in my room and I had the New York Times and the Christian Science Monitor, and people like that, and I would read and write stories, you see.  Is this it?
Speaker 1: That's the letter [from Carter G. Woodson], yeah.  Did you want to read from it?
Speaker 2: You can have it.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know, but would like--did you want to read something from it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  Oh, I see, you want me to read something.
Speaker 1: A handwritten notation at the bottom on page two.
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: On page two.
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  This is where--yeah, this is from Carter: "The Chicago board--branch of the Association [for the Study of Negro Life and History later, the Association for the Study of African American Life and History]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Can you sit back?  Can you do that again, and can you sit back a little bit because you were too close to the camera--
Speaker 2: "The Chicago branch of the Association is dead.  It will be your duty to revive it"-- Carter G. Wilson.  That's what he is saying to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He sent that to you in 1946 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Six, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was very close to Carter G. Woodson, very close to him, yeah--very close to him, and he used to, you know, talk to me about things that I should do and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: You want to keep that? You can have it--
Speaker 1: Oh, sure. Thank you very much. Yeah, we're going treasure this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was very proud of Carter G. Woodson.
Story_ID: 187115
Speaker 1: What was he like?  What was Carter G. Wilson like?
Speaker 2: He was--he now--what do you call it--he was very--not finicky, but--
Speaker 1: --very detailed or?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was detailed.
Speaker 1: --rigorous?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --scholarly?
Speaker 2: Oh, very scholarly, tremendously, no foolishness at all with him.  He was a very wonderful person to sit with and talk about situations and things, like Walter [Francis] White was, too.  He was another person who was a wonderful person to be around.
Speaker 1: Do you a good story about Carter G. Woodson you can tell us, or?
Speaker 2: Well, he was just a wonderful person--I was always happy to see him and we would talk about any number of things.  He was just a great scholar, great scholar, and I was very glad to know him as well as I did.
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. Charles [H.] Wesley, too?
Speaker 2: Yes, but not like I do Carter--Carter G, um-hm. Yes. I knew Walter White fairly well, too.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Walter White.  Now Walter White was executive secretary of the NAACP at one time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and honey, he was as white as snow (laughter) with his blue eyes and I remember we were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --he was black, though.  He was a black person, but he --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he was a black man--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --he looked like he was white.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right and I remember we were eating and he said, "Wait until I get upstairs," or something like that, "and tell them about this" some experience that we--he was having.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did Walter White ever talk about his experiences down south?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Because he had some close calls down there.
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.  I can't remember any of them right now, but he was just a wonderful person to be near.  It was just nice to sit near him.
Story_ID: 187116
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of the other people we have come down in history that you might have known?  What about Edith [S.] Sampson?
Speaker 2: Yes, Edith Sampson lived at E. 37 Street [Chicago, Illinois] and she was something else.  I'm trying to think about what I can say about Edith.  I don't know what to say about Edith, but she was a very fine person.  I enjoyed Edith.  She was--but I can't think of anything specific.  Do I have a letter from Edith?  Is that it?
Speaker 1: Right, here's one, right here.
Speaker 2: "I express myself with reference to the luncheon meeting. Thought that I should drop you a line. (unclear) Smith was the finest (unclear)." I better put these [glasses] on. Things that I have been looking for, I'm giving them to you. All these letters (laughter)-- Edith was something else, wasn't she?
Speaker 1: I didn't know her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So I don't know her significance really.  I was hoping you would tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How significant she is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, she was a lawyer.  Edith was a lawyer. She was, you know, snappy and tells you off in a minute, you know, but she was both-- she was--we got along, and I-- I just felt very comfortable with Edith all the time.  I don't know anything specific to say except this indicates the way she think--thought, you know?
Speaker 2: Okay, what about A. Leon Higginbotham [Jr.]? He's someone who (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't know too much about Higginbotham.  Now, we had a Higginbotham who lived in the same building where we lived in 54th [Street] and Dearborn [Street, Chicago, Illinois], but I don't know if that was the same Higginbotham or not.
Speaker 2: Well, in this letter, Higginbotham writes you and he is asking for a copy of a picture that he took with [HM] John Hope Franklin with you.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --that he took of John Hope Franklin?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --no, with you--
Speaker 1: With me?
Speaker 2: Yeah with you and John Hope Franklin.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, well John Hope Franklin and I were very close.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  John is still living.  Aurelia [Whittington Franklin] is dead.  Now, she did not--I mean Aurelia never knew what she was going to eat, especially in holiday periods and other times, too, because John did all of the cooking and planning; and I suppose his son [John Whittington Franklin] does now.  I can't think of whether they call him Whitty [ph.], isn't it Whittin [ph.]?  I think it's Whitty, they call him Whittin or Whitty, but John is still living.
Speaker 2: Right; we're trying to interview him, too.
Speaker 1: I don't know how well he is.  I don't think he is too well.
Story_ID: 187117
Speaker 1: You knew Mary [Jane] McLeod Bethune very well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us something about her and don't assume we know who she is, just tell us as if we never met her before. Who is she and--
Speaker 2: Mrs. Bethune had a niece who lived on the third floor of the building in which I lived, 5703 Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and when she would go upstairs to see her niece, she would ring my bell, and she would come in and talk with me.  And I used to tell her about some of the discouragement I had, you know, and things like that, and she said, "Don't be discouraged.  Just go right on doing what you're doing."  That, "You know, [Christopher] Columbus didn't discover this world alone when he came here.  So just keep on doing what you're doing."  So that's--she was just a very--she always encouraged me to do more and don't be afraid what people might say, you know, or but she was a very wonderful person.  I admired her.  I wanted to be like her, like Mrs. Bethune, and I remember I said to some people who asked, whom did I want to be like, and I said, "Mrs. Bethune," and they said, "That old black woman?"  And I said, "Yes.  When we go to Washington, D.C. or when we go to these big meetings, she's there and everybody knows her. And she and Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, are always together."  I said, "Of course."  I said, "Color has nothing to do with it.  I'm very proud of her."  And they wanted me to think about going down there to teach, but I didn't.  I don't know what happened, but I didn't get involved because I was teaching here, and I knew what I had here, but I didn't know about down there.  That's all I can say about her at this moment.
Story_ID: 187118
Speaker 1: Now when you got your curriculum passed, but something must have happened along the way because there came a time when, really--this--well, when your curriculum was passed and you started teaching black history in the schools--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, here in Chicago, I mean it wasn't picked up by everyone or was it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was in the textbooks.  See, when it gets in the textbook, the teacher may not assign that story to be read or that sort of thing, but it's in the textbook, so you can't really tell whether the child has read the story or not just because of assignments, you know.
Speaker 1: There was some confusion in the state legislature, too or was it not--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the beginning.
Speaker 1: In the beginning, I think the original legislation said that the curriculum "shall be taught," right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was not mandatory.
Speaker 1: "shall be taught," "shall be taught," right?--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was not mandatory.
Speaker 1: And then when it got to the Illinois Senate, you said, they changed the wording?
Speaker 2: "Shall be" instead of "must be."  They didn't make it mandatory.
Speaker 1: I think it said, "It may be taught" instead of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: -- "may be taught" that's right.
Speaker 1: -- of "shall be taught."  Okay.
Speaker 2: So they changed that and that was Corneal [A.] Davis who did that.
Speaker 1: Oh, he changed the wording?
Speaker 2: Well, no, he didn't change the wording.
Speaker 1: He wrote the legislation.
Speaker 2: He wrote the legislation, the original--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --the legislation, yes.
Speaker 2: And then the Illinois State Senate changed the wording.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What happened after that?  Did we see--I mean, did teachers pick up the curriculum and start using it in the class?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, they have--they've gone along with it.  There seems to be no problem.  There seems to be no problem, but there are going to be problems even if it seems, you know.  Some teachers will stress some things and some will not, but the story is there so that the child can read it.  It's in the book ['Negroes Who Helped Build America', Madeline Stratton Morris, 1965].
Story_ID: 187119
Speaker 1: Did you write about [Jean Baptiste Point] DuSable in those days?  Did you write about DuSable?
Speaker 2: Just a little, but [HM] Margaret [Burroughs] was really the one who dealt with that.
Speaker 1: Dr. Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Margaret Burroughs.  You see now, I noticed now since [Charles Gordon] Burroughs is dead, that Margaret is going back to her first husband [Bernard Goss], who was a tremendous artist--tremendous artist and she had a daughter by him, and now she has gone back to that phase of her life, so--I told Margaret, "Margaret, I can't follow you now.  I have to stay in this United States," when she was married to Burroughs.  I said, "I have to stay with what I want done here or what I would like to have done here in this country."
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. Burroughs when she was in school?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. Burroughs when she was in school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, not in grammar.  Oh see, how did I know Margaret?  I don't know, but we were working in Negro history and she wanted me to come along her route, but I told her, "No, I can't do your route.  I have to stay with the United States." And she was involved--because when I went to Russia, they knew Margaret Burroughs, and you know they were always asking me something about Margaret Burroughs.  I said, "Yes, I know her," you know, but I told Margaret that I had to stay in the United States because I want to see these children and we get some equality in our own country.  So that's where we broke, but we didn't break friendship.  We broke with which route we were going to take.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was a socialist.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --a communist.
Speaker 1: --a communist.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --They claimed Margaret to be a communist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Charlie Burroughs, her husband--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Charles Burroughs--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --had a history.  He was raised in the Soviet Union--in Russia.
Speaker 2: Well, he was the one.  And she--they all knew Margaret in Russia, but I see she's referring to her husband now--her first husband.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles--no it wasn't Charles, Burroughs, no it wasn't Burroughs.
Speaker 1: Was it [Bernard] Goss?  No, that was her maiden name, right? G-O-S-S.
Speaker 2: Well, wait now, what did we say just a few minutes ago?
Speaker 1: Burroughs, Goss, and Taylor.
Speaker 2: Goss, Goss--His name was Goss, but he was a brilliant man, artist, and she is now referring to him, and he was fair skinned and the daughter is fair-skinned.  They live at 37th and Michigan and she's still there.  And that's where she and Goss got started and she stayed there with Burroughs, so I don't know how that worked out, but that's as much I know.
Story_ID: 186716
Speaker 1: Did I ask--did you tell the Russian story yet?
Speaker 2: Russian story?
Speaker 1: Because you have a Russian story you said to make sure to ask you about.
Speaker 2: Oh, when I was in Russia, we had a table with the American flag on it, and the people--those of us who were--we guests of that country for history or something [Association for the Study of African American Life & History-sponsored tour of the USSR in 1975]--why was I there, well anyway we were guests of the country and we had been told to always be polite, and to not to, you know, be impolite of any kind, so when this officer came officer came over and asked me to dance with him, I got up and danced with him and I noticed that as were dancing, we were getting farther and farther away from the table and from the community of people that I should be associated with.  And I tapped him on the shoulder and said, "I'm going back--back to the table."  And so I went back to the table, so that was the end of that, and then another time, he, at this meeting, they would fill up your glass with vodka--and before I knew it--the first time, I drank it, you know, and I thought that would be the end of it, and then before I knew it, this man was back pouring some more vodka in there and I said, "Uh-oh, I can't do this," so I didn't know what to do, but every once in a while, I would put my tongue, the tip of my tongue in this and the glass was still full, so they didn't bother me about this vodka anymore, but that's what I had to do in order not to--I knew if they got me back--this fellow dancer had gotten me back there, where I couldn't speak a word of Russian, I was gone, they'd never find me, and so the fellows at the table said, "We were watching you, wondering what you were going to do."  And I said, "Well, I saw him going in the other direction, I said, "I touched him," and said, "I'm going back, back, back."  And I went--left him, went over to my table and sat down.  I remember there was a colored fellow, his name was Washington [ph.]; I don't remember his first name, but he was one of us, from--from America of United States, and there was somebody else.  I don't remember who the other person was, but that's--that was my story on Russia.
Story_ID: 186717
Speaker 1: You've written some books, and we've got a couple of them here.  In addition to the curriculum you wrote, there's a book called, 'The Negroes who helped build America' [Madeline Stratton Morris] which--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a book company [Ginn & Company] that made books for Chicago [Illinois] and the United States.  That was a big company.
Speaker 1: Ginn Company.
Speaker 2: Ginn Company.
Speaker 1: Ginn and I think they're in Massachusetts--yeah, based in Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When was that book written?  I have forgotten.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --oh 1965.
Speaker 1: This edition anyway is 1965 and there are biographies of black people in this book, pioneers of science, defenders of our country, builders in commerce and industry, politicians and statesmen, educators and artists, abolitionists and spokesmen.  And you have another book here.  It is called 'Strides forward: Afro-American Biographies' [Madeline Stratton Morris], and both of these books are written during the '60s [sic, 1965 and 1973], I believe.  I just want to know what you thought about the surge of interest in black history during the 1960s.  There was a black cultural-kind of awakening in the '60s [1960] and what did you think about that?
Speaker 2: Well, they all did, yes, and I speak of that as the mustard seed.  Now, you don't pick up--you don't see on television anything that doesn't show the plurality of racism, the black and white, you see that over and over again--I don't--every movie, everything on television, there's a black and white working together, and they work in harmony and I tell you I think that we can say safely that sports has done a lot to bring this about, too.  It's not I-- it's we; we do this.  You don't do anything by yourself; somebody else is with you in thought, or against you.  That is another thought, but the hatred isn't there like it was formally.  I don't think--now it may be.  Now, this fellow who did all the shooting a couple of days ago, that man was crazy in the beginning.  He didn't have anything work with at all; otherwise, he would have known that he wasn't gonna get anyplace, and so he kills people who are innocent, people who have evidently been kind to him and people who have, you know, just hated, you know.   So when I say, I think that my work--I want to be remembered--that my work was a mustard seed--that is throughout the world. We now take all people into consideration.  My thoughts don't have to be exactly yours.  They may be something like it.  They may not be anything like it, but at least I've been able to present my thought.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope we can get back to some phase of sanity, or recognition, that I'm not going to think exactly like you.  I may think somewhat like you.  There will be some latitude, something there that will make it possible for us to live together, respect each other, not admire, but respect.  I think a lot of our living has to be respect, just like in marriage, in any friendship--we respect.  I'm not going to say the exact words, but just respect what I have to say--let me say what I want to say, and I need to be corrected, understanding that we must be corrected because we all make mistakes.  We're not infallible.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We all make mistakes.
Story_ID: 186719
Speaker 1: When you look back on things, what would you consider right now is your legacy?
Speaker 2: Now, legacy--what are telling me now--asking me?
Speaker 1: I'm asking you when you look at the things that you've been able to accomplish over the years, what would you summarize as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Respect--respect for all people--respect for all people.  Nobody is infallible.  I respect you for what you can do, what you have done, and for the works that you do for people.  I respect.  I have some love and admiration for all people, everybody.  I think that's the dominant thing: to respect, and to love and respect people. No person should have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For instance, I just get disgusted when I see these people marching like the Nazis were marching.  Every once in a while, they'll show a short film or something, showing them fellows walking at that pace.  That's not showing respect because look what they did to the Jewish people, look what they did to Christ, and they talk about Christ and Jesus, and all that.  Who was Jesus?  He was a Jewish person.  That is on much of our literature, you know, but look how they crucified the Jewish people. So I think respect, let me--let us have respect, man and woman, husband and wife, we respect each other.  I don't think like he thinks all the time.  My husband, Sam--I wasn't married to Walter very long--Walter Morris, but respect, just respect each other, you know.  We would sit in that dining room for hours with a dictionary and a thesaurus and he'd say, "Darling, did you hear that word? Let's work on that word."  We'd get the thesaurus and look at it, you know?  My thesaurus has disappeared.  I don't know where it is because we sat with that on the dining room table when we were having dinner and the television on, and Sam would say, "Darling, did you hear that?"  And another thing, I don't care how angry he was with me, it was "darling," but maybe it was a different inflection or something like that.  And he--we lived at 5703 -Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] when we married, and he would say, "Now, darling--and I was pregnant at the time-- "Darling, what do you what me to get for you before it gets dark because you know I don't like to go up on 58th Street [Chicago, Illinois].  He was very sensitive to 58 Street.  And I said, "Well, get me some pickles."  I always wanted pickles, you know.  So he would go up there and get pickles, and come on back home, you know, but that was the life that we lived, you know, with him, but respect.  It seemed to me, you know, there were times that I'd be angry with him and times when he was angry with me, but we respected each other. That's all, and our love didn't change, but we respected each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all.  I don't know how to say it other than that, you know.  With Walter, I wasn't married to him very long before he died with emphysema, and he loved cigarettes.  He just ate 'em up.  He walked a mile just to smell some smoke.  And I had a young man working for me and I'd say, "If you bring another package of cigarettes to him, you can't come back here to work anymore," and so he stopped, and Walter tried to stop, but he couldn't, but he was a very fine man.  He wanted to be a millionaire.  That was what he was working toward.  He had a construction company, laying cement.  And he had contacts with the city and the state for underground work, you know, laying cement in subways and all that kind of stuff.  I didn't know that too much because we weren't married very long before he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he had emphysema, cancer of the lungs.

Speaker 1: Do you plan to write any books in the future?
Speaker 2: Now, you know I can't write.  I can't think--
Speaker 1: You might be able to dictate them.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I can't write.  I can't think.
Speaker 1: Do you any unfinished books or works?
Speaker 2: No, I have--I don't plan to do anything.  I don't plan to do anything.  I started to call this off.  I said, "Because I don't have anything to offer those young men."
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad you didn't call it off.
Speaker 2: Well, I started to because I couldn't find my stuff.  She had all of it.  I had given it away.  I said, "Come over here, get what you want," she did, she took what she wanted.  It was all right with me.  I didn't know where it was.
Speaker 1: Well, sometimes we forget.
Speaker 2: Honey, you don't know have the forget that goes up in here now.  It's a different kind of a forget.
Speaker 1: We won't forget you, and thank you for this interview.
Speaker 2: Oh well, I'm just so happy--
Story_ID: 186721
Speaker 1: Mrs. Stratton, since I was introduced at the beginning, I was just going to say, my name, again, [HM] Glennette Tilley Turner, but I just feel so honored that you entrusted your papers to me, and that you're allowing me to house them at the Vivian [G.] Harsh [Research] Collection at the Carter G. Woodson [Regional Library, Chicago, Illinois], and then future scholars can have the benefit of knowing all your work and the pioneering efforts that you made, but I'd like to ask, are there any schools that are named for you yet?
Speaker 2: Oh, no!
Speaker 1: Wouldn't that be the ultimate tribute?
Speaker 2: No, no school.  That had never crossed my mind.
Speaker 1: Well you pointed out to students what schools are named for outstanding black people--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --yes, I wanted students to know that what we had--but we didn't have colored principals, you know?  We didn't have many colored teachers when I came along.  See?  I've been here almost a hundred years as my nephew said, so that's a long period of time, but I don't--well, I'm just happy that the world is changing.  I'm so glad.  There is going to be more respect.  I think there is going--I think the young people--you know, they're seeing the plurality of life.  We have to have it.  There are a lot of beautiful people, white and black.  Both of us, we're all trying to do some good and as long as we live, we must do good to all of the people that we meet and every place we go, and keep people alert to the good things that people do and the evil things will disappear, but I think life is beautiful, and people have been veery kind and thoughtful to each other, and we must be.  And I want to thank you for including me in this history making group.  I had never heard of them before, and I'm so proud to meet them.  They're fine, young men, black and white, great people, so I'm glad.  This is what I'm talking about, see?  Here's this mutual respect.  These two men, one black and one white, and they're both respectful of each other, and I think that's beautiful.  It doesn't mean that you want the person to be saying every word that you say is right, but let us respect each other, and I love it.  I love it that way; and I hope for all of us--all of us, I want to be included too, that we just live a comfortable, pleasant life with respect for each other, and I think that word "respect" along with some love and kindness will bring about a great change in this world, because it's God's world.  It isn't ours.  We don't know how this world began.  We don't know when it will end.  We don't know when are going to end.  We may live to be a hundred.  We may live to be not 200 (Laughter).  A hundred is enough or a little more, but, you know, I'm just so grateful for you coming this afternoon.  This is a great organization.  I'd had never heard of this group of people, and they're fine men, fine, young men, so I'm very proud.

Speaker 1: Tell us who is in that picture, Mrs. Stratton?
Speaker 2: All right. Seated on the couch are my parents, my mother [Estella Dixon Robinson] and father [John Robinson] and then the first person, over there, to my left, in the dark dress, is my baby sister, Edith Robinson Franklin, and then my mother is Estella Dixon Robinson, my father, John H. Robinson, my sister, who is deceased is Zana [ph.] Robinson.  Now, the little boy down there is seated in front of ma is Bobby.  He is the son of my brother of my brother, Robert, but Robert is not in this picture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, that young man is Robert, my brother's son.  And next is--oh, no, I'm wrong, now that next picture.  That's right, Robert, then the next person is Violet Robinson, married to my brother.  The next person is Vivian Robinson, she was Mrs. Burns [ph.], but she changed her name.  She didn't want to be married to Burns.  Then Edrona [ph.] is the second sister and she is deceased for about five or six years, and then I'm next, Madeline Stratton Morris, and then Sam Stratton.  Now, that's that picture up there.
Speaker 1: Now, about what year do you think this picture was taken?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was taken right in this living room, too, by the way, you can see some things, the couch is particular.  Let me have the picture, I can't see it.
Speaker 1: Is it written on the back?  What does it say?
Speaker 2: It says here Robert Robinson.  This is Bobby.
Speaker 1: Does it tell the date on the back?
Speaker 2: Let me see, do I have the date? 1947.
Speaker 1: Excellent.  We finished one whole picture. How about the next picture?
Speaker 2: May I have it?
Speaker 1: Yes, you may--
Speaker 2: Okay, this picture is--was made in the Grand Hotel in Las Vegas [Nevada].  This is a family picture, too.
Speaker 1: About what year?
Speaker 2: I don't see it.  I don't have a date on this.
Speaker 1: That folio might have the date on it because it came in that.
Speaker 2: No, this is part of it, the in-laws.  Now, the first picture there to my left, that's it--that is Yolanda--it looks like Yolanda--I'm not seeing too well.  Where are my glasses?  Well, I guess I can see.  Yolanda, then Ed--Dr. Edward Stratton, and then Sylvia Stratton, then across from Sylvia is her mother, Kitty--really it's Katherine Stratton, and then Dr. Henry Stratton, and then Madeline.
Speaker 1: Those are brothers of Samuel.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --brothers of Sam.  Those two men are doctors, M.D., medical doctors.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.  Next.
Speaker 2: Then this is when I was down in Springfield [Illinois] with my class.  What year is that?  I don't know what year it is.  Does it say on the back?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Let him get a shot first, and then we'll look at the back.  I know it's in the 40s.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: That's my class.  Let me see what--if there's anything there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1956, October 4th and thru the 5th 1956.  Can you give us the date again?  Just read it into the mic.
Speaker 2: October 5th, 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good.  How about this photo here?
Speaker 2: This photo was when we were at a meeting downtown [Chicago, Illinois].  I think this was Phi Delta Gappa people.  May I have that a little closer to me just for a second?  I just want to--I was [Supreme] Basileus.  Here I am here and here is Bessie, the one who worked with me.  Now, somebody wanted to decide who should work with me and Dr., who was the district superintendent--I think that's right. Dr. Smith--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I think so.
Speaker 2: --said, she knows better, you know, who wants to work with her, and so I chose Bessie Smith, but Bessie died about maybe then years ago, but this was a hotel where we met and ate dinner.  You know, we couldn't eat or have dinners anyplace we wanted to and it appears the places we went to--what was the name of that hotel?
Speaker 1: You said the Palmer House [Hilton, (Chicago, Illinois] was one of the first ones to open.
Speaker 2: The Palmer House.
Speaker 1: Now, while the photo was off camera, she identified herself and Bessie, but we don't know who that is unless.
Speaker 2: This is you in the picture (simultaneous)?--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's Madeline and then that's Bessie--
Speaker 2: And she was your assistant when you did the curriculum guide, wasn't she (simultaneous)?--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. They said, "She is to choose somebody she wants to work with her," so she could be dismissed from her classroom duty because I was dismissed, you see?
Speaker 2: Yes, because you went downtown to the-(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, I went to the curriculum department.
Speaker 2: This is Mrs. Stratton and this is the young women who assisted her, Bessie.
Speaker 1: Bessie King.
Speaker 2: Next photo?
Speaker 1: That's when we were in Egypt.  Isn't that when we were in Cairo, Egypt?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is that Cairo, Egypt?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's in 1964.
Speaker 2: Oh, is it?  Yes, 1964, that's when we took our trip around the world.
Speaker 1: October 1964.
Speaker 2: That's Sam. I was on, isn't that donkey?
Speaker 1: A camel. From that angle, it's hard--you don't see the hump.
Speaker 2: Camel, um-hm, because I was scared to death getting up on that, but they stay on the ground until the person gets up on you--on them.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.  Next.
Speaker 2: That's Bessie again.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute--
Speaker 2: This appears to be the same event [at the Palmer House Hilton], but go ahead and give the any other commentary for this photo.
Speaker 1: Didn't you say that was when you were announcing your curriculum guide that you were introducing it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  This looks like [Samuel L.] Gandy here.
Speaker 1: Oh, you know Sam Gandy?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.  He was wonderful to my father.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: With the little mustache.
Speaker 2: Here is Juanita [ph].
Speaker 1: Juanita Cochran [ph].
Speaker 2: And here is McCullum [ph.] and here is Bessie.

Speaker 1: For the record, tell us who these individuals are.
Speaker 2: This is Eleanor McCullum [ph.] the principal, Mrs. Stratton, Superintendent William H. Johnson, and Bessie King [ph.], who was your assistant, is that correct?
Speaker 1: Um-hm..
Speaker 2: What would the date and occasion be for this photo?
Speaker 1: What was the occasion?  It's the same occasion.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --This is when Negro history ['Negroes who helped build America,' Madeline Stratton Morris]--this is a part of the introduction and acceptance--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Of the curriculum--
Speaker 2: Right, it's the same event.
Speaker 1: Is there a date in there?  I wonder if some of the others have a date on them.
Speaker 2: Is it on the back of it?
Speaker 1: No, it's not written there.
Speaker 2: Write it on there.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know would it be around 1941?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it was later than that.
Speaker 1: Was it?
Speaker 2: Didn't you say it was the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: It had to be.
Speaker 2: I think there are other pictures on that occasion.
Speaker 1: There is some more over there.
Speaker 2: I think that's the picture of the people on the train, here I'll trade with you.
Speaker 1: Well, we're ready to get a description for this photograph when you people are ready.  What's in this picture there?
Speaker 2: This one there?  Up there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what's the occasion?  Who's in it? When was it taken?
Speaker 2: I don't see it.

Speaker 2: It's 1977--
Speaker 1: Let me see what that says.  Oh, I see.  This is Walter.  This girl used to sing.  I can't remember her name.
Speaker 2: I think it's on the back.
Speaker 1: Here I am.
Speaker 2: Let me take a look.
Speaker 1: Ms. Turner can read it.
Speaker 2: Why don't we let Glenette read it?  It's kind of hard.
Speaker 1: Oh I see Sheraton [ph.], Oklahoma, Evelyn Jackson [ph.].  June 26, 1937--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Nineteen seventy-seven [1977]
Speaker 1: --Oh, Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 2: We still haven't identify the people, so the caption person will be able to know who they are.  They're not in the room here.  They have to have a positive indication.
Speaker 1: From left to right is Evelyn Jackson.
Speaker 2: Well, we have to put it up higher than that, and then give it to the left to the right.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: All right, left to right, Evelyn Jackson, Mrs. Stratton-Morris and Mr. [Walter] Morris.
Speaker 1: --Walter Morris--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Walter Morris
Speaker 1: --and Madeline Stratton.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Madeline Stratton--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Madeline Stratton Morris.

Speaker 1: --I did walk ahead.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --Even though you were all there for the same cause.
Speaker 1: Linebacker--linebacker, something like that.
Speaker 2: When we interviewed her (unclear) this morning, we didn't really (unclear).
Speaker 1: There he is again.
Speaker 2: Mrs. Turner, the people that you do know, if you can point out.
Speaker 1: The only one I know is Mrs. Stratton.
Speaker 2: Okay, if you can point her out.

Speaker 1: I think we're going down to Springfield [Illinois], does it say so?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but with the suitcases,--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Yeah, I think we were going down to Springfield.--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it must have been when you went to lobby for that bill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's my nephew and his wife.  They just married; they hadn't been married but a couple of years, or something like that.  I just received this this past week; and he wanted to live with me, but I wouldn't let him live with me.
Speaker 1: Tell us your nephew's name.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Tell us his name and his wife's name.
Speaker 2: Show me--give me the thing.  He is asking for the name.  The name is Connie, her name is Connie and his name is Anthony Stratton.
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: Connie and Anthony Stratton.  Now, he looked white, and he wanted to live with me, but I wouldn't let him because I knew he would be friendly with the folks, fellows, you know? And the next thing I knew, he'd be in trouble or he'd get killed, you know, they were beating up.
Speaker 1: Now, that was a wedding photo and you said they got married a couple of years ago?
Speaker 2: About two--I guess so.  I don't know.  I don't really know.
Speaker 1: We could look at the back. OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION
Speaker 2: Can we put it on tape?
Speaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: All right, the names of this picture are written on the opposite side of the picture, Edsel Hudson [ph.], his picture is right on the opposite side, Lyman [Abbott] Webber is pictured on the opposite side here, Cornelius Palmer [ph.], Reverend Kenneth [B.] Smith [Sr.].
Speaker 1: You don't have to read each one.  You just have to let them know that these are going--instead of going left to right when they identify the photo; they should go right to left.
Speaker 2: Should I say that again?
Speaker 1: You say it because I'm not on mic anymore.
Speaker 2: Instead of these going from left to right, this caption should read from right to left, so that Edsel Hudson is here and Otho Robinson is here on this side when the picture is flipped.  It's the trustee board of Church of the Good Shepherd [Chicago, Illinois], 1970.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: You did that one, didn't you do that one?  Didn't you do this one?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Is that your family?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my mother [Estella Dixon Robinson] and father [John Robinson], see?
Speaker 2: It's later.  I see you and Mr. Stratton.  These are your parents, right? OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION
Speaker 1: Go from left to right, maybe--
Speaker 2: This is Mr. Stratton and Mrs. Stratton and these are your parents, John Robinson and Estella Robinson.  I don't know the other people and your sist-- your relatives.
Speaker 1: You want the names of the other people?  This is my family.
Speaker 2: Okay. We named them all before.

Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: The Anniversary of his relatives, two of his relatives.
