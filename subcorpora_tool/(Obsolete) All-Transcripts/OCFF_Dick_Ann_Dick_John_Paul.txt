 Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also joining me today is Tanya Finchum. Today is Monday,  April 25, 2011 and we   re here in Grand, Oklahoma interviewing Ann  Dick and her son J.P., or John Paul, about their centennial farm as part  of our Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project. And let me get  the name of this farm right. It is the Bar Tee Jay Ranch.  Yes.  Okay. Well, Ann, let   s begin by learning a little more about you and  your family. How did your family come to Oklahoma?  Well, actually, I was the first one to come to Oklahoma after I married  my husband in Morocco, which was in those days French Morocco. He  had come with an American company, Morrison Knudsen, who had the  contracts. This was after World War II. They had the contract with the  Corps of Engineers to build the bases in and all over Europe, which they  did. They had five. They built five bases in Morocco, which again, was  French Morocco.  I was born in Morocco because my parents were from Spain, from  northern Spain. They came on their honeymoon to Morocco and literally  fell in love with it. It   s a beautiful country. It reminds me a lot of  southern California. So my father, who was a pharmacist, decided to buy  a pharmacy and stay there with his wife and raise a family there. That   s  how come I was born in Casablanca, Morocco. Well, twenty-some years  later, I met my husband who had arrived with the Corps of Engineers  and the Morrison Knudsen company to build bases in Morocco. We met,  and of course, fell in love and got married there. And when he passed  away, we had been married, I think, fifty-six years.  5  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  How did you meet your husband?  Well, in those days I was out on my first job after college in the  Consulate of Argentina. They gave a party, a reception, and my husband  was staying in Sidi Slimane, an  Air Force  base the American   s were  building in those days. I think his roommate, who was European, was  invited to that reception also and he brought my husband. That   s where  we met. I think the roommate was supposed to be my date, but we  changed things around. (Laughs) We were engaged maybe about four or  five months later and married, probably, a year later.  And where did you get married?  We got married first in Rabat, in the center of St. Francis Catholic  Church, and then we were also married at the American Embassy in  Tangier, Morocco, to be sure that things were legal. After that, of course,  we had the honeymoon in Spain, and we went back to Morocco where  he had to finish his contract. From there, the company sent him for  another   oh, I think we stayed four years in Iran building bases and  things like that, and highways. But meanwhile, at least once a year, we  were coming back to Oklahoma to visit. In those days, his parents were  still alive. He lost one young brother in   what was it?  The Korean War.  No, it was not the Korean War, it was before that. Indochina, I think it  was. A young brother died there. There were nine children, including my  husband. So anyway, we spent another four years in Iran, and we finally  came back to stay here.  So when you were visiting Oklahoma, where were you going?  Well, first of all, we spent a few weeks in New York because I had  cousins living there. Then we didn   t lose any time, we came straight to  Delaware County.  To the farm?  To the farm.  Yes, I think what she   s getting at is how did we acquire the centennial  farm? How did the Dick family come to Oklahoma to get the centennial  farm?  Oh, that   s another story. (Laughter)  6  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  I think that   s the story she wants. I think that   s why they   re here, Mom.  No, she asked how I met my husband.  Sure.  Okay.  So we kept coming every year and were staying a few days. We were  staying with my in-laws.  Well, what did you think of Oklahoma?  Oh, I loved it. I really loved it. I loved the whole country very, very  much. My mother   now, I don   t know if that interests you or not   but  my mother had come in 1904 and had gone with her uncle and aunt, who  were tourists, and had gone to the St. Louis World   s Fair. That   s right, in  1904. And so she kept telling me how wonderful the United States was.  She always kept that and I have the dish from 1904.  Well, tell me a little bit about the Dick family and how they came to  acquire the land.  Okay. The Dick family, as far as I know, and I might be making  mistakes, I go from what my mother-in-law and my husband  told me .  It   s really a shame that my husband passed away and his brother. They  were the two who really knew everything. But we found all those books  that may help you. So from what I know, they came   or maybe their  ancestors came   with the Trail of Tears.  The family was in Brasswood, North Carolina.  From Georgia.  Well, and Brasswood, North Carolina.  Yes, but the Dicks came from Georgia.  Well, remember when we went to see Jeff Muskrat out in Cherokee   North Carolina , and we went to Brasswood? He had the rolls as to how  many goats and cows and things like that they had. So they came over in  the Trail of Tears and settled in Delaware County. They were allotted  the Indian allotment, or were allotted acres where the home place is  now.  7  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  And I think it goes back four generations, don   t you think?  And that original Indian allotment was how many acres?  I think sixty. I heard my husband say sixty.  Yes, I believe it is sixty.  John Paul said it was.  The original acreage was sixty acres and it   s been added to, so the Bar  Tee Jay Ranch encompasses about 530 acres today. My dad acquired the  original sixty from his brothers and sisters when his dad passed away,  but he   d added lands acquired adjoining that, since the    50s. He would  send back money and buy land or he bought some when he came back.  Now, your husband   s family, were they farming the land?  Yes. His parents and grandparents were farming the land. They raised  nine children. Of course, as you know, it was not enough to raise a big  family, so my father-in-law worked at one time at the dam. Where was  the dam?  Pensacola Dam, in Disney.  Yes. He worked there for a while. My mother-in-law, who was a  wonderful lady, was teaching a one-class school and that was by Eucha.  You know where the restaurant is on top of that hill?  They may not. We   ll show them the old Gray Schoolhouse. We   ll show  them down there. They don   t know where that is.  There was what they called the Gray Schoolhouse and it was a one-room.  But they really weren   t farmers as such, like Western Oklahoma farmers  with wheat, corn, and things of that nature. This is much hillier. It was  more grazing cattle, farm animals, and growing what crops they needed  to live, but it wasn   t really a commercial farm.  Yes. But they always had a garden and all they needed to feed their  family and the people who helped them with the farm.  So in the early days, what kinds of crops are we talking about?  To be quite honest with you, I really don   t know. I know maize and  8  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  some wheat and some things, but it wasn   t for commercial use, for sale.  The families who had shared with the families who did not. So lots of  the stories my dad tells me are about everybody helping everybody else.  The house was built, I believe, in 1888. My granddad   s dad was born in  1892 and my dad was born in 1921. Six of his eight brothers and sisters  were born in that house. He was the third oldest.  He was the first boy. They had two girls, then one boy, then boys and  girls. Eight of them were born on that farm. Only the last one   and her  name is Naomi Sebastian from Jenks, married to Dr. Sebastian who was  a dentist, he   s retired   was the only one who was born in a hospital  around Fairland or Afton, somewhere there. That   s the only one.  Furthermore, I remember my husband saying that several people came to  have their baby at their place because   I don   t know, maybe they were a  little bit better off financially. Maybe they could afford to. But that  house was always full whether it was their children or somebody else   s  or they were helping someone who was going to have a baby. Do you  remember Daddy saying that?  Sure.  Does the house still stand?  Yes.  Yes, the house stands. And something funny happened. I don   t know if I  told you, but last week I got a phone call from the County Assessor  saying that they had raised the price. Did I tell you that?  You may not want to tell that story. (Laughter) The tax guy may get in  trouble for keeping it where it is, Mom. You may not want to tell that  story.  I called and they said,    Well, we took pictures of a house falling apart.  We go back and they   re putting on another roof.    And I said,    The only  reason we   re trying to keep it from falling apart is because it   s a  centennial house.    Then he agreed and he said,    Okay, thank you. Forget  about it.     Well, tell me about the old house. Describe it to me.  Okay. Where is that picture? Here it is. The entrance was     It   s a two-story home. It   s overlooking a valley.  The entrance was like a living room or a family room. Then it had a  9  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  kitchen. And upstairs they had the big bedroom for the kids, I guess.  Luckily, all the kids were not the same age. There were three and two,  and one. By the time my husband left there were still kids there.  Do you know how the house was heated?  Fireplace. Yes, they had one big fireplace there that heated pretty much  the whole house, so it got pretty cold upstairs.  Oh yes, and the house caught fire many times because they had a kitchen  with a stove. And of course, all the smoke and all, that came out back. It  went to the fireplace. And then the roof would start on fire. So they  would tell the kids, everybody would rush to get the water from the well,  and put it out. They put it out every time. It happened several times, but  the house never burned down. But this happened quite a bit. And that   s  in the books.  And how about a water source?  There was a well there.  The well was located to the, let   s see, to the other   can you hold it up  please?  It was on the east side of the house.  Okay. On the   well, that tree is on the end of the house, that   s where the  well was. The outhouse was on the left side and the well     On the opposite side of the house.     next to the well was a beautiful rose bush. And it disappeared. I don   t  know why, but I was sorry to see it go.  But they also had some springs that ran twelve months a year. Never  went dry. We had a spring just on the north side of the house, probably,  about a quarter of a mile, and then there were a couple of creeks, streams  that ran about a quarter-mile south of the house, that were more  seasonal, but     Was that included in the sixty acres?  Yes. The stream was. Dad acquired the land with the spring later, but  when you   re in the 1920s and    30s, you went where you wanted to. Dad  talks about riding a cow to school because it was a mile away and the  cow was warm on those winter days. So things of that nature. There are  10  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  some great stories.  That   s right.  Plus, they always had the horses and cattle, but sometimes when he  couldn   t catch a horse, he   d ride a cow.  And my mother-in-law, not only did she teach, but she played the piano  beautifully. She would play the piano for the kids. She taught them to  dance because my father-in-law played the fiddle. So both of them  played music while those children tried to dance and they all have that  memory. I remember all my sisters-in-law talking about it, except for the  youngest one, of course, because I think she was only seven years old  when her mother passed away. She died pretty young.  She was about forty years younger than Dad.  Probably, yes.  Dad would be 89 now, and she   s mid-fifties.  So I   m assuming, at that point, there   s no running water in the house.  That   s right.  So how would they get water into the house?  Well, they got it up by the bucket-full, I guess.  I think they had a hand pump.  Did they?  Yes.  And do you remember stories of when the house got electricity?  Oh, yes. It   s says that   I don   t know if it   s in this one.  The well   s still there. The well still works. I need to get a new pump for  it, but it still supplies water when we need it. The farm is still   up until  a couple of years ago when we had the ice storms when it tore down  some of our fences, we had cattle and horses still running there until a  few years ago. Then, all the trees that fell due to the ice storms knocked  down, it seems like a couple miles worth of fences. So, we   ve been in  the process of kind of reclaiming our fence lines again and rebuilding  11  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  the fences, but it   s not complete yet. So we can   t run cattle and horses  again, quite yet, on all of it.  Here, they interviewed my husband. This is what this is. And it says,     Dick said the two-story house was probably one of the most modern of  its time. Back then, there was no such thing as electricity or running  water. The two-story contained a kitchen and a spacious living room,  downstairs, with a fireplace and a bedroom upstairs. The twenty-eight by  twenty-eight foot house held up to eight children at one time, not  including the parents.     So there   s one bedroom downstairs behind the living room. And then a  couple of years ago, as Dad   s health was   he   d always kept it up   but  as his health was failing, realizing that between termites and it just being  a hundred and ten or twelve years old, we went in and I had some people  come in and help shore it up. We put some new braces in there and roof  and some siding because we want to preserve it for the next couple of  generations.  Yes.  So, we did that a couple of years ago. With the ice storms and the snows  we   ve had the last couple of years, I   m guessing that it probably would  have collapsed if we hadn   t done that. So, we got lucky and the timing is  everything.  It says here,    The family was self-sufficient. They milked their own  dairy cattle, raised their own crops, and lived off their livestock and  game.    And it says about the mother,    The mother was a school teacher  while raising her large family, a huge garden, and doing household  chores.     Now, your husband   s father, was he always a farmer or did he have a  job outside of the house?  Well, the only job     He was the one that worked on the dam. So he was a carpenter.  Yes.  So he wasn   t solely a farmer.  No, he was not a farmer. This country is hard to make a living. Where  this is, it   s in rolling hills, there are lots of draws, beautiful bottoms,  pastures, but rugged, tree-covered lands and so it   s hard to get the  12  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  hundreds of acres you need under crops to really make a living. So they  were more going what they needed to sustain the family. Horses and  cattle were the primarily the lands they liked, evidentially. Dad told me  when they came over from the Trail of Tears, one of the reasons they  settled up here, this whole eastern part of Oklahoma where the  Cherokees settled, was because of the similarities to North Carolina and  Georgia, where they came from. So it is beautiful. As a matter of fact,  it   s just really the same lands that Grand Lake covers. It   s just down  south of the dam. This valley where the farm is continues and it comes  out right below where the dam is, so if the dam had been downstream a  little bit farther, this would have been covered with water also.  Were there other structures on the property, barns, or a smokehouse?  No, I think     Outhouse is about it. I mean, Dad added a barn in 1970     There was no barn before that?  You know, there was. What I recall as a kid in the    50s   now, I don   t  know before that, they had a couple of barns and chicken houses, had  some corrals and that   s where when I was a kid   I was born in    61. In  the    60s when I was a young kid, we used to get all of Granddad   s cattle  up and work them a couple of times a year. Some of my favorite  memories are when my cousins   my dad   s brothers    and sisters    kids     us all getting together and helping work Granddad   s cattle. After we got  through working the cattle, we got thrown on these calves and my dad  and his uncles and his brothers and stuff would laugh their butts off  watching us get our butts bucked off those little calves with an ear in one  hand and a tail in the other. But, we worked hay, we brush hogged. Dad  had a dozer down there trying to keep the creeks in line because that  country down there, if you don   t work it, it will grow back to wilderness  within a few years. And so we   ve had to try to keep up the best we can.  This is my husband during World War II in Italy. That   s where he went.  And these are also   it   s funny, they met. They didn   t know they were  there from their county, Leroy Brough   who was the other one, honey?  I don   t have the name.  John Lee. They   re all high school     They were all friends     They were all in the same high school. They all found each other in Italy  in 1944.  13  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  They were all from the same school and they ended up in Italy during  the war.  Well, how did the land finally pass down to your husband?  When my father-in-law died, there were eight children. They talked  about morseling it, but how do you morsel? Who is going to say,    Well,  I want this and that,    and someone might end up with something     By that time, my granddad had moved out of the home and the farm, so  this is in    74,    72. By that time, he had already moved to Jay, about ten  miles away.  So they decided to put it for sale at the courthouse, on the steps of the  courthouse, in Jay, and that   s what people bid on. Everybody could bid,  and my husband was one of the bidders and bid higher than anyone else.  That   s how he finally got the farm.  Very few people bid against him. They knew Dad was going to buy it.  Do you know how much he gave for it?  I don   t remember exactly. I   ve seen that number. That was for the  original sixty. Over the years though, up until that point, Dad had  acquired lands around it. So it was integral. He was going to buy it no  matter what.  And this way, all the family     We   ve had family reunions there. People have come and     Yes, and this still remains. Anyone who wanted to come, the family, can  come and visit.  He had a sister put a home on there for a couple of years when she was  older and didn   t have any other place.  I love this picture. This shows my husband and John Paul and all the  cattle and that   s the view from the house.  That   s a great picture. When you settled here tin Oklahoma, were you  living on the farm at all?  No, we never lived on the farm.  14  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  You were just visiting?  We came and we tried to find something in Jay to buy or rent. We didn   t  find anything. This was 1961. We didn   t find absolutely anything. So, I  was here one day to get my hair done and this one was in a little baby  carrier. I told them we were looking for a place. So the owner, Miss Teal  (she was one of the Teal girls, and the owner of the beauty shop) said,     Well, I have a house for rent, if you   d like it.    And it was on   what  street was that?  Seventh Street.  On Seventh Street, downtown. A brick house, very pretty, with three  bedrooms.  Well, they had come back to Oklahoma to start a construction company  and live here.  That   s where we lived for about three years before he finally bought the  land here. He bought the whole city block here and built this house. But  the farm had priority. We were there every weekend, every vacation. So  we would spend weekends there.  What would be your job when you would go to visit the farm? What were  your chores?  My chores were the inside of the house, just cleaning what was needed.  We had family reunions there and I remember buying a large table so we  would have room for all of us, and it   s still there. You will see it.  Did you have holiday celebrations there?  Yes.  Yes, Easter we   re there and all the family would go, all my nephews and  nieces and my sister-in-law. Of all the family, all the Dicks, there are  only two girls left and the two daughters-in-law, myself and Betty. And  by the way, Betty     Tarleton was one of my dad   s younger brothers. He worked at OSU, was  in the agricultural department forever and actually, his granddaughter,  Becca, Rebecca Rainsdall, has been in the master   s or Ph.D. program in  the agricultural program at OSU. They lived in Stillwater, they would  come here every weekend. They would come see us and help us work  our cattle at the old home place. They also had a place over in Drowning  Creek, five miles as the crow flies or ten miles as the road goes. We  15  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  would go over and help them work theirs.  They had the Drowning Creek running through their land and so the kids  would play in that creek. That was a lot funner creek to play in than the  creek that went through our land. But that was Granddad   s land, so we   d  always come over to Granddad   s and go hiking and hunting for birds  and squirrels and whatever else. The land is populated with some turkey  and maybe a few black bear, over the years a little bit, some cats,  obviously, tons of deer. This is just a beautiful place. It   s a really nice,  relaxing place to go to.  Well, what were your chores when you would visit the farm growing up?  Oh, boy  (Laughter) Well, I   d help Dad. We   d fix fence, we   d work  cattle, we   d fix fence   a lot of fence. It seemed like we always had  fences to fix. You know, breaking the ice, feeding the cows. Back then,  it was the old square bales time.  Branding them.  Yes, every fall we   d work them but during the summer time, that was  my job. After I was about twelve years old, he   d drop me off with a  pickup and a flatbed trailer and a couple of my buddies. We   d haul hay,  then we   d come back and play baseball. Those were our kinds of jobs.  We learned how to eat cheese and Vienna sausages for lunch, and it was  a great way to grow up. You   d hunt and fish and you   d do everything  else. You learned to ride horses, because that is rugged country and they  wouldn   t stay always in our fences. Mom was scared to death of us on  horses.  One time Dad and I were out chasing, I was probably six or eight, ten  years old, chasing some of the cows through the brush. You   ll see that.  And we were heading back from down at the bottom, away from the  corner where Mom couldn   t see us from the house. We jumped across a  little creek to get some cows, and I got hit by one of those hanging vines  and knocked off. The horse wants to go back where the food is. It  doesn   t have a rider, so the horse takes off. So Dad grabs me and throws  me behind him. We   re chasing after this horse trying to catch it before it  rounds the corner because if Mom had seen that horse without me on it,  we both would have had hell to pay. (Laughter) So we catch the horse  and drag it, he throws me back on the horse, and so we go back and get  the cow.  We finally told Mom about that five years ago. (Laughter) But it was  also a place that Dad employed a lot of people from Delaware County,  kids, either on the construction equipment, teaching them how to work  16  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  that and their concrete plant, construction company. But also, teaching  them how to work on tractors and drive tractors and do something. He  employed a lot of people in that part of the world. He taught them how  to do things with themselves.  He had Grove Ready Mix Concrete for at least forty years, maybe a little  longer.  From    62 until ten years ago.  He   s the one who put the landing   what do you call that?  It was the airstrip for the Grove Airport back in the early    70s.  Yes. Twice he got the bid. He was deep in construction.  My brother has a house just on the hill above the old home place. He  built that five, six, seven years ago. He works around the country doing  some different things, but he comes back there, and his wife lives there  all the time. It   s a beautiful place to come home to. It   s kind of tough  with the bad weather, but it   s a beautiful place to relax. It   s a beautiful  place to come back to, with beautiful views. It   s very quiet, very dark,  but Tommy loves it. He loves that place.  He has worked it almost as much as Dad has. Living in Oklahoma City  and different places, I haven   t had to work it as much in the last couple  of years. It   s really a labor of love, but it   s hard. Farms are hard work.  You can   t just let them build themselves, and that   s what Dad always  taught us. There were a lot of Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings I  would have rather done anything else than go down there and break ice  for the cattle. When you turn sixteen and can drive, Dad was on cruise  control at that point because he had somebody to go take care of the  things that were beneath him at that point. I don   t blame him. I did the  same thing with my kids when they turned sixteen.  It freed him up a little bit to do other things. I can remember all those  mornings. Mom would come down there in a separate car, and we   d get  back late at night, and Mom would have dinner ready for us. So she  supported us being out there for fourteen, sixteen hours a day on the  weekends. They had a full-time job at the concrete plant during the  week, so there wasn   t a lot of down time except when the Dallas  Cowboys played. That was about the only time my dad would ever     Do you remember, maybe you don   t remember, but at one time I  remember seeing goats. He had goats right after the     17  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  I never remember goats.  You don   t remember those? You were too young. But he kept goats, and  my husband said that was to keep the place clean. That   s what they do.  And I don   t know how long we kept them, but he had them there. I  remember. And they were right after the entrance, after the gate, on kind  of a little hill. I remember that.  There weren   t all that many fences down there.  Maybe Tommy Lee might remember that.  Tommy Lee will remember a few things that, obviously, we don   t. They  also had cattle drives. It was still in the mid-twenties, early-thirties. They  would take cattle, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty miles at times. It   s not like  now, but my dad was eight years old and on a cattle drive.  He gave each one of the boys a little  calf  to keep, and that money  should go towards their college fund.  So you were a member of 4-H or FFA?  No, I wasn   t. I kind of had a, kind of, built in 4-H because every year we  would have a hundred fifty, two hundred head of cattle. So we   d have  fifty or a hundred calves every year, which we would work and sell.  Invariably, every year or two, you   d have one heifer that died during  childbirth. That just happens. And so we would bring that calf and set up  a pen here at the house. That was my job, raising the calf. The last thing  I wanted to do after fixing fence all weekend was to go to school and  have to do more of that. (Laughter) So I had it built in. I loved the farm.  I loved doing that, but I had enough.  I remember that little calf.  We had about five or six of them.  We had a fence around right here, in front of the house, and he would go  and feed her with a bottle. (Laughs)  The calf had a bucket, and you   d feed it. So you   d do that. We had five  or six of them that we   d raised over the years, and they were pets. Dad  had that touch with horses also. You hear about the horse whisperer, and  he was that kind. He would train the horses by scratching them on the  back above the tail. He   d gentle the horses when they were fowls, when  they were babies. As they got older, we   d always have ten to fifteen,  twenty horses at one given time.  18  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Did you see all the saddles at the entrance?  But he would train them by scratching them there. When he   d bring  people to come see them he   d take them down to the farm and show off  the farm a little bit. All of a sudden, as soon as they   d hear Dad   s  pickup, they would come running. And they   d get about, just on a dead  run towards Dad, and you   d see these people   s eyes get big around. All  of a sudden the horses would get about ten yards away and turn around  and start backing up. So you   d have twenty horses with their butts  walking back towards Dad. Everybody   s used to getting kicked by  horses, and you hear all the stories, but Dad would just sit there and talk  and scratch them all until they all had their fill and walked away. But he  was like that with horses.  Coming back to what I did, I used to drive the pickup while he would  feed the bales of hay to the cattle. That was one of my jobs. He would sit  with the hay in the pickup and feed the cattle.  It was a good place for us. It was a good place to get away. It   s more  work when you live there and every morning you wake up there, but it  was a good place for us to drive thirty minutes to go to, and it was also a  place for the whole family.  It   s about an hour drive from here, isn   t it?  For you. It   s about thirty minutes for everybody else, Momma.  Oh, for me. (Laughter)  So is it just the two brothers?  Yes, my brother, he   s a couple of years older than I am. That   s just the  two of us. But again, it was for the whole family and everybody.  Well, Tommy Lee is older than that, honey.  Well, Tom   s not here to defend himself so I   m going to say a few years  older. (Laughter) I have some cousins in Tulsa that come down to hunt,  and it   s for the family. That   s the way Dad always looked at it. It wasn   t  his farm. It was the family   s farm. He pays the taxes on it. He pays the  upkeep for it, but he never turned down any family that wanted to come  shoot birds or go hunt or go camp out or do anything. It was always  there because it was the family   s farm, where his dad and his granddad  were born   or yes, his dad was born and his granddad had set up and  built the house. So it was truly a family deal and it continues with  19  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  Tommy and I, if we can afford the upkeep. (Laughs)  And the younger generation is very fond of the farm, also.  Yes, Tommy Lee has a couple of boys, and I   ve got a couple of kids.  Some of my cousins, since they sold their land on Drowning Creek, they  like still having a farm they can go to and feel welcome at.  Yes.  So, that   s good for the whole family. Hopefully we   ll have some more  family reunions down there. It doesn   t have a pool or things like that,  that are fun for the youngsters, but the older people in the family, they  still like going there and sitting underneath the tree and just feeling the  breeze as it comes up the valley. It   s really pretty.  Is there a story behind the name?  Thomas Jefferson Dick was, I think, my dad   s granddad. He   s the one  that, essentially, built the house, and so it was the Bar Tee Jay. I   m not  sure where the Bar came from. When I was a kid, I heard it was Bar Tee  Jay, and it was Thomas Jefferson after that.  I think it   s his year. Wouldn   t that be   ?  I believe that is.  Was Grove the closest town there for him to take things to market or to  go get groceries?  Well no, Jay. Well, actually Disney. Langley, Disney, where the dam  was. The dam was built in the late    20s and    30s, during the Depression.  So that is only about five miles away to the west of the farm. That was  probably the swingingest town back then because of the construction of  the dam. Jay was about another seven or eight miles east. They   re in the  middle of nowhere, essentially, there. Those were the closest two places  to go to the market.  Now, as they got older, Jay was the county seat, so that   s where  everything happened. Dad   s best friend growing up was Jeff Muskrat,  who was ultimately the superintendent of the Cherokee Reservation in  Cherokee, North Carolina. But Jeff   s dad was the sheriff in Jay, so when  my dad and all of them went to school in Jay, Oklahoma   when they   d  have ballgames, instead of having to go back after basketball games and  football games and things of that nature, they would stay in the jailhouse  there, at the courthouse. That   s where they   d spend the night and go  20  A. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Door  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  back the next day, back home. Stories like that, it   s hard to relate to now,  when we just jump in a car and go somewhere, but they were riding  horses and doing things just seventy, eighty years ago.  This was my mother-in-law. Isn   t she beautiful?  Gestures to  photograph   She is. Then if Jay was the county seat, were there county fairs there?  Yes, yes.  Now, did your mother-in-law pass down any traditions to you, any  favorite recipes?  Oh, yes. Oh, I have a book     Well, just tell them about it.  It must be there, but do you want me to find it?  No, no.  Okay. She gave me a recipe book. I was still overseas when she sent  that. I asked my husband,    Is she afraid I   m going to starve you to  death?    (Laughter) No, but I remember that it was wonderful. For  Thanksgiving, the recipe for my turkey is halfway my mother-in-law   s  and halfway my own mother   s. I have a very good, very good recipe.  Yes, I use her recipe a lot. My husband would also tell me how his  mother would make cornbread. His favorite dish was cornbread with  milk. (Laughs) That   s all he wanted. Yes, I use her recipes. She was  wonderful, absolutely wonderful.  Would she quilt at all?  I don   t know about that, I don   t know about that. But I wonder how she  would have the time with such a big family and working. (Laughter)  Right. Teaching school     Oh, and she   yes. When she was teaching that one classroom school  when, finally   I don   t know what year it was   they decided that the  teachers should have a degree. All she had was graduation from high  school, I think. So her parents sent her to Tahlequah, and the college in  those days was called something else. You don   t remember? She used to  mention this beautiful   it was a tree   what kind of a tree was it?  21  J. Dick  A. Dick  Finchum  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  I don   t know, Mom.  With the big white flowers right outside her window when she was in  school, over there. That   s where she got her degree to teach. Then one of  my nieces, her granddaughter, ended up also in Tahlequah. Several of  them ended up in Tahlequah, and she talked about that tree. That tree  was still there. So I love that story.  Was it a Magnolia?  Probably. That   s what it looks like. But anyway, she came back and she  had her degree, on top of everything else. I don   t know how she did it.  Would she do a lot of canning from the garden?  Yes.  Oh, yes  Oh, gosh  When we came back to stay here and she passed  away, we went in and we still had stuff that she had canned, a lot of  canning. Her daughters, most of them are very good cooks. Most of the  daughters, you can tell that they were trained properly. (Laughs)  Now, did you have an agricultural background before you moved to  Oklahoma? (Laughter)  Well, no. I   m a city girl. I   m not going to lie about that. (Laughter) My  sister, who is older than I am, married a farmer. I don   t know if you can  call that a farm, it was a plantation. But he also had cattle. The plantation  was castor oil beans. In those days   I   m talking about, I don   t know,  fifty, more than fifty or sixty years ago, castor oil beans were the  beginning of nylon. They made nylon with it, they made all those things.  So, it was big. We used to go with my parents. I was still single. We  would go and spend weekends over there, on that farm. That was my  first. And also, we had friends who were farmers. Their farm was mostly  oranges. They exported the oranges. Morocco and Spain were the first.  So, I remember those days also. But that   s about all. My father was a  pharmacist and that was it. (Laughter) But we enjoyed going, always  going. It was a privilege to be able to go and spend a weekend in the  farm.  You were mentioning that story earlier. I just noted that my granddad,  Jeff, had taken Cleo by buggy to the Tahlequah Women   s College. You  were talking about the magnolia trees.  Yes, that   s right. I remember that.  22  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Tahlequah Women   s College so she could get a  teaching certificate ,  and they would go by buggy. This would have been back in the early  1900s.  They had a wonderful family. Of course, they would go to church every  Sunday, and they would use the buggy and all that. But finally, my  father-in-law bought a car, and I don   t know what year that was. But my  husband said that he never had taken a driving lesson. I said,    Why did  you buy it then?       We took the car and drove it in the pasture until we  got the feel of it.    (Laughs)  That   s how we taught our kids how to drive, too. (Laughter) Just give  them a standard, an old truck, and say,    Go in the field,    and so you   d  hear them grinding away for two or three hours. That   s how my kids  learned how to drive. (Laughter)  When did the farm get its first tractor?  Oh, my.  Oh, my goodness. I   ve heard that story, and I don   t know. I really wish I  could remember. We   ve got four or five tractors down there now, a  couple of which actually work. They really didn   t have one until Dad  bought one.  Oh, yes, I remember the story telling where my husband was holding the  handle of   what? It wouldn   t be a tractor, would it?  No, it would be for a horse.  No, no, it was a machine. Even Betty remembers that, and he could  barely reach the handles of that     Plow?  Plow.  That   s it. So he was very young when he started working in the fields.  They all were. But I don   t know when he bought his tractor.  I don   t know. It   s rugged country, lots of rock. It   s beautiful, but it   s  rugged country up and down. The trees grow quick, and so we   ve gone  through a couple of brush hogs and several tractors. It can tear up a  crowbar.  Now, I have a sister-in-law who lives in Tulsa, Carol Sue. Now, she  23  Finchum  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  lived a few years in that   well, I think she got married when she was  very young   but she lived in that farm. Now, she   s in Tulsa. She could  give us more information.  Any conservation work like terracing or that type of thing?  They have, a little bit with the county and the state as far as when we  had some of the droughts in the past and some of the ponds. But as  you   ll see, it   s pretty rugged country, and it   s tough to dig. There hasn   t  been a lot done down there. I probably need to do more with the county  and the state on some of those things. My brother and I just kind of tried  to maintain what Dad left us.  Well, of what ponds there are, were they manmade?  Both. There were some that are just natural from the curvatures of some  of the creeks that have left ponds, and then Dad created three or four  ponds on the lands for the cattle and for the animals.  How about that other painting with the cow and the pond? That   s up in  the flats, isn   t it?  Probably so.  Was that part of the sixty acres?  No.  No, we bought that. I have another large painting of the pond and a cow,  several cows. If you want to, I can show it to you. It   s hanging in my  bedroom. My brother-in-law, who passed away, told me that he  remembered that cow exactly because she had kind of a white spot on  her face. So, I have that also. Those are the only two paintings I have of  the farm.  Well, any idea of how record-keeping was done through the years?  Dad kept pretty good records.  Yes, probably. We were able to find all this, but we could look some  more.  Oh, no, I mean was it done by hand? Did he just write it in ledger books  or   ?  He never really kept track of the money, but he always kept track of the  24  A. Dick  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  horses and the cattle.  Yes, that   s right.  He would know exactly which horse   he could look back at the record  and of course, he knew them backwards and forwards. He always made  sure of all the records with the American Quarter Horse Association or  with the Herefords   this, that and the other   and the Charolais that we  had, Angus. He always had those records, but as far as the money goes, I  don   t think he kept a whole lot of track of that. I don   t think he wanted  Mom to know what he was spending down there. (Laughter)  Did he have a brand?  Yes. Bar Tee Jay. We   ve got all that.  Oh, yes, and I have the seal. What you would use like on a letter. I have  that here somewhere. I have the authorization to use that brand by the  Agriculture Department, I suppose it is.  Have the neighbors changed through the years? Were there many  neighbors in the area?  Oh, yes, yes. We had quite a few.  Well, yes and no. There are a few homes. There   s a home every half  mile or so, or mile   probably about every half mile. There are a few that  have moved out and a few that have moved in over the years. For the  most part, I can remember since I was a kid, one new house being built  down there. It burned down. They rebuilt it. But, some of the same  families   the Buzzard family, the   I   ll think of the other families here  in a few minutes. But there are several families who still have lands that  were here for the last fifty years. So, there are not that many people  down there. It   s pretty quiet.  Was church an important part?  I think church was a very important part to my dad, to my dad   s mother.  She made sure that they all got dressed up and went. Because the Gray  Schoolhouse, I think, doubled as a church. So I think, in that part of the  world, it was at that time. It still is, but I mean, talking about when my  dad was growing up. I think Grandma made sure they all had a good  education, religious.  Did your grandmother ever talk about Christmas programs in the one-room  school or pie suppers?  25  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  Oh, yes. Pie suppers, I remember them talking about. I remember my  husband talking about that, yes.  It was a community. One thing that Mom mentioned earlier is that the  one thing that Dad would always talk about was that your family wasn   t  just your relatives. Your family was everybody, essentially, that you  knew within five or ten miles. You would help them out if they needed  help. If they needed help with their cattle, if they needed food, you   d  take them food. There were always kids staying the night over, from  other families. Everybody was helping each other out if somebody was  giving birth or if they had some problems with their cows.  My Granddad Jeff and my dad always said that was a big part of it. You  couldn   t just live alone as a hermit down there. You were part of one big  community, which may be not that many people, maybe a couple  hundred people, but that would be their universe, which would stretch  from Jay to Langley and down to Topsy and that whole Drowning Creek  area. That   s where they grew up. That   s before the lake was in there, so  they would know places where to cross the Grand River. The Grand  River is only a couple of miles away. That was before the dam was built.  So they would cross on over and go over into Vinita. There were certain  places where there was shallow water. They would cross the river with  cattle if they needed to, with horses, with wagons. So, it was a different  world. They were great stories to listen to.  Any visits from county agents or home demonstration agents?  That I don   t know. I don   t know. I   m sure they did.  Well, I know they went there to take a picture of the house. (Laughter)  They told me that. The County Assessor      There may have been a few game rangers stop by every once in a while,  I don   t know. (Laughter) Some of the neighbors, they really didn   t have  a season that they adhered to.  Any interactions with the state in terms of regulations?  Well, I don   t know if this has anything to do with it, but one of my  brothers-in-law, younger than my husband, was in Vietnam, in Saigon I  think, he was working. He was military and he was working at the  American Embassy when it was bombed. I don   t know how long he  stayed there, maybe a year. Then, his wife and babies were living at the  farm, two babies. The third one wasn   t born. They lived with my father-in-  law who was a widower already. So she lived at the farm with her  26  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  father-in-law and the children. That was the important one with the war.  But as far as the county agents and things of that nature, I don   t recall. I  know Dad called and talked to them every once in a while when we   d  have some issues. But, it was pretty much self sufficient down there.  Did they do their own veterinary work?  Yes. You learn how to use a come-along for a lot of thing as far as  pulling calves out of cows or out of horses or things of that nature,  because you   re down in the sticks and thirty or forty-five minutes to an  hour drive to a vet on a weekend night, you   re going to lose the animal.  So Dad was a pretty good vet in his own right, as most farmers are.  Did you pull any calves?  No, I didn   t. (Laughter) But, once it was out, I spread the newspaper on  the back of our station wagon, and we   d put the little calf there because  the mother died giving birth, and we brought it here. Mary Jane was  here. Mary Jane was a friend   s daughter from Europe. For a graduation  present, her mother sent her to spend two weeks with us, here at this  house. And of course, we were going to the farm as much as we could.  She was there when that little calf was born and the mother died. She  helped put the newspapers and bring it up. So we called the little calf  Mary Jane. I thought of that. And that   s the one who grew up here and  that he was feeding with a bottle.  We had several before her.  Now, she was born   you know where we have the picture of that cow,  we can go down and there is the water running and that kind of cress  growing like you use for salad.  I know exactly. Watercress.  Watercress. We used to go down there and have a picnic, and then I  would cut all the watercress I could, to use it here, as salad. I loved that.  Now, that was not part of the sixty acres.  No. You had that and you had the wild onions.  But it was all surrounding the sixty acres, which makes it now, just one  big ranch.  That   s a lot to keep up with now, over five hundred acres.  27  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Oh, yes.  J.P., do you have any lessons that your father passed down to you about  being a good steward of the land and taking care of the land?  Oh, sure. You learn growing up with it how important it is, and you  learn the sense of family. It   s not just yours, for one thing. Like Dad  always said, they   re not making more land so keep it in the family. I   ve  told my kids that I may not leave them any money when I pass away, but  they   ll have the farm, or at least my share of it. It   s very important to  take care of it and to learn from it. My kids, I   d bring them up here,  they   d play in the creeks, and they   d learn how to drive in the fields, and  they   d hike through and see all the deer and everything. It   s important  for them. Hard work and getting up at five in the morning and sloshing  through snow to go feed the cows, those are the kind of things that you  don   t grow up complaining about, you just go do it. I don   t remember  ever being really that cold or really that mad about it because Dad said  that was what had to be done. So you grew up with a work ethic.  When we told them about the interview, they were very, very excited.  They are both in college, and I called both of them, and they are very  excited. They said,    That   s cool     (Laughs)  But you learn to appreciate what it means to have a farm, and especially  the centennial farm and how it goes back generations. You can feel the  family, the ghosts of the family still. What   s nice about the old home  place is you can really get on the front porch, which they didn   t really  have the front porch   my brother added that. They had like a little stoop  out front and he added a front porch cover, which is really nice. But you  can sit out there and really feel the breeze, even on a hot day, and feel  the breeze that cools you off. You   re looking at what they looked at a  hundred years ago when they had built the house, which is a very cool  feeling.  I heard Patrick, his son, say when he was maybe twelve, thirteen years     I was there   he told my husband, he said,    Papa, this is where I want to  retire when I grow old.     Yes.  Were you there?  He doesn   t know how hard it is to work that land, but yes, that   s what he  wants to do. (Laughter) Kids need that. I   m glad I was able to share that  with my kids, and we didn   t live here so they didn   t get to enjoy the  early mornings and the ice breakings and stuff like that. They helped  28  Finchum  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  with the fences, they helped work the cattle. They helped do some things  over the years, and they got a taste of it. Not the full taste, but enough.  That   s a part of their heritage now and they want to continue it.  Would you spend the night out there with your grandparents when you  were younger?  Yes, I don   t remember a lot of that, quite frankly. I wish I had a better  memory of the past.  I was just curious about breakfast on the farm.  This family could eat breakfast. (Laughter) I don   t remember a morning  that I didn   t have ham and eggs and biscuits or bacon or something. That  was just unheard of if you didn   t have breakfast or you only had a piece  of toast or a donut. Mom got up every morning and made it, and when  we all had the whole family together when we had our reunions (or not  even really a reunion) we   d say,    We   re going to be down at the farm,     and people would show up with picnic baskets in the afternoon when we  were working cattle or we were brush hogging, they   d show up. We   d  throw the water, or the pops, in the creek to keep them cold. Everybody  ate.  It was kind of cool because there were a couple of big trees. Dad or  Granddad cleared a lot of the bottoms out so you could actually brush  hog and have hay and things like that. But they kept a few of the trees.  Dad didn   t like clear-cutting just big swaths of land. He   d always keep a  tree every once in a while, a big walnut tree or a big pecan tree or  something like that. So those were great places to go, and people would  set up underneath it. When we   d take a break from work, Mom would be  there or my Aunt Betty. My cousins would be out there working with us.  Those are a lot of my memories.  I remember him taking his two children, because they   re only fifteen  months apart, the boy and the girl, one on each arm and climbing up  the     Yes. There   s a ridge called Devil   s Humpback.  And that   s where all the     There are some rock formations, a little   I don   t want to say cave,  because it doesn   t really go back in very far   but it   s underneath and it   s  very cool.  And dogwood all over the place.  29  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  It   s a big rock, limestone overhang. We found some arrowheads. Every  time when my kids were young, in the wintertime we   d do it because in  the summertime there were too many snakes. In the wintertime, we   d  always climb up the hill, climb up that ridge. It was almost straight up  and we   d sit there for a couple of hours and we   d cook. We   d make a  fire up there, and the kids felt like they were camping out like the  Indians did. Then we   d see a lot of critters. So, the kids remember that  probably more than anything. I do, too.  Dad was probably my age when I was doing this with my kids thirty  years ago or twenty years ago, and I said,    Dad, do you want to go up  there with us?    He said,    No, I did that when I was a kid, and I swore to  myself back then, I   d never do that again.    It was straight up a hill so  you had to have young legs to be able to do that and be able to breathe  for a couple of hours. But that whole land   s pretty rugged. I wish it  wasn   t raining so much so I could really take you on a nice tour, four-wheel  drive-wise around. We have roads all the way through the lands  where you can get back in the back. I   m afraid the creeks are going to be  up, and we   d get bogged down, and I don   t want to have to have  somebody come get us with a tractor and pull us out. But we can go  some of the places today.  When your husband died, what happened to the ownership of the land?  Is he the owner?  Well, he was the owner of the farm. I was, too. So automatically, it   s  mine now. We had been married fifty-six years and every time we  bought something, whether it was, land, house, cars, it was always with  right to survivorship. If I died first, my husband would have had  everything. He died first so I have everything, but one thing I know for  sure, and I always told my husband, I will never sell that farm, never. It  will pass on to them, to the next generation, God willing. I   m not going  to sell that.  So in the next one hundred years, what do you see happening to the  land?  Well, I think it would be the third generation from me. I   m the last  generation, then his generation, then it will probably be his children, I  suppose, if they are able to keep it, and I   m sure they will. I   m pretty  sure they will. So it   ll go on that way because they will be able to afford  it. They are both in college doing very well. One is graduating next  month. The other one is still going further. He already has his master   s.  So they will be able to afford it. Well, actually they   ll be the two of  30  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  them.  Well, Tommy has a couple of boys that spend a lot of time there, and  they have the same love for it also. Between my two and Tommy   s two  and, quite frankly, some of the cousins, we   re going to do everything we  can. Hopefully down the road, we   ll be able to do some things to keep it  perpetual to pay the taxes and do the upkeep and have a little money set  aside. Right now, I   m making sure Mom   s taken care of before we do  too much to the farm.  At least the original sixty?  Yes, and you know what, really, you kind of get spoiled by having all  530 because they complement each other. You   ll see, this is the house  and bottom as it goes due south, but then you   re cutting off a couple of  great fields where we had alfalfa and things of that nature and hay, and  then you   re cutting off some of the Devil   s Humpback, and you   re  cutting off another parcel of land that has the spring that has never gone  dry. So, the sixty is very important because that   s the start, that was the  heritage, but it   s kind of like cutting off one arm. You don   t want to lose  that arm. You want to keep the whole body.  I wonder how many of these allotments have remained whole like that.  Do you know?  Well, your father   your husband   had some foresight to buy the land  around it.  Oh yes, he did, and was able to. We never had to borrow money to buy  anything.  An interesting story is that there was a forty-acre tract adjacent to the  original sixty, but inside of some of the other lands my dad bought had  also been adjacent. There was a forty-acre tract that was owned by a  full-blood family, McLaughlin, I think it was.  And I think I   ve found the title. Ever since I talked to you, that   s all I   ve  been doing.  They were smack dab   they had lived in the home, lived in an old  cabin, being kind. They had water. Their water well was about a hundred  feet away. They had coal. They didn   t have electricity. I remember this  when I was   this would be maybe thirty, forty years ago when I was  ten, twenty years old, these people were still living there. They had a  daughter who lived in Jay that would bring them supplies.  31  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Were they the one making the quilts that Linda kept buying?  I think so, probably. But Dad ended up buying the land from them,  probably thirty-five acres, but gave them life tenantship. He said,    This  is your land, you   re here. We bought the land. We   re going to hunt  around you, but           You can stay as long as you want to.           you can get in and out. We   ll maintain the roads for you. You stay  here as long as you want to. You live here until you die.    But, they sold  it to Dad on that basis. They lived another ten years or so in that house.  And then they disappeared.  Then one day, they weren   t there. It was kind of     We don   t know what happened.  So, the old home finally just crushed under snow, I think, one day. But  the old home place, it was tucked into a little old draw that you couldn   t  have found if you were looking for it, unless you knew exactly where to  look. So that was kind of an interesting little side note. They didn   t  speak any English. They were full-blood Cherokee and didn   t speak a  lick of English. The daughter was bilingual in English and Cherokee.  Dad spoke a little bit of Cherokee that he could kind of converse with  them a few things. But we   d see them down there. We   d see the smoke  coming out of the   coal   coming out of the chimney, or fire.  Now, were those the McLaughlins?  I think it was the McLaughlins.  Were both grandparents Cherokee, do you know?  Granddad Jeff, Dad   s dad, was three-quarters Cherokee and     My husband was one-sixteenth.  No, three-sixteenths.  Three? Okay, three-sixteenths.  Granddad was three-eighths. No, Dad was three-quarters and then I  think my grandmother was   I don   t think she was     32  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Actually, I think they gave the allotment to the great-grandmother. I  think she was a widow and she had a son and that   s the reason.  Thomas Jefferson.  What?  Yes, Thomas Jefferson.  Is that right? That   s right, okay.  That was the son who got the allotment from the mother because the  allotment was done back after the Trail of Tears. He   s the one that built  the house, and he died at an early age, when he was thirty-five, forty  years old. Then Granddad, Dad   s dad, was born there in 1892, and then  Dad was born there in    21.  So today is the farm just pure recreation or are you still running cattle?  One of these days, my brother and I will get the fences back up. We both  have full-time jobs. It is recreation and expensive     But you hope to do it this summer.  Yes, we   re going to try to. We   ve done some other things. We fixed the  house up a couple of years ago. That took most of the budget and then  we did some things on the equipment. We kind of fixed up some, sold  some. This year we   re going to try to do the fences and then hopefully,  next year, with the fences fixed, we can maybe get some cows back  down there.  You still have the tractor.  Yes, we still have a couple of tractors. We still have some equipment.  Yes, because when my husband passed away, he still had all of our  business, Grove Ready Mix Concrete. We had an auction sale for our  business and I told them, I said,    Before we sell, you guys see what you  need for the farm.    So, they made sure that they had     Yes, all we needed. A trailer for when you need to haul some stuff, you  need a trailer. We already had most of the tractors and stuff down there.  We need to build another barn down there to house some of the  equipment.  There is a big barn now.  33  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Well, there is. And we shored it up. There was a barn that Dad built back  in the late    60s, that was about to fall apart.  So you redid it?  Well, yes. We had some guys come in about three or four years ago and  fix that back up. There are some other things, it   s a continual process.  Plus, if you don   t keep things brush hogged, those trees will come back  and all of a sudden you   ll lose a whole field. So my brother did a lot of  work trying to keep it up the last couple of years while he was off and on  from working. Hopefully this summer we can get some guys down there  to help us do some more things, do some more fencing.  It   s challenging.  It is, but you have to do it. You don   t want it to go back to wilderness.  Dad and Granddad and everybody worked too hard over the years. And  we did also, to get it to where it is now. You hate to see it recede, but  you can only do so much time and money-wise. And it is expensive.  You fix a tractor and it is a few thousand dollars, and you get another  tire and it is a few hundred dollars, and you get another brush hog and  that   s another ten thousand. It just adds up, so you have to just work it  like business and budget your time and budget your expenses, but it   s  worth every penny. You   ve got to look at your bank account, but when  you   re down there and you   re sitting there, and you   re looking out over  the valley and you feel the breeze, it   s all worth it.  Good memories.  Oh, yes.  Well, do you have anything else you   d like to tell us before we end  today?  I think there will always be enough Dicks to keep that place going.  (Laughter)  Yes. Well, Mom   s been the shepherd of Dad making sure that he  always   he   d go down there without food, and she   d bring food down to  him. She   d always had food waiting when she didn   t go down there. So,  she always made sure that we all were taken care of. She   s always been  the shepherd for the whole family. Dad   s brothers and sisters and all  their families and stuff like that.  The family is big, a bunch of cousins and lots of boys. Now, my sister-  34  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Finchum  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  in-law, Betty, has three boys, doesn   t she?  And a daughter. They all went to OSU. All four of them went to OSU.  Their grandkids are going to OSU.  Carol Sue has four boys, I think.  No, three boys and a daughter.  His brother has three sons, and he has one son.  And all the kids spent time there. That was the cool thing. I had a bunch  of cousins within five or so years of my age. And so, that was the fun  part between Uncle Kenneth and Uncle Charlton   s farm on Drowning  Creek and our farm, all the cousins grew up hunting, fishing, and  chasing crawdads, working on the farms, messing with cattle, and riding  horses. My generation all had that, and we need to probably do a better  job of making sure that the next generations do that as well.  Keeping that connection?  Keeping that connection. It   s harder to do in today   s times, but we need  to make more of a focus to do it.  None of them tried to make a living out of it. There   s no way you can.  It   s hard.  It   s hard.  It would be nice if there was some oil underneath it. It   d make farming a  lot easier.  Ever any speculation?  No. I   m in the oil and gas business, actually, and Mother Nature gave us  a great topography and great surface. We have all the water in the world  underneath us and beautiful trees and draws and valleys, but she kind of  shorted us on the oil and gas, mineral side. (Laughter) So you get on one  hand and you don   t get on the other hand. Some of those other places out  in western Oklahoma that aren   t quite as pretty to my eye, as some of  our land, but their minerals are a lot prettier than our minerals.  Well, we appreciate your time today and thank you so much for joining  us and sharing the story of the Bar Tee Jay Ranch.  35  A. Dick  J. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  A. Dick  Nykolaiszyn  A. Dick  I wish we had more.  Yes, I wish this had happened a couple of years ago when Dad was still  alive. You would have had to bring more tapes. (Laughter)  Well, we could tell your passion for the land and his passion as well.  Yes, and the rest of the family is just as passionate as we are. I never  heard any of my relatives or nephews or cousins say,    We don   t like that  place.    They all love it.  Well, they were all very appreciative that Dad looked at it like he did.  That it was for the family, not for himself.  Yes, it could have been sold, you know? Everybody was bidding on this.  But in those days, they didn   t have any money. (Laughs)  Well, and everybody knew that Dad was going to buy it no matter what.  Well, what year was it?  It had to be    74.  It was not much money.  Granddad died in    72 or    73, so that was about a year after that.  My father-in-law was a typical Indian. He was calm. He was very     Stoic, quiet.  I never heard him say one bad word about anybody. He adored children.  Yes, with his cowboy hat on, on the horse, he was quite the   something  out of a movie, you know what I mean? He had the chiseled, Cherokee  Indian face with the hat on, straight up on a horse and looking over. I  remember that view of him and it   s very pretty.  I have a picture of him on a horse, and John Paul and the kids always  had their little horse. (Laughter) And I think,    My, gosh  They look like  Don Quixote and Sancho Panza     (Laughs) I have a picture of that.  Well, anything else?  I don   t think so.  36  J. Dick  A. Dick  J. Dick  Thank you for coming and doing this.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for having us.  -------  -------
