Speaker 1: I would like to start out by asking you about your mother.  What was her name and what did you know about her background, and her family, her growing up or do you remember any stories that she told you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Mollie Lee Parker.  She was born on January the 27th, 1700--1879.  She was born in a village out from Brownsville, Tennessee called Ged, Tennessee, G-E-D, Tennessee.  She was a member of a fairly sizable family.  I don't know just how many siblings she had.  She talked of a number of them, and I, I met a number of them.  She had a brother named William, she had a sister named Mariah and she had another sister named Lucy.  Her father was a farmer, a Baptist deacon.  Her mother was barely literate, but a housewife.  And, my mother was enormously creative, and she went to college when she was about seventeen at Roger Williams University in [Nashville] Tennessee, which doesn't, doesn't exist any longer.  And it was there that she met my father [Buck Colbert Franklin], and they became engaged and later married.  She was a teacher, schoolteacher by profession--elementary school teacher by profession.  She taught in Mississippi, in Shelby, Mississippi.  She taught in Tennessee, Brownsville, Tennessee.  She taught in Oklahoma at Ardmore--Springer and then Ardmore.  And they moved away from Ardmore in 1913 and went to a village called Rentiesville [Oklahoma]. And I was born there in 1915.
Story_ID: 17889
Speaker 1: What kind of person was your mother, and do you think you have any of her characteristics?
Speaker 2: My mother [Mollie Lee Parker] was a strong, had a strong personality, a strict disciplinarian, if I may say so.  And as I indicated, very creative.  She not only taught school, but she was milliner and she could make hair pomade, which she did at odd times.  She was a leader too.  She became a leader in every community in which she lived that I know anything about.  And by the time we moved to Tulsa [Oklahoma] in 1925, she didn't teach anymore, but she continued to be very, very active in the community in various types of civic organizations, not much in the way of political organizations, although she was active in terms of exercising her franchise and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 17890
Speaker 1: What about your father?  What was his name and what did you know about his background and his family?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Buck Colbert Franklin.  He was born also, in 1879, born May the 6th, 1879 in the Indian Territory, part of the Indian Territory, and southern part of what is now Oklahoma.  He was born in a village called Wildhorse, Oklahoma.  And he grew up there, later went to a school called the Dawes Academy, named for the member of [U.S.] Congress named [Henry] Dawes for whom, in turn, the Dawes Severalty Act of 1887 [also known as the General Allotment Act] was named. And my father performed so well at the school that this teacher, which was a Ms. Dawes, advised my father--my, my grandfather and grandmother that he should go away to college.  And so they pooled their resources and sent him away to college to Roger Williams University in Nashville, Tennessee where he met my mother [Mollie Lee Parker].  And he, he was very, very scholarly in his whole attitude and mean.  And he was interested in all forms of literature and writing.  He studied Latin and Greek and various--and philosophy and that sort of thing.  And he developed habits of work, even in college, that were to stand him in good stead later.  He loved to write.  He loved to read and the years that I was growing up, I never saw my father when he wasn't reading or writing.  And I thought that's what you were supposed to do.  So I developed the habit myself of reading and writing, day and night.  And that comes right from him.
Story_ID: 17891
Speaker 1: They [Buck Colbert Franklin and Mollie Lee Parker] made a remarkable team because in the areas where my mother was relatively uninterested or inactive, he was very active, and the way--the other way around was true, whereas with areas in which he didn't seem to have much interest or didn't seem to be pushing, were areas where she pushed.  She was a strict disciplinarian, for example.  He could not punish his children.  She was the one who told us that if we did our best, that's what she expected.  She expected no less than the best.  "The angels," she'd say, "can't do any better, but I expect you to do as well as the angels," which is perform at the very highest level that you can perform.  And so that became sort of a standard of mine.  So the reading and writing which I got from my father, and the, the high standards of performance, which I got from my mother, stood me in good stead through the years.

Speaker 1: They [Buck Colbert Franklin and Mollie Lee Parker] were born in the last quarter of the 19th century and lived well into the 20th century.  Particularly, your father who died in 1960.  They're sort cross-century people here.  Do you think you benefited from your parental experience of living in both centuries, seeing the changes?
Speaker 2: I would say, yes.  My mother didn't live to be, didn't live to a ripe old age.  She died in 1936 when she was in her late fifties.  My father, of course, as you indicated died in 1960, when he was eighty-one.  But they had, they had the perspective of time, both of them did.  And they, they were--they appreciated very much what it meant to live in a changing world.  And although the world was, would change perhaps much more rapidly and much more radically after my mother died, than it had in the years of her own life, lifetime, they were nevertheless changing, both for good and bad, all that time.  And they had perspective on the years, and they passed that on to me so that I--I can appreciate the changes that were made.  I can-I--for example, I could appreciate the fact that the automobile came into its own during my own lifetime.  The airplane too, came into its own during my own lifetime.  I can appreciate the fact that, the human relations were changing and race relations were changing.  It was sort of up and down, a seesaw, as it were.  I didn't, of course, I couldn't remember Plessy against Ferguson in 1896 [Plessy vs. Ferguson], but I knew what that meant in terms of reaffirming segregation and strengthening it, and to make it, making it a part of the very being in everyday life.  But I can also remember the changes of the early part of the century, especially the rioting, the race riots.  And I don't remember them personally.  I, I think I might be able to remember those in 1918.  I was only three years old, but I don't know whether I remember them or whether I remember the recounting of them day in and day out, year in and year out.  But I knew that these, these token, betokened enormous change in the relations of human beings with each other, across the racial lines and so forth.  And then, of course, I remember the [Tulsa, Oklahoma] race riot of 1921, which affected us very, very deeply and, and adversely in most cases.
Story_ID: 17893
Speaker 1: Your father had an issue with his name, Buck Colbert [Franklin].  And he was a father who respected and loved his own father, David Franklin.  But he had this thing with his name, and he wanted to be referred to as B.C.  Your older brother was also named Buck Colbert after your father, but he named you after a college president, John Hope--John Hope.  Now, what was going on with your father and his name?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's name, he was Buck Colbert, he was proud of that name, but he didn't think that white people who did not know him at all should call him by his first name.  So he, he used the initials B.C.--his letterheads when he was a lawyer and all of his, his legal transactions are B. C. Franklin.  And that didn't, that didn't stop white people from calling him by a name.  And so they named him Ben.  So they called him Ben Franklin, Benjamin Franklin.  And so he was known around town as Ben Franklin because the white people felt they had to call him by some first name, betokening a kind of insignificance or, or it was looking down and so forth.  And he named my brother B.C. for the same reason.  He was Buck Colbert Franklin, Jr., but my, my brother was also known as B.C., Jr.  So that's why he had a thing about those names.  And that was a result of the, of the race thing.  Now, by the time I came around, of course, he had already used up the name B.C., Jr., named for him.  And there wasn't any reason why my mother [Mollie Lee Parker] would want me to be named for any of her people.  And John Hope had taught both of them at Roger Williams University [Nashville, Tennessee], before he moved to Atlanta Baptist College, which later was called Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And they both loved him dearly.  And they were in his class, and they were, they were--he was their mentor.  And when my mother graduated and left to go back to West Tennessee, Dr. Hope had moved to, to Atlanta, to Atlanta Baptist College, Morehouse College, and my father saw no reason to stay in, in Nashville any longer.  And so he transferred from Roger Williams University to Morehouse College, from which he graduated in 1903.
Speaker 1: You named your son--.
Speaker 2: And, and they, they just loved Dr. Hope, and so they thought there was no better name for me than John Hope, and that's what I'm called.
Speaker 1: You named your son John Whittington, was that after you or John Hope or how did John Whittington--?
Speaker 2: John Whittington came about for the reason that, by the time he was born, some thirteen years after we were married, and we felt that, that probably was gonna all that we would have in the way of offspring.  And so we wanted to perpetuate both families.  So he's named for me, John.  He's named for my wife, her maiden name was Whittington.  So he's John Whittington Franklin.  And that preserved both her name and my name.
Story_ID: 17894
Speaker 1: Now your father [Buck Colbert Franklin] was an attorney working in the old Indian Territory that's now Oklahoma.  Did he have aspirations for you to become an attorney?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  If he did, he kept them to himself.  I thought that he might have aspirations and certainly I had aspirations.  I wanted to be a lawyer like I wanted to be nothing else.  And I went to college for the express reason, a purpose of getting through it as swift, quickly as possible, going to law school and coming back and practicing law with my father.  That's what I wanted to do all through high school.  That's what I thought of, until I got to college.
Story_ID: 17895
Speaker 1: Nashville, Tennessee and Fisk University are a long way from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  And you arrive there at Fisk in 1931 to begin your freshman year.  Can you take us through the steps that led you to enter in Fisk University?
Speaker 2: Yes, I moved from Rentiesville, Oklahoma to Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1925.  That's--we were supposed to move in 1921, but the [Tulsa Race] riot came just at the end of our school year when my mother [Mollie Lee Parker] and father [Buck Colbert Franklin]  were planning to move the family to Tulsa.  The riot came.  Everything he had accumulated there was destroyed overnight, everything but what he had on his back.  He had nothing left.  And so it was four more years in Rentiesville before we could move to Tulsa.  And so we moved to Tulsa in 1925 at which time I was ten years old, and, and in the seventh--in seventh grade.  I had been skipped two, two grades because of--well, they thought I could skip that then, those classes.  So I then entered seventh grade in Tulsa and went through high school there and graduated first in my class.  And I, I didn't--you see in my, in my home, there was not the question of whether I should go to college.  That was, that was an absurd question.  It was a given that all of the children would go to college.  My brother [Buck Colbert Franklin, Jr.] and my sister [Mozella] were already in college.  And my sister was graduating and my brother was also about to graduate.  And so there was no question but that we--my sister, my younger sister and I, should go to college.  Where, is another matter.  Roger Williams [University, Nashville, Tennessee] had, had closed.  Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], I think my father was not as attached to Morehouse as he might have been.  He was attached to Dr. Hope, but not so much to Morehouse College.  And my brother, who was attracted to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] before me, was--became a very big student on campus, and campus leader.  And all we read about when we were in high school was Fisk, Fisk University.  And so that--and, and I looked up to my brother.  I felt there was nothing better than my brother.  So I said, I want to do what he's doing.  He's going to Fisk, and so that's the way I happened to go to Fisk University.  And my younger sister [Ann Harriet], who was, we were so close together in, in age, just one year apart, and we were in the same class.  And so she went to Fisk too, the two of us went to Fisk as freshmen in 1931.  She stayed only a year.  She wanted to major in physical education, which they did not have.  And she transferred to Talladega College [Talladega, Alabama], which is where they did have a major in physical education.  I remained, I went to Fisk and remained there.
Story_ID: 17896
Speaker 1: Now how many children were in the family, and what order are you?
Speaker 2: I'm the fourth.  There were, there were four of us that lived.  My sister was the oldest, Mozella.  My brother, who's named for my, our father, Buck Colbert [Franklin], was the second.  My sister, Ann Harriet was the third, and I was the fourth.  There was a child stillborn after me, by the name of Harding Franklin, but he did not, he didn't survive his birth.  So I'm fourth in, in order.
Speaker 1: What memories do you have growing up with your sister and your brothers?
Speaker 2: Oh, very poignant and wonderful memories, particularly, my youngest sister, who I almost regard as my twin sister because we were so close in age.  My oldest, older sister, Mozella, thought that she was the surrogate mother to me.  She was nine years older than I was, and she took care of me as much as my mother [Molly Lee Parker] did, particularly when my mother was teaching in school, even when I was small.  And my sister took care of me until she went away to boarding school, then to college.  My brother, I, I wanted to emulate in every way possible.  And I thought he was--he was so personable and so likeable and so popular and so smart that I, I said, I want to be like my, my brother.  My sister, Ann Harriet, we called her Ann, was--as I said, almost like my twin.  And I didn't look up to her because I looked at her as my equal.  But we, we were, we did everything together.  We went to college together, we went to high school together, we played together as kids in Rentiesville [Oklahoma].  And we, we did our chores together when my mother was away teaching, and my father was in Tulsa [Oklahoma] practicing law.  We did our chores together, and, after school.  And we studied together and everything.  We cleaned the lamplights together, lamps together, and we brought in the wood together and so forth.  So we, we were very close in terms of age, age as well as grade and activity.
Story_ID: 17897
Speaker 1: Let me take you back to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tenneessee].  You go to Fisk at the onset of a great social and economic changes, the onset of the Great Depression.  And you're an undergraduate there.  There are great changes in Washington [D.C.] with the New Deal and [President] Franklin D. Roosevelt.  What was it like being a college student at Fisk University, and you, you met someone else there at Fisk University.  Was it, and did you think Fisk prepared you for graduate school too?
Speaker 2: It was like being in, in heaven in a way.  It was, it was a--the experiences were new and very different.  And I, I just, I just loved it.  I ate it up, I was just happy to be there.  We were very poor, as you've said, the Great Depression had overcome the country. And we didn't have any money.  I won a scholarship to Fisk, a tuition scholarship.  And I worked two and three jobs the entire time that I was at Fisk.  And I, I worked hard, and I studied hard because I knew that whatever I did, whether it was going into the practice or law or going into something else, I had to be extremely well-prepared.  And so I, I--I feel that I must--I felt that I must utilize my time as best as I possibly could.  Now, there were two people that I met at Fisk that were of enormous influence on my, on the rest of my life.  One was Theodore Courier, the white chairman of the department of history.  Ted Courier was a graduate of Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], University of Maine [Orono, Maine], where he was Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year at Harvard University , where he got a M.A.  He never got a Ph.D.  And I went into the class in contemporary civilization where he was lecturing.  And I heard him lecture once or twice, and I was so enthralled by what he had to say, so impressed by this man, only twelve years older than I was, that I, I--I said, I'd better take a course with him.  And that was the great turning point in my life so far as my academic pursuits were concerned because within a year, under his spell, I knew that I wanted to major in history.  And I knew nothing else mattered.  And I, I decided to major in history.  And I knew nothing else mattered.  And I, I decided to major in history.  And then he worked with me in a way that prepared me for graduate school.  I have the feeling that Ted Courier was projecting himself through me.  He had not got his Ph.D.  He had not finished his work.  He was not terribly disciplined, to be very frank.  And, but he thought I had it.  And he began to prep me for graduate school, from the time--from my sophomore year in college until I graduated.  And by the time I graduated, I knew I was ready to go to Harvard. The other person who was a great influence was my, my girlfriend, with whom I date--whom I dated the first month that I was in, right in, at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  And that was Aurelia Whittington Frank--Aurelia Whittington, from Goldsboro, North Carolina.  I took her on her first date, the homecoming game.  And I took her on her first evening date to the homecoming dance.  And I said, took her, I didn't take her to the dance because I had to work, but I met her at the dance.  And she was my date on October the 31st, 1931.  And from then on, we dated through college and through graduate school.  And nine years after we met, we married, and we were married for fifty-eight and a half years until she died on the 27th of January 1999.
Story_ID: 17898
Speaker 1: When you were at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], what were your thoughts going--and you said, you were well prepared to deal with Harvard, but that was a new experience.  Graduate school is a little more different than undergrad school.  What were your thoughts and--?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you that [Fisk University professor] Ted Courier instilled in me such confidence that I didn't regard Harvard as, as a difficult place.  Now, probably I should have, but I didn't.  Not only had he prepared me in terms of subject matter in the field of history, but he was a debating coach.  And he--and I was on the debating team.  And we debated not only black schools, like Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], but we debated predominantly white institutions, such as [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] and  New York University [New York, New York.]  When I debated the boys from Notre Dame and New York University, I saw them as just people. They were white to be sure, but they weren't, they weren't all that good.  They weren't any better than my debating team.  And so I began to develop the notion that, well, they might be white, but that doesn't mean they're better.  And when I got to Harvard, that was my attitude.  Now, for a twenty year old in graduate school, that probably was dangerous attitude to have.  I remember once in my first year, in the fall of my first year, one of the graduate students who was assisting a professor said that, "Are you registered in this seminar?"  I said yes.  He said, "Well, that's a very crucial seminar they tell me," he said this. He said, "They tell me if you make an A in that seminar, you won't have any more worries while you're in graduate school.  I said, "How many A's does he give?"  He said, "Well, I understand he gives only one."  I said, "Well I don't need but one."  That was the kind of cockiness that I think was very dangerous, but I, I had to have that feeling to give myself a sense of security, intellectual or otherwise in a, in a--in a place where I was a complete stranger.  And so I, that's the attitude I had when I went to Harvard.  I said, you know, it's just another place.  These are just more people, and I can take them on the way I've taken on other things.  By the way I did make an A in that seminar.  I don't know how many he gave, but I gave--I made an A.  And so, you know, it was, it was, it was self-fulfilling, and it was very, very self-assuring when I was able to move at that, at that level.  And I must say that, although I learned a lot at, at Harvard to be sure, I never did, I never did have the fear that Harvard, being the oldest and theoretically, the greatest university in the country, was, was beyond me.  I never did think it was beyond me.  I thought it was within my reach.  And I always had that attitude, and it turned out to be within my reach because the first year I was there, I took an M.A. degree, the very first year.  And I was working three jobs and got an M.A. degree and won fellowships.  I got no fellowship when I was entering Harvard, but by the time I was there one year, I had fellowships from Harvard and from [the Julius] Rosenwald Fund, and I was forbidden to work there.  I didn't need to work.  I had plenty of money.  And though I went of, at residence for a year to work to pay back the debt that Mr. Courier had gone into send me to Harvard in the first place, I went back to Harvard in 1937 and completed my work.
Story_ID: 17899
Speaker 1: Were there other, other black students there at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when you were there or had proceed you?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were, there were a few, a few, precious few.  I had no class with any African American student when I was in Harvard.  There was no in the graduate school in history when I was there.  There were some that were--had been there--.
Speaker 1: Okay, finish, finish.
Speaker 2: There were some that had been there, and they were there, some were there already, but they finished their work.  They were, they were way up where I didn't have much contact with them.  And no one entering the graduate program in history the year I entered.  And there was no one in any, in any classes, no African American in any classes, where I was a student.
Speaker 1: You crossed paths with Robert Clifton Weaver [first black named to U.S. Cabinet post] at one time or did you meet him--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I--only because I roomed in the same room that he roomed in, and I got to know him.  He was back up there.  He was, by this time out and was with the--he'd been with the New Deal by this time.  You see, we're talking about 1936, 7, [1937], 8 [1938].  And Bob Weaver just came by to visit.  He came by to visit, and to ask us what we were doing there, and how, how long we'd been there, and how long we planned to stay.  I said, I don't know how long I plan to stay.  He said, well--said, "Why don't you get your dissertation that you can do in nine, nine months, and tell them you have only nine months worth of money left, and, and then you'll get, they'll approve your dissertation, and you'll get out."  He was that kind of person.  He was just, a lots of fun, but he, I didn't--he was, he was already out.  There were a number of people like that who came by.

Speaker 1: I'd like to state that we are at the National Archives and Records Administration in College Park, Maryland.  There is an archives, one in Washington, D.C.  The videographer is Matthew Hickey.  My name is Walter B. Hill, Jr.  I am doing the interview and we have an observer, Amy Billingsley, of the HistoryMakers.
Story_ID: 17901
Speaker 1: Let me take you back to the [19]30s again because this is a period of extreme--in terms of American history, a lot of politic is entering American, the American political arena.  And radicalism is pretty much developing here.  Did these radical ideas influence you as a graduate student at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, let's go back to earlier '30s when I was an undergraduate at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee.]  There was a, there was a current of radicalism moving through my undergraduate school, Fisk. There were chaps there who were radicals.  There were chaps there who I think were members of the Communist Party.  But only once they tried to enlist me into their various organizations.  And I, I had no interest in them, and they--and once I became president of the student council at Fisk, they thought they really could use me there to further their own agenda.  And I rebuffed them once more.  I had no, I had no quarrel with being radical.  I hoped that I would be radical in a sense of trying to do something to change America, the United States.  But I, I didn't--I didn't think that they had the right approach, and I wasn't interested in going down that, that road.  When I got to Harvard University in 1935, there was, some radicals were there, not a great deal, however, at least I didn't find it to be so.  There was some liberal thinking there.  But the, the--Harvard was such a conservative institution that--and so, so profoundly independent that it was inconceivable that they could go beyond the point where they would be more than mildly critical of anything in American life.  So when I went, for example, to get a job, I thought I could get a job through the National Youth Administration, which poured money into various colleges and universities in the United States.  So I went to the employment office there, and I said, I'd like to have a job, the NYA, an NYA job.  They said, "NYA?"  He said, "That's federal money."  He said, "Harvard University wouldn't dare touch any federal funds.  We, we are independent, and if you are in need at any time while you're here, and if your grades are all right, you can, you go to the aid, financial aid office, and you can get a loan there or maybe we we'll supplement you for your fellowship."  He said, "But, no, not, not the government."  Well, that was the way things were there.  And I would say that in my courses there, I never, I never heard a, what you might call a radical word spoken.  I took a course in world history, world economic history.  It was just mild, you know, in terms of ideology.  The same was true in British history, American history and intellectual history, American social history, American diplomatic history, and all this history I took there was sort of orthodox and uninspired when it came to radicalism.
Story_ID: 17902
Speaker 1: You did enter Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and you were there when it really, the world was getting ready to change to--the rise of Adolph Hitler in Europe, the invasion of Ethiopia and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Did you have a since that you were living in historical times and how were you observing these things as an American?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember so well that by 1939, I was about to complete my--I had completed my resident work, and I was, worked on my dissertation.  And I remember was spending the summer of 1939 in, well, part of it in Washington [D.C.], and I could see and feel the onset of the [World] War [II].  And I knew some young men in European history that were very much upset because they couldn't go to do their research in France, in Germany and places like that because the upheaval was upon us.  And then I recognized the fact that things were changing when I, at the end of 1939 and in the summer of 1939, when war did break out in, in Europe, and I was in New York part of the summer and in Washington part of the summer.  And I went, came back to Raleigh, North Carolina where I had attained a job teaching at St. Augustine's College all of this was now, was--everything was in the air.  Everything was sort of on the brink or on the verge, as it were.  And, of course, it was in 1940 that we began to enlist, register for the draft.  And in 1941, [the bombing of] Pearl Harbor [Hawaii] came.  The draft was stepped up, and we all felt that the war was upon us.  I should add that in the spring of 1940, and when I got my Ph.D. at Harvard [University, Cambridge Massachusetts], the commencement was--looking back on it, I can say it was, it was a war rally.  The people that honorary degrees were, for the most part, members of the National Academy of Science or the, or the National Selective Service or the [U.S.] Army or something like that.  So, and the citations were very clearly, citations praising these people for their efforts to put the United States on the war footing.  And then at the end of that ceremony, how could I tell you, they had a special ceremony, a special Oxford ceremony, where the vice chancellor of Oxford University [Oxford, England], Lord [Edward Wood] Halifax took charge of the program--my, my commencement program, took charge of it and turned it into an Oxford commencement, an Oxford convocation which they were giving [President] Franklin [D.] Roosevelt an honorary degree because of his "standing by Britain", you see.  Britain's already in the war, and this standing by--although President Roosevelt was not there, his chief of staff was there to receive the degree for him.  And by that time, it was just a--the commencement was just a big war rally.  And when I came back to Nashville [Tennessee], I mean, I'm sorry, I came back to Raleigh, North Carolina in the fall of 1941, feeling that we were, we were really gonna get it any time.  So Pearl Harbor was no surprise to me.  And then there was this very strong upsurge in draft, drafting of men.  And I began to get nervous.  I had a low draft number, and at that time, they were crying out for people to come to volunteer for the [U.S.] Navy, which was, had been almost decimated at Pearl Harbor.  And so I rushed down and volunteered for the Navy to help them with their problems of trying to man offices, run offices and trying to carry on all the paperwork that was related to the, to the war.  And I volunteered with the Navy recruiting, at the Navy recruiting station in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And I ripped off, ripped out my qualifications that I could type and I could take shorthand, and I could run the office and that I was a Ph.D. from Harvard University and the lieutenant looked at me, square in the face and said, "You have everything but color."  And I said, "I'm sorry, I thought there was an emergency.  And forgive me for taking up your time."  And I left.  And that was a, that was the second day of infamy so far as I was concerned, the first day being the bombing of Pearl Harbor which President Roosevelt a day of infamy.  But I thought that the disgraceful performance, a representative of the United States government in 1942 when I volunteered to tell me, an American citizen with those qualifications that I, I also had to have the qualification of color.  It sounded more like Hitler than the United States.  And I decided then that the government, the Army didn't--the armed services, not only did not deserve me, but they were not gonna get me.

Speaker 1: Teaching class and writing a dissertation, that was quite difficult.  How was that life for you and how did you manage it, and did Aurelia Whittington [future wife] fit into your plans?
Speaker 2: Well, I started my dissertation in the spring of 1939.  And I was doing research so I came to North Carolina.  And she was already out of graduate school, graduate library and back working as a librarian at a high school from which she graduated in Goldsboro [North Carolina].  And we decided to get married in the summer of 1940.  And so she became almost immediately, not only my wife, but also a colleague in helping with my work.  So we went--we spent our honeymoon in the Library of Congress and at the National Archives and the Bureau of the Census [Washington, D.C.].  And from there, we--after collecting our material, we went on up through Cambridge [Massachusetts], where I began to write my dissertation.  And we came back to Raleigh [North Carolina] to--and she got a job as a librarian in a high school there in Raleigh.  So she was working, and I was working at St. Augustine's College [Raleigh, North Carolina].  And I was writing my dissertation, and she was studying her business or her work.  And we were working together very smoothly.  And so, in a short period of time, I had finished my dissertation.  And I went up for my finals in the spring of 1941.  And I passed them, and then I was--we went up together in the summer of 1941, in June, and I received my degree.  And she was right there with me.

Speaker 1: As a student of history though, where were you intellectually with what's going on in the country and the [World] War [II], the government, and being a student of history, where were you intellectually?  How were your ideas being shaped at that point in time?
Speaker 2: Well, we must remember that my ideas as a historian were shaped first by [Fisk University professor] Theodore Courier.  When I got Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I wanted to go into British history, but I learned there that you had to be able to go into the sources, the original sources.  And how would I ever get to England, you know?  And that was, that was an impossible dream, and I was a practical person, I gave it up.  When I gave up, I began to think about American history.  And by that time, I had been exposed to American intellectual history, American diplomatic history, American social history, and American western history.  And we called it 'wagon wheels' at Harvard.  And I began to shop around in that area to see what I could do in the way of getting some subject matter together.  And I decided to write in American history, American social history and I wrote on free Negroes in antebellum North Carolina.  This was with the counsel and help and guidance of my mentor, Professor [Arthur M.] Schlesinger [Sr.] and my--.
Speaker 1: Is this Arthur Schlesinger?
Speaker 2: Arthur Schlesinger, Sr.
Speaker 1: Senior, oh.
Speaker 2: And my advisor, Paul Henry Buck--Paul Buck who was a younger man, and who in Southern history.  And he guided me through my dissertation.  Now, I, I didn't belong to any school of history.  I worked across the board, social history, intellectual history, some economic history, some political history.  I had no, I had no ideology that I was pressing.  I was not a, I was not a--I was not an ideologue that came to economic interpretation of history or the social interpretation of history or with anything like that.  I was, I used whatever I needed in the way that I needed to us it in order to, in order to interpret and to delineate what I thought was important in, in American history.  And so I belonged to no school, and no--I had no agenda in that sense.
Speaker 1: And you felt comfortable with that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did feel comfortable with it.  And I, and if I may say so, I felt almost smug because I wasn't--I didn't have to be loyal to any set of ideas or any set of principles.  I'd just shop around.  If this economic interpretation seemed all right for the, for what I-- when I looked at a certain problem in history, I'd use it.  If I felt that some other interpretation was better, I used it.  And therefore, I, I--and I was not beholden to any of them.

Speaker 1: You began to develop your teaching skills at Fisk [University] in Nashville [Tennessee], [North Carolina] A&T College in Greensboro, North Carolina, St. Augustine's College in Raleigh, North Carolina and North Carolina College for Negroes [now North Carolina Central College] in Durham [North Carolina].  When Howard University [Washington, D.C.] called you in 1947 to become a full professor in their history department, how did that happen and what was it like at Howard in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, let me say first of all that, that I had been teaching in all these places that you mentioned for a certain number of years, but I wasn't certain that--you, you have to understand that in 1947, Howard University was the only place that I could look forward to, to teaching.  And it was in sort of the top of the, top of the line.  It was the, it was the end.  Now, I was only thirty-two years old, and I didn't, I wasn't certain I even wanted to go to my final job.  And that's how we had to, had to look at it.  You had to look at it that way in 1947.  There was no job after that.  Now, did I want to go there and spend the rest of my life or did I want to move around to some of the other places?  Well, had written 'From Slavery to Freedom' by that time, and, and Rayford Logan had urged me to come, and then were some other people that urged me to come.  And I thought that I'd better not pass it up, although I wasn't certain that I was ready to go to Howard.  And so I accepted the invitation in 1947 and went to Howard University.
Story_ID: 17906
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned in '47 [1947] that was the year that 'From Slavery to Freedom: a History of the American Negro,' was published. Why did you write that book, how do you think the book stood up to other historical, broad writings regarding African Americans?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote it to, because I was invite--I invited to write it.  I had no plan.  I planned perhaps some time in my life to write a history of African Americans, but I, I certainly hadn't planned it in write it in 1946 or 7 [1947].  But a, the editor of (unclear) called me, wrote me, and he had called me, to ask me if I ever had an idea of writing such a history.  I told him, "Well, yeah, maybe some time in the future, but not now".  I was working on a book that was to be called 'The Militant South' and I didn't want to be bothered with any of these distractions.  But he persisted.  He said, you know, 'The Militant South' is a very good subject.  He, himself, was a historian, trained as a historian of the South, Ph.D. from Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey].  He said, "That's a good subject," he said, "but it could, it could be at any time."  He said, "But the history of Negro Americans is urgent, and it's urgently needed because this is right after the War [World War II].  And there's blacks who are coming home, and blacks are doing this and that. They need a history."  And he continued to twist my arm and twist my arm until he finally almost broke it and, and persuaded me that I could drop 'The Militant South' for the time being and finish--and, and write 'From Slavery to Freedom,' which I agreed to do in the fall of 1946.

Speaker 1: During this stretch of time, how did you view yourself because some had put you in the Carter G. Woodson [historian] tradition and some have you defined, have defined you as broadening and going beyond his parameters, delving into American history.  Did you define yourself as a Negro historian or simply as a, an American historian?
Speaker 2: Well, I define myself as a, as a historian of the United States.  And there was, there were certain subdivisions or sub-areas or fields to which I was more attached than to others.  I was not attached to western history, although I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I was not attached to American intellectual history, although I had a great time there.  But I was attached to the history of the South, and I was attached to the history of African Americans, not that I had worked extensively in the field, but because I, I identified with it personally and because I had some respect for the people who worked in the field.  I had enormous respect for Dr. Woodson.  And I regarded him as a friend from the time I met him in 1936 until the time of his death in 1950 when I was a pallbearer at his funeral.  And I, I looked at these works--Dr. Woodson's, 'The Negro In Our History' was the only work that was even deserved to be considered as a solid piece of work at that time.  And I, I saw that it was a, it was not the kind of history that I would be interested in writing.  And despite the fact that I admired him and what he was doing a great deal, I thought I could--with my, with the kind of the training I had by this time, the kind of experience I had in research and writing, that I could present a much fuller picture, a much more delineated picture of African Americans than he ever did.  And I therefore, sought to do it, and, in 'From Slavery to Freedom,' which I was working on at that time.  And there were other historians of the Negro experience, but I would say that they were, for one reason or another, not, not to be emulated, certainly not to be regarded as competitive.  The old book George Washington Williams, 'The History of the Negro Race in America', and published in 1882, and was, had not been revised since that time.  Merle [R.] Eppse's book, 'The Negro Too In American History' [1935] is--was, was I thought, just what it was.  It's just an interesting and, but not challenging, not stimulating piece of work.  And there were others, brief and long, but the only the Woodson book was worthy of attention.  And, and it was not the kind of book that I was interested in writing.  It's not the book--kind of book that I wrote.
Story_ID: 17908
Speaker 1: 'From Slavery to Freedom,' it's now in its eighth edition, and it's translated into six languages.  Did you ever think it would emerge as a dominant textbook on black history and why did you take on and assistant in the later editions and what were your thoughts relative to this evolving story in the editions because each edition came out, and you were adding chapters.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, let me say hastily, that I had no dream that 'From Slavery to Freedom' would survive more than one edition.  And I had no dream that it would become used widely in the United States and abroad.  I simply was writing for 1947 and whatever came out of that would be all right.  I think it's well to remember that 'From Slavery to Freedom' was not enthusiastically received by the historical community or by the lay community.  It simply was not.  As the review in the 'New York Times' [newspaper] left much to be desired, and other views.  There were other views that were very favorable.  'Saturday Review of Literature', 'New York Herald Tribune Review' and others.  But some others were not very favorable.  But I, I complained a lot to my publisher.  And I think that's what every author is inclined to do.  If the author isn't doing enough--if the publisher isn't doing enough to push your work, you know, to promote it and so forth, and they said, "Well, it's doing fairly well.  And we're gonna keep it in print," and so forth.  And they did keep it in print, and it, it did do fairly well.  I did revise it again in 1956.  And I was about to consider revising it in 1967 when the publisher and I had a very serious disagreement.  I said that it should be in paperback.  And they had promised earlier that they would publish it in paperback, but after I wrote the third edition.  But by that time, we had a--what, what the [Alfred A.] Knopf [publishing company] people describe as a corner on the market.  And they said, as a hard cover book, it would make more money if we just leave it in a hardcover where we charge what we please and it won't have any competition.  But I thought that that was a very unwise thing to do, and that it was impolitic on their part.  And I, I wrote them a letter in no uncertain terms saying that I would never revise the book again if they weren't, if they weren't interested in putting it in paper.  And I warned them, I said, "Some day in the not too distant future, if you don't put this paper, some writer is gonna come along and write a kind of potboiler, unscholarly work, but an angry work that will sweep the country and we'll lose what we have gained."  And so they seemed to take that serious, and they said, come to think of it, we will publish it in paperback.  So I did revise it in 1967 it was brought out in paperback that year.  Now what is very interesting, what they didn't understand, they, they saw that the book was, the book was increasing in sales, but they didn't understand what was going on; that this big Civil Rights Movement, which spawned all kinds of arguments and thoughts about the, the past as well as the future of black Americans, that was stimulating the interest in the reading and study of African American history.  And so when they would publish or print an edition of the 'From Slavery to Freedom,' it would just be sucked off the market, and just disappear just like that.  And so they began to say, "Well, maybe you've got something there," and they published it in paper, put five or ten thousand copies and they'd just disappear.  They would just vanish.  They put five or ten thousand more, and they would vanish.  And then they began to feel that deep down, they had something there.  And they, they began to realize that there were study groups, not merely in the colleges but study groups in, in community colleges, study groups in, in junior colleges, study groups in high school, study groups in night school, and in informal circles and so forth.  And they were using 'From Slavery to Freedom,' and I--we couldn't--they couldn't keep it in print.  I was getting letters all during the '67, 8 [1968] and 9 [1969], people saying, "What's happened to your book?  We can't find it."  Well, they were having trouble keeping it in print, and especially when they were not willing to put, publish a massive amount of the, of the book, you see, and put five thousand copies in there.  Well, that wasn't anything for that, that period of interest in the subject.  And, but they gradually learned that this book had something that they even were surprised to realize.
Speaker 1: Your assistant that you took on--.
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I won't call him an assistant.  I'll just call him a co-editor.  He's a co-author, co-author, that's what I call him.  Alfred Moss came during the sixth edition.  I found that my back was breaking with trying to bring up the two editions, bring up the editions, up to speed, and revise them orderly, in an orderly fashion.  I was doing other things.  I was very, very busy in the '60s [1960s].  I was becoming a leader in my profession.  I was president of the Southern Historical Association.  And then in the next decade I became president of the other association.  And I, I didn't have the time to revise all on my, all my--all by myself.  So I cast around to see who could help me.  And one of my own Ph.D.'s, Alfred Moss, Jr., who was trained under me as well as in other places, I invited him to become my co-author.  And he graciously accepted.  And the sixth, seventh and eighth editions, he was my co-author.  And we worked well, very well together.  And, and I shall be ever grateful to him for what he did.  And now he's dropped out of the picture and we have another co-author, but he was wonderful for that three years, three editions.
Story_ID: 17909
Speaker 1: Were there other works of your works that you felt very good about?  I know 'From Slavery to Freedom' is the shining star, but there had to be others.
Speaker 2: Well, 'From Slavery to Freedom', I guess is my best-known work.  But it isn't my favorite work, and it, it's been, it's been a wonderful experience because it's, it's very gratifying to know that people in Brazil are studying 'From Slavery to Freedom' or in China or India or France or Germany or Japan.  It's very interesting, very gratifying and rewarding, but, of course, my favorite of all my books is 'George Washington Williams: A Biography,' which I started about 1940 or '41 [1941].  I published a piece on him in the 'Journal of Negro History' I think in 1941.  And I brought the, I brought the body of it to a conclusion and published it in 1985.  So it's more than forty years I worked on that.  So it's my child, and my baby.  And I, I reconstructed a person.  He was, he was a--he was nobody in terms of being able to visualize or to associate with or to commune with, as I have.  And I brought him to life.  I pieced his story together from nothing to a full-grown man, and he lived for, not long, forty-one years. But I, I'm very pleased with what I did there.  And I chased him all over the world, wherever he went, I went.  He went to England, I went to England.  He went to Belgium, I went Belgium.  He went to Canada, I went to Canada.  He went to the Congo, I went to the Congo.  And he went to Egypt, I went to Egypt.  I picked up things about him all along the line, in all these places, you see, trying to imagine, piecing, piecing a life together.  That, with what I found in the archives, National Archives [Washington, D.C.] and what I found in, in the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and places like that, helped me to round out his, his life and to, and to present him, I think, as a full blown man in, in 1985.
Speaker 1: Now, I--,
Speaker 2: So it's very satisfying, very satisfying.
Speaker 1: --I'm enamored over 'From Slavery to Freedom,' and I have used in my own writing, I have used your work on George Washington Williams because when I read the book, I was extremely impressed.  And I knew that you had reconstructed this man's life.  And I was very impressed.  I'm sorry to say, but my favorite piece, because I'm sort of the spokesman for the archives when we're dealing with the Emancipation Proclamation, I re-read Eman--your '[The] Emancipation Proclamation' book at least five times, and it was published in 1963.  And I have said it in my writings and in certain speeches, there's not a finer piece on the Emancipation Proclamation than John Hope Franklin's.
Speaker 2: Well, there are two pieces, two books coming out this next year on the Emancipation Proclamation, but I'm afraid they might push me on off of, off of--out of the window or off the main line but we'll wait and see.  But I, I do appreciate your expressions about 'The Emancipation Proclamation,' which I wrote as my commemorative celebration of the--I knew that I was gonna be out of the country during 1963.  I was in England at Cambridge University [Cambridge, England].  And I was--I just wanted to leave that as my expression of appreciation for the centennial of the Emancipation Proclamation.
Speaker 1: But what is significant here, Dr. Franklin, in 1963, that book has stood for forty years as the premier book on the Emancipation Proclamation.  And for some strange reason, in the last few years, the country and the historical profession has gotten excited over the, over that document, which you knew in 1963 was a critical, probably one of the most outstanding historical documents in American history.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It certainly is.  But now, for some strange reason, people are getting interested in it.  There's a new study out, it's coming out, by John, by Grosell (ph.) and another job being, all edited by friends of mine in Providence, Rhode Island.  Frank Williams, who is the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, I'm writing the preface for that one.  I don't regard (unclear) these books as a competitor, particularly.
Story_ID: 17910
Speaker 1: Jackie Robinson [baseball player] in 1947 comes into the major leagues.  Now, that had to have some impression on you.  I think you saw a bigger picture than Jackie Robinson and baseball, did you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Jackie Robinson's rise to the position that he did hold in 1947 as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers [New York, New York] baseball team was very crucial, critical, not merely in his life, but in the life of African Americans.  Well, that, that constituted a kind of breakthrough that would reflect itself in all kinds of activities for the next decade after that.  I think it was no accident that, that what happened in the next, in the next ten years, flowed from, from that event, not that it necessarily portended these events; not necessarily that it influenced them directly, but it created a climate in which some of these other things could take place.  So that when I became chairman of the history department at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York], Brooklyn, Brooklyn Dodgers, Brooklyn College, in 1956, I was, I was treading in the footsteps of Jackie Robinson, you see, and other things that were happening at that time.  That's no accident that, that Brooklyn itself felt that it was doing something.  And even New York City [New York, New York] itself felt that it was doing something.  How else was my picture on the front page of the 'New York Times' at the time of the announcement of my becoming chair of the department of history at Brooklyn College.  It was a spectacular kind of appointment.  It, it would make no news now to be sure.  I'm delighted it wouldn't. And I was amazed that it made the kind of news that it made in 1947--(correcting) 1956.  But then I could put all this in perspective and see what was happening from Jackie right down to 1956 and on beyond.
Speaker 1: So those were your thoughts going into taking over the chair of the department, history department at Brooklyn College.
Speaker 2: I'm not persuaded, I'm not sure that I thought of Jackie Robinson that morning in February when I was elected chairman, but, but as I get perspective on it and I get some vantage point in which to look at these events, then I began to see the trailing of events and the culmination in my appointment in Brooklyn from the time of Jackie Robinson going there in 1947.  And, you know, I see a parallel there and 'From Slavery to Freedom' came out in 1947.  And then Jackie went to Brooklyn that year, and then I followed in Brooklyn in 1956, you see.  And it's very interesting.
Story_ID: 17911
Speaker 1: What did you take out of that experience as chairing the history department at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York] because in 1964, you get called by one of the premier schools, University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], history department and you become, ultimately, you become the chair there.
Speaker 2: It's very interesting that you would ask that, because we had talked about moving about from place to place earlier.  I indicated my reluctance at going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] because it was the final institution.  It's as high as I could go.  I could go--couldn't go beyond that.  But here I am in 1956, being confronted with another kind of challenge; that is the challenge to go into a predominantly white institution, Brooklyn College, student body of more than ten thousand a department of history of more than fifty people, no other blacks in the department, and I am the chair of the department.  Now, that is something to, to consider.  Now the--one thing, the drawback on that was that I was to be chair.  I wanted to be professor of history.  But I didn't want to be chair of the department.  But that went with the, with the territory as they would say, and they were looking for a chair, who would be a professor.  And so I could take it or leave it.  They weren't interested in me as, as a professor, and only as a professor.  They were interested in me as being a chair, and being a permanent member of that, that institution.  Now, I've been visiting professor all around town, all around the country, Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York], [University of] Wisconsin [Madison], UC Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley] and so forth.  But those people, they didn't offer me any job.  And they just had me there for a decoration for the summer or for a semester.  But Brooklyn [College] offered a job, a permanent job.  It was something I had to take seriously.  And, and I,  I felt that this was really a very important thing.  And by their offering it to me, they made me--they put me on a deep sense of appreciation for their recognition of my merits on their merits, not because of my color or anything, on the merits.  And that was, that was a moving experience, which I never got over.  I shall ever be grateful to Brooklyn College for, for breaking the ice, as it were, for doing something that these other places were not even thinking about doing and having an African American as chairman of the department, as professor, full professor, permanent status, not one, not visiting for summer, not visiting for a semester, but visiting forever if you wanted--if I wanted to be there forever.  So I am, I'm deeply gratefully to them.  Now, when, when I was invited to leave Brooklyn to go to Chicago, the first thing in my mind, and I was not in the country at the time, I was in England, but the first thing in my mind was what would this--how would Brooklyn College take this?  For Brooklyn College was, had dug deep into my heart and my sense of appreciation by offering me the job.  And the only--I, I had to come back to this country in the spring of 1960--1956--I am sorry, 1964, '63 [1963], I had to come back here in the spring of '63 [1963] from England to some meetings, Fulbright [Scholar program] board meetings and so forth.  And I took it upon myself to make, to make an appointment with the president of Brooklyn College, explore this with him.  And if he had said I don't want you to go that would have been the end of it.  I wouldn't have gone, very frankly, I wouldn't have gone.  But he said to me, he said, "You know, I taught at the University of Chicago before I came here at Brooklyn as president".  He said, and it's Brooklyn College--he said, "The University of Chicago is one of the premier places in this country, in the world."  He said, "And I wouldn't stand between you and the University of Chicago for anything in the world."  He said, "If you go, you'll go with my blessing.  If you stay, you stay with my gratitude."  He said, but you, he said, "I want you to feel free to make up your mind on other things rather than having the obligation to Brooklyn College."  And so that's what I, that's the consideration that [wife] Aurelia that I took into account, as we pondered whether we should go to Brooklyn College--to, to the University of Chicago from Brooklyn College.  And we finally decided we would go.
Story_ID: 17912
Speaker 1: Now you and [wife] Aurelia had been together for thirteen years as you'd earlier said, and all of a sudden, John Whittington Franklin comes in the picture.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're a father now.  You're handling multiple jobs.  How are you balancing that out, plus being--?
Speaker 2: Well, my son was born in August 1952 when I was still at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And when I went to Brooklyn [New York, New York], he was four years old.  I couldn't have done what I did without Aurelia, without my helpmate because she was just absolutely understanding, so generous and, and so broad in her appreciation of what I was trying to do.  And so secure in her own self, which she was, that it was no problem for her to encourage me, even to sacrifice, even to pick up and leave where I--whatever I wanted to be.  She did not take a job after we left Howard University.  When we went to Brooklyn, she did not take a job because she felt that she had to be at home for Whit, our son, when he came from school or wherever he came from, especially with the climate so hostile in Brooklyn to him as a child and to us as a family, that she wasn't going to risk not being there.  And so she just simply bowed out of the profession and stayed at home for Whit.  That, I will be eternally grateful for.  And it made it easy for me to consult with her on critical decisions about where, what we should do, where we should go, whether we should go to Chicago [Illinois] or stay in Brooklyn?  Whether we should go to Salzburg [Austria] and teach or stay in the country.  You know, it was, it was so easy because when she expressed her views on it, I knew that they were her honest views, and that she was generous enough to, to tilt the scales in my favor.  And that's what she always did, always.  And for that, I shall be ever grateful.
Speaker 1: What did your son teach you about life?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Being a new father?
Speaker 2: He taught me responsibility.  And he taught me that--or at least I learned from the experience, that, that I should be more forthcoming and helpful to my family than I'd ever felt that I should be.  I, I became a father in every sense of the word, a father who, who vowed that nothing would ever interfere with my time with my son or my effort to rear him or to be with him or to guide him, that nothing would do that.  So that, for example, whenever he came into my room or into my study, I'd stop what I was doing. And he could ask me a question, two questions, a hundred questions, and I'd give him all the time he needed, all the time, any time.  And that was true until he left for college.  It was even true after he left for college.  It's true now.  So that, that was a--there was a part of me that I didn't know existed until he came into my life.  Then I knew what responsibility was, what parenthood was, and what joint rearing of a child meant.  And I never would, I never would want to do what my father did, and he had to do it.  He was away from us for four years.  He visited us every month or so, but my mother was, my mother reared me in the, in the boy things from the time I was five until the time I was ten.  And I thought that I should not put that responsibility on Aurelia and, because I didn't need to be away from them for a long period of time.  And I was never away more than a couple of months that I might be in Europe or some other part of the world.  But she was very understanding.  And I vowed then that wherever I had gone without her, I would go back when she had a chance so that she could experience what I experienced.  That was true of my going to Australia, New Zealand.  It was true of my going to--through Africa.  It was true of my going to various parts of Europe where she had not been.  It was true of my going to, to various parts of Latin America where she hadn't--she had not been.  India, where I had been six times, I had to go back just to be certain that she had the experience that I had had, you see.  So when it was payback time, when payback time came, I, I tried to live up to my, what I felt were my obligations.  But nothing stood in the way of doing what I could to rear my son or nothing stood in the way or our rearing our son together, as we certainly did.  It was a joint, it was a joint project which I entered into as willingly as I could and as much as I could, and as completely as I could.

Speaker 1: There are a lot of things changing around you.  You lose your brother in the late '40s [1940s] and I know there's some feelings there.  [Historian] Carter G. Woodson, the father of black history, dies in 1950 and your involvement with the Association for the Study of the Negro Life in History.  How do all of these things play out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Well, I could say offhand that in 1947, the summer of '47 [1947] was, was the busiest in my life.  I'm seeing 'From Slavery to Freedom' through the press, proofreading, indexing and so forth.  My brother [Buck Colbert Franklin, Jr.] was critically ill in the McGuire Veterans Hospital in, in Richmond, Virginia.  And I had been invited to Howard University [Washington D.C.], which involved moving and all that.  And I was juggling things.  I don't know how I did it.  I was going to, to Richmond, sometimes every week, sometimes driving, sometimes going on the train to see about my brother.  He died unfortunately, at the end of the summer.  I was proofreading; I was having proofreading parties at my house.  My friends would come over and we'd read 'From Slavery to Freedom' out together.  I had to index it that was all my job.  And then we had to move from Durham, North Carolina to Howard University, to Washington, D.C.  We had to find a place to live, had to move my things up there, all within a space of two, two, two to three months.  So it was, I just don't how I did it.  I was just doing, going and coming all the time, to Richmond, to Washington [D.C.], to Tulsa [Oklahoma] to bury my brother, back here, indexing here, and, you know, and all over.  It was--it was riotous time in my personal life.
Story_ID: 17914
Speaker 1: What were your reactions about [historian Carter G.] Woodson's death?  Did you know that they were, the leaders of the Association [for the Study of the Negro Life in History] were considering you to become the executive director?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Dr. Woodson and I had become very good friends, I would think close friends.  And despite the fact that I had published a book that was in competition with his, he was so gracious and so generous that I felt quite comfortable having published a book that was competing with his.  He made me feel that way.  He made me assistant editor of the 'Journal of Negro History' after that.  He--I never went into Washington [D.C.] if he didn't invite me tome to come and see him and have dinner with him and talk about things over with him, so that I, I felt very deeply appreciative of his grace and his generosity.  At the same time, when he became ill or when he died suddenly, I guess you would say, although those of us who knew him, knew that something was wrong with him.  He was slowing down somewhat, but he'd--when he died, I, I felt something had gone out of me.  And I was very distressed.  As I indicated, I was a pallbearer at his funeral.  I marched with [historian and educator Dr.] Luther P. Jackson from Virginia State College [now Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], and Luther kept saying to me, even then, during the funeral, "The mantle is yours, you must take it, you must take it.  You have to--you have to become his successor" and everything.  Well, and there were others who felt that way.  But I never felt that way.  I never wanted to do that because from my point of view, it was, it was taking up precious time that we, it might be valuable in the long run for others, but not for me.  I was not interested in administering an organization.  I'd been around these people enough to know that they needed more than, more time than I could give them.  Dr. Woodson was full time.  I was never gonna be full time with fooling with an organization like the association.  And so, although I appreciated the, the expression of confidence in me on the part of these people, I said, thank you, but no thank you.  And we went along like in that way.  And I did what I could supporting the organization from that day to this.
Story_ID: 17915
Speaker 1: Now you were right in the midst of perhaps, in my mind, the greatest social movement of the century.  Did you see the Civil Rights Movement coming?
Speaker 2: Yes, I could see it coming.  I saw it in various ways.  I, I worked with [NAACP lead counsel] Thurgood Marshall on the case of Lyman Johnson against the University of Kentucky back in 1948 [Johnson integrated University of Kentucky's [Lexington, Kentucky] graduate school], but I was the expert witness in that case.  And, of course, I was, I was, I worked with him constantly in the summer of 1953 when he was preparing the re-arguments for Brown against the Board of Education [Topeka, Kansas] remanded by the [U.S.] Supreme Court to the attorneys and their clients for re-argument in the fall of 1953 when they would answer the, certain questions about the intent of the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment [of the U.S. Constitution] and so forth.  And so I worked with him all that summer and into the fall and got a good handle on what, what was going on in the litigation field.  And I knew of things that were happening in, in Texas, 'Sweatt v. Painter' [U.S. Supreme Court 1950] and in various other places, Smith against Allwright [U.S. Supreme Court 1944], a transportation case [sic, case decided whether it was constitutional to deny blacks the right to vote in Texas state primaries].  And these things were boiling up, coming together in a way.  And then there were mass meetings, particularly after, after the, [Dr.] Martin Luther King's [Jr.] response to the, the, the problems we were having in, in Montgomery [Alabama], the bus boycott and so forth.  And that was all boiling too.  And one couldn't be a close student of these affairs without realizing that something was, something major was happening and about to happen.  This certainly was true by 1959 and '60 [1960] when you had the Montgomery Bus Boycott, having been successful, when you had these cases that I mentioned, having been won; when you had the Brown case, having won.  Now, there was a--there was negative response to all of these events by, by whites in the South and some in the North, but there was no question in my mind but that this was marching on.  Now, by the time of the Montgomery march in '63 [1963], I think that things were really boiling and the Civil Rights Movement was, was reaching its apex.  The, the marching had been successful all through and they were pressing for legislation.  That would come in '64 [1964] and '65 [1965].  And there would be the big March on Washington, and there would other marches on Selma [Alabama] and which I participated.  So by that time, any observer could see what was going on, that the, that the Civil Rights Movement had reached its apex probably and that, and that the country would never be the same again--,
Speaker 1: You had a role in--.
Speaker 2: Especially after the legislation of '64 [1964], '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 17916
Speaker 1: Did you have a role in the Brown v. Board of Education Topeka, Kansas?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was one of the, what [then NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney] Thurgood Marshall called, the Non-Legal Research Staff.  And he, he called me--I was teaching at Cornell University [Ithaca, New York] that summer, and he called me asked me, the summer of '53 [1953], he said, "What are you doing this fall?"  I said, well, I'm going back to Howard University," [Washington, D.C.].  He said, "You know what else you'll be doing?"  I said "No."  He said, "You'll be working for me."  And he said, and then he told me about the case and how they had to get some history of the Reconstruction period.  And, and I said, "Well, all right, I'll work for you."  And so I began to work for him in the summer of '53 [1953], toward the end of the summer, and I went to Washington [D.C.].  I went from Washington to New York [New York] every week from Wednesday to Sunday, every week, working with him, writing papers, doing research, answering questions.  We had seminars, we had all the kind of group meetings, the lawyers were in and out.  And whenever we would, someone to talk about this, they would--they were most respectful and they were very glad because they wanted to know what happened during Reconstruction, you see.  And so there I was to tell them what happened during Reconstruction.  And I did that until, until late November 1953, every week I went there.  And I can add, parenthetically, I've never seen a person work as hard as Thurgood Marshall.

Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement impacted American society, and it also had an effect on, I believe, an effect on American scholarship.  Now, do you think your political activism was influenced and shaped by the events of the Civil Rights Movement or did you--were you able to maintain some separateness of your scholarship and your political activism?  How did that work out for you?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I've said over, over and over that I was a political activist--I'm pleased to be one.  But my scholarship and my writing, I think, would not necessarily reflect that.  I don't think that, as a, as a scholar I could be an advocate without losing my objectivity.  But I think one can be both, and I've tried to be both, and I'm very sensitive to the importance of keeping them as separate as possible.  I'm not sure I succeed, but I try, I try to keep them separate.  But I have to be an activist.  As a scholar, I'm an activist.  You know, I--serving as an expert witness in these cases, that's a kind of activism.  Even going to these places and lecturing or talking where you know that, that you're not considered to be good enough to be a permanent addition--that's activism too, because I'm trying to prepare them for the time when they will accept people on the basis of their scholarship and not merely on the basis of their color or race.  So it was a lot of activism that, in, in my life which is, I would say not activism in the sense that it's commonly used.  But in addition to that, I'm, I'm an activist like anybody else. I'll walk the streets, I'll march, I'll picket, and I'll do things like that to try to push the program on and to get some level of decency in our American life.
Story_ID: 17918
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about the Cold War, your scholarship and your activism?
Speaker 2: Well, the Cold War--let me say, first of all, that I, I felt it very keenly, and in my work that I did in Europe and in Asia in the '60s [1960s], some--and into the '70s [1970s].  I, I remember the first time I went to Germany, I went to Berlin [Germany] to lecture in 1951.  I, I was astounded at the, at the way in which I was limited in my movements and my activities, and even more so later when I went back, and I went to Russia in 1970.  And the, this, the way in which I could not do certain things impressed me greatly.  For example, I, I went to the, I went to the Soviet Union as a part of a delegation of educators, and I went as a kind of expert on American social and intellectual life.  And I was to answer questions which people had raised in these places about this various (unclear) American scholarship, American philanthropy and whatnot.  And I was amazed at how much these people did not know or how little they knew, how warped their views were of what was going on in the United States.  And I, I had said, for example, I'd like to see in, in the Soviet Union, I'd like to see the following people--I named them.  I was able to see them because they were brought together at the American History Institute in Moscow [Russia].  But then I wanted to see--I remembered I wanted to see someone else, that I hadn't told them about before I left the United States.  And they said it was not possible.  You can't see them.  I hadn't given them enough notice.  And so that was, that was it--that's all, kinds of other things like that which, of course, did not affect my scholarship as such, but did tell me what was going on in other parts of the world, which, which made it somewhat easier for me to sustain what I was experiencing in my own country.  Because the kind of intellectual controls there were greater than the controls here.  And while I was very much unhappy about many things that were going on in the United States, I didn't feel that I was bound by any kind of ideology or any kind intellectual constraints and so forth.
Story_ID: 17919
Speaker 1: In 1964, you moved to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and between 1967 to 1970, you served as chair of the department and became the John Matthews Manty [sic, John Matthews Manly] Distinguished Service Professor in 1969.  How did the school affect you, and what were your thoughts about being there in those years?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always said that I went to Chicago with the blessings of my friends at Brooklyn College [Brooklyn, New York].  But I, I went because, in addition to the other reasons that I wanted, I wanted to have students of my own, Ph.D. students of my own.  I didn't have that Brooklyn College, which was not yet up and running and its doctorate program was not yet up and running.  The graduate center of the City University [of New York] which is very, very important now, was not, didn't exist then.  So in order to have Ph.D. students of my own, I had to leave Chicago--leave Brooklyn and go to Chicago.  So that one of the first things that happened to me at Chicago was to, was to think in terms of, of a cohort of, of--of disciples or students of mine that were, would carry on where I was unable to carry on, or that could do a lot of things which I wouldn't have time to do, which they could do, and which I had viewed that this ought to be done. So it was a, it was very, it was very wonderful to think that I was in that position.  And, and so I entered my job as professor of history with great enthusiasm.  And I was enthusiastic about it and was doing very well until the provost called me in the spring of 1967 and said that he wanted me to be chair of the department.  And I got up and started out.  I said, "I thought you wanted something with me," and I was just disgusted.  And he said, "I don't think you should just leave when fifty people in the department have asked me to ask you to be their chair."  Well, I slowed down then.  And I went back and sat down, and then I began to complain about the department, what I didn't want to do.  And I said, "I haven't--I'm too busy to be chairman of the department."  He said, "You can have all the assistants you want."  He says, "You can have a research assistant, you can have assistant of the office."  I said, "Well," I said, "I've been chair for eight years, and I'm, I'm just--I'm fleeing from it."  He said, "That's why they want you to be chair.  They know you have experience as chair of this department."  I said, then I said--finally, I was getting desperate, I said, "And that office, it looks awful."  I said, "I wouldn't be caught as chair of the department and that office looks like a way station in a Russian village."  He said, "Why don't you have it, why don't you have it redecorated and buy new furniture and everything."  And I said--anything I would say, he would counter with something, and remark like that.  But I didn't decide then that I would take it.  But about a month later, I saw the provost and--this is Edward Levy, who was later was to become president of the University.  I saw him in the Quadrangle Club.  I was having lunch with someone, and he walked over to my table.  And he said, "I have not got an answer from you yet on what I asked you a month ago."  And I looked up, I knew it was, it was Mr. Levy, I said--he said, "I think your answer is gonna be yes."  And he walked away without giving me a chance to say anything else.  Well, I finally said yes.  And then I was chair of the department and for most--at the biggest upheaval that I think we've had at the University.  That's when the student uprising was just blowing away, just blowing up, and I was left with all of that stuff to handle.  It was really quite something.
Speaker 1: You develop an army of Ph.D. students at Chicago, and that puts you in a different role of being a Ph.D. advisor, and going through that process myself, that's a very serious role because students look to their Ph.D. advisors like mother and father figures.  So that's a new role for you.  How did you take that?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed it very much.  I, I had about, I had about--I had over thirty Ph.D.s at the University of Chicago in sixteen years.  And, and it was, it was really great.  They, they took to me, and I took to them.  First, they were excellent students, just top-notch students.  Secondly, they were very congenial and very amenable, who--they were, they were students who liked to, liked to work.  They didn't mind working hard.  They were students who were always questing for something new and different.  I took them, I brought them to New York--to North Carolina once to do research.  And we spent several weeks here doing research in the archives of Raleigh [North Carolina] and the state archives and at the University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].  And they, they loved it.  And the others that didn't come with me were jealous of, of the ones that did come with me.  And we had a very wonderful time together.  I was their advisor to be sure, but I was only their, sort of senior advisor.  And they were juniors.  I, I--they were, they were people, not just students.  They were, they were wonderful people for me, and, and that's the reason I think that I have such fond memories of them today, and where--and the reason why most of them keep in touch with me now, especially if they're living.  I lost three to death, but the other twenty-eight or nine are just, just wonderful people.
Story_ID: 17920
Speaker 1: That must have been an exciting time for you because the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], there's an explosion in American historical scholarship with the introduction of race culture and gender and that had to--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it did.
Speaker 1: And your students certainly went in those directions.
Speaker 2: Yes, I had students following those new paths with great enthusiasm, great energy, and, and it, it did, it did effect me too.  And I began to look at various problems, historical problems, differently. I began to--for example, I began to fret about runaway slaves as an example of, of a kind of revision of the earlier understanding of what slavery was like in this country.  I began to think in terms of the role of women in, in history in a way that I hadn't before.  Mr. [Arthur M.] Schlesinger, Sr. at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had talked about women and American history, and I hadn't given as much time to it as I wanted to give.  But now that I had some students who were interested in it, I had began to think about and work toward that end.  I developed some new views about women myself. I began to examine my own writing, for example, to see what extent--to what extent I had overlooked that, and I had, to a painful degree, been guilty of the same things that other people were guilty of, mainly of, of thinking of history in terms of men, more than men and women.  And I, I ran back and began to revise 'From Slavery to Freedom' with that in mind and my other works I hoped would--that were coming out, I hoped would bear that new point of view, which I was developing.  So that, this explosion meant a great deal, not only in terms of gender history, but in terms of social history, cultural history, and intellectual history and so forth, so that I, I hoped that I became a, a more whole historian or more wholesome historian as a result of those experiences.
Speaker 1: But that's an interesting point you made about Arthur Schlesinger [Sr.] at Harvard when you were a Ph.D. student there, that he talked about women need to be incorporated more into American history.  Because I had been in conversation with other scholars, and they said, "Well, Dr. Franklin doesn't deal sufficiently with, with women in some of his works." But in, in your years at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you began to think about that then?
Speaker 2: I did.  I, I think that I've been probably unjustly accused of being chauvinistic where, you know, where women are concerned, but no, I--my eyes were opened, not merely by Professor Schlesinger, but also by Professor McIlwaine.  I, the first paper I wrote of any consequence at Harvard was--dealt with women.  And it had to do with the constitutional position of the Norman queens.  And I worked on all those queens, and went back and read in, in Latin all of their edicts and edicts about them and their role in, in the court and that sort of thing.  And I wrote a paper which I, which I've lost now.  I wish I had it.  I would publish it as a vindication of my, of my position with respect to women.  But I can't find it, and that's that.  But I have--and Mr. Schlesinger certainly was, himself, an outstanding leader in the field and the Schlesinger Women's Library, at Radcliffe [College, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is named for him and other things have indicated there, the, the enormous influence that he had in this area.  And I hope some of it rubbed off on me, but I never want to be accused of being a male chauvinist of any kind.  And I, and I, and I stand to be corrected--I, I'm willing to accept any kind of observation that, that I have neglected women in some place or in some way, 'cause I have no interest in doing so.
Story_ID: 17921
Speaker 1: You were involved with the Fulbright Board of Foreign Scholarships from 1962 to 1969.  You were also involved with the [U.S.] State Department and the United States Information Services.  We have the records of your involvement here at the National Archives and Records Administration.  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, it did give me the opportunity to, to become what I hope would be regarded in some quarters of the world citizen, and that is, a person who was not confined to the United States at all.  I first went abroad in 1951 to teach in, in Salzburg seminar--to teach in Salzburg, Austria at the seminar on American Studies.  And it was there that the window of the world was opened to me in a way that I hadn't seen it before when I had students from all the countries in Europe--most of the countries in Europe, in my classes there.  But in--and I, and I continued to be active in the U.S. Information Service and in the State Department, going abroad lecturing and so forth in the period between 1951 and 1962, or three [1963].  And then in '62 [1962] President [John F.] Kennedy appointed me to the Board of Foreign Scholarships, known as the Fulbright Board.  And I became very active in that almost immediately, and I served on that board some seven or eight years, three of which the--three finally--which I was chair of the Board of Foreign Scholarships or chairman of the Fulbright Board.  And I worked assiduously, not merely to promote the program of the Fulbright scholars and researchers all over the world, but I worked to keep it alive.  I--it was, it was undergoing some difficulty in terms of the hostility of various members of [U.S.] Congress and so to, to the continuation of the program at a certain level, and I fought to keep it at a higher level.  And sometimes I had to initiate programs in which the host countries would be joint participants in, in financing the program.  Germany, for example, and France and Italy soon began to help with the financing of the program in a way that they hadn't earlier.  And this helped a great deal.  And, of course, during that period I was, I was abroad every, every year and sometimes two and three times a year in connection with the Fulbright program.  And this was particularly easy after I went to [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] where I taught only--I, I taught only two quarters, and was in residence one quarter, but not teaching and could go anywhere.  And one quarter, I was out of residence all together.  So I was able to take on these assignments, and I helped to establish the American Studies and Research Center in--at Osmania University in Hyderabad [India]. And I, I used my, one of the--one three-year term, I used primarily as working in the Near East and South Asia, and I went everywhere from Baghdad [Iraq] to what is now, what is--Baghdad through India and all in between.  And I, I lectured a great deal in those countries.  And then, of course, after I left the Fulbright program, formally I was invited to serve as the Lincoln Lecturer where I would celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Fulbright program by visiting New Zealand, Australia and about six countries in Latin America.  And I later was working as the member of the Advisory Board on American Diplomacy.  And I served also as [U.S.] President [Jimmy] Carter's, a member of President Carter's Advisory Board on Ambassadorial Appointments and in various other ways.  And we worked assiduously, very hard to promote the idea of American Studies, American intellectual life in other parts of the world.

Speaker 1: In 1982, though, you became professor emeritus at [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], your retirement.  Can you tell us how you ended up at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] teaching history and legal history, and you became the James B. Duke Professor of History in 1985.
Speaker 2: I began that in 1982.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two.
Speaker 2: I, I became weary of Chicago after about fifteen years.  It was simply too cold, and although I loved the university, as I still do, I found that I couldn't bear the weather any longer.  And we had my ninety-two year old mother-in-law living with us.  And it was terrible to have her cooped up in the house from the fall to the spring without even getting outdoors at all.  And my wife, as was I, yearned for the South, not merely for the climate but also to be part of what we, what we regarded as the remarkable and revolutionary changes taking place in the South.  And so we decided to leave Chicago and to move to North Carolina.  I had reached retirement age anyway, and despite the fact that the president of the university had got the board of trustees to extend my stay for another three years, I decided that, despite the fact I was grateful for that gesture, I decided I would go on anyway.  And I, I did go. They wouldn't let me go at first.  They gave me a leave of absence.  And I, I went, took my family with me, bought a house in Durham, and became a fellow at the National Humanities Center, where I attend--where I worked for several years and was working there for an indefinite period of time, when Duke University invited me to be the James B. Duke Professor of History at the university.  And I accepted it and went there and worked for three years in the department of history and seven years in the law school [Duke University School of Law, Durham, North Carolina].  And so it was a great and wonderful experience, which I've described in my autobiography as a whole new life.  And so it was, it was an amazing experience.  Duke took me into its heart and to, into its inner self, as I thought that no university would ever do.  They commissioned a portrait of me to hang in the library.  They established the John Hope Franklin Collection of African and African American Documentation in the library.  And they also created a new agency called the John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies, and the whole building is devoted to that, one of the busiest programs at the university now.

Speaker 1: From the publication of your works in the 1940s to now, you've been an extremely productive scholar.  And you've covered an amazing range of historical themes and issues.  From that time to now, in these years, how has your scholarship changed or has it changed?  What themes did you consider vital, or what were the major themes in your mind that you considered vital?  And what was most important to you to look at?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--it's very interesting you've asked me that question because I, I sort of used my leadership in the various associations as kind of landmarks to, to punctuate my interest in the field of history.  And it, and it changed.  And I can, I can show you how it changed from time to time.  When I became president of the American Studies Association in 1967, I think it was, I was tied up, as I think I might have indicated just a few minutes ago, was tied with foreign policy, problems abroad and so forth.  And so I took as my presidential address the subject of the American scholar and American foreign policy.  And I, I pursued that, and, and it was later published, of course.  But that's, that's one of the, one of the issues that I gave attention to.  Then when I became president of the Southern Historical Association two years later, '69 [1969], I was interested in, in the South.  This is, the moment that I was terribly and deeply interested in the South and what it was doing, how it was reacting to all this, all these problems around it and so forth.  And I, I wrote my presidential address on, on this problem--the South and great, great challenge of change--I think that's the way I put it--and the extent to which it was not changing, you see.  This comes, this arises out of my study of the militant South, you see, and so forth.  And I gave that a good deal of attention.  And then when I became president of the, the Organization of American Historians, I was right up to my ears in considering the question of Southern travelers, and--.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: 1974 or five [1975].  And southern travelers and this, this great--see this was, this was social and intellectual history, I think, as I had defined.  But Southern travelers, who were going North, trying to understand the North, trying to appreciate the North and northerners were going South trying to understand and appreciate the South.  And it's, it's leading toward the Civil War in a sense, getting the tense, feelings are getting more and more tense.  And so I wrote my presidential address that year on the North, the South and the American Revolution, in which they were arguing--the North and the South arguing--which, which was more responsible for independence from England.  And I traced that with great care and interest and delight for that period.  Then I became president of United Chapters of Phi Beta Kappa [honorary fraternity], and although I didn't deliver a presidential address to them, they were the ones that chose to publish in the place of a presidential address--which they did not have anyway--my, my paper on the, on the--the first paper that I delivered on the, the, the--I'll think of it in a minute.
Speaker 1: Was it the Bill of Rights?
Speaker 2: No, no, you can cut it out if you want to.  No, it's a, it's a paper I delivered on the, in the--for the American Studies Association on the American scholar and American foreign policy.  But I did not have to deliver a paper on--at the Phi Beta Kappa Association meeting.  And then the family in the American--when I was president of the American Historical Association, I was interested in, in this whole question of the impact of Reconstruction on the mind of the South and the mind of the North.  And I gave it, I gave a presidential address that dealt with that problem of change in the, in the North and the South.  And so my, my leadership in those associations gave me an opportunity to stop and think about where I was with my own mind and my own work and to, to share that with, with the members of my association.

Speaker 1: A prominent scholar and, and women's black women's historian, Darlene Clark Hine, who is at the, is a professor of history in Afro American studies at North University--Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois], considers your work a "fountain of black culture."  How do you feel about that?  In addition, [interviewer] Walter B. Hill, Jr., of the [senior archivist and subject area specialist for the] National Archives and Record Administration [Washington, D.C.] described you as a protégé of Carter G. Woodson, but not in the tradition of Woodson's scholarship.  What are your thoughts about that?  And if there's any person out there--any scholar, historian, political person, who influenced your scholarship?
Speaker 2: Well, with respect to the Darlene Clark Hine's observations about my scholarship, I would say I appreciate it very much.  And she's most generous in her praise, and I'll take it, although I'm not sure that I'm worthy of it.  With respect to Walter Hill's observations, I would, I would, I would say that I try to be as, as true to the highest standards of scholarship as I can be, but I'm still working at it.  It's a, it's a work-in-progress, shall we say.  Now, who out there influences me more than anyone else, I, I would say that if you're talking about high standards of scholarship, regardless of the field, it would be David Levering Lewis, whose, whose versatility I greatly admire, and I only wish that I could be as versatile as he is in writing books about Africa, about Europe, about, about this country and biographies as brilliant as this, Pulitzer Prize winning, two-volume biography of the [author, scholar, activist W.E.B.] DuBois.  But that's, that's a--it, it, I'm, I'm awed by his scholarship and by his, his achievements really.  And so he, he's--although he's my junior in many ways, he's also my, my idol, as I look at the historians who, who are writing today.  And I'm thinking about the ones that are writing today.  I'm not thinking about the, the giants in the past and people that I have emulate, I do consider as, as persons that, that are maintaining the high standards of scholars in the, in the twenty-first century.  Lewis is, is especially dear to me in that sense.
Story_ID: 17925
Speaker 1: A lot of contemporaries and past scholars would have to be awed by you because, after all, I think you're leading the field in terms of receiving honorary degrees from a lot of major universities and colleges.  And then that's no small feat, so you have to, I believe, feel very good about that, and this--her [Northwestern University professor Darlene Clark Hine], assessment of you in terms of your scholarship at least, in terms of being a, a fountain of black cultural, I think is right on the mark.
Speaker 2: Well, I am, I am grateful to, for people who recognize me and these 135 universities and colleges that have given me honorary degrees, I, I'm very, I'm very awed by that.  And it causes me to wonder, I mean, I don't know what it may--it, it gets to be a fad or a style and well, if they gave--this guy said, if, if so-and-so gave Franklin honorary degree, we, we'd better do it ourselves.  And they go on and do it.  I don't know.  I'm not, I'm not simply swept off my feet by it.  I'm grateful, but I don't know that this--I don't know what this means and what it says or--as I said, I'll take it, but I--
Speaker 1: But they had to recognize the fact that you got a long measuring here in terms of your scholarship and your productivity, and I don't think they're just leapfrogging here because others have done it.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not, I'm not persuaded by your argument.  I, I think that they might do it because others have done it.  And, and it's, you know, Father [Theodore] Hessberg [president of University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana] and I were leading recipients of honorary degrees in the country, and it's kind of a friendly race.  And he says, "Franklin, how many you got?"  I said, "Well, I, I'm not gonna tell you because you've got more than I have."  I said, "How many do you have?"  He said, "I have 106," or something like that he was saying.  I said, "Well, you wouldn't have that many if it weren't for all those small Catholic colleges that give you honorary degrees because they fear you and are awed by you."  And I wouldn't tell him that I, that I've gotten honorary degrees from large numbers of Catholic colleges too.  But it's, it's sort of a pleasant kind of recognition.  I'm deeply grateful for it, and I'm still getting them.  I will be getting them this spring, but--.
Speaker 1: But you do see the point that is being made here, that you have made your mark, and that is, that's what's being recognized here--,
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: --first and foremost.
Speaker 2: All right, all right.  I won't argue with you.
Story_ID: 17926
Speaker 1: Where did you develop your taste for orchids and greenhouses?  It seems that that's been kind of therapeutic for you and your wife [Aurelia]?
Speaker 2: I was teaching at the University of Hawaii [Honolulu, Hawaii] in the summer of 1959 when I became aware of orchids other than on women's--as women's corsages.  I had never seen an orchid plant in my life.  And we lived in--my son who was six years old at the time, and my wife and I lived in a faculty house in, on Manoa, in Honolulu [Hawaii].  And we would go out for strolls in the faculty compound there and everybody would have these plants on the stoop, the steps or on, plant--on the porch and whatnot.  They would be orchids blooming.  And I would walk up to them and look at them, and I was just astounded.  I'd never seen any, I'd never seen orchids blooming.  And when we arrived in Hawaii, they put leis around us, that sort of thing, orchids and leis.  I'd never seen this before.  And I was fascinated by the, by the plant.  And so I decided that I should bring some of those home.  So when I came back to Brooklyn [New York, New York] in 19--in the late summer of 1959, I had a half dozen orchids with me.  And I was gonna raise them, and they promptly died cause I didn't know what to do with them.  I watered them and--but they died.  And, but I wasn't finished with them.  I got some more, and I began to travel.  And as I would travel abroad, then, I would go to where the orchids were and collect them, and bring them back with the permit that I had from the United States Department of Agriculture.  And I learned to take care of them.  I learned what they needed and whatnot.  I was at that time, very friendly with the curator of the orchid collection at the Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, who was a professor of botany at, at Brooklyn College where I was teaching.  And our wives were best friends and so he and I became friends and he taught me everything.  I don't say everything he knew, but he taught me everything I know about orchids.  And, and I was then in, sort of in business.  I got a, window greenhouse there.  I kept it until I left.  When we were in Chicago [Illinois], I built a greenhouse, our first greenhouse on the roof of our house there.  And I had a fairly substantial collection there.  And then when I came to Durham [North Carolina], I built a freestanding greenhouse, my dream greenhouse, so to speak, and I now collect orchids.  I have about four hundred or so now, and we've been recognized.  I've had two orchids named for me, registered in my name.  And I--my wife has had one named for her, in her memory [phalaenopsis Aurelia Franklin].  And I prize all these very highly.
Speaker 1: Were you surprised?  I think that was the 'New York Times' [newspaper], were you surprised when they did a piece on you and your orchids?  Been a few years ago.
Speaker 2: Well, they had a picture of me in and my orchids--in my greenhouse with the--I think the, the piece had to primarily with my appointment as--,
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --as chairman of the President's Advisory Board on Race.
Speaker 1: But that picture of you in your greenhouse, and I think you had an apron on, I mean I think that sort of sets, set the tone for reading that article--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did.
Speaker 1: --that this was a man enjoying life and enjoying his orchids.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's true.  Orchids, as you say, are quite therapeutic for me.  I enjoy them.  I--some people have coffee breaks.  I have orchid breaks.  I go out to my greenhouse two and three times a day just to have a look at my orchids.
Speaker 1: Most people that I talk with who visit you in Durham [North Carolina] will tell me, before we sit down and talk with Dr. Franklin, he always first takes us into his greenhouse to see his orchids.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: What's our thinking behind that?  To relax people or what?
Speaker 2: No, I just, I just have so much pride in them, and I want to them to share that--it's a great pleasure.
Speaker 1: How much did your wife have to do with that greenhouse and the orchids?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, we, we worked together.  And before her mother died, we--her mother, even in her nineties would help us repot orchids and that sort of thing.  But my wife and I were very--we were avid orchid growers together.  We visited orchid ranges in Costa Rica and various parts of the world, Brazil.  And the orchid company in, in South Carolina, Carter and Holmes [Newberry, South Carolina], they finally made, named an orchid in her memory.  And when she passed, they remembered her so well because we went, we were down there and we purchased orchids from them.  And we would have so much fun with the people there that when they learned of her death, they immediately developed and an bred orchid and named it for her, registered in her name [phalaenopsis Aurelia Franklin] at the Royal Horticultural Society in London [England].

Speaker 1: Let me take you back into the political realm in American history and scholarship, the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s], and even going into the '80s [1980s].  Vietnam is in the center of this country's history in this century, and with the shift of [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] opposing the war, what were your thoughts in seeing [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] take that shift and as an American scholar and historian, how were you beginning to view the war, the Vietnam War?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't need King, King's position to influence mine because I, I'm sure that I was very critical of the war as early as King was.  And--or if I didn't do it as openly as he did, nevertheless, the I was, I was critical.  I was--and I was not supportive at all.  What pained me was to see President [Lyndon B.] Johnson, whom I, for whom I had the highest respect, and whom I admired greatly in so many ways, it pained me to see him sink himself into the mire of Vietnam more and more and more.  He never, he never recovered from it, and that's, that was, I thought, very tragic.  I was critical.  I was openly, personally critical of the war, certainly before it got, before [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] began to express his opposition to the war.  I probably did not go as far as he did ever in my criticism, but we had different styles.  I have a different way of being critical from what he does.  So, but it, it affected me greatly, and I think it probably affected my scholarship.  I don't know how but--.
Speaker 1: That's what I was gonna ask you.  Did it show up in any way in your scholarship?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I hope not, unless it was, unless it was dealing with that particular problem of war.  I try to keep these things separate.  It's not gonna show up on my--in my presidential addresses or any of the articles or any books that I write.  It certainly won't show up in that way because that's not the kind of history I write.
Speaker 1: Right.  So that pretty much remained in the realm of you being the political activist, the social activist--,
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --the public intellectual.  Right.
Speaker 2: And I think these things must be kept separate.
Speaker 1: Separate, right.
Speaker 2: There are people who disagree with me, and think that I--that's not possible.  I, I can only say that I try all the time to keep them separate.
Speaker 1: Was it difficult though?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, it's very difficult.  And--but I always say--and this brings me back to my resolve, that I always say that you cannot do this and be a credible scholar, you see.  You're affecting your credibility if you go and shout against whoever, you see.  And so I try hard not to.  For example, when you, when you see a man like Ja--like [U.S. Senator James O.] Eastland or any of the other Mississippi or Southern [U.S.] senators filibustering and, and denigrating blacks as they did on the floor of the Congress, House of Representatives and the Senate, and you are inclined to, to rage at them and to denounce them, in your scholarship saying, "It's just like Southerners.  They just like--," but you can't do that.  You can't do that without affecting your scholarship and your credibility as a scholar.  So I try to keep those things quite separate.
Story_ID: 17928
Speaker 1: In 1997, the President of the United States, William [Bill] Jefferson Clinton called on you to chair his advisory board for the initiative entitled, One America.  What was your reaction to this?  What mandate did the president give the Advisory Board on Race [Relations]?
Speaker 2: Well, my reaction was one of being astounded completely, despite the fact that the president at that time, I knew him.  And he had conferred on me a Medal of Freedom in 1995, and I'd been to the White House a number of times for various activities, various invitations he'd extend to me.  I was still surprised that he would in the summer of 1997, ask me to chair the President's Advisory Board on Race.  And the first, my first reaction was that I had to go see my doctor, to see whether I could do this or not.  After all, I was, I was already eighty years old.  And the doctor said, "Go for it."  And I talked to my wife [Aurelia], and she said, "I don't see any reason why you shouldn't."  And I, if I was looking for an excuse not to, they wouldn't give me an excuse not to.  And so I, I finally agreed.  I didn't, I didn't agree the moment he asked me.  I had to think about, think about it.  Now, the mandate that he imposed on me--.
Speaker 1: Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt.  That's interesting.  You did not immediately--this is the President of the United States.  So you told the President, I'll get back with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That's right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I, well, I had to, I had to ask my doctor, and I had to ask my wife.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how long did it take you to make that decision, though?
Speaker 2: A week, I guess, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: A week?
Speaker 2: I don't remember how long it was but I--when I got back to the President, I got back to him later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was all right, I guess he was all right with him, I suppose, I don't know.  But it was all right with me, I think, (laughs) anyway.  But the mandate the president gave us is widely misunderstood.  The President didn't ask us to solve the race problem, although many people thought that that's what we were going to be doing.  The president didn't give us a mandate to straight up anything or do anything like that.  He gave us a mandate to start a great national conversation on race.  This was his mandate to us.  And, and we set about in the summer of 1997 to do, to do just that.  And with some degree of success, I think we did it, although the people who, who expected us to solve the race problem, were disappointed.  But this was just a step, interested in getting the attention of all the people in this country and calling their attention to the fact that this was a problem that needed to be confronted, needed to be viewed by every American.  They ought to get into the discussion and see what they--what we can do about the problem of race.  And so, from that point we started in the summer of 1997 to doing a number of things, including creating units or groups all over the United States, on campuses, in communities that wanted to start talking about race and the problems of race.  We meanwhile, we meanwhile met in various parts of the country and gave people an opportunity to come to the board, the Advisory Board on Race and to air their views about race and what we ought to do about it and so forth.  And we published a number of documents, encouraging people to discuss race.  We, we didn't create all the avenues that developed, but we did what we could to stimulate this, this discourse, this conversation on race.  And we got it going.  I remember in Seattle, Washington, I, I was, I was very gratified to see what was happening.  I was in Boston, Massachusetts I was pleased.  In Texas, I was pleased, Houston, Texas.  In Florida in Miami, I was pleased.  In Chicago [Illinois] and various other places where we went people were talking about race.  And that's what the President wanted us to do.  But there were two things that were wrong with the, our approach so far as the general public was concerned.  One is that we didn't--the race--the mandate was not as broad and as strong as many people wanted.  And the Op-Ed pieces in the New York Times [newspaper] by [former U.S. Congressman] Newt Gingrich and Ward Connerly [Chairman of the California Civil Rights Initiative], even before we met the first time, the opposition was so strong by, on their part, the criticism was so strong, there was nothing we could do--nothing we could have done to satisfy them.  That's, that's one kind of problem.  Another was that people defined the problem in a way that we didn't at all and that the president did not.  They defined the problem as one which could be solved by certain acts like broadening the mandate of the, of the Equal Opportunities Commission [sic, US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] and putting more teeth in this and that and the other.  And that's not what he wanted us to do, and that could not have been done in 1995--(correcting) '97 [1997] anyway.  So it, that was another source of criticism.  Another was that we, we were, we didn't give enough people enough opportunity to air their views.  And we were being criticized for that, as we, indeed, were.  So it, it was--we were in a no-win situation so far as the general public was concerned, although they were doing, even as they did that, they were doing what we, what the program wanted them to do, mainly to, to air their views, to vent themselves, to start a dialogue and hopefully it would be constructive.  And what we were doing, we were trying to guide these discussions and facilitate them and, and stimulate permanent organizations that would be working in this area.  And we published a book called 'Pathways to--,' I've forgotten the title, 'Pathways to Understanding in the Twentieth Century' and they were, these were suggestions of hundreds of ways in which it could be done.  And we, we listed all these in there, organize, you could organize a certain way.  You could organize another way, you could do this you could do that.  You could contribute to the resolution of the problem of race in this country.  Another thing we did was to publish a report finally at the end of our term, to publish a--we published a report in which we reviewed what we had done and made some recommendations of what ought to be done after that time.  What we had done was, I think, clear and unequivocal.  What ought to be done was clouded by the fact that we were going out of existence and the president had only one more year himself, or a year and a half.  And, and just not much could be accomplished in that year.  And the President [William J. Clinton] was distracted in various ways and didn't get a chance to do what he needed to do to facilitate our recommendations.  But it's interesting to know that, that once I left the chairmanship, once it--the board was dissolved, the president did follow up on a number of our recommendations.  We told him that you can't do this unless you have the support of the legal profession and, and get them going to provide law that would undergird whatever those, was gonna--whatever could be done.  And he did.  He invited, invited the attorney's general from every country--(correcting) every state in the Union, and his own [U.S.] Attorney General [Janet Reno] was there, and law--various representatives of various levels. The single lawyer, the lawyer with one person in the office, the big, the medium-sized firms and the big firms, they were all there. And I was invited, as were the members of the Advisory Board on Race although we, we didn't exist any longer.  I was invited to sit with them and to talk with them and to, and to share my views of what they might do.  And he did the same thing for the religious group later.  We had every, every kind of religious leader in this country, and not merely Christians and Jews, but Muslims and Buddhists and whatnot, they were all there, and spent a day discussing the problem of race and trying to work out some ways in which it could be improved.  And they, they made some very significant statements with respect to that, and others, like other activities like that.  So it, there was a follow up, but, by this time, no one seemed to be interested because our report didn't say that the race problem had been solved.  And, and these, these other activities were just sort of hanging on and distracting.  And, as a matter of fact, we were out of existence, and the American people were back to their old habits of, of not doing much about race.
Story_ID: 17929
Speaker 1: Do you think the American public--do you think they recognized that this commission [sic. Advisory Board on Race Relations] was historic because there had been two previous race commissions, under [U.S. President Harry S.] Truman and under [U.S. President Lyndon B.] Johnson.  And you spoke once at the Supreme Court Historical Society on that very topic.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, I don't think the people, they don't know their history that well.  They didn't link these three presidential boards together and they didn't measure the extent to which they might have had some influence, that is the Truman board in 1949 or the, the Johnson, Kerner Commission [formally named the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders] it was called, in the 1960s.  They simply didn't, didn't, they didn't--they don't have that much sense of history to link these things together, or see some thread that might be passing and, and influence one on the other.  No, we don't, we don't think like that.  We don't have a historical mind to think like that.  So that, the result is we don't benefit from one stage to another.  We do everything--we have to invent the wheel all over again.  And that won't get us very far if we have to do it every time.
Speaker 1: Did you have any--going into the work of the commission, did you have your own ideas of perhaps, where you wanted to probe and what you wanted to ask and what you wanted to hear?  Did you have your own ideas about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  And I think my own ideas were, were fulfilled, and I, and I hopes were fulfilled.  I did what I wanted to do, and my colleagues, they were wonderful colleagues, on a very small board of seven people.  They were colleagues who thought for the most part, thought together about a problem, worked together about the problem, a problem, whatever it happened to be, and came up with similar recommendations and solutions.  So I was, I was pleased with the performance of the board and I was pleased with the, the outcome, although it wasn't what the general public wanted.  But they wanted something that we didn't have the power to deliver anyway.
Speaker 1: What, what did you learn from that experience?  Did it confirm some of your thoughts about American, American society?  Were there any real great revelations made to you, and what were some of your experiences in working with the individual board members?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll answer the last one first.  As I said, the board members were very responsive on the whole.  The board members were very cooperative, and we worked together.  And a bond had been, a relationship that was very admirable.  Now, so far as the--when I go out of this, as far as the achievement was concerned, I'm afraid that the end result was not very fruitful in the sense that it delivered a product that was, that everyone could see, and it was very good, and it was durable and whatnot.  And although it did open the eyes of many people and it did simulate them, and it did start this dialogue that the President [William Clinton] wanted to have, it didn't, in the long run, do what people wanted it to do.  An they misread its purpose, and they misread its, its results because they were looking for something else.  And I would say finally that the board was, was an effective and successful instrument for doing what the president wanted done, despite the fact that they were--there were people who--and I learned a great deal about people and about institutions, especially the communicating institutions, the, the--I, I said once that the only free press is the ones you own yourself and that these presses were not very--very good.
Story_ID: 17930
Speaker 1: Let me take you back a little bit with the preparation of your father's [Buck Colbert Franklin] autobiography.  You said going through your father's manuscript and other papers, you developed a greater appreciation of his life.  How did that experience affect your views of him and did you acquire a deeper understanding of who he was as your father?
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose I did.  Going through his papers, particularly his manuscript for his autobiography and his manuscript of other things that he left, I, I did have a greater appreciation for him.  And, and I, I had a great sympathy for him too--that here's a man who struggled all his life to be an effective member of society and who had to defend himself by, or escape the wrath of the community by using initials instead of his first name, and who, who never really had the opportunity to practice law as he wanted to practice it.  And that is, to chose his clients selectively, to specialize in an area.  It was so difficult for him that he had to take all clients that came, whether he wanted to or not, although he had one caveat, namely, that he would never, never take a divorce case unless he was absolutely persuaded that there was no hope for their--for a reconciliation.  Even though we might be hungry at home, he would send a couple away, and tell them to try it again and he wouldn't take their case, although they might be willing to pay him that day so they could get out of, out of it, no, he wouldn't take it.  He wouldn't, he wouldn't take the case.  And sometimes they would go to other lawyers who would take the case.  But that's the way, that's the way he was, a man of great principle.  And, and I, I admired that.  And so much of this comes through in his writings, in his, in his, not only his autobiography, but other, other things as well.  Now, when, when he was writing his autobiography, he wrote it after he had had a massive stroke, and he lost the use of his right hand all together, and he was right handed.  He could only use the index finger of his left hand, and he wrote two drafts of that autobiography with the index finger of his left hand, just pecking away, day after day after day.  Finally, he came--and, meanwhile, he was saying to me that, I want you to help me get this published now.  I said, "Now look man, I'm busy.  We'll get it published, but I'm busy.  How about talking about it next week or so?"  I did not know, or I didn't sense enough to realize, that he knew that he did not have much time, and he was hoping that he would be able to get it published. He knew.  He--I had published books, and he, you know, he wanted some connection.  He wanted me to use my connections to get his book published.  And I, I said, "I will, but, you know, give me time, just wait."  And one day, I woke up and my Dad is dead.  And the manuscript was not published.  Well, then I don't have to fret about it much because he's gone, and I can't do anything about that, and I'm busy, and I just, you know, I'll get around to it.  Then I one day I looked at the calendar, man, and I realized that I was the age he was when he tried to persuade me to help him.  Now, I'm eighty-odd years old, and he was only seventy-nine, eighty when he tried to get me to help him.  And if I don't do something with his manuscript soon, then it'll be lost another ten or fifteen or twenty years.  And so I engaged the assistance of my son who lives here in Washington [D.C.], and who could run to the [National] Archives and run to the Library of Congress and get material that we needed to document his work.  And then we would be able to publish it.  I think it ought to be known that, that the manuscript is not edited.  My father wrote, wrote very well, and I couldn't improve on the writing.  What we did was to provide notes and information which would help to illuminate the point that he was making, but never, never correcting him, no, no, no, no.  And, and so, it, it gave me appreciation for his own style, his own use of words or language and that sort of thing and appreciation of how, of what kind of training he had had in, in philosophy and history and so forth.  So that when we published his autobiography, it was published as he left it--even the title and the dedication and the manuscript itself, just as he left it, and we, and we made some editorial notes.  That's all we did.  And I got it published at the University of--at Louisiana State University Press [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], which was delighted to do it anyway.  And they put it in paperback, and it's still in print after--since 1997.  And so it's, it's thriving.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was published 1997 entitled 'My Life and Era: The Autobiography of Buck Colbert Franklin.'  Now, in the opening appreciation in (unclear) you wrote, "Consequenty"--I'm quoting you, "Consequently, as I assume work on the manuscript, an urgency, not unlike that which gripped my father in 1959, took control of me and did not release its hold until my son and I had completed this manuscript and sent it to press" unquote.  Could you talk--that urgency, were you looking at your age and your father's age--that' what it was?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes, I was looking at my age, yes, it was my age, and I was--I said, "Well, my goodness, he, he went out of here that I am now, and I'd better do something about his manuscript.  Otherwise, it will be left to, to someone else."  And I could not do that to my father, and I dropped everything I was doing then and, and turned my attention to the manuscript and got it out.
Speaker 1: Would you characterize that as guilt or it just wanting to do it.
Speaker 2: It was just--oh, no.  It was a sense of guilt.  It wasn't any question that I had a feeling guilt because I had, I had not, I had not done right by my father, I thought at the time he was living, and when he begged me to do something--help him with the manuscript.  And I said, "You know, I'm busy, you--we'll do it, we'll do it in time."  And, no, it was a sense of guilt, I think, that hounded me and drove me to doing it without any delay at that point.
Speaker 1: What was your son's, John Whittington's [Franklin's] focus here?  Did he put any pressure on you or did he just graciously--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No, he, he was delighted to do it, and he was, he was thrilled really to be a participant in this enterprise.  And he was constructive in his help because he was here in Washington where I needed to have certain instruments at certain points verified and so forth.  No, no, he, he was, he was--he had no sense of guilt.  Of course, he wasn't involved in it, but he was just, has a great sense of exhilaration, exhilarating sense.  It exhilarated him in a--exhilarating sense that he was a part of an enterprise, and representing three generations.
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship did he have with his grandfather?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't know him very long.  My father, my grandfather--his grandfather, and my father, came to see him when he was about five days old.  He'd been vacationing in Saratoga Springs [New York] and came down to Washington where we were.  And he, he--I think it was not, I think it had, the baby had not been five days old.  And so he, he took him and held him in his hands, in his arms and said that, "Now, he can't be called John because there're two of you, and he's got this marvelous middle name, Whittington, why don't we just call him 'Whit'?"  That's my son--my father's name for him, and he's been known to me as Whit ever since, although he's now known in his circles as John.  And later on, my father visited us from time to time, and we visited Oklahoma from time to time, but you see, he's got only--he's got only a short time to live between the time my son was born and the time he died.  My son was eight years old when my father died.  So their relationship was, unfortunately, terminated at a very early age.

Speaker 1: The last three, four years, you've been diligently writing your own autobiography here and other places.  Will this biography have more than the evolution of your life?  Will you get into your views on your life as it related to the changing American environment and atmosphere?  Will it deal with your scholarship?  You've given the public some snippets of this autobiography, and I think there is an anticipation out there waiting for this biography.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I haven't withheld anything that I thought the public ought to know. It's, it covers most of my life down to about 2000.  And, and I have tried to apply the same standards of scholarship to it that I've applied to my other writings.  I have not been terribly self-critical, but I've been, I hope, objective about what I say, about what I've done, and we'll see.  I don't know.  We'll see, but I hope that, I hope that I've satisfied the public's curiosity about me and what I've tried to do in these last eighty-odd years.

Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the--for African American communities in this country?
Speaker 2: My hope is that they shall be, they would be completely integrated.  I'm a, I'm an integrationist.  I hope that the African American community will be integrated into the larger community in every conceivable way and every way possible.  I'm not terribly sanguine about that.  I'm not very--I don't believe that it will happen any time in the near future, because racism is so deeply ingrained in this country.  And it's, and the real facing of it, is eluded so, so clearly and so consistently, that without facing up to it, there's no way you can solve it, no way you can deal with it.  And every time you get to deal with it, you try to deal with it, some, some, some group or some leaders who will say, "That's not the way to do it and oh, it's already done, and you're muddying the waters," and so forth and so on.  I'm not terribly optimistic about it, but there have been changes, and there are changes and there will be changes.  How long?  It will reach the point where I would like for it to be, where there is no concern of color and race and so forth.  Reach that--and I don't know whether it ever will reach that point, but I'll be working to, to try to make it reach that point because that's where I think it ought to be.

Speaker 1: What about African American scholarship, what are your thoughts about where it's been, where it's at, where do you think it should go?  What are some of the issues and topics that need to be addressed further?
Speaker 2: Oh, you see I think African American scholarship ought to be moving the way that I hope our society is moving, where we will not have any separate kind of scholarship.  I didn't--I'm not, I'm not a great advocate of African American History as such, as long as we know it.  In my last years of teaching, I taught--I didn't teach African American history at all.  I taught American history and put African Americans in that history where I think they belong, you see.  I taught history of the South, and that gave me the opportunity to teach about southern blacks and whites trying to confront their various problems and so forth.  And I, I was very pleased with the results of that kind of integration.  And I, I really believe that that's where we ought to be going.  And I'm like Dr. [Carter G.] Woodson [historian] on this point that he used to say that he looked forward to the day when, when you wouldn't have to have "Negro History," as he called it.  You'd just have history.  And I don't know--I contiue to react favorably to that observation.  I'd be pleased with that too. And so, and as it, as the scholarship increases, I think it will--it's doing two things.  One is, you've got vast quantities of African American history like you've never had before, and people are just churning it out, churning it out.  At the same time that African American history illuminates American history generally, it makes it possible to blend them more, when you have all this information about blacks and the Confederacy or blacks in the Union or blacks in the [American] Revolution or blacks in the national period and so forth.  You can blend them much better having that knowledge than you could when you had no knowledge of what was going on one side of the fence.  So that's not the, the burgeoning of that field is not necessarily a point that indicates a separation of the field from others.  It might mean it can be more adequately blended now that you've got as much information about African Americans as you have about others.
Speaker 1: So blacks that, that whole phrase of "Blacks in," that needs to replace or substituted by just American history?
Speaker 2: At that time, at the time when you get to that point.  I'm not saying we're there, but--.
Speaker 1: You don't think we're there then.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: From your grandfather to your father [Buck Colbert Franklin ] and now you, and then your son [John Whittington Franklin], can you reflect on the Franklin legacy here?
Speaker 2: Oh--my grandfather left the legacy of, of commitment to, to family values and decency of living.  And my father left a greater legacy because he left his own print--imprint on his son--his sons, and his grandchildren, and more importantly, he left a legacy for the entire country in his autobiography and his commentaries on life in this country.  I have been fortunate to have had more opportunities to secure a greater education than anyone in my family previously--formal education.  My father was as educated as I was, but it wasn't formal.  And I've had the opportunity too, to be rather glib in my writings of various kinds, and, which, of course, have had some impact, I hope.  And I hope that the legacy will be there for all to see in due course.  And finally, of course, I hope that my son will take the torch and carry it on.  I'm pleased with the way he's done up to, up 'til now, and have every belief that he will continue in the future.

Speaker 1: What do you want people to say about John Hope Franklin?
Speaker 2: I want them to say that he was a first-rate teacher, which I hope I was.  That's all.
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I was a first-rate teacher.
Speaker 1: First-rate teacher.
Speaker 2: That's all.  That's really all.  I teach in various ways.  I teach by confronting students.  I teach by writing.  I teach by reflection, teach by other--by example.

Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, all of the ups and even the downs, how do you feel about it?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm fairly satisfied.  I don't think I would have done many things differently.  I'm, I'm--I wish that I had had better opportunities.  But that's something over which I had no control.  I would like to have been a linguist because I think that it's only that way you can communicate with people in other parts of the world.  But I had no opportunity to do that.  And that's one of the reasons I've worked so hard to have my son [John Whittington Franklin] to master at least some foreign languages and he's, of course, absolutely fluent in French and in Wolof [indigenous language of Senegal and the Gambia, West Africa] and less than in Portuguese and some other languages, Arabic.  But I don't think that there's another big gap in training that I would want--would have wanted, and I'm pleased with the opportunity which I've had to, to work and to influence others, to teach my students and, and to be taught.  I'm still teachable.  I'm still learning, trying to learn every day.

Speaker 1: One last question---.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh c'mon. C'mon.
Speaker 1: Once you finish your writing project, what's--do you have any other project in mind?
Speaker 2: Yes, going fishing.
Speaker 1: Going fishing.
Speaker 2: Yes.
