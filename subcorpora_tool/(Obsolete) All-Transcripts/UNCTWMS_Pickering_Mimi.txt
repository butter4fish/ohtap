JESSIE WILKERSON:  This is Jessie Wilkerson and Mimi Pickering. And I&#8217;m at Appalshop in Whitesburg, Kentucky. The date is August 5,&#172; 2010. I always like to start these interviews with getting a sense of a person&#8217;s childhood and early life history, so where you come from and what your family was like.
MIMI PICKERING:  Okay, well, I am not a native of Kentucky. I actually grew up in California in the Bay Area in a fairly middle-class community and family. And so I went to, I was sort of in high school in the sixties and I would say was fairly influenced by the sixties sort of with questioning what was going on. I think partly through my youth church program and stuff, we were questioning the Vietnam War and you know the whole hippie thing was happening in San Francisco. And then we also, there were sort of leftist students from Stanford coming to our high school, and so there got to be a pretty radical group going. And so I actually was introduced to the women&#8217;s movement at that time, like late sixties, early seventies, in I don&#8217;t know which wave of the women's movement that is, but--. [Laughter] So, you know, very early on as a teenager and young adult started to think of myself as a feminist and in that perspective, and then I didn&#8217;t--.
I wanted to, when I got out of high school, I wanted to go and live somewhere else or experience other things and not just stay in that environment or stay in California, so although I was not that excited about going to college, but I did end up going to Europe for a while and then going to Antioch College in Ohio. And that&#8217;s a school that has a program where you, or it did exist, you go to school for a couple months and then you go intern somewhere. And I think Antioch kind of invented the notion of the intern, but it was mandatory. It was part of the degree program. So I actually was there in the fall of 1970 and met a woman who was from West Virginia, and so through her, we went to Charleston and I met some folks working with the Black Lung Association and some other groups. And then they decided they might like to get some Antioch interns and so came and interviewed some people, and I was interested.




So I ended up going in January of &#8217;71 to be an intern in Charleston, West Virginia. And what they wanted me to do was to--. They had been given some video equipment, some really--. It was already out of date, but some of the first portable video equipment and Gibbs Kinderman, who I worked with, and he was really interested in the notion of media and how media could be used and that it was becoming more affordable and accessible to folks. And he had heard about Appalshop, so they had been given this equipment donated from somebody, and he wanted to use it to do some training tapes with the Black Lung Association because they were all about training lay advocates to help miners get their black lung claims, and also kind of organizing the UMW reform movement there, but he&#8217;d heard about Appalshop.





So on my first or second week, January of that year, we came down here to Whitesburg and met Bill Richardson. And Appalshop was pretty young at that time, so Gibbs came up with an idea of doing a film with Appalshop, in part for me to learn filmmaking to continue on with them in West Virginia, and also, it was a community in south West Virginia that he thought would be really good to document. So then I started working on a film with Appalshop that ultimately became the Struggle of Coon Branch Mountain. And I went from sort of being in a learning position to kind of directing it, editing the film eventually at the end of it. And then I also--. So I kind of commuted between Charleston and Whitesburg at that time, and then I also, with some of this video equipment and some other equipment, they connected with George Stoney from New York University, who was just doing media access stuff with video and cable access.
And so we also started a cable program on the cable system in Charleston where we did kind of community access programming, so that was fun to do. It actually didn&#8217;t--. We did shows like, we kind of went to different groups, statewide groups, and let them do a show, so it wasn&#8217;t--. And then it only showed in Charleston. So I don&#8217;t know. The audience, the shows, all that didn&#8217;t really mix, but it was fun to do, and groups like the West Virginia Welfare Rights Organization did a show, which was great. They acted out being nasty case officers. And then our work was, we did stuff on black lung and stuff, and our work there was more state-focused than Charleston, but anyway, that&#8217;s how I sort of got involved in media work and then involved with Appalshop. I don&#8217;t know exactly--.
I guess that we, when doing the Struggle of Coon Ranch Mountain, there had been some, a VISTA, in particular, who had been involved with this community, which had been, a lot of their fight had already occurred. They were fighting to get a road and so that a school bus would come up onto their mountain community and take their kids, so the kids could go beyond the eighth grade. They could go to the high school in town, but the school system said the road was too bad to send up a bus. So they were going to different people trying to get a road and a school and all this. So this VISTA had been involved with them, and I think he had actually gotten fired because he had helped this group and they&#8217;d challenged all the powers that be, but I think he probably suggested that this one woman, Birdie Powell, would be a good, you know, was really important to this story, and so then eventually, she became, in my mind, kind of the storyteller. And it&#8217;s a real short film, but I think she&#8217;s sort of the featured person in that. And you know I think it, from that point on, most of my films have really, it&#8217;s ended up that women are the principal storytellers, and it really has not been a deliberate choice on my part. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve found that they really are the community leaders in so many of these struggles, and you know, they&#8217;re maybe not acknowledged as that so much, but they are, you know, and they&#8217;re really these amazing strong women that hold their families together and hold their communities together and you know are willing to step up and take the heat and do all these amazing things.








JW:  I wonder if your background with feminism and being open to, I guess going through like a phase of gender consciousness or whatever, allowed you to see those women doing the primary work or kind of the key roles? I don&#8217;t know.  MP:  Yeah, it may have. [Laughter]  JW:  Compared to other filmmakers who maybe didn&#8217;t have that same experience.  MP:  Right.  JW:  It&#8217;s just a--. I don&#8217;t know.  MP:  Right, yeah, and I mean my involvement in the women&#8217;s movement, I mean it did start in what was sort of typical of that time of sort of consciousness raising and women talking about men and society and being screwed over and this and that and power, but I think it also, I was also involved in sort of left-wing politics, and so got a bit of learning about a class analysis, and that was one of the reasons that I was really interested in going to West Virginia because such a state, a poor state, but also with sort of a strong working class labor movement and union workers. So I thought if all these organizing, the working class ideas are legitimate, West Virginia ought to be a place where that plays out.  JW:  Can you say more about the politics that you or the political movement you were getting involved in? Because it seems to be a story that we run into a lot, of people who were involved in leftist political groups and then moved to this region and started doing organizing work. So could you tell a little bit more about how that played out, so where you started?  MP:  Yeah, and I was never like, didn&#8217;t really join any of these groups, but my brother was quite active, who is a year younger than me. And you know I was friends and involved and all that, but the--. You know it was a lot of stuff coming out of the anti-war movement and some of the people coming from over in Stanford and organizing in the whole Bay Area. So it kind of evolved to the, eventually, there was a group called the Revolutionary Union, I think, the RU, which was active, and I know some of those folks did leave the Bay Area and come to West Virginia as organizers. So I didn&#8217;t do that exactly, but they were a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist group, and they later became the Revolutionary Communist Party, the RCP. So I was never, you know, an official member of any, but I certainly knew people and participated in some of the--. I can&#8217;t even remember what they called them, maybe study groups or something, and did definitely think that a lot of the philosophy and ideas and sort of anti-capitalist approach made a lot of sense, but I guess that was one of the reasons I was attracted to West Virginia because of that, like here&#8217;s people who are really being exploited and there is a class consciousness through the Mine Workers and other unions. And so if this is really something that is a reality and could happen in the U.S., it seems like this would be a good place for organizing, although again I have not--.




I mean I went to Antioch and in high school did a lot of artwork, and I sort of was majoring in art, so I never really wanted to be an organizer, but--. [Laughter] And one of the things I found in making that first film was that I found it a really creative activity, you know, I really loved filmmaking and editing and putting it all together and found it a way to hopefully, in doing that, also being able to have something to say or tell stories that needed to be told from the perspective of people who were directly involved. And so I found it a really satisfying way of being creative.  JW:  When you came to West Virginia and then you started working more in the region, how did that change the politics that you had been learning or kind of the political experience you&#8217;d been having on the West Coast and at college? How did that compare to what you actually faced when you got here?  MP:  Well, you know, I actually found that a lot of the people that I interacted with were pretty progressive in lots of ways. I mean they really did have a class analysis that was pretty on target. And for the first, I guess it was for the first year that I was in the region, I was working a lot with the Black Lung Association, so there were a lot of disabled miners who had really, you know had been horribly screwed by the system, the companies, and they knew it and had a pretty good sense of where it came from. And so you know people were, they were religious, but didn&#8217;t, it didn&#8217;t--. It seemed like a different kind of religion then. You know, it was, I mean there would be some of the most Pentecostal really small-time churches and the preachers, and those preachers would be part of, be members of the Black Lung Association and would deliver a prayer before, at the end of the meeting, and it would just be an amazing prayer that brought in the situation there in West Virginia and made it very real and based in that place and was kind of a prayer of unity and solidarity. So I&#8217;m not a religious person, but I really, you know, I related to that and it didn&#8217;t seem in any way in opposition to the organizing work. And then, you know, I mean attitudes towards women were, they were traditional in lots of ways, but there were a lot of women involved in the black lung movement, a lot of widows, or wives whose husbands were so disabled they really couldn&#8217;t participate much. And they were always very well received and seemed like they could, you know, participated, so yeah, I didn&#8217;t really--. I didn&#8217;t find it a huge culture shock in some ways.
I mean what has happened over the forty years that I&#8217;ve lived here is I&#8217;ve seen the region both politically and culturally get much more conservative, which is a sad sign, but I mean one of the--. About a year ago, I was driving from like here to Charleston and was in Logan County, West Virginia, and it was Easter time, and then just driving alongside the road, there&#8217;s like a little pilgrimage of people dragging a cross and doing the Easter thing. I was like, &#8220;This--.&#8221; On the highway, you know. This is not something you would&#8217;ve seen thirty years ago, you know.  JW:  What do you think has led to those changes?  MP:  Well, I think it&#8217;s symptomatic of or the same thing that&#8217;s happened in a lot of the country, but, that we&#8217;ve become more conservative. I mean some of it I think is a reaction to the women&#8217;s movement, to the gay, lesbian, lesbian, gay movement, you know, to the civil rights movement, all these things that there&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s definitely been a backlash, and this happened both politically and culturally. I also think that early on people were, they were Democrats and they voted for Democrats, and now, like they&#8217;re Democrats and they vote for Republicans. And I think back then, they really did feel like the Democrats stood for something and actually delivered things that made their lives better, and then I think in more recent years, you know, the Democrats have not, for working people, have not visibly done any much more than Republicans have, at least that&#8217;s easy to see. And, you know, the Democrats supported NAFTA, which a lot of working people really, I mean, did--. I mean all of these world trade things have really, really hurt working people, and maybe the financial industry has profited, but--.

So my theory in part is that people have turned to God and faith and religion more because they don&#8217;t see any help anywhere else. And these more conservative politicians who prey on that and push in that direction, that things would be better or we would go back to where we were, to that good times, if we outlawed immigration, immigrants, you know, if we got rid of gay people, if women would go back in the home, you know, all those kinds of things. And when you haven&#8217;t seen a lot of benefit from the other direction, it&#8217;s easy to fall for that. And religion is really important here and been strong in lots of ways. People have lots of faith, which can be a really good thing, but I mean you know you have really low to moderate-income people also concerned about continuing the so-called death taxes, as if estate taxes are going, as if that&#8217;s going to have any impact upon them at all. I mean in fact it will hurt them if we don&#8217;t tax those kinds of, you know, really wealthy people.  JW:  Have those political shifts affected your own work?  MP:  Well, yeah, I mean I&#8217;ve done--. One of the things I&#8217;ve done, I&#8217;ve produced documentary films and videos, and then I&#8217;ve also tried to work in media or communication sort of strategies with grassroots groups around policy, more directly around policy issues. And so we were involved with a group called the Kentucky Economic Justice Alliance, which involved the Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, and Appalshop, and Community Farm Alliance, and Kentucky Youth Advocates, at one point. So we did a--. You know, we&#8217;ve done--. We have worked particularly for the last five or six years, it&#8217;s not going anymore, but, well, KFTC continues it, but have been working for fair and adequate tax reform. So we&#8217;ve really been fighting the public sentiments for a while, and it&#8217;s a frustrating battle that we&#8217;re just fighting to try to keep state budgets for domestic violence centers and school lunches and on and on, you know, adequate schools. And it&#8217;s also fighting against an attitude that government is bad and that government doesn&#8217;t do anything and we should get away from government. So I&#8217;ve seen all those perceptions of the role of government and the--. You know I&#8217;ve seen that change over the years.









Anne Braden talks about it in the film we&#8217;re doing with her, and she talked about it a lot, this whole, you know, the reverse discrimination thing, which I think is, you know, it&#8217;s tied into this, where the message has been going out that we now discriminate against white people and that we&#8217;ve given everything to black people and women and immigrants and all of this, and we&#8217;ve given that in the form of our government largesse to all these people, and we, the poor, the hard-working white people, are being discriminated against, and as a rationale to cut taxes and to cut all these programs. So you know that&#8217;s--. So we&#8217;ve continued to fight to try to maintain them or increase them, you know, because--.  JW:  It sounds like a daunting task.  MP:  Yeah, and I mean in the belief that government really should represent the people, not the corporations, and that government is a place to level the playing field and work in the people&#8217;s interest, but, you know, I don&#8217;t think it does, and I think it&#8217;s gotten worse instead of better.  JW:  I was about to ask a question along those lines. Oh, because I was just thinking about how it seems like since you&#8217;ve been in the area for a long time, you would&#8217;ve seen the shift from the War on Poverty, where government was involved and it seemed like good resources were coming out of that, to people thinking that the government&#8217;s too big, but I wonder what your sense is of the memory or how people think about the War on Poverty or its legacy? Is that something that ever comes up in your work?  MP:  I mean it comes up. I mean it has come up at Appalshop a lot, because, well, some of our films, like Stranger With a Camera, you know that Elizabeth did, deals with that, and Strangers and Kin does, and some other Headwaters shows, but I mean I think now when you, like talking to college-age kids or younger, I mean I don&#8217;t think they know what the War on Poverty is or was, so it&#8217;s sort of fading into the distance. At Appalshop, we&#8217;ve been part of discussions about the War on Poverty, and it had some, it definitely had some negative--. I mean people locally felt negative aspects of it. I mean one of the things that really interests me is our images in this country and feelings about poverty. And every time that there&#8217;s a film that comes out that looks at the Appalachian region and poverty, you know, there&#8217;s a scream of outrage, like, &#8220;Why do they focus on us? And why do they do this?&#8221; And you have mayors and Congresspeople all criticizing a film when they&#8217;ve never seen it, which I think is interesting. And most recently, Diane Sawyer did a piece called Appalachia&#8217;s Children or something, which, I mean it was, you know, network TV, but, people just say they hate, and yet she was filming real stuff, like the really bad situation with teeth, tooth decay and people, kids drinking all this pop, and all this kind of stuff. And she failed to--. You know she failed to put any kind of analysis on it, economic analysis, that, you know, people don&#8217;t have drinking water that they can, don&#8217;t have safe drinking water, so you give the kid pop. That&#8217;s cheaper than buying water or easier, but I think that from--. I think the War on Poverty probably brought the region into the limelight, at least in the past century or in people&#8217;s memories, more than previous times it was brought up, and left with a lot of people this sort of feeling of a stereotype or stigma of being poor. And that I think continues, and people are really sensitive about any portrayals of any of the poverty in the region. And I think it&#8217;s in large part because in the country as a whole, we have this just really negative attitude towards poor people and poverty, and I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s changed--. [Referring to the weather] We might have a big storm.   Over, you know, I think it might&#8217;ve been different in the thirties when there was more class organizing and I always get the sense that in Europe there&#8217;s more of a pride of being from, you know, being working class or, you know, a sense of being poor, having some dignity, but here it just seems it&#8217;s been stripped of all dignity, and it&#8217;s a &#8220;blame the victim&#8221; kind of thing. So I think it&#8217;s really detrimental in this region because it&#8217;s hard then to have a real discussion or exploration of poverty and why people are poor and sort of the systemic reasons for it. So I think that&#8217;s kind of a lingering effect of the War on Poverty, and it suits a lot of interests to have this defensive reaction to any depiction of poverty because then it gets just dismissed. I mean you think about the era of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson when the press came into the region and they showed people living in real, I mean dire, dire circumstances, and starving, and the reaction of the populus, I think, and the politicians, was to provide help. And then nowadays you do--. You know, Diane Sawyer does a piece and it shows people in pretty dire circumstances and nothing happens, and it&#8217;s just dismissed. And people want to say, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s not true.&#8221; And they certainly want to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s not me.&#8221;  JW:  Do you think something&#8217;s changed, too, with the imagery and the type of poverty they&#8217;re showing? Because one thing I&#8217;ve been thinking about is how in the eighties there&#8217;s this whole, like the welfare queen, and it&#8217;s women, and then it is also true that more and more women are falling into poverty without support and it&#8217;s children, and it is, it definitely gets gendered, a lot of people would say.  MP:  Right.  JW:  So I wonder what your thoughts are on that, like how those images or ideas of poverty have changed. And I saw that Diane Sawyer piece, and one thing that--. I mean I think there&#8217;s a way that the images with Kennedy and Johnson, like, it&#8217;s poor people, but there&#8217;s something I think like people could romanticize it in a way because it&#8217;s shacks and there&#8217;s people in overalls, and it&#8217;s sort of quaint in its own way.  MP:  [Laughter] Right.    JW:  And in the Diane Sawyer piece, you have like meth addicts and trailers and people burning tires, and it&#8217;s a different, it looks different, at least the way it&#8217;s being shown on TV.  MP:  Maybe it&#8217;s the difference between color and black and white. [Laughter]  JW:  Yeah, it could be. [Laughter]  MP:  Yeah, I mean I think there are, I mean there are, I mean in the same way that we have not conquered racism in this country and, you know, probably, I mean that&#8217;s the kind of thing you never completely can, but, you know, by no means has the women&#8217;s movement achieved its end goals. You know there&#8217;s definitely a lot of hostility and resentment towards women, and, I think, and welfare definitely becomes a flashpoint for that, that these women are--. Well, people don&#8217;t, again, I think it&#8217;s, a lot of it is a lack of understanding of the reality of situation and a lot of myths about it that--. I mean the reality is that I think--.








And I was doing a piece on welfare reform and did some short pieces. It was really interesting, of women who were on public assistance and then going to the community college, you know, who had recognized they needed to get their GEDs and then get at least an associate&#8217;s degree, if they were going to get any, you know, get a job. And so you know here they were trying to better themselves, and as they would say, &#8220;We&#8217;re trying to become taxpayers. We&#8217;re trying to contribute.&#8221; And that was right when the Welfare Reform Act of &#8217;96 went through, and it made it much harder for anyone to go to school and get public assistance. You know, it&#8217;s just like punitive or something, so it is not a program designed to help people get on their feet. It&#8217;s almost to undercut them, but I do think it is primarily women and children who benefit from that program, and they&#8217;re not held in high esteem in our society, and then they&#8217;re looked on as that poverty is their doing, and so they don&#8217;t deserve these benefits. And they&#8217;re actually benefits like, you know, the dollar amount hasn&#8217;t changed in twenty years or something. I mean it was amazing just recently this debate over unemployment insurance, as if again that was like some welfare giveaway.  JW:  Right, that people wouldn&#8217;t want the job.  MP:  Yeah, they won&#8217;t look for a job if they&#8217;re getting unemployment, you know. [Laughter] And it&#8217;s hard to know if that is a lack of a sense of reality on the part of people. I mean clearly it is for some people who fall for that. For the politicians, of course, they know. It&#8217;s just a cynical ploy. And you know with welfare, that was an area in the region where there was a really strong women-led movement kind of in the time of the welfare rights, the whole national movement. It&#8217;s one that has kind of died down, and actually with KFTC, we did work on welfare reform and all those issues, and had some good organizing going on with women. And then what happened was that it got harder and harder for women to go to college, and they also had to work all these hours, either voluntarily or, well, to get their check, so they were--. And so they really--. It was kind of a masterful thing because they no longer had any time to be involved in any organizing, you know, between going to school and then working their thirty hours a week and raising children, you know, they couldn&#8217;t go to KFTC meetings or march on Frankfort or anything like that.  JW:  Or rest.  MP:  Yeah, right. [Laughter] Or sleep, you know.  JW:  So given the issues you&#8217;ve addressed that women have faced here, has your sense of the women's movement changed over time, you know, the way you define it or the goals, what you see as the primary goals?  MP:  Well I guess that my--. You know, starting pretty early, my sense of the women&#8217;s movement did really involve a--. The economic issues were more important than some of the--. Or the issues facing working and poor women were really at the heart of it and where the emphasis should be. And, you know, I&#8217;ve been a little disdainful of the &#8220;Ms. crowd,&#8221; kind of, or, you know, and even, I&#8217;m very pro-abortion, pro-choice, but have not been, you know, have thought some of those organizations were really catering to upper middle class white women. And I&#8217;m probably unfair in that. I just get their stuff in the mail, but I haven&#8217;t really seen that as a place to move forward the issues that much. I don&#8217;t know if that answers the question. [Laughter]  JW:  Yeah, so, I mean with this project, we&#8217;re really trying to think about what the women&#8217;s movement looks like in the South, and getting away from this standard narrative, from that middle class sort of &#8220;Ms. crowd&#8221; narrative, so I wonder if you have--. [Sound of rainstorm] It is really--.  MP:  It&#8217;s not unusual.  JW:  Pretty big storm out there. [Laughter]  MP:  I wish my windows weren&#8217;t open at home, but--. [Laughter]  JW:  Oh, no. [Laughter]  MP:  I knew I should&#8217;ve closed them, but it&#8217;ll survive. I mean one thing that I have, I mean I&#8217;ve experienced both in being involved in a citizen&#8217;s group like KFTC and then also in my media work is that in the, I think in the region, most of the grassroots struggles around various issues have been led by women, and I think they really, women are kind of at the heart of communities and are the, you know, the most likely to stand up and fight for their families and their community. And I think some of the people you mentioned earlier, you know, Bumpass Cove was certainly that case, that was the case, and just time after time, they&#8217;ve been these sort of unsung leaders, and they also--. They&#8217;re not--. They do not say, &#8220;Well, you know, I&#8217;m a feminist,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is the women&#8217;s movement,&#8221; but, you know, by their actions and willingness to fight and determination, I think they really are. And another interesting thing has been to see women who got involved in some of these struggles because their community was threatened with toxic chemicals or building of a coal-fired plant or whatever it was, to see their growth in that process, that you know they may not win the fight, but there&#8217;s so often a kind of a growing realization of their value and their self worth and what they can do, and you know, kind of a real--. They had that strength there, but maybe didn&#8217;t realize it, and that&#8217;s been really interesting to see. And it&#8217;s great to see these women emerging as more and more leaders. And you know what also tend to happen in a lot of cases is their relationships have fallen apart, which I think, you know, maybe as the women become more self assertive or more engaged with outside communities, some of the husbands are not too happy with that. [Laughter] &#8220;You&#8217;re just not the little woman I married who&#8217;s there to feed me dinner every night.&#8221;  JW:  I wonder if there&#8217;s ever resentment over that happening, though. I mean if it&#8217;s a--. This came up in another interview when someone mentioned that women in this particular group would not say they were feminists. They would say they were for women&#8217;s rights, but they wouldn&#8217;t say they were feminists because they didn&#8217;t want to be perceived as anti-man, because they really liked having a husband and wanted, you know, needed a husband for--. I mean I guess they just wanted a husband, and for economic reasons, just believed in having a traditional family. So it&#8217;s interesting to think about getting involved and losing a husband or a support system. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s really complicated.  MP:  And I think that it goes to messaging again. You know, like feminist is a dirty word. Well, why should that--? I mean, it means man-hater and, you know, abortionist, and all of these things that have just--. So that&#8217;s, you know, I think people, women do shy away from that, from saying they&#8217;re feminists. And you know it&#8217;s really, it&#8217;s too bad that--. You know, it&#8217;s always too bad when a label, I mean labels are labels, and they&#8217;re not great, but a word like that can, you know, becomes distorted or gets taken out of its proper place. I know that--.







You know, the film, I did a film on Hazel Dickens, who&#8217;s a wonderful working class singer and songwriter. And her songs that she writes to me are just the epitome of working class feminism. And I just think they describe the lives of so many women and usually have a pretty ass-kicking kind of end, like working class, you know, &#8220;Working Girl Blues,&#8221; like &#8220;take this job and shove it,&#8221; kind of thing, but you know, in talking to Hazel and sort of interviewing her, she definitely didn&#8217;t want to be labeled a feminist, but her whole lifestyle of--. She&#8217;s not married now, and she lives by herself. She's very independent. She very much makes up her own mind and handles her own career and all of those things, and her art, I mean, she is in my mind in every way, but to her that label means something else that she&#8217;s not comfortable. And I think that&#8217;s really sad that we&#8217;ve come to that, and I think that&#8217;s true of a lot of Southern women, women from the country, from rural areas, that they are, they just don&#8217;t--. You know that label doesn&#8217;t feel right, and there&#8217;s no other. There isn&#8217;t another term, you know, or way to describe themselves in a way.   JW:  Yeah, that is what we&#8217;re coming up against almost in every--. [Laughter]  MP:  [Laughter]  JW:  Even women who maybe once did identify as feminist will sort of back away from it, and I think it just, culture wars, I guess, is the name.  MP:  Yeah, yeah, I think that&#8217;s right.  JW:  That the name came to mean something else.  MP:  Right, and there&#8217;s another project I worked on recently with Angie DeBord, who's a storyteller and playwright, and we interviewed a bunch of women in a community right over the mountain here in Cowan. And the idea was to just sit around and tell stories about growing up with a group of women who are sort of middle age, forties and fifties, and then eventually make a play out of it. And we ended up with a slightly older group, but they were great. Of course, they knew each other, but their stories of their mothers were just amazing. Almost every woman in the group came from a family of like anywhere from eight to fifteen children. I mean these were not ancient women. You know, they&#8217;re maybe from forty-five to sixty-five. And they&#8217;re talking about their mother, the work they did, the cleaning and washing without running water, and raising the garden to put food on the table, and all of that. So I guess you would call that a very traditional life, but in my mind, you know, it&#8217;s, I mean it&#8217;s about as, and in some ways, is as much about feminism, feminist-ism, as, you know, anything. It's just not, was not recognized as such.  JW:  It&#8217;s not the 1950s housewife.  MP:  Right, exactly, not at all. These were 1950s and &#8216;60s, you know, here, which was a little different. And I&#8217;m sure, you know, the women, they stepped back for their, when they did have husbands, you know, a lot of the men died, were killed in the mines or whatever, but you know they deferred to them, and culturally that would be expected, but it didn&#8217;t mean who really is the power in the house or who&#8217;s the one whose keeping it all together or making it, making this family grow.  JW:  Well, I have one more question, and then we can sort of wrap up. I wonder if you could say a little bit about the most important moment in your long history here at Appalshop, like what moments really stand out to you, the ones that you&#8217;re really the proudest of?  MP:  Um, well I think that I--. The things I&#8217;m proudest of are the, I think the media work that I&#8217;ve done and the people&#8217;s stories in that work and getting that out and having it as kind of a lasting piece of work that&#8217;s out there, and then, and getting, you know, getting people, getting responses that say it&#8217;s made a difference to them. I actually, with the Buffalo Creek Flood film I did, I got a letter a number of years ago from a University of Hawaii law school class and said they&#8217;d watched the film in class, and they wrote about how much it meant to them and that they would dedicate their careers to making sure that nothing like that ever happened. And then they wrote another letter to the people of Buffalo Creek, and they asked me to send that to them, and they wrote about how brave and strong and courageous they were and they could see their dedication to their community and their place. And that was like--. You know, you don&#8217;t get that stuff written down very much, but that was really rewarding for me. And then we&#8217;re, as the technology is changing, it&#8217;s making it easier to work with people to have them really tell their own stories and be able to do it more themselves just with some facilitating and guidance. And that&#8217;s very satisfying. I&#8217;m working on these, kind of digital storytelling that&#8217;s real low-tech kind of things, but really powerful stories can be made. So I think there&#8217;s so many stories of amazing people standing up and fighting for their families and their communities, and it&#8217;s just a, it&#8217;s a real opportunity to be able to get those out in one way or another.  JW:  Well, is there anything you would like to add or anything else you&#8217;d like to cover before we end?  MP:  I don&#8217;t think so. You know, I--. Whatever my, I definitely consider myself a feminist and have tried to bring those sort of principles into my relationships at work and with other people and in presenting women in my stories as well as I could. So that&#8217;s about it.  JW:  Well, thank you.  MP:  You&#8217;re welcome.
