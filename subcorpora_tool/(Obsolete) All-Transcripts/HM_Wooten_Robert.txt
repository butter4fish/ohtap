Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  Well, my wife is an excellent cook.  And I like--well, her preparation of salmon croquets and I love my chicken and greens.  I think that would be in one of the top dishes that I would enjoy the most.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color?  Well, having been involved in church work for a long time, I've learned, I've grown rather fond of black and white, but more so the black.  I like black because it generally goes with practically anything.  And it's suitable for all occasions except for this, this kind of interview (chuckle) where we're--it's suggested that we not wear black.
Speaker 1: It works.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes, I enjoy Christmas, mainly for the music.  I enjoy the carols.  I enjoy the special music that is done at Christmastime.  And most of my life, I've been involved in some aspect of the church program, and I was always included in the music programs.  And I developed a great sense of appreciation for the music that is appropriate for that type, for that kind of season.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Yes, I would say I like to go to the--out West to Las Vegas [Nevada].  The wife and I generally try to make it there once or twice a year, and we, we really enjoy ourselves there.  We like the shows and the other entertainment that's provided there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have a favorite or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  I would say my favorite saying would be in the form of a scripture, it says--well, I use this as a kind of a daily prayer, I ask the Lord to go before me and make easy, successful my way, my journey, whatever the undertakings are for that particular day.  And I feel that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.

Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side and then your father's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Flora Waits, W-A-I-T-S.  Now, some of the family added to the "e" to it, W-A-I-T-E-S, but on her death certificate, I saw W-A-I-T-S.  And unfortunately, we--I lost my mother when I was about three years old.  But I, my stepmother, who was Bessie Overall, O-V-E-R-A-L-L, and she married my father when we were very young.  And we never referred to her, her as a stepmother because actually I really had very little remembrance of my birth mother.  And--(telephone ringing)
Speaker 1: Okay, so when was your birth mother born?
Speaker 2: When was she born?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I would imagine--to be honest with you, I'm giving you an estimate.  I believe around 1902.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know anything about her side of the family at all?
Speaker 2: On her side of the family?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, I've learned quite a bit about it.  We have reunions, family reunions here of lately.  We've experienced our attendance there.  We've gone to Atlanta [Goergia] several times for family reunions.  These are relatives of my mother, my birth mother.  And speaking with some of the older members of the family, I learned quite a bit regarding her life and the kinds of things she enjoyed, etc.
Speaker 1: Well, what did you learn about her?
Speaker 2: What did I learn?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what did you learn?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I learned that she was an excellent cook, and she was a very pretty lady.  And unfortunately, she left us when she was--right after my youngest brother was born, right after the childbirth of my youngest brother.  And they said that she was very congenial, you know, got along well with the other members of the family.  And most of the things I learned about her were very positive.  I haven't heard anything to the contrary.
Speaker 1: Okay, and her people are in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yes, some parts of Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did anybody tell you how far back they can trace the family, her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, we've gone back several generations.  We had a family tree drawn on one of our handouts at one of the reunions.  And it described very--I felt they did an adequate job in terms of describing the, I'd say, second generation of grandparents for me.  And I learned some of the other relatives that were included on her side, and very meaningful.
Speaker 1: And they're all from Georgia, basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, some were from Cincinnati, Ohio and, but I said, the greater portion of them are still there in Georgia.
Story_ID: 15810
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your stepmother who raised you?  What was she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I would say at this age now, and even when we were coming up, we learned that for a woman to marry a man with 5 children, that took an awful lot.  And that's saying an awful lot, you know, for her to take on that kind of responsibility.  And she was a very smart lady.  She was an excellent seamstress, and she prepared many of our outfits or suits and so forth.  Now, I had 4 other brothers, and this was a big help because I remember, even graduation from elementary school, she made my suit.  And she wasn't, I'd say, the best housekeeper, but she--you'd put her on a sewing machine, and she could really do her thing.  And she proved that by making sure that all of us were looking well when we went to school, church, out to play and what have you.  And one who spent time with the family.  She just loved us, and that's why we never knew--we never used the term stepmother.  We just viewed her--we called her mother.  And many of our friends were not aware that she was not our birth mother until her passing, and this was mentioned in the obituary.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a story about how your father met your birth mother or how he met your stepmother?
Speaker 2: Nothing about--nothing that I can recall in regards to meeting my birth mother.  But my stepmother, I think they met when he was, he was involved in the church there at Mt. Vernon, at 39th and Dearborn [Chicago, Illinois] at that time, Mt Vernon Baptist Church.  And she was a member of the choir there.  And they developed a relationship that blossomed into a marriage.  And here we are.
Story_ID: 15811
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your father.  And can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is John Henry Wooten, J-O-H-N, H-E-N-R-Y, W-O-O-T-E-N.
Speaker 1: And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is January 5, 1898.  And his place of birth was in Georgia.  I'm not sure of the exact city, but I know it was in Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you know very much about his family?  How far can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew his father.  I met his father and his mother.  As a matter of fact, we spent an awful lot of time with our grandparents.  They lived at 41st and Indiana on the near South side of Chicago [Illinois].  And we spent a good portion of our there.  As a matter of fact, I remember many of the childhood things that we did in that particular area.  It's--it was quite an experience down there.  As a matter of fact, when they told us that we were gonna move to Morgan Park, I could only associate park--at that time, park meant only something like a place where you go to picnic and things like that, no houses, no nothing.  And I couldn't imagine that we were going out to live in Morgan Park and no houses and so it wasn't until we actually came out there that I was able--I found some houses.  And I found that this was one of the best experiences that I have ever had, when we moved from 41st [Street] out to 113th [Street].
Speaker 1: And when did you move?
Speaker 2: In 1936.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were about 6 years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about 6 years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, but just going back to your father and his side of the family, are there any stories?  Did your grandparents tell you any stories of the days of slavery or right after slavery or anything like that or about the South?
Speaker 2: They may have shared some of those stories with me, but I just can't recall any now.  None that really made an impact on me.  He was among the older siblings in his family, and he took a lot of responsibility off of his father in terms of helping with the younger siblings.
Speaker 1: This is your father, right?
Speaker 2: My father did, yeah.  And he was a pretty good young from what I'm told.  He was a good churchman, and he had to understand at a very young age that everybody in his house had to attend services on Sunday.  And there were certain activities that we could not participate in on Sundays, afternoon.  You know, Sunday was the day set aside, and we had to adhere to those rules if we stayed in his house.  And we had no place else to stay so we were able to make that adjustment.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, what I can recall, he worked at a company, a factory called B. Heller, some chemical factory.  It wasn't too far from where the, I call it where our family resided.  We were at 41st and Indiana, and I think over near 39th and Calumet or somewhere over there, they had this B. Heller Chemical Plant.  And he worked there for many years.  Later, he came out and he worked for the Board of Education in the janitorial services.  But he only stayed with that for a while.  Then he was encouraged to go into the barbering business.  And that's what he was doing when he passed.  And he was real dedicated to whatever he was doing.  He was a very dedicated man.  He was a non-drinker.  He smoked a little.  I don't recall--he would smoke cigars, I think, but not cigarettes.  And, as I said, no drinking at all and very active in church.  And this I can appreciate to this day.  I tried to bring my family up in a similar fashion, but, and I think was successful.  I'm very proud of--my kids are still involved in the church.  As a matter of fact, they're succeeding me in some of the responsibilities that I had in the past fifty-nine years or so.
Story_ID: 15812
Speaker 1: Tell me about your first childhood memory?  What's the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: I think attending, when I was attending Felsenthal School there at 40th and Prairie [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  It was an elementary school there, and I remember--one of the most vivid experiences I can recall is the teacher had passed out scissors.  We were to clip out some little artwork, and, and that was done.  But one pair of scissors was not turned in.  And at that time, when they said, police, you were really frightened.  And she told the class if, you know, whomever had those scissors didn't turn them in, she was gonna call the police.  And I'll never forget that.  And it was a kind of a situation where you didn't want to be involved.  I, I felt that I knew who had the scissors.  I could see, I knew the fellow had placed them inside his desk.  Well, at that time, you know, you don't rat on people like that.  So I just sat there.  And sure enough, when she went through and searched the desk, she found the scissors.  And the young man was reprimanded for that act.  And it's something that I--well, I learned a lesson a long time--well, as a youngster, you know, honesty pays off.  You know, I had nothing to do with it, but I just happened to know that he had scissors inside his desk.  Perhaps, I should have told the teacher, but that was not my role.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  Now, you say you moved to Morgan Park in 1936, right?
Speaker 2: Thirty-six.
Speaker 1: Now, what was your neighborhood like, and what were the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, having lived down at 41st and Indiana [Avenue], you know, if you are familiar with Chicago [Illinois], there are those buildings that are close together and not a lot of air space.  I can notice when we were coming out here, my parents were still working down in the--my mother worked in the Loop and my father worked at 40th or 39th and Calumet, I remember when we were getting in the car to come home, we were not--I could tell the difference once we hit 87th [Street].  It seemed like the air was much fresher.  And I'd always take deep breaths once you'd get there because there was a difference.  And I didn't know how to attribute it to, you know, (unclear), but it wasn't a lot of homes out here.  But I, I can really, I remem--each time I passed there, I could recall that experience of how the airs changed, the freshness of the air changed when you hit that spot.
Speaker 1: So you noticed it was a lot--the air was cleaner.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot more space.
Speaker 2: And we had, we were able to play in the streets out in Morgan Park.  We played ball out in the street, you know, and if cars would come along, we would, naturally, we would move out of the way.  People were very polite then.  They would honk the horn and everybody would move out the way.  Many times, they didn't have to honk the horn.  We'd see a car coming, you just move over.  Totally different from what you see today.  But I enjoyed the outdoorness that we could enjoy.  We couldn't do this there in the '40's [1940s], at 41st [Street].  Forty-first or the near South Side of Chicago.  It wasn't safe.  Out here, our parents felt very secure with neighbors around us.  Any neighbor could tell to, you know, adjust your behavior and you'd better do this, you know.  No questions asked.  So when the parents weren't there, the neighbors were there.  So we always had someone looking over our shoulders.  And I think this made a big difference.
Speaker 1: An extended family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 15814
Speaker 1: What did you like to when you were a little boy?  I mean what of--what were your favorite things to do?
Speaker 2: Well, I spent a lot of time playing baseball, especially after we moved out in Morgan Park [South side Chicago, Illinois neighborhood].  And we used to get up in the morning, do our little chores and sometimes we'd go out, with permission of our folks.  Sometimes they'd tell us we had to stay in because we didn't do this or that.  But I'd sneak out and those little things like kids will do, get the penalties.  You know, I'd have to pay the penalty for that particular act because, as I said, we had neighbors who would tell--we didn't know they were telling.  But the parents found out, you know, if we were supposed to be in the house, and they'd leave some time, maybe 7:30 in the morning or 8:00 o'clock.  And my oldest brother would be in charge of us.  And we may not, you know, obey him as we should have.  And then we'd go out, sneak out and go playing.  Come time--we knew what time their car would be turning the corner coming home, my parents, and we needed to, you know, get things together.
Speaker 1: Now, were you the youngest brother?
Speaker 2: I was next to the youngest, the second from the youngest.  There were 4 of us, 5 of us.  And we learned then that, you know, that our older brother was the one that we were supposed to listen and follow his instructions and that type of thing.  We had no problems with that.
Story_ID: 15815
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Now, you went to [John D.] Shoop [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], right, Shoop School?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I attended Shoop School--
Speaker 1: Is that where you started?
Speaker 2: No, I started at Felsenthal [School, Chicago, Illinois] down there, but we transferred out here, and I attended Shoop School.  And I enjoyed that experience.  I can recall--well, my parents always instilled within us that we do the best we could.  And I recall having report cards where the teacher was, just knew I was an excellent student.  She'd just give E's even in a blank space down there.  She'd put an E.  My mother'd say, "What is this for?"  I'd say, "I don't know."  But it was just, you know, she knew that I was a good student and, and I received all E's.  And I enjoyed--well, I got a chance--I was doing a little playing there, but as I progressed in school, my piano playing became a little more advanced.  And I played for graduation when I graduated.  We, I recall one number--
Speaker 1: From grade school?
Speaker 2: From elementary school.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I played, 'When you Come to the End of a Perfect Day', you know.  I was learning to play, not only by ear, but by sight reading and what not.  And the experience I had, my piano teacher lived directly in front of me, in front of our house.  And if I feigned illness, I'd have to be ill all that weekend.  See, I'd go to her on Saturday.  If I, I told my parents I didn't feel well, it wasn't that I didn't feel well, but I didn't have my lesson prepared, and I didn't want to hear her.  And I would, if ever I made that kind of admission, I would have to stay in for the full weekend because if--she'd come in and she'd ask me, "Where have you been?"  And, strange as it may seem, she worked for the juvenile home or something, and that in itself, kind of put a fear in me.  Young man, where have you been?  Oh, I--"you're supposed to be sick, and you're out here".  You know, you don't stay sick all your life.  But I can appreciate what she's, what she did for me and that experience, although I couldn't appreciate when I come out--every time I'd come out of the house, I'd look into her house.  It wasn't the best experience for me.
Story_ID: 15816
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of your family life in growing up?  Did you listen to a lot of radio or records and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, when we were growing up, I think it was trend, a family trend to have the youngsters involved in some kind of activity other than just regular academic school work and so forth.  And all of--each of my brothers played a different instrument. They hooked themselves up with something.  Some didn't do anything with it.  Now, my oldest brother fooled around with the trumpet and never did anything with it.  But it was there in the house.  And the second oldest brother, well, he never showed any musical inclination toward anything.  So he was just--but he became a podiatrist.  And the third one, Ernest, he played the clarinet.  And then my younger brother, he played saxophone.  And that's how I picked up the saxophone.  Once--by the time I got to high school, I, I joined the band cause they had nothing for piano, you know.  I could play for the choir, but they had other people there.  So I joined the band, and I did quite well.  The bandmaster thought I was, you know, advancing so quickly do to his teaching, but he didn't know, I had been studying piano all, since I was a little kid, 6 years old.  And I could read well, and many of the questions he'd ask the class, he knew that I'd put my hand up because of my former training.  And I learned to play saxophone quite well.
Speaker 1: Now, this is at Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] when you were--
Speaker 2: At Morgan Park, yeah.  And I was in the beginners' band, the marching band and, well, I went to junior band, I even became a member of Concert Band.  And at one time, I was a member of the jazz band, which didn't (unclear) too much to our being in there.  When I say, our, at Morgan Park there weren't too many blacks at the time, and certainly not engaged in those kind of things.  But he, the bandmaster knew that I read well and my musicianship was up to par.  And he asked me, he says, Bob, I have a chair open, a second alto chair open in the jazz band.  He said, "How would you like to--he said--and it was such a shock to me, a surprise, I said, well, let--he said, "Well, think it over and let me know at the end of the class."  I mentioned it to several, several my buddies.  They said, "Yeah, man, go on in there."  And I ended up in there.  And I enjoyed it.  It had its experiences.  But that's kind of the activity I had with the music department there at Morgan Park.  And I continued my piano lessons the whole time.  I hadn't stopped piano lessons from the time I was in elementary school on through high school.  And then I thought I--when I graduated from high school, I thought I would want to go into another field.  I went to [Cortez W.] Peters Business College [Chicago, Illinois] and I said I'd become an accountant.  Man, I stayed up many nights trying to balance books.  And I said, this doesn't make sense.  I, I couldn't balance the books, and I finally gave it up.  I just don't (unclear) --the typing and other things I could do well, but that accounting, accounts receivable and all that, I said, no, that's not for me.  But I had read where there was a band leader whom I had a great deal of respect for.  I think he, he had a second vocation, and it was in the field of accounting.  And I said, well, maybe I'll do that.  But that wasn't what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I asking, you know, was music a house?  Was there a lot of music around the house when you grew up?  Did you all play the record player a lot or the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, we had one of those vent--what do you call it?  Victorians [ref. to Victrola] or whatever--
Speaker 1: [sic] Virtual?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When you crank it up?
Speaker 2: And we had our share.
Speaker 1: Can you describe how it work cause people don't, who are gonna be watching this tape, will not know what that is?
Speaker 2: The Victoria?
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, it wasn't electric, right.  You didn't have any power?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, you crank it up, and then you crank it for so long.  And then it'll spin.  You put your record on there.  And (unclear) (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: It's an arm--the turntable and an arm.
Speaker 2: Right, and then you're playing, and once it loses all its power, as much as you had cranked up, the music would tend to get slower and slower.  And you knew that you needed to re-crank the box up again.  And we had that type of experience, and we enjoyed that.  Plus, we had the pianos with the rollers where you--
Speaker 1: Player piano.
Speaker 2: --player piano.  And we were forbidden to play that when our parents weren't there, but, you know, kids we did, we did.  And we'd bring other kids over and let them hear it or see it, you know.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you have a radio?
Speaker 2: We had one radio, one radio for the house.  And whatever, whomever was in charge of it--the oldest one, Dannie, got to hear what he wanted to hear.  And we'd have to just go along with it.  And there were certain programs that were family programs that we listened to together cause we didn't have television and all this other stuff.  So we just made out with that.
Story_ID: 15817
Speaker 1: Now you were involved in music all along, but did you think that your career would be music?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I think from the time that I switched from accounting into music, I had made up my mind then.  However, I had been, I was--it was a continuous project for me to do as best I could in the Music field and so forth.  And I was playing--as a matter of fact, that's how I picked up my little side change.  I'd play for a little church that was meeting at, at a funeral chapel not too far from me, in the afternoon on Sundays.  And I'd pick up maybe a dollar and a half, two dollars, which a lot of money then.  And it provided me with show fare, especially when I got into high school and, and you're dating.  You want to take your lady friend out.  That gave you a little money cause my parents, I couldn't go to them and ask them for money for that.  So that was my little sideline.  And I was real fortunate.  When people asked if I would play for their weddings and, you know, things of that sort.  So I picked my little change that way.
Story_ID: 15818
Speaker 1: Now, who were some of the teachers in high school that influenced you?
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: That showed an interest in you or influenced you in some way?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I, I received more encouragement when I was in elementary school.  In high school, you know, I was just almost another number.
Speaker 1: Now, how many black students were at Morgan Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois], I mean relative to the rest of the population?  Was there maybe a third of the school or a fourth of the school?
Speaker 2: I would say about a fourth of the school.  On paper, I know my boss, my former--my last boss when I worked at the district office, he would always, he says, "Bob, how long has Morgan Park been integrated?"  I'd say, "Huh," I said, "on paper for so long, but in reality, ump."  Not even to today.  You know, you go in there, here's a section here; here's a section here.  And no one assigned those sections, you know.  You just go in and you--you have a tendency to sit with people with whom you have things in common with, and you enjoy and that's the way it turned out.  But there weren't a great deal.  And when we, you know, made some of auxiliaries up there or we were able to get into some of the-- those activities that had been set aside for the--it really made a difference.  We stood out.  But in elementary school, I had some people who told me, oh, you're gonna be, you're gonna do well, you know.  And they continued to encourage me.  And even when I had to play for assemblies, you know, like the 'Star Spangled Banner,' they'd pull me out of the classroom, go on up there and place.  Well, at first I was a little fearful of it, but then after I did a few times, I felt very comfortable with it.  And I didn't get that kind of send-off in high cause we had the band and always somebody else to do that.  I think there in elementary school is where I got the biggest boost.  And that elementary school was all Black, all colored at the time.
Speaker 1: At Morgan Park, there's not a lot of interest shown in you then?
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: There wasn't a lot of interest shown in you.  Now, were you involved in social activities in high school?  Did you get involved in student council and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was involved in student council.  I was president of my division, you know, for a couple of years.  And the story behind that is I had to observe--in one of the classes, they were having election of officers.  So right away, I kind of looked around at the room.  And I saw it was an even number of each one.  So I went, and I was selected and a boy by the name of--well, I won't call his name.  He was selected, and we went out in the corridor.  I said, well, the only way they're gonna break this tie is the teacher will have to vote.  But that wasn't what happened.  They called me in so quickly, you know, and called us back in there.  And I was amazed.  I asked one of my friends later on what had happened.  And one of our guys had voted for the other.  And rightfully so, because he had gone to elementary school with this kid.  And he knew him.  He didn't know me, and I didn't know him.  So his loyalties were there.  So that's how I lost out on that first time that I was elected.  But I was, I considered myself quite popular when I was in elementary school.
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: In high school, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: High school, okay, that was good.  So when you got to graduation, did you know where you were gonna go to school, to college?  Had you thought about college?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 15819
Speaker 1: My piano teacher had mentioned the [Chicago] Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois] to me because she had graduated from there.  And I admired her work.  And I went on down there to the Conservatory.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the Chicago Conservatory of Music?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Of music, yeah.
Speaker 2: So this would have been 19--
Speaker 1: I went there in forty--well, I went there in '52 [1952] cause I spent almost 2 years at Peters Business College [Chicago, Illinois].  I graduated in '48 [1948], and I went there I think in '52 [1952] because--I came out in '56 [1956].  But a good experience.  I liked that.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, what was that like?  I mean were there any other Black students at the [Chicago] Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Where, at the Conservatory ? Well, it was mostly, you know, you go--you still continue to study your scales, whatever your major project was or whatever your concentration was.  And then you'd attend classes, and I did well their classes.  Ear training, which was one that was pretty difficult for a lot of the fellows.  I did quite well.  I just--I guess I was born with that innate ability to hear a tune, hear notes and be able to tell you what they are and what--I didn't have to be at a keyboard.  I--you hit a note on the piano, and I can tell you what that note is just like that.  And that was an asset.  Now, I know there were a couple of my buddies who said, man, I, I'll pay you anything to show me that.  Well, I--it's not something you can show people.  And, you know, you'd help them as much as you could, but it's just one of those gifts.  And, fortunately, I had that, and it helped me.  Sometimes it could be a hindrance.  I used to have my-- before she caught on to it, my piano teacher, she'd give me some new material, and I'd say, "Ms. Inniss, could you play this over for me?"  She would play it over, and I'd go home and try to emulate what she had done instead of reading.  So then, she got hipped to it, and she, she wouldn't do that any more.  She said, "No, you go home, and you read and let me hear what you're gonna sound like when you come back."  I said, "Okay, fine."  And that's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, so Ms. Inniss was your teacher there?
Speaker 1: She was my piano teacher, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's I-N-N-I-S?
Speaker 1: I-N-N-I-S-S.  I believe she used two s's.  And at that time, you didn't find a lot of really prepared, you know, teachers of piano; just somebody, you'd go cause if someone could play a little bit and then they'd start you out.  But here was a trained woman, and she really developed my ears.  She'd have me stand there at the keyboard, and I'd sing my little vocal ee's, the exercises.  And then she'd say, what is this note?  I -- my back was to the keyboard, and I'd have to identify those notes.  And I did well.  And I think that was the start of it.  And I continued to develop that ear.  When I got in Ear Training, I was able to bypass certain classes cause I was able to, you know, test out of the Ear Training class and the primary classes.
Speaker 2: Now, Chicago Conservatory of Music is located on the --
Speaker 1: It was, at that time, it was located in the Fine Arts Building down there at 410 South Michigan.  And there was many a day I went there, every day, you know, for four years.  And I'd take the train from Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois].  And I'd go down there.  And many days, I, I'd -- I merely had a train ticket.  My Dad always said, you get your train ticket, you know, when I got my little money.  You get a train ticket so you can get to and from work.  And I had a train ticket, but nothing else, no, no lunch money.  No nothing.  And I used to come down to Van Buren from LaSalle -- I'd walk over to Michigan, and in walking over to Michigan, there was a restaurant there.  I'll never forget it.  I'd pass there, and I'd see those people eating those hot dogs.  Sometimes they'd sit in the window, and I'd pass there twice.  I'd go back around and come around just to see --
Speaker 2: Just to look at the people.
Speaker 1: Then the time came when I was able to purchase a hot dog.  And I'd get -- I went there and sat right there in the window and ate my hot dog like, you know, other people.  But there were many days that I didn't have -- I remember once I had paid my tuition bill.  And carfare wasn't that much, but, you know, I didn't have enough money to get home.  And this is where I really tried my faith because I came out, and I said, I'm gonna walk up and down State Street until I see somebody.  Before I could get to State Street, I had met one of the Deacons of the church.  And I said, hey, I need some carfare.  So right away he just reached in his pocket, gave it to me.  That was it.  But it was so close to Easter time at that time, I thought a lot of people would be down there shopping.  But I didn't get over to State.  I came out of the building there on Michigan, walking toward there, and I saw him.  And he did this for me.  I'll never forget that.  Those kind of experiences, they stick out, you know.
Story_ID: 15820
Speaker 1: Were you attending church during all this time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're still going to church--and were you involved with--well, were you playing with the choir at this point, in church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started playing for the church when I was thirteen and they gave me a little something, you know, they--I guess they did what they could.  But many of them felt that, you know, the Lord gives you the talent, and you're supposed to give it back to him.  I said, okay.  But I was trying to develop my talent, not just what the Lord had given me.  I said--and I--my Dad always taught me, you know, the church, this is your church.  So you, you know, give something.  I did that for a while, but there came a time when my tuition was seven hundred dollars in arrears, and I was offered a job on the South side with a church on the South Side, 51st [Street] and State [Street], Greater Harvest Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], and Reverend Louis Body was the Pastor.  And they offered me--I think I was making, what sixty dollars a month out here at Beth Eden [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois], and they offered me two hundred dollars a month.  So some people said, "No, don't go down there.  That's not your kind of people."  I said,"Huh, this is a door opened for me.  And my mother was a strong supporter.  She said, "Listen, if they want you down there, go on."  She knew what I was facing because I'd go into classes and the instructors would, you know, after taking attendance, they'd say Bob Wooten, Ms. Darendall (ph.) wants to see you or you should see her before you go.  I'd say, okay, I'll see her right after this class.  That was in order for me to stay in there and see what was being offered during that class.  I didn't want to miss too much.  But I didn't see her.  I'd wait, I--you know, that was just a way to prolong it.  And maybe over the weekend, I'd get enough to pay, and then they could take that marker off of my name.  But it wasn't easy at times.  My Dad, you know, my parents were not able to send me to school.  So I had to pay my tuition.  And, now, there was no I had to--I did not have to pay rent or anything of that sort.  I stayed at home for free.  But no tuition.  So that, that helped me greatly at Greater Harvest when they paid the two hundred dollars a month.

Speaker 1: Was there any particular thing that you think was the most important thing that you learned from Chicago Conservatory of Music [Chicago, Illinois] or is there any particular theory or idea that you learned there or technique that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. Ganz told me, he says, it's important that you learn.  He says, you--once you get out in the world, you'll see people, you know, if it's conducting, they might conduct a four, four like this.  He says, as long as you know the correct way, you can deviate from time to time.  But, you know, if ever you're called upon, you can do it correctly.  And that kind of thing, that kind of thinking stuck with me because I found it to be true.  You know, you get out here in the real world, and a lot of times you're beating, beating a four, it may not be the proper way to do it.  But as long as you can get your, the understanding and you know what is proper, if you have to beat out the proper way, you can do it.  But you don't, you can always deviate and still maintain your purpose.
Speaker 1: If you know what you're doing.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, anything else from the Conservatory.
Speaker 2: Well, I learned little things like, if you're accompanying someone--and I was a piano major, if you miss something in this major, you can't go back.  You just have to continue to move forward.  You know, always continue to think ahead or read ahead.  And that, that you've missed, pick it up the next time, if there's a next time.  If not, you've just missed it.  And that, that helped me greatly because I used to, you know, hey, I didn't do so and so back there, but it's too late.  So that kind of thing, it stuck with me throughout my career.  And even when I get involved in rehearsals or working with younger pianists, I can share that kind of insight with them.
Story_ID: 15822
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated from the [Chicago] Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois] in, was it '54 [1954] or?
Speaker 2: In '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six, okay, all right.  So did you start teaching right away?
Speaker 2: I started teaching in '57 [1957].  I -- it took me a little longer because see I -- when I entered the Conservatory, I had this proud thought that I would become a concert pianist.  And it wasn't until my junior year that my counselor called me over.  He says, "Bob, he says I'm not trying to discourage you, he says, but being honest with you, he says, you don't find that many black concert pianists."  And he says, "If I were you, I think I would take some education courses, just as a backup."  And I took those additional courses.  It cost me another year because the girl I was going with then, she told--when I told her I had one more year, she said, uh-uh, no, no.  She couldn't wait.  So she went on and got married.  But --I'll, I'll not forget that.  But it was his suggestion, and I'm glad he did because I spent what?  I spent a good 20 years in public school music.  And I did well.  I enjoyed it.  And some of my former students are still with me with my present choir at the organization that I have now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that shows that they had the stick-to-it-iveness, and they can really appreciate it.
Story_ID: 15823
Speaker 1: In 1949, you founded the Wooten Choral Ensemble?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about that, and how did you manage to do that?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1947, I was--well, I had, I really had I guess a touch of pneumonia or something.  And I didn't completely recover from that.  And that's when I attended this, what they call a Snow Ball at the school --
Speaker 1: And that was in--
Speaker 2: And that was in the jazz band at the [Morgan Park] high school [Chicago, Illinois]
Speaker 1: Well, what is the Snowball?
Speaker 2: It's a dance around Christmastime.
Speaker 1: Oh, a ball.  They named it after the snow, okay.
Speaker 2: And it was all right too.  And I got up.  I, I was determined that I wanted to play at that ball.  I wasn't well, and I'm going out there blowing this instrument, taking what little air or energy I had out of me.  And I had a set back, and I had a hospital stay, at which time I--they had these choirs that could, groups coming into the hospitals to sing to patients and what not.  And I didn't like what they were doing.  I said, "If ever I get out of here, I'm gonna do this."  And sure enough, when I got out, that was one of the things I wanted to do, was take music into places like that where people are confined, can't get out.  And we'd take the music in to them.  And there's a need for this type of thing, even today. And I'm happy to say my son is continuing, you see. We go into the nursing homes and so forth.
Story_ID: 15824
Speaker 1: How many people were with you when you got started?
Speaker 2: I'd say about eight or nine.
Speaker 1: And where did you draw them from?  From the church or--
Speaker 2: From Morgan Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois], from the community because some came from Beth Eden [Baptist Church] and 2 or 3 of them came from neighboring churches out there.  Reverend Woods, Maceo Woods, who has is pastoring here in Chicago, he was a member of the ensemble when we first started.  And, yeah, about 8 or 9 members.  And we did quite well.  Well, we, that number--we grew to be about, oh, anywhere about a hundred 150 people, and surprisingly, and never did we have situations where I would have to call in somebody else to help discipline the group.  When they came, you know, I just let them know we were there for business, and every now and then you'd have one who wouldn't know where to draw the line because some of these were members of my peer group and, naturally, I wasn't gonna be serious all the time.  Sometimes you want to have fun, play with them, but they have to be smart enough to know where to draw that line.  And I found that some of them weren't.  Let's say if you were at a party on Saturday evening and then Sunday, when you get up to perform, you know, they wouldn't be, bring that same behavior there.  And I did meet up with that kind of experience.  But it didn't take long.  I let them know that, you know, this was our focus and--
Speaker 1: Were the members of the ensemble paid--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --for performances?
Speaker 2: No, it's purely voluntary, and there's a--well, later on there's a treasury because we, we were just--we had to go out and sing, and we would--later on when people asked us to do concerts and so forth, then we would affix a fee to it.  And that was put into the treasury.  And that treasury, we had hope, and we still are in the process of granting scholarships to up and coming musicians, church musicians because there's a dearth church musicians.  And we've offered a number of scholarships to people in the Chicago [Illinois] area who have demonstrated their interest in this kind of music.  And we feel that it's working quite well.  You know, they--here within the last ten, fifteen years, they've taken music out of the public schools.  Anytime there is a budget cut or anything, they're gonna make sure the music and art and gym, and some of those things that we need to develop ourselves more, those are the first things that they want to draw--drop from the program.  And presently, well, just recently, I heard that they're trying to initiate a program where they get some volunteers, maybe former teachers, to come in and work with some of the students, you know, because that's an area that many of our youngsters need encouragement.  And they need further training.  And I think all you need do is spend a little time with them.  I have a student now that I'm very proud of.  He's only been with me since February, but I have him doing some things, some little [J.S.] Bach, Inventions, the two-part inventions and [Muzio] Clementi.  And to think that he started in February, the last week in February and I--this is August, he has done tremendously well.  He's playing [Ludwig Von] Beethoven's 'Fur Elise' and other materials.  He picks up hymn books and learned to play hymns.  And I think this is important.  Plus, he enjoys it.
Story_ID: 15825
Speaker 1: You started teaching high school in '57 [1957].  And by this time your group is--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't start teaching in high school in '57 [1957].  I did the elementary school first.
Speaker 1: Oh, elementary, sorry.
Speaker 2: And I taught there for, I guess about four or five years.  And then I entered into the high school music.  I started at Parker High School on the South side of Chicago.
Speaker 1: That's right off of 69th [Street]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eighth and Stewart , and had one of the nicer choirs there in the city at that time, during that time, and had a good parents' group that would--I organized.  I figured in order to have a strong choir, you need that parental involvement.  So we had the parents involved, and we bought new robes cause when I took the choir, they had some dingy-looking faded robes that I didn't like.  And the kids wanted to wear robes.  So we set out in an effort to purchase robes, and we were able to raise the funds.  Even my principal said, "Well, Mr. Wooten, I think it'll take quite a bit of time for you to get--but we fooled all of them."  We did, and we did the same thing with the Ensemble.  We would go out and do concerts and the funds from which would be focused towards the purchase of the robes.  And we were able to get those robes with the carrying cases.  And, well, through the help of the parents.  You know, they had little sales and what not.  And they would certainly encourage us in whatever other ways they could.  And this proved to be one of the greatest impacts that we had on the total school program there at Parker.  And I still say, I'm proud to say I have about 6 or 8 members who were members of that choir at Parker who have joined the Ensemble and been with me ever since.
Speaker 1: Ever since, yeah, ever since the '50s [1950s].  Okay, what would you--now, you matriculated, well, you kind of rose in rank in the public school system to District Superintendent, right, or District--
Speaker 2: Well, I was the District Administrator.  And, fortunately, I was able to service, serve out here in an area that I was familiar with because practically all of my life I spent at Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And when I was assigned as, appointed as District Administrator, it was for District 18, and that encompassed Morgan Park High School, Percy Julian [High School, Chicago, Illinois] and all of the schools that--elementary schools that feed into those two high schools.  They were under our supervision.  And this helped greatly.
Speaker 1: [John Marshall] Harlan [High School, Chicago, Illinois] , and I guess--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Was Harlan in it too?
Speaker 2: Well, no, Harlan was in another area.  No, we just had Morgan Park and Percy Julian.  Now, in that same bracket is the agricultural high school, which is out there at 111th [Street] and Pulaski [Road, Chicago, Illinois].  They reopened that while I was administrator there, District 18.
Story_ID: 15826
Speaker 1: What's been the highlight of your teaching career, I guess and teaching and administrative career?  Or what have been the highlights?
Speaker 2: Well, what I mentioned a few minutes ago, the purchase of those robes and to get the superintendent, who was Dr. Virginia Lewis at that time, she was the superintendent, the district superintendent, she came out.  I had a dedicatory service for the robes at Beth Eden [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] because I knew I could get that church for free, and it provided the kinds of things that we needed to promote that type of service.  And I thought that was a tremendous achievement on the part of the youngsters as well as myself.  And I look upon that as being one of those things that's--you know, people you can't do, but if you have the mind and the focus right, you can do it.  And we did it, and it didn't take that long.  That's one of the factors, but now, there's some other things,  you know, as--when I came out of music and went into administration, I was instrumental in getting youngsters into certain schools that the parents I don't think could have done it without some assistance.  And I just figured that a part of my being there was to perform this role, you know.  They wanted more blacks in there, and I knew the community quite well.  So, and my parents and my brothers preceded me, and all of them, you know, and the fact that we were known.  The Wooten's were out in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], so we had a tendency to be somewhat influential in terms of bringing about changes in the lives of some of these youngsters in the field of education.  And then when I see some of them now-a-days, they say, "I really appreciate what you did for my son.  He's graduated from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] or he's graduated from so and so. And this could not have been, you know, possible had it not been for your intervention in terms of getting him into such and such a school."  And these kinds of things, you can't help but think of them and think on them in a very pleasant manner, some of the accomplishments.  I call them accomplishments because some you almost have to lead by the hand in order to get them to get in there and to the thing right.  But those kinds of accomplishment, and then when I look at, in terms of the, the musical programs that we used to present and the enjoyment that the people would get out of it.  And then when I have students who came to me and he said, you know, were it not for the football team and the choir, I would have been out of this school a long time ago.  But this was--not this is a genuine testimony from one of the fellows who sang with--and one thing I admired about him, every time I'd say--let's say our school day began around 8:00, I had no problem calling early morning rehearsals at 7:15 in the morning and dare them not to be there, cause you know you instill this kind of discipline in them, and you let them know what you're gonna do, and let them know that you care about them.  And, and it's not just as Music teacher, but whatever the, whatever the real problem is or whatever kinds of situations they're in, you're there to offer assistance.  And I think I've been able to share this with many of my students.  And this makes me feel good, especially when you see--and you can seem them in all walks of life.  I went to take my son to the hospital the other day.  He's under treatment.  He's diabetic.  And one of the young ladies there, she said, "Mr. Wooten, how are you?"  And I, and I didn't remember her, but she told me what, you know, the kind of experience she's had.  And a lot of time, they want to compare what's going on today with what went on then, and, well, it was a total difference.  And when you hear some of their comments, some of the ones that you really had problems with, who have finally realized the importance of this kind of thing, it makes you feel good.
Speaker 1: Okay, have you had students to go on to become well-known entertainers or--
Speaker 2: Well, I would not take credit for all that, but I'd say some who have come my way and who have worked with me, and been in the choir when--we had several.  Now, we've tried to instill.  Let me start with Reverend [Jeremiah] Wright up here at Trinity [United Church of Christ, Chicago, Illinois].  He was a member of the Ensemble at one time.  And I have (unclear) well, at the time, he just enjoyed the good singing, and he wanted to be a part of it.  And we were happy to have him as a part of it.  And then there's, there are other people who have done well.  I think I mentioned to you before, Sue Conway was one of my former students.  And Pat Henley and the little, they call them Hutchinson Sunbeams, but they have another name [aka Heavenly Sunbeams], the three girls on the South side.  I forget the name.  They were called the Hutchinson Sunbeams when they were acting with the church, but then they got out and started singing secular music and they made it big [aka The Emotions].  They're doing quite well.  They were--I can't call the name now.  They were Hutchinson Sunbeams, who were Wanda--oh, I can't call the name.  It's been a few years, but--
Speaker 1: Was that a hit group in the '80's [1980s]or '90's [1990s]--
Speaker 2: Oh, I would say in the '80's [1980s], yeah.  And I was quite proud of some of the productions we put on there at [Francis W.] Parker [Public] High School [Chicago, Illinois].  I remember on November 22nd [1963], when [President John F.] Kennedy was assassinated, we had planned--our program was supposed to have been that night--
Speaker 1: In 1963.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '63 [1963].  And I remember we had to cancel it, but when we rescheduled, it just gave us a greater focus, and we were able to convince the audience it was well worth waiting for.  But we've had some wonderful experiences.  And I think when you're, when you're--some of your students come up and tell you this, you know, of their own volition, then I mean unsolicited to offer this kind of comment, that means an awful lot.

Speaker 1: Are all your children musicians?
Speaker 2: Well, out of 3 children, [Bobby, Carol and John Darryl].  Bobby and Carol are still in music.  As a matter of fact, Carol is the music conductor for the [Wooten Choral] Ensemble.  And Bobby is more or less, he trains them and he plays the organ, the instrument for them.  But my youngest son, he took a leave of absence some time ago, and he hasn't rejoined us yet.  But that's one that--he did mention to me once, he said, "Dad, you know, I wish I had kept up with my music," because even when he was trying to do his theatrical work, it would have been so much better had he, you know, been--and if he had had more time with his singing, spent more time with singing.  But he's doing well.  He's part of the theater now, and he's done some nice productions up there at Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And I was very proud of him because he--there was one, I forget, what was the (unclear) there?  I can't recall the play, but he, the Principal said that they had not had anything like that in the past 8, 10 years.  And he was able to come back there and work with the youngsters and do a good job.  So (unclear).  My daughter, Carol, she's now chairman of the music department there at Morgan Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois], something I never dreamed would happen, never because Morgan Park, being Morgan Park.  And she's doing an excellent and very thorough.  And Bobby is director at the Ensemble now.  He's taken on that directorship and Carol assists him in working with the choir.  And my wife was a member of the Ensemble prior to our getting married, and shortly after our marriage, but then once she started having kids, you know, one of us had to be at home.  And she chose to be there.  She's been a beautiful helpmate.  And I'm very proud.

Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite arrangement or a favorite song?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that the title of album, 'Beams of Heaven' is the, that was the first album that we put out.  And that more or less describes my feeling.  And I have an arrangement of 'Close to Thee'.  It's an arrangement of a hymn, but it's published and scored, and they've done--many of the college choirs that come here from down South and out East, they use that number quite frequently.  And I'm very proud of it.  And I dilly dally around with some other things, but I think those are my--two of my favorites.  I hope to have this 'Beams of Heaven' published, our arrangement published within the next few months.

Speaker 1: When you look at the community, the Black community today, what are some of your hopes and concerns?
Speaker 2: When I look at the black community?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, I would hope that some of the music, and naturally, I'm gonna speak about music, that some of the music that we feel that we have been responsible for and some of the legacy that was left here for us, for our generation and for previous generations, that they would capture that type of thing and include it in their works of today.  You know, a lot of times they don't know what happened years ago.  They feel that's not important.  But I think it is.  You don't know--if you don't know where you've been, it's kind of hard for you to discern where you're going.  And, and I notice that there are some people who say well, they weren't living back in that time.  They shouldn't be exposed to that kind of music.  Well, I, I disagree with them.  I feel this way.  You need to know from whence you came and preceded you because much of what we hear today is totally different from what, you know, our music and the ancestry.  And I think the legacy that we, as a black community, have is rich.  And there's so much of it that we're losing, we have lost because of the, I guess, their inability to transfer this kind of information over to the younger people or to this present generation.  And I would hope that in the future, they can just--it's not a matter of deleting anything, but make it inclusive as opposed to, you know, you give people the total program.  I was told at an early age that, you know, especially when you get people to come out to a, even a worship service, not everybody is gonna enjoy the same thing.  So you try to meet the tastes of all your folk during the service.  So that means, you know, we have to be on our toes and think in terms of doing a variety of literature, not just one facet of what we're about or what we hear on the radio.
Story_ID: 15830
Speaker 1: A typical concert where you'd have a mix, what would be included in that mix?
Speaker 2: In the mix? Well, we would try to--we would include, I won't say try.  We would include, we'd do anthems.  We'd do spirituals.  We do hymns.  We do gospel liturgy.  And if we are in a hall where we can do, you know, some secular music, we can do that, you know.  There are a lot of Broadway tunes that have a lot of music, good musical quality to it.
Speaker 1: For instance, what's one that you would think of that would be good?
Speaker 2: Well, the 'Sound of Music'.  I think one of the most beautiful performances we've ever witnessed was our 24th anniversary [of the Wooten Choral Ensemble].  We went to Arie Crown Theater [Chicago, Illinois], and we did--I did as a segment of the total evening program, I did The Sound of Music.  And I had some of my girls dressed in those nun's outfits.  You remember when the nuns wore all the habits and all.  They would dress in the habits.  And we had the spotlights hit them at a certain time.  And even the stage director down there said, this was the first time, and he had been conducting these type of things for a number of years, the first that he'd ever seen anything like that.  So I really, I was really proud of that.  That was the 24th anniversary.  We did the 'Sound of Music'.  And we had the little kids, you know, who were a part of that.  And then the next thing close to that was when we went to--we did it out here at [Percy] Julian High School [Chicago, Illinois].  We did this 'Evening on Broadway'.  Now, there's a lot of good music that, you know, you can hear on Broadway.  We did things like the South Pacific and (singing) "Oh, what a beautiful morning", whatever that is.
Speaker 1: 'Oklahoma'.
Speaker 2: 'Oklahoma', yeah.  And, you know, you just put a whole conglomeration of these things together.  People enjoy that.  You know, not everybody likes to get to where they can get into this, but we enjoyed doing it.  And I think this provided a challenge to the choir to, you know, tackle this type of literature and do a good job.  And we always speak in terms--I, when I say, Choral, I'd speak in terms of four-part harmony, not the three-part, the SAB [soprano, alto, bass] or whatever they--SAT (unclear).  It's always SATB [soprano, alto, tenor, bass] or SSA [soprano, alto], if it's for women only; TTBB [tenor, bass] for the men, and we, we do just a variety.  And we do the gospel literature as well as the spirituals and what not.
Speaker 1: So you go back to the Negro spirituals?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we have one now, one that's my favorite, I consider my favorite.  It was arranged by Roland Carter, the Director of Music at the University of Tennessee [Knoxville, Tennessee].  He's, he was the former Director of Music at Hampton Institute or University now [Hampton, Virginia].  And he has an arrangement of 'In Bright Mansions' and the choir does an excellent job.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you ever do songs from the Civil Rights Movement, some of the songs, I know, Bernice [Johnson] Reagon at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]  and some of those--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, we always include that.  Plus, we have a very, very, very capable narrator.  You can just give her the idea, and she can on and develop it.  And you know it's done in good taste.  And that's so important.  But I had the privilege of going to Washington, D.C. and meeting Ms. Bernice Reagon.  And I have one of her books upstairs.  And it was quite an experience, quite an experience.  And what is that, the Smithsonian Institute [sic, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.], yeah.  And she shared some of her works with, with me, and I enjoyed them.
Story_ID: 15831
Speaker 1: I was asking you off camera about the biggest concerts you staged.  And you said there were some held at Christ Universal Temple [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--
Speaker 1: It's a large facility in Chicago (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: For every, every five years we generally go out or the years intervening between there, we have them at the church.  When I say, at the church, it's at Beth Eden [Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] because this is our rehearsal base and we look upon that as our base site.  But for the, our next musical, which will be the third Sunday in July in 2004, we'll be out at Christ Universal Temple.  And we enjoy going there.  We have a nice working relationship with Mr. Robinson, Walter Robinson, who handles that type of thing.  And we like the accommodations that they have there.  And from time to time, Reverend [Johnnie] Coleman has invited us to participate in some of her services.  They had a, something like a testimony to her.  It was done through music, and we were one of the guests that performed there.  And so the next year's concert, the 55th year of the Ensemble, we will be out there.  And we look forward to that.  But my son has, well, he took the choir over to Moraine Valley [Community] College [Palos Hills, Illinois.].  And they did a concert entitled, "I Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now" or something like that.  And it was excellent.  The boy did a fantastic job.  And he's--not because he's my son, but he seems to be doing better and better.  This past February--we do two major concerts a year, February is what is called the Winter Musical or he has named it the Founder's Day Musical, mainly because in February, there was my birthday.  And that's when I was just starting the [Wooten Choral] Ensemble, they called it the birthday concert.  But now they've changed it to the Founder's Day Service.  And this past February, he did an excellent program.  I, I heard comments from, well, to be honest with you, they, these were some of the seniors.  Reverend Richardson, who was the former Pastor of Metropolitan Community Church [Chicago, Illinois] there at 41st [Street] and King Drive.  He says it was one of the most memorable evenings he has spent in many a year.  Bobby [Robert Wooten, Jr.] tries to include all facets of music.  And he did an excellent job.  The choir did a nice group of anthems, and then they did spirituals.  They did some hymns and then Nathan Carter, a very prolific song writer out of--he's there in New Jersey, I believe--no, where is Hampton?  Hampton [University] is in [Hampton] Virginia.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nathan, he's at that school not too far from Hampton.  I can't call the name.
Speaker 1: Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: No, not Virginia Union.
Speaker 1: Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Norfolk, he's there in Norfolk.  And he's a fabulous conductor.  Well, he recently arranged three hymns and Bob included those, "Oh, For Our Faith" and Nathan Carter, what else is that?  "Great Is Our Faithfulness" and one more.  But I think that type of thing, you know, especially to your older citizens, you don't get this in many of your churches today.  And this is why he said he could appreciate this.  And those kinds of things mean well because, you know, you can't just forget the older people.  They had some lives too.  And now and then I think we ought to, you know, reach back and get some numbers that they too can enjoy and be inspired with.  And this is what he's doing.  Plus, I can appreciate his musical background, his--the boy is tremendous.  He, he's played for any number of artists.  He did a little stint with Lena Horne when she doing her final tributes there in New York.  And he [Keith Sweat] was director of music for Phyllis Hyman, prior to her death.
Story_ID: 15832
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on all the things that you've accomplished, and you've received numerous awards.  And you've had a street named after you here in Chicago [Illinois], I mean what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy would be, I would hope that I would be remembered for providing a balanced musical diet for a large number of people.  I would want to think that I--that was, that was my intent.  I would hope that, you know, through our efforts, that many people were inspired with the musical renditions that we did.  And the lives that I've been privileged to touch, work with.  I certainly would hope that some of this will be remembered.  And it doesn't take long because from time to time, and you hear it from time to time, you've just got to know how to, you know, receive those kinds of comments.  And sometimes they're not always compliments.  Sometimes they might be criticism, but you get both.  And I can appreciate that, both.
Story_ID: 15833
Speaker 1: How would I like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Well, I would want to be remembered as one who was dedicated to his art, the music and, and one who tried to, via his musical renditions, tried to inspire people to better appreciate a nice quality, a good quality of music.  And I think it can be accomplished.  I think--I would certainly hope that I've accomplished some of this when I look back over the years that I've spent.  And dedication is one thing that I think is important.  You know, now presently, I think we're the, we're supposed to be the second oldest community choir in Chicago [Illinois], in the country.  Now, we will celebrate our 55th year next July.  Now, the Thompson Community Singers who says that they're one year older than we are, I'm told that they're doing their final concert before they dissolve the organization next month.  So that would mean that we would be the oldest group, not that we're trying to claim to their group.  We just happen to be, we have been here.  And our music has been consistent.  We have had no breakage there, from '49 [1949] on to--and one of the things I attribute the success of the [Wooten Choral] Ensemble to, is that we've had some church connection.  We don't just sing for programs and things.  We have to provide a Music Ministry for church services twice a month.  And I know when we went to Dr. Martin Luther King, Sr.'s church [Ebenezer Baptist Church] in Atlanta [Georgia], I talked to him via the telephone prior to going down there.  And he said, he said, Mr. Wooten, you know, we don't have these fly-by-night groups coming in.  And I said, we're not a fly-by-night group.  I think at that time, we had been together maybe some thirty-five, forty years.  And so when we got there and participated in his morning worship service, he could tell that, you know, we weren't just one of these groups that gets up and, you know, prepare for a concert and that's it.  But ours is a ministry, and we are part of that ministry.  And so he apologized, but it was only through his hearing the group and seeing their response, participation in the service that he was impressed and led to give that type of compliment.

Speaker 1: This is somewhat of a family photo, my oldest brother, James Wooten with is wife at that time, Ida Wooten, and then--excuse me, yours truly, that's me and then Frances.  And you notice a nice full head of hair there.  And she still has all of her hair, whatever she hasn't had cut off, and then my brother, Ernest and his wife, Warleatha.  And the young man standing there in the front of us is Joseph Wooten, my oldest brother's youngest son.  And he's grown now, so that was taken when he was about seven or eight years old.

Speaker 1: Here is a photo of my youngest brother, Edward Wooten.  Edward was a--he was non-musical, I, I would say, and since he's not here to defend himself, I have no fear.  But he was a good police officer.  If you lived in Chicago [Illinois] and you hung around on the South Side, you knew Edward Wooten.  I mean he held every job there was on the Police force.  And I'd see him in different capacities with the Police Department.  I don't know why, but he enjoyed his work, and most of the people who worked with him enjoyed his companionship.

Speaker 1: This is Frances [Wooten, wife] and myself.  This was taken I'm sure in the early '60's.  We posed for these type of photographs on various occasions.

Speaker 1: This photograph was taken on the day that they renamed Loomis Street [Chicago, Illinois] in my honor.  This was after a church service.  And on this photograph, going from left to right, you have Mrs. Jenkins, the wife of our pastor and (unclear) and then Isaac Wooten, that's my grandson, the youngest grandson, and then Bobby Wooten, III.  He gets a kick out of that cause he can tell people that's his name.  But then yours truly and then my wife who was standing there looking beautiful as ever and Bobby, my oldest son.  And to his left is his wife, Ismati, and their daughter, Rachel and my youngest granddaughter, Alisa.  She would have fits if I didn't call her name.

Speaker 1: If you had known me some forty years ago, you wouldn't have any problem identifying this photograph, but I remember that suit and, my ring, I still have.  But Russell was a photographer.  He initially started working with Valentine Photographers.  And then he set up his own place.  And we've done business with them through the years.  And one reason we stayed with them because they were able to make you look real good.  And we could appreciate that.  And you notice there, I had a head full of brown hair or black hair or something.  There wasn't any gray.

Speaker 1: Here we have a photograph of the Wooten Choral Ensemble.  And it was at a time when they were, we were really doing an excellent job.  I wouldn't dare try to name them for you, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you could start from left (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We'll come back and we'll let you name them.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Yeah, I bet.  But this was taken there at the church, and you can imagine how you, you have to deal with all these--it really brings back very fond memories when I look at the faces of some of these people.  Many of them have gone in different walks of life, but surprisingly, the majority of them are still there with me.  Some are in Virginia now, as I look over this photograph; some are in, in Indiana.  And some are in Texas, Houston, Texas.  A lot of them, I don't--some have gone to other churches, and we miss them.  But basically, I think the nucleus of the choir is still in tact, and we're grateful for that.  These choir members, many of them have had as many as 25, 30 years service with this organization.  And that's something I'm very proud of.
Speaker 2: Is Robert Wooten, Sr. in that photo?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's the first one.  I'm the only one that didn't have a white robe.  I had to have a--
Speaker 2: That's you right here, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with the, with the black chevrons down the front.
Speaker 2: What year was this taken?
Speaker 1: That was taken in 1991.
