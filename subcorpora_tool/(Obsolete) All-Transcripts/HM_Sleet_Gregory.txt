Speaker 1: Now is there a significant story behind the name, Moneta?
Speaker 2: You know, we've tried to figure that out, Larry, and I can't tell you that we have.  We discovered that there was an Italian monk (laughter) by the name of Moneta.  Some people seem to think the name has Native American origins.  We really don't.  My grandfather was a Moneta, Senior [Moneta Sleet, Sr.].  My father was Junior [Moneta Sleet], my son is the third [Moneta Sleet III].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So it's unknown at this time, but it's a family name that's been passed down (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's unknown, yeah, it's been passed along.
Speaker 1: All right.  And, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 8, 1951, born in Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center] in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: All right.  Sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a federal judge.
Speaker 1: All right.  In the District of--
Speaker 2: In the District of Delaware.  I'm a, in other words, I'm a trial judge in the federal system in the District of Delaware.  I happen to be the chief judge of this court [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware].
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in a courtroom.  I think this is courtroom 2B, or it might be 2A, but we're in a courtroom in the United States courthouse, the only court- United States courthouse in Delaware, in the District of Delaware, in Wilmington.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is May the 25th, 2012.
Story_ID: 635691
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food?  I like poultry (laughter).  My, yes, I do actually, I like red snapper, I love red snapper (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the spring is, leading into the summer, yeah, but springtime, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, many years, Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  That's--was my parents' [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] destination.  They honeymooned there, and we went there many times as children and family, and kept it up while I was married with my two children [Moneta Sleet III and Kelsi Sleet], and have kept it up to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I probably have a number of them, pet phrases.  No- nothing comes to mind immediately.  (Laughter) Can I reflect on that a little?
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: If you think of it (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, if I, if it comes to me, yeah.
Story_ID: 635692
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) and your father's [Moneta Sleet] side separately.  Then we'll put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Juanita Harris was her maiden name, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, H-A-R-R-I-S [Juanita Harris Sleet].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother's passed.  She was born the 29th day of October, okay, 1927--I think that would be.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Well, I believe, generally speaking, it was Lynchburg, Virginia, but probab- probably, more accurately, Davis Creek, but let's say Lynchburg.  That's where she hail- hailed from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's near Lynchburg.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's near Lynchburg, and I suspect she was actually born in Lynchburg, but I'm not altogether certain on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was she raised in Davis Creek?
Speaker 2: Well, partially, and Lynchburg, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about the family history on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, I, you know, I'm, as we were discussing a few moments ago, Larry [Larry Crowe], I'm an awful historian in that regard.  My sister's [Lisa Sleet] the much better (laughter) individual to talk to about this.  It was, it was a group of family called the Clarksons, C-L-A-R-K-S-O-N-S, on my mother's side.  And, you know, I can't take you very far back at all beyond, except to my mother's siblings actually, Uncle William [William Harris] and my Uncle Mansfield [James Harris].
Speaker 1: Now, as far, well, let me ask you like this.  Are there any stories in your family that are passed down to indicate that they were from some other place other than that part of Virginia or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there's, yeah, there's a suggestion that my grandmother, my mother's mother, Ruth [Ruth Clarkson Brown], married a full blooded Cherokee [William Harris].  And well, there's more than a suggestion--she did, and now, I don't know where he came from.  I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was Virginia or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't know if she lived in Virginia or--
Speaker 2: My grandmother did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I just don't know where she met her husband and I, you know, unfortunately, don't know very much about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any stories passed down through the family about the emancipation or Reconstruction or any of those kinds of--
Speaker 2: No, like where were people of that and things of that type--not really, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: About the founding of churches or schools or anything of that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, my Uncle William was a builder in Lynchburg and built any number of churches.  I've actually seen some of them that are still in use to this day.  But you mean in terms of church, churches that the family attended or--
Speaker 1: Or any, any, you know, kind of institution or like that, you know, just, well, so did, so you knew your, did you know your grandmother, Ruth?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandmother actually died in her bed in my parents' home in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you know your grandfather?
Speaker 2: I--not on my mother's side, no, I did not.  He, I'm told, was actually shot to death in an incident many years ago.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about it you can tell?
Speaker 2: Well, it's--
Speaker 1: I mean, 'cause this is about a story.  It's not exact (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there's a story that perhaps it may have involved another relationship of some kind.  And there may have been some jealousy involved and it--it's all very vague.  But I can tell you that as I watched one day my grandmother recount the story at, I don't know, it was a breakfast table or where we were sitting.  She, even after all these, all those years, still teared up at there, at the telling.  And I only have the vaguest recollection of it.  I was rather young at the time.  But I take it that there was a tragic--a tragedy that resulted in him being, being murdered actually.
Story_ID: 635693
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] say, or did she talk about growing up in, in, near Lynchburg [Virginia] and Davis Creek?
Speaker 2: And Davis Creek?  Well, yeah, she would talk about, you know, the rural nature of things.  I've seen photographs of my mother as a young child with her dog, and she certainly did, in general terms, talk about her, the fact that she thought she had a good upbringing.  She enjoyed her life there, and felt safe and secure, and a lot of family.  And, you know, part of her rearing was on a, they lived on a farm.  And I don't know the size or anything of the farm or the exact location and--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --and partially a city rearing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: Did they own their own land?
Speaker 2: I believe they did, I believe they did.  That land, I don't believe has survived in the family, I don't think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother go to school down there in Davis Creek?
Speaker 2: She did.  She went--I believe she went to school in Lynchburg.  I mean, I remember, speaking of land and family, there is an uncle on my mother's side, John [John Harris], and I don't know Uncle John's what, his last name was, but I have really fond memories of summers that I and my--well, my brother [Michael Sleet], my--I don't think my sister [Lisa Sleet].  Well, she might have been an infant, a time when we went down there once.  And I believe it was Nelson County, Virginia, where Uncle John owned a very substantial number of acres.  I'm--my recollection is that it was in excess of seven hundred.  And I used to spend time there as a child at times in diapers, and then, as I got a little older, running around with my cousins.  I have a great, for some reason, I can remember one day when I was out in the, in the yard.  And I climbed a fence into one of the pastures, and a bull got sight, got, sighted me, and took out after me, and chased me up a tree.  And my Aunt Cammie [Cammary Harris Banks] came out and heard me yelling for help (laughter) and shooed the bull away.  And I got down out of the tree, but there were little things like that.  I remember sitting on the porch with my Uncle John.  And he was a--I believe, and I believe I'm told he was a, had a substantial amount of Native American or Indian blood in him.  He almost had a red, brownish complexion, very ruddy complexion, tall, erect, very erect, distinguished man, but who, not but, but I remember his farm outfits, his bib overalls, and his boots.  He was a farmer and, so I have, you know, scattered remembrances of those times.  I remember going down one time when I was older for a funeral.  Tragically, a couple of my aunts and, again, my memory doesn't serve me well here, were tragically killed in an automobile accident on one of the interstates.  They were travelling somewhere, and a tractor trailer jumped the lane.  And I remember going to see the car, you remember back in the day, cars used to be very substantial.  This was an Old- I think it was an Oldsmobile, and it was a big sedan, it was all metal and it was just crushed.  And you knew that nobody could have come out of that alive.  My parents didn't allow me to go to the funeral.  I remember that.  I stayed back with another cousin.  We were old enough to stay alone, interestingly enough, but my parents, for some reason, didn't want me to attend the funeral.  It was my Aunt Jessie [Jessie Harris Powell].  So I have these--the other clearest memories I have of my time in the Lynchburg area, Nelson County, were great times that I spent with my cousins, my, the children of my mother's oldest brother, youngest brother, William [William Harris].  And he had a lot, I had a lot of cousins (laughter), and we used to stay in the house.  And my parents would go down to see my grandmother [Ruth Clarkson Brown].  She lived, actually in a trailer.  She had remarried a gentleman by the name of--all I knew him by was Reverend Brown.  He was a, was a minister, and actually lived in, you know, one of those trailers that you could pull with a truck, but it had been taken off the wheels, and made permanent in its location.  And I used to much prefer to stay back in Lynchburg (laughter) with my cousins, and where we would have a great time and I'd get to sleep upstairs with them.  And we just raised all kinds of heck and, and hell (laughter), and it was just generally a really fun time, a very happy time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother continued to have a lot of relatives down there for years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, still does, just, we just lost my Uncle William's wife, my Aunt Katheryne [Katheryne Dickey Harris] who was eighty-eight, just passed last week.
Story_ID: 635694
Speaker 1: Now did your mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] finish high school in Lynchburg [Virginia]?  And (unclear).
Speaker 2: She did.         I believe, you know, I believe my mother went to Garfield high is my recollection, G-A-R-field, F-I-E-L-D--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --high school.
Speaker 1: Garfield--
Speaker 2: No, you know, let me, let me, let me revise that, no, now, I remember.  It was Dunbar, Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School for Innovation, Lynchburg, Virginia] that she went to, D-U-N-B-A-R, I guess.
Speaker 1: She would have been there during segregation?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, I believe so, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that is probably, that was the black high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe it was, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So did she go on to college?
Speaker 2: She went on what used to be known as Hampton Institute [Hampton, Virginia] which is my alma mater as well.  Of course, now, as you know, they changed it to Hampton University.  It was Hampton Institute when I finished.
Speaker 1: And what did she aspire to do like--
Speaker 2: To teach.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother became a teacher.  She taught, she taught, as I recall, physical education.  She taught home economics, I believe, at some point and health.  No, she didn't teach home economics.  She taught health and phys ed, I think.
Story_ID: 635695
Speaker 1: So I'm going to stop here with her [Sleet's mother, Juanita Harris Sleet], and I'm going to go to your father's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Moneta, M-O-N-E-T-A, John Sleet, Jr. [Moneta Sleet].  Now my father never used his middle name, so he was always known as Moneta Sleet, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born on Valentine's Day in 1926 in Owensboro, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's in western Kentucky.  Now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not far at all.  I can, you know, I can tell you a little bit about my grandfather and my grandmother [Ozetta Allensworth Sleet].  We did travel to Kentucky several times.  As you pointed out earlier, it was during the period of segregation.  I remember traveling out there.  It's a long drive from New York in the blue and white '57 [1957] Ford--me and it was most likely my brother, Mike, Michael [Michael Sleet].  And I remember, I have vague remembrances of not being able to go into restaurant facilities.  I didn't exactly equate it at the time, but I remember stopping along the way at roadside stops.  You know, there might be a picnic table there, there might not.  I remember great chicken sandwiches (laughter) with the chicken in between two white pieces of bread, you know, and just, it was, it was a, yeah, the food was good because you were starved by the time your mother let you stop.  Either they stop driving and eat, you know, well, she, you know, she'd let you eat a little bit along the way.  But I, and I remember, I seem to remember the bathroom situation was different for us.  And, you know, I think it was only about two times, two or three times, that we, maybe, that we went out there to Owensboro.  My grandmother and grandfather came back to New York once or twice to visit that I recall.  I remember sitting out on my granddad's knee one, for some reason, one summer in the, in the yard out at where we lived in Roosevelt at the time, Roosevelt, New York.  This was on Long Island [New York].  And he was a, he was a, he was a large man, he was tall, my dad was tall, my dad was 6'2".  And his dad was tall and, but--
Speaker 1: So this is Moneta Sleet, Sr.?
Speaker 2: Senior, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Moneta, Moneta Sleet, Sr., okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 635696
Speaker 1: He spent his life in Owensboro [Kentucky] basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, but, yes, he did.  I think at some point, they went to Paducah, Kentucky.  I'm trying to remember when that happened, but my [paternal] grandfather [Moneta Sleet, Sr.] attended, I suspect, schools in Owensboro, I think, and he's a college man.  He's a four year, had his four year degree, and you're going to ask me where he graduated from, and I'm not going to be able to tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now this is your grandfather?
Speaker 2: This is my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Grandfather, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he was, he was, he was an unusual man in that respect.
Speaker 1: So, he had a four year college degree?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, but you're not sure where.  Did, do you know if there is any stories about him going outside the State of Kentucky or--
Speaker 2: I--no, I don't remember, like, you know, again, I actually, if I, I wish and probably should have boned up.  I could have called my sister [Lisa Sleet] (laughter), and she probably, she's a better source of this kind of detail.
Speaker 1: Interestingly enough, my grandfather grew up in Princeton [Kentucky] which is not too far from Paducah or Owensboro.
Speaker 2: Is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he actually became a teacher, and went to Paducah industrial school [West Kentucky Industrial College; West Kentucky Community and Technical College, Paducah, Kentucky] which no longer exists.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: It's a black college [HBCU] there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for, at least for teaching degrees for normal school degrees.  I don't know if they went four years or not, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's something you may want to check.  It took me a long time to figure that out, but it's Paducah industrial school.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was--
Speaker 2: I will.  I believe my granddad was a business administration major.  I think he might have done that, and he worked, I believe, in that field at a college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I just don't, can't tell you where.
Speaker 1: Now, around there, the only school, college, I think, was that Paducah industrial school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was that the only, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, close by, anyway, around that, in that western Kentucky area.
Speaker 2: Something seems to make me remember that he used to travel to work a distance and actually may have stayed away and come back on the weekends.  So I don't think that he actually worked in the area.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you think Kentucky State [Kentucky State College for Negroes; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] maybe (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It might have been Kentucky State.  It could well have been.  My dad [Moneta Sleet] was a Kentucky State grad.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Kentucky State would have been a little hike, but it's possible.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it is possible (laughter).  These are, yeah, things I should know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this is, a lot of people don't, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Don't feel bad.  So, all right, so your grandfather now, he had, he was a business administration major?
Speaker 2: I believe so.
Speaker 1: And, so he worked at a college--
Speaker 2: I believe he did.
Speaker 1: --business, some business related--
Speaker 2: Field, yeah, area, yeah.  Some- something to do with college, with the administrative part--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --of the college's operations, I believe.
Story_ID: 635697
Speaker 1: So did your father [Moneta Sleet] basically grow up in town and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, yeah, I think so.  That's probably a good way to describe it.
Speaker 1: So many people were out in the, you know, farm areas.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he wasn't a farm boy as I recall.  He grew up in town.  And I'm trying to remember where he went to high school because, actually, several years ago, I can't remember exactly how many.  Oh, it's been, it was after his passing, before my mom [Juanita Harris Sleet] died, so it must have been in the early '70s [1970s].  The early '70s [1970s], the City of Owensboro invited me and my family. Could we hold just for a second?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Sure.
Speaker 2: Can we go ahead now?  The City of Owensboro invited my family to come out.  They had a day for my dad.  And they revealed or unveiled, you know, those historical markers that you see around cities and places from time to time.  So there's an--actually a historical marker with the outlines of my father's life in front of the house where he grew up in Owensboro, and it was a very lovely--my mother and I went--very lovely day in Owensboro, Kentucky.  You know, they showed me a number of photographs.  They had set up a display.  And, so my father was apparently a pretty good basketball player in high school and showed him, actually taking a foul shot in a game, and other photography of him, and it was a very special day.
Story_ID: 635698
Speaker 1: I'm just going go back and ask about some more about ancestors, but we'll talk about who your father [Moneta Sleet] was--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --real specifically, so people will know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm not going to skip that, okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, sure.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just saying--so there--
Speaker 2: So ancestor wise?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Ancestor wise, people I came to know on my father's side of the family, of course, were my grandfather [Moneta Sleet, Sr.] and my grandmother, Ozetta, O-Z-E-T-T-A, Sleet [Ozetta Allensworth Sleet].  I don't really know my grandmother's origins too much.  I can tell you that she was very fair skinned like me, beautiful woman, with very straight black hair, long black hair.  And that's about as much as I can tell you (laughter).  Some might look at her and surmise that she was of mixed parentage.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: So was she basically a housewife and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I believe that's true.
Speaker 1: Now did your father come from a large family?
Speaker 2: No.  It was my dad and my Aunt Emmy Lou [Emmy Lou Sleet Wilson].  And you asked me to spell Emmy (laughter), E-M-Y [sic.], I think is Emmy Lou, her, she lives in, now lives in, outside of Detroit [Michigan], a place called Hamtramck [Michigan].  She, Aunt Emmy Lou is probably around eighty-four or so.  And she was the younger by a couple of years.  And Aunt Emmy Lou was a university grad, as well.  I don't remember what school, but she had a career as a librarian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's Emmy Lou Wilson now.  She married a fellow by the name of Wilson [Warren Wilson].  And I don't, they, I don't know if he passed on or they divorced, or whatever happened.  I never really knew him, don't even know if I met him.  And I have, I have, I have a cousin by that marriage--Valerie, Valerie Wilson, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any stories about the ancestors--I mean, your ancestors beyond your grandfather?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are.  I don't, again, I'm a poor source.  You know, there's a place in Kentucky called Sleettown.  And I think you can look it up (laughter), and there's a family reunion that takes place out there, I'm told, somewhere.  I've not yet attended.
Speaker 1: Now, is this a black town pretty much (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Or was it--
Speaker 2: Yes, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I understand it, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now I don't know if it is recognized as a municipality, you know, with its own government, and that kind of thing, I don't know that.  But I got a brochure, actually was sent to me by some relatives out explaining that it's down in my, up in my office somewhere, telling me about this place called Sleettown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I know a few years ago, the State of Kentucky started recognizing these early black settlements and doing things that--
Speaker 2: And allocating some money, yeah, and I think this was one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Sleettown, Kentucky.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, this is, so there may be a story there that goes back a little, you know, maybe to the Civil War and beyond--
Speaker 2: Oh, I think so, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's discussion--I believe in the pamphlet and the brochure about the origins of the family.  And I think they do date back, as I recall, to the Civil War--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and beyond.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 635699
Speaker 1: Now in terms of your dad [Moneta Sleet], he is, you know, was a, he won the Pulitzer Prize for photography.
Speaker 2: He was first African American to do that.
Speaker 1: Can you maybe just kind of walk us through, like how he got started in photography, and what he's, what his career was so we can know who, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me see if I can give you the broad strokes as I understand them.  The story goes that I don't know it was for his birthday or Christmas gift, he was given a boxed camera, a Brownie, you know, those brown box Brownie cameras.  And he began to take photographs with it and just fell in love with the hobby.  He developed a hobby of taking pictures and photographs and, but I don't think, I don't think, I don't know whether he, at that point, formed the intent to study photography.  I don't know if he could even do that, or if he had it in his mind to do that.  I doubt it.  And I don't think granddad [Moneta Sleet, Sr.] was going to be particularly supportive of that anyway (laughter) as I understand it.  He wanted him to get a degree that would, he wanted him to go to college.  That was not from my grandfather a discussion.  And it wasn't going to be photography that he was going to study.  So, my dad, in fact, did go on to Kentucky State [Kentucky State College for Negroes; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] after finishing high school and--
Speaker 1: Now do you know what high school he went to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I should, I should remember it from the trip out there, but I don't.  That's information I could, I could get for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he went to Kentucky State?
Speaker 2: He went to Kentucky State, and I believe he was there for two years before he got drafted.  This is World War II [WWII] and got drafted to serve.  I believe he served over in India, primarily was when, it was a theatre that he served in theatre war.
Speaker 1: In India?
Speaker 2: Was it India?  I'm--not India--Burma [Myanmar].
Speaker 1: Oh, Burma, okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Burma.  I did say India, didn't I?
Speaker 1: So, it's--
Speaker 2: And what makes me remember Burma is that he used to talk about being out on the Burma Road which, as I understand, it was a pretty infamous and treacherous supply line, I guess it was, strategic road of some kind.  My dad was a supply officer, you know, that--well, President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] hadn't yet desegregated, I don't believe at the time of his service, the armed services.  And they didn't allow all that often, black troops to serve in combat, and lie in combat positions, so he was in a supply unit.
Story_ID: 635700
Speaker 1: Where was I?
Speaker 2: You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he [Sleet's father, Moneta Sleet] was serving in a supply unit, and finished out his service, was honorably discharged.  I think he was a staff sergeant or something like that when he finished, if there's such a rank, but he was a sergeant.  And--
Speaker 2: Oh, he was a sergeant, so he wasn't, he was, okay, so he was in charge of supplies, but he wasn't a--
Speaker 1: He did--
Speaker 2: He was still an enlisted man, he didn't go to officer candidate school or anything like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, he was drafted.  He was a--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But then he returned to Kentucky State [Kentucky State College for Negroes; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky], finished his degree.  His--continued to, apparently continued to have the interest in photography.  I think he, too, finished with a degree in business.  And then, somewhere along the line, he meets--I think it was Professor Williams, I think it was John Williams [John T. Williams].  I'm probably getting this wrong--from Maryland Eastern Shore, I don't know, Maryland State College, Maryland teachers college, but it's now I think Maryland Eastern Shore [University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland], who shared his love of photography and was an avid photographer and invited my dad to come up there and help him establish a school of photography.  I think the gentleman I just mentioned went on to become the president of that college or university.  So dad did that--I think it was along about that time he met my mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] who was in Maryland--I believe, teaching.  After having graduated Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], this would have been in the late '40s [1940s].  And they got married and from there, moved on to New York, New York City [New York, New York].  My dad went to, went to--well, he went to work.  I think the first, as I recall, I think one of his first jobs was at the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News].
Speaker 2: Now is that why he moved to New York to work for Amsterdam News, or was it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  My godfather, Harvey Russell [ph.], R-U-S-S-E-L-L, I believe, from Kentucky, from Owensboro, older, older gentleman than my father, but my grandfather [Moneta Sleet, Sr.] contacted Harvey Russell, as I said, was my, became my godfather, and told Harvey that my parents were coming on up.  Please look out for them.  He did more than that.  They moved in with Harvey and his family and his wife.  And my dad, I believe, I don't know the chronology of this, went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] to get his master's [degree], and also study photography--I believe at the modern school of photography [School of Modern Photography, New York, New York].  I think that's what the place was called.  He actually--his first job in news, in the news business was, I think, in Amsterdam News, but not as a photographer, but as a writer.  I think he was covering sports, I think he covered sports.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he had a journalism, he took journalism courses (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he took journalism courses at night.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I--we, for the longest time up until very recently, thought that he had actually gotten his master's in journalism.  But at the time, we've since learned NYU didn't have a master's in journalism.  My father was just honored by the school when they celebrated their, they've just celebrated their hundredth anniversary, a centennial, and I was contacted, and my sister [Lisa Sleet] and I were contacted.  And they advised us that they had decided that they couldn't honor each of the graduates, so they were going to, they had selected one to stand for all, and they had selected my father.  It was at that time that they, in their research, that they learned that he actually didn't have a, technically a master's in journalism, though he'd taken a lot of journalism courses because they didn't have a master's in journalism, so he had a master's.  And then, he went to work for Our World magazine, which was a predecessor of Ebony.  It was a Life, Ebony type, Look, you know.
Story_ID: 635701
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he [Sleet's father, Moneta Sleet] worked for Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News] then he, then he got a job with Our World (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our World, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now did he do these simultaneously, or did have to quit one to do the other or--
Speaker 2: I think when the opportunity at Our World came on, I think he went there.  I don't think he was doing simultaneous jobs.  I don't think he was working two jobs--I don't believe.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, I'm trying to figure, I guess, I don't know if there's a person, even now, that can be--you can work for, as a freelancer, for a lot of different people, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a staff photographer probably.
Speaker 1: Staff for Our World magazine.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this isn't a Johnson publication, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, as I recall, it was, preceded John- Ebony, Johnson publications [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't know who founded it.  It--I actually have seen the magazine.  It published, I don't remember how long, but it went out of business.
Speaker 1: It was headquartered in New York [New York] then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been headquartered in New York.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Had you heard of the magazine?
Speaker 1: I vaguely remember hearing this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But I've never, I can't think I've seen one, I don't think I've seen one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it existed.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm going to look for that, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Our World.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's Our World magazine.  Do you know who is involved with it at all?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no, I really don't (laughter), except to say, I'm reasonably sure that it wasn't, it wasn't John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].  I think that story is told differently, that he started that, that publication with five hundred dollars, or whatever it was, a loan from his mom [Gertrude Johnson Williams] or something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: He sold the furniture.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sold, yeah, and so, I don't think he was connected with this operation at all.  And my father was, I believe, one of the first staff photog- well, first photographers hired on or that went to work with Mr. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Our--so Our World magazine, but it didn't last.  How long did it last?
Speaker 2: It didn't last--I don't think it lasted long at all.  I, you know, whether it was a matter of months or years.  I don't think it was long.
Speaker 1: And what did he cover when he worked for Amsterdam News in terms of--
Speaker 2: Amsterdam News, I think was sports.
Speaker 1: Sports and, you know, did he cover any big sports events like Joe Louis fights and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't (laughter), I don't know, Larry [Larry Crowe] (laughter).  He prob- You talk--I would imagine Amsterdam News would have been interested in that stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know where that took him, you know, 'cause when you take him, you're a photographer and a sports reporter, you can--it could take you to a lot of different places.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.  And you, what you're making me wish, and then we wished it long ago is that, is that we had sat down with my dad, and put a camera in front of him, and done this, had this kind of discussion that you and I are having.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know who's left between Isaac Sutton and the other, G. Marshall Wilson and--
Speaker 2: G. Marshall is gone.  I believe Mr. Sutton is gone.  There's some others that knew me as a child that are gone.
Speaker 1: Ellis T. Finley [ph.], I think that's one.  There's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I believe, yeah, you know, [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett's still with us, I believe, was my, you know, the editor, senior editor of Ebony.  And there are others, but I don't, (laughter) oh, boy, there were a lot of old, that generation of photographers that I came to know a little bit that, who came to dad's funeral.  Mr. Callender [Rupert Callender], who I knew growing up, and I'm--the first name is escaping me, was a freelancer.  And I believe made contributions to Johnson and other publications, not just black publications.  Howard Bingham, you know, the great photographer, who is actually Muhammad Ali's personal photographer.  And Howard and I have struck up a relationship since my father's death and we maintain periodic contact on the phone.  He's out in California.  And there were others.  Of course, there's [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks who was a contemporary and at the same time, a mentor, I think, as I understand it.  My father might disagree with me--wrote a lovely introduction to the book ['Special Moments in African American History, 1955-1996'] that Johnson published of my father's work--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --some of my father's work, yeah.
Story_ID: 635702
Speaker 1: At what time did he [Sleet's father, Moneta Sleet], did he go from Our World then to, from the demise of that magazine to Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I believe so, I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So this would have been what, about what year, you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, it must have been around the time I was born probably in the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, I was born in '51 [1951] so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had to have been around that time.
Speaker 1: Anybody can look this up and find that the (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we were living in the South Bronx [Bronx, New York] at the time.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) starts working for Johnson--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Publishing?
Speaker 2: I think they could.
Speaker 1: So did Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] use him primarily as a New York photographer, East Coast photographer?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you mean throughout his career or initially?
Speaker 1: I guess, initially and then--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --then, did he move at one time to Chicago [Illinois] or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, my father was always based in New York [New York].  As I understand it, always worked out of 30 Rockefeller Center, or Rockefeller Plaza [30 Rockefeller Plaza], whatever the correct address is.  They still, of course, have offices there--I believe.  And if it's not 30, 30 Rockefeller, it's the, an adjacent building.  I remember going there many times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  30 Rock as people call it now, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, as people call it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I take it, that's probably what he was, you know, did he have--so he probably shot the New York, you know, scene pretty much but--
Speaker 2: Well, you, well, that may have been initially and what, why I hesitated was because I don't know the extent of the magazine's operations initially, but as you know, it, they grew to cover global events.  So, my father travelled extensively around the world and the, and the country as well, covering news events and other types of events including fashion photography for Johnson Publishing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was this enough, was there enough work--at Johnson, is well, frame it this way, he's notorious for, you know, he's tight.  He's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pinching a penny, yeah.
Speaker 1: So was there enough work at Johnson for your father to, you know, have a full time job, be comfortable, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, apparently, yeah.  He raised three kids and we, he was able to get us out of the South Bronx which was a good thing.  It was, we were in a tough neighborhood.  When I was about six, I think, is when we moved out to Long Island [New York], a place called Roosevelt [New York], famous for a couple of other people.  And my dad, Julius Erving, Dr. J, and Eddie Murphy and Howard Stern (laughter), all came in, interestingly enough, from this little, little town called Roosevelt.  And, so I think the answer to your question is yes.  He was paid a livable and sustainable wage enough, so that he was able to raise and educate his kids.  You know, I'll tell you frankly that my mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] had, at various times, encouraged him to look for other opportunities, and take them when they presented themselves.  For instance, while my dad won the Pulitzer Prize in '69 [1969], a number of people came calling.  I think people, organizations who had called on him before like Time, Life, and others.  My father never explained to me 'cause I encouraged him, as well.  He was basically, you know, I was, he was old school.  I was his son.  I didn't have any place in that discussion.  And, so I never really understood my father's reasoning, except to say that I felt, feel that he wanted to work for a black publication, that he felt that he was able to do the kind of, cover the kind of stories, kinds of stories that he would not get a chance to cover, that would not be the primary focus of other publications.  So, I think that's why he stayed.  It wasn't for the money (laughter), as I understand it.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he did okay.  That's--
Speaker 2: He did okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  You wonder sometimes, like when people can make doing these gigs in different settings and stuff, and you wonder, you know, and hear stories.  But--
Speaker 2: He didn't get rich (laughter).  We'll tell you.
Speaker 1: Johnson was, from what I understand, was a lot better though than the Defender in terms of pay and, you know.
Speaker 2: The Chicago Defender?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I've heard a lot--we've interviewed photographers that've worked, you know, as stringers for the Defender, and worked for the Defender.
Story_ID: 635703
Speaker 1: Now your dad [Moneta Sleet] covered a lot of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: And for one of the pictures he shot in Atlanta [Georgia], he won the Pulitzer Prize.
Speaker 2: Yes, the photograph of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now tell--
Speaker 2: Mrs. King [Coretta Scott King] with Bernice [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King] in her lap, inside the church, Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] on the day of the funeral, yes, at the funeral.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], yeah.
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968], yes.
Speaker 1: Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] funeral--so how did that kind of change your life growing up?  I mean, did you realize how good your dad was until--?
Speaker 2: My dad was there, and we know it was an important event.  I was old enough by now.  I'm in high school by this time, and I knew what the Pulitzer Prize was.  I know it was a big deal and I knew when they sent the photographer to take a picture of the family when, you know, Columbia University [New York, New York], I think, sponsors the prize or sent someone out to do that.  But, you know, how kids are, we're inwardly focused I was, no different in this regard, and I was focused on my life and what I was doing.  And, so I was proud of my father, but I don't think it was until much later that I began to really appreciate his accomplishments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanted to get that out there.
Story_ID: 635704
Speaker 1: When you consider your parents' [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] talents and their personalities, their dispositions, their looks, their mannerisms, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My father.  Yeah, I don't think there's much, that's what people tell me.  This is just, these are not, it's not just my assessment.  This is what my sister [Lisa Sleet] sometimes, when we're talking on the phone, she'll stop, and she'll say like, "Ooh, that's spooky."  And I'll say, "What are you talking about?"  She said, "You sound so much like dad."  And other people who knew him and know me, and have continued to echo that, and I can see it, I can see it.
Story_ID: 635705
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  Hm, well, yeah, I guess I, you know, I remember being in front of a black and white TV in the apartment in the tenement where we lived in the Bronx [New York], watching 'Peter Pan' (laughter), when they broadcast 'Peter Pan.'  I do remember that for some reason.  I guess I was probably five or so.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the old, the old black and white one with Mary Martin as Peter (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With Mary Martin.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know why I remember that, but I do.  That's one of my earlier, earliest childhood memories.  I have very, other childhood memories from that time in my life.  For some reason, I don't know if you've had this experience but some- sometimes you can remember things that people say, "Ah, you don't remember that.  It didn't happen that way."  And, no, I remember that, and that's the way it was when I was five.  And I remember we used to--my, we called her my Nana, a woman who lived next door who my parents [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] 'cause both my parents worked.  My mother taught and Nana would babysit for me.  And she would let me just empty the closets out of all the pots and pans and use them as drums.  And I remember banging on drums and just all of the really interesting gadgets and just all the fun I could have at, over at Nana's.  I remember that.  I remember there was, there were several brothers, Lonnie [ph.], Landa [ph.], and Earl [ph.]--I think were their names--that I used to, even at that young age, run around in the streets (laughter) with--we were mischievous.  We weren't bad kids, but we would get into mischief and in trouble, avoided any trouble with the law (laughter).  But I remember those times, and so just being, being out in the streets, my--just drive my parents crazy.  But, yeah, I, so I do remember a little about the Bronx, yeah.
Story_ID: 635706
Speaker 1: You were born in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You were raised in the Bronx [New York] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Initially, yeah.
Speaker 1: Initially, okay.  So you were in the Bronx from about what age?
Speaker 2: About from my birth 'til about age six or so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe between five and six there.  And we moved to Roosevelt [New York]--now I have a lot of memories, obviously, about Roosevelt, growing up there.
Speaker 1: Now, Roosevelt, now, tell us about Roosevelt again.  Roosevelt is a community in the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, Nassau County [New York], about forty minutes' drive or train ride on the Long Island Rail Road from Manhattan [New York].  And at the time that we moved there, it was--I describe it as a lower middle class community, mainly populated by white folks.  I seem to remember a lot of individuals of, seemingly of Eastern European descent, names like Stuber, Billy Klein Stuber [ph.], Wichnefski [ph.], some Italians in there, Garristino [ph.], the Garristinos, and others like that.  There were a few black families on the block, one or two when we moved there.  I think they were, the Davises [ph.] were there, the Joneses [ph.] might have been there.  I don't know if the Stimmlers [ph.] were there and other Pfeiffers [ph.] were there.  Now, we moved in next to a family by the name of Stimmler, a white family.  It seemed to me it wasn't that long before the community became, changed complexion, pretty dramatically (laughter).  You've heard--
Speaker 1: Mostly being black (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you've heard, yeah, you've heard of the term, white flight.
Speaker 1: So is this Long Island [New York] we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was Long Island.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: There was a section of Roosevelt where people either didn't want to move, or couldn't move from, couldn't afford to move from, but I didn't live in that section.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is about 1958, I guess, right?  Fifty-seven [1957], '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born in '51 [1951]--
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951] so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, probably, when, yeah, probably 1958--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --in that neighborhood, yeah.
Story_ID: 635707
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Smells of cut grass 'cause I used to have to cut it (laughter) with a push reel mower.  Picket fence--I mean it literally was a white picket fence around our house.  And I remember it well because that's how my dad [Moneta Sleet] would let me make a little money, painting the picket fence.  The smell of leaves burning in the, in the autumn, in the evening.  That's when you could burn leaves.  The sights, the screaming and hollering of kids on a summer evening, running around without the need for a lot of supervision because it was safe playing different kinds of tag games, like ring-a-levio and, you know, various forms of hide and seek, and that kind of thing.  The daytime sights of kids playing baseball.  We played a lot of baseball.  In the streets, we had a sandlot, literally like the one in the movie, 'The Sandlot.'  We used to go--it was over behind the country club which was actually, interestingly enough, organized and built and developed by a group of black men.  And maybe the name will come to me.  I'm, if it does, I'll let you know.  But there was land behind that club, and I don't know if it was really a country club.  It was a club where they, the brothers got together and did what they did.  And, but we used to play baseball back there, and that was one of our favorite, really favorite things to do was to play baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I remember those sounds and sights very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you came along in the days when, yeah, when baseball was really big.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, now, the, did you have a baseball hero?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I'd have to say that Willie Mays was the name that was my hero.  You know, we used to have arguments.  My buddy, Russell [ph.], and I used to argue, and I wasn't as ardent a Willie Mays fan as he was.  I mean, there wasn't--you couldn't talk to Russell about anybody other than Willie Mays, but I used to try to make the argument for Mickey Mantle every once in a while.  And 'cause I thought that was a pretty good argument (laughter) to be made for Mickey Mantle.  But when it came down to it, I would generally side with Willie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the two big stars.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But we knew all the players--I mean, 'cause we used to trade baseball cards.  I mean, we knew, we knew them all.  And so, there, to varying degrees, more or less, there were, there were guys that we, you know, we really worshipped or followed, but, you know, Willie Mays was Willie Mays so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you play in a Little League?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, sure did, another sight and sound that I remember, getting on my bike, putting my glove on the handle bars and riding to practice.  And then, you know, we used to have shortcuts, practice, yeah, maybe it was a couple of miles away a ride, and we'd find our way to the, to the baseball field.  They would have, had these two fields that they had built behind the A and P [The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company] supermarket.  And I remember the days of practice there and couldn't wait, couldn't wait to the first practice in the Little League season.  And then, you know, I went on to play at higher levels of ball, but not, I was, I was an okay player.  I wasn't a great player or anything like that, so I pretty much, I played through VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars], I played some VFW ball.  And that was the senior, one of the senior leagues.  I don't, never played Babe Ruth, in the Babe Ruth league.  And then, played a little bit in high school, but not much, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What position did you normally play?
Speaker 2: Variety of positions, I actually caught, I played third base, and played also in the outfield.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you have a dog?
Speaker 2: I did.  My first dog was a mutt (laughter)--what now I guess today they call mixed breeds.  He was a mutt--Spanky, a little, a little fellow, brown spots and white dog.  That's another recollection I have of my childhood.  Spanky apparently went out, and while he was out running around, got into something that, and got sick, and died.  And I remember my sister [Lisa Sleet] (laughter), my sister coming upstairs to my room.  I was, I was laying on my bed crying my eyes out 'cause Spanky had died.  And my sister came up, sort of na-na-na-na, you know, how sisters can be, and (laughter), oh, man, was she--that was the wrong time to do that.  And I--my father or somebody heard this commotion upstairs.  I was pounding on my sister, and they came up and got me off her, but, yeah, I remember that well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, that's something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was my first dog.  Yeah, so we always had dogs coming up in the house.  And that may have been from my mom [Juanita Harris Sleet] who I think had dogs all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you mentioned earlier that she--there's a picture of her with a dog.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That kind of caused me to ask that question, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I thought, I bet you had a dog, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, yeah, she's, we did, yeah.
Story_ID: 635708
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school out on Long Island [New York] as--kindergarten at a, at a place called, a public school, Underhill Avenue School [Ulysses Byas Elementary School, Roosevelt, New York], which was the school that, you know, you would walk to.  It was in walking distance, a neighborhood school.  It was a very good school, highly integrated when, you know, by the time I started and--
Speaker 1: It didn't--did it stay integrated?
Speaker 2: No, and I lost track because in fourth grade, as you know, my mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] was a teacher, as I've told you.  And she was a bit of a disciplinarian, and I was a bit undisciplined in school and a bit is probably an understatement.  And, so I was always in trouble, and always in the principal's office for some reason or another.  I was a good student, but always in trouble.  So one day, the beginning of the year, it's the fourth year, my mother told me, "First day you get in trouble, you're out of there."  And she thought that was going to because she knew how much I loved being in school with my friends and everything.  She thought, I guess, that would, was going to be sufficient motivation to keep me in line.  And as it happened, a buddy of mine and I got into an argument, and it wasn't a bad argument, but the teacher caught me responding.  I remember who it was--it was Dennis Wichnefski [ph.], who lived up the block, and we were, we were arguing and we were good buddies, but we were arguing.  And the teacher caught me arguing and we ended up--I think we both got detention.  I came home late from school.  That was the last day I set foot in Underhill Avenue School.  They then sent me to a series of parochial schools, actually Lutheran by denomination for some reason (laughter).  Never figured that out.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was your--you're saying your family was Lutheran?
Speaker 2: No, my parents were Southern Baptist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know why I ended up going to this Epiphany Lutheran school over in a town called, the next town, called Hempstead, New York, H-E-M-P-S--
Speaker 1: That was--was it hard to get over there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, had to catch a bus, yeah, had to, you know, the school provided a bus, you know, so it was--that wasn't fun.  Yep, but yeah, it was okay, I mean, you know, I, yeah, so, we took a bus.  It's a private school, take a bus.
Speaker 1: Now was, how was it different from the public school?
Speaker 2: I don't know that it was really different.  You had teachers, you had students.  We--well, the one difference was, we used to go to chapel every day, yeah, and we didn't go to chapel in public school, yeah.  So there would not be able--other than that, it, yeah, there was another difference.  So they didn't have the athletic facilities that, you know, I didn't have the--they didn't have the space.  So I didn't get to play all the games of baseball, and that kind of thing at recess.  And gym was different.  If you get back then, you, physical education was required and the state would, you know, in public schools, you had phys ed.  So, yeah, it wasn't as big a school physically.  It was a much smaller class sizes, and but didn't have, the physical plan wasn't as good.
Story_ID: 635709
Speaker 1: So Epiphany Lutheran school, you had to go to chapel.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You had to go to--there were no athletic facilities there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, none to speak of, not--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --not like at Underhill [Underhill Avenue School; Ulysses Byas Elementary School, Roosevelt, New York].
Speaker 1: So did they have a recess or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had recess.  We, you know, we did, we'd go out.  There was, such as it was, there was a play area which was a paved, all paved over, and we played kickball out there.  And (laughter), I remember my, I particularly remember my fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Grimm [ph.], was playing as the pitcher.  And, so we played, you know, kickball and dodge ball and other stuff like that, but it wasn't nearly the room or the--we didn't, I don't think the school had a phys ed [physical education] teacher.
Speaker 1: So did you get in less trouble at that environment?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter), no.  No, that plan, I soon thwarted (laughter), but I was there through sixth grade.  I did finish there, so I was there from fourth through sixth.
Story_ID: 635710
Speaker 1: Then my parents [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] thought that the experiment was doing okay.  So they, they wanted to continue.  So then I went--they put me, enrolled me in Long Island Lutheran High School [Long Island Lutheran Junior Senior High School; Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School], pretty well known Long Island High School in Brook- Brookville, Brookville, Long Island [New York].  At seventh grade, I didn't complete the seventh year.  And this is one of those things, I can tell you exactly where I was when President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot.  I was sitting outside in front of Dean Dutton's [ph.] office, one of the vice deans who was in charge of discipline.  I hadn't actually done anything wrong this particular day other than tripped up the stairs coming, and fell into a door, and got, had a big knot on my head.  So they called my mother who had to interrupt her day at school, about forty minutes away.  It was a forty, at least a forty minute bus ride from where we lived out to Long Island Lutheran.  And my head, it was all swelled up, and I have the clearest recollection of sitting out in a chair across from his office.  The door was open, and he had a radio on.  And you knew something was going on because people started gathering.  And I remember this guy running down the hall.  I believe he was a senior--I don't know his name, I know he was a white guy.  That's what I remember about him, and he came down the hall yelling, "They finally got him, they finally got him."  And I then walked to Dean Dutton's office, and that's when I learned that President Kennedy had been assassinated.  My mother was literally a mess by the time she got to me.  She cried the whole way home.  And by that and, so that tragedy, coupled with--it wasn't first time she had to come to school (laughter), you know.  It just so happened this was a benign purpose this time, but she just tired of it.
Story_ID: 635711
Speaker 1: I guess she [Sleet's mother, Juanita Harris Sleet] talked with my dad [Moneta Sleet], and they decided that--she called up one of her colleagues in her sister school.  My mother taught at a school, a junior high school called Turtle Hook [Turtle Hook Junior High School; Turtle Hook Middle School] over in Uniondale, New York.  And the sister school was Lawrence Road Junior High [Lawrence Road Junior High School; Lawrence Road Middle School, Hempstead, New York], and that was seventh through ninth, was how it worked in New York.
Speaker 2: So what's the name of it again, this--
Speaker 1: Her, my mom's school was Turtle Hook, Turtle Hook.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But the school that you went to--
Speaker 1: Lawrence Road.
Speaker 2: Lawrence Road, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, junior high.  So, she called up a colleague and friend of hers who was a guidance counselor there, Carolyn Cassio [ph.], who's now passed, and they decided on my future (laughter).  They said, decided, 'cause back then, they track, you were in tracks in public school.  And they decided that the best track--I forget what it was--I think I was in, you know, you track one through something, and I was in 7-2, I believe.  And she said, Ms. Cassio, I remember saying, "We're not going to put you in 7-1."  I don't remember what the reason was.  She wanted me in 7-2, so that's what I did.  I went, and through Lawrence Road and graduated from Lawrence Road, and went on to the high school, Uniondale High School [Uniondale, New York].
Speaker 2: Now 7-2 would, like the middle road--
Speaker 1: No, that would be like, just a notch below honors--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the highest honor--7-1, if you think the highest honor.  I was in an honors track.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, you know, then you had 7-3, four, five, so there were several tracks below that.  In any event, that's what, that's the way they decided I was going to be tracked.  It wasn't based on any testing or anything that I knew about.  It was, I guess, they looked on my, looked--Ms. Cassio looked at my academic record, and she knew me, as well, and decided that's where I was going to be tracked.
Story_ID: 635712
Speaker 1: Now what kind of record did you have in grade school?
Speaker 2: I had a good, I had a good record, yeah, I was, I was a good student.  I was a difficult student, discipline wise, but I was a good student in the main, you know, every, we all have subjects that challenge us.  I remember earth science in seventh grade being very challenging and me not wanting to work very hard at it.  I remember that.  But math wasn't my strong suit either, and I think that's because I didn't work at it.  And I think there, to this day, are a lot of myths about math and what people can and cannot do with that regard, but I was a part of that generation that bought into the myth.  So, you know, I focused on other aspects of liberal arts and not the sciences so--
Speaker 1: So you liked social studies and reading better?
Speaker 2: Yeah, reading and history, and I was good at it and, you know, social studies.  I was a good biology student for some reason, awful chemistry student (laughter), but a good biology student.  And, so I finished part of the seventh grade year [at Long Island Lutheran Junior Senior High School; Long Island Lutheran Middle and High School, Brookville, New York], and then joined the Lawrence Road [Lawrence Road Junior High School; Lawrence Road Middle School, Hempstead, New York], and that's where I finished junior high, and then went to high school [Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York].  And I, that did end my period of unruliness--it worked.  My mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] said, her thinking was I'm going to put you in the system, not my school, but I'm going to put you in the system where I teach.  Get in trouble now.  And it worked, I stayed out of trouble.
Story_ID: 635713
Speaker 1: Now are there any teachers when you look back that really stand out as mentors or people--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had an English teacher in my sophomore year, Ms. Gaffney [ph.] was just an incredibly gifted and dedicated teacher.
Speaker 1: Now this is in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in high school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Uniondale High [Uniondale High School].
Speaker 1: Uniondale?
Speaker 2: Yeah, U-N-I-O-U [sic.]--what is it, U--
Speaker 1: Uniondale junior high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Union- Uniondale, D-A-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was that at?
Speaker 2: In Uniondale, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Uniondale, Long Island [New York].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It was--God bless you.  It was a neighboring community to, where we had, while we were still, were we still in Roosevelt [New York]?  I think we were still in Roosevelt.  We eventually moved to Baldwin [New York], just the next town over.  And, what I remember about the move to Baldwin was my father [Moneta Sleet] and mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] apparently made a mistake in their research.  And they thought they were moving me and my sister [Lisa Sleet] and brother [Michael Sleet] into the Baldwin School District [Baldwin Union Free School District], which is a very good public school district.  But they made a mistake because we were, albeit in, living in the town of Baldwin, we were still in the Roosevelt School District [Roosevelt Union Free School District].  By this time, the Roosevelt schools had begun to fall off dramatically, in part due to all of the flight that was, that had occurred, and a loss of resources, and just social conditions.  And at least in their view, it, they had fallen off dramatically, my parents' view.  I shouldn't say that as a matter of fact 'cause I have some good buddies who finished Roosevelt schools who were doctors and other things and did just fine.  But my parents, particularly my mom, I think, was of a view that she didn't want me to attend Roosevelt schools.  Better or worse, I didn't, and I didn't go back where I'd started in Roosevelt.  So I went to Uniondale High where I was able to go ahead and finish.
Story_ID: 635714
Speaker 1: Did you get a lot of information in your home?  I guess, your father [Moneta Sleet] being involved in journ- journalism, I would suspect that you had a lot of magazines coming in the house and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, and information and newspapers and stuff like that.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, there was, you know, the various newspapers.  My father read The New York Times every day.  And I would come home, I don't know that I was an avid New York Times reader, but at the time you had Long- it used to be, I think, called Long Island Newsday [Newsday].  You had the Long Island Press which are papers that we got.  Of course, Ebony was around.  Time magazine was around and books, and books and music and conversation.  My parents, when my father wasn't travelling, we used to have dinner together.  It was a lot of family discussion.  My father would frequently talk about his trips, and we'd learn things that way.  My mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] would talk about school.
Story_ID: 635715
Speaker 1: You remember any of the discussion about his, his [Sleet's father, Moneta Sleet] travels?  Did, for instance, we--you know, the travels to the South during the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember the--I don't have a recollection from those discussions.  I know that they occurred.  Nothing particular stands out like, for instance, there's some images from the time that he covered the, some of the Selma Montgomery march [Selma to Montgomery March].  And you know about all the violence and things that occurred at the Titus Memorial Bridge or Titus Bridge [sic.], whatever the name was in the--
Speaker 1: Pettus, yeah (unclear).
Speaker 2: The Pettus--what was it, the Pettus--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Pettus, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Edmund Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Edmund, yes, and I think an anniversary has recently been celebrated around that.  He was there.  The fire hoses, the German Shepherds, you know, the sheriffs with their hands on their guns ready to pull the--so I've seen those images that he took.  And, so I'm quite certain that there was discussion about those times.  Every once in a while, he would, he would take me with him, so there was that education as well.  It wasn't frequent.  I remember, I do remember being with him, getting on the train, and going to work with him one day.  He was cut, doing a story on Malcolm X.  And we were out somewhere in Harlem [New York, New York] on a, on a, on a corner, and Malcolm X was giving a talk.  Big crowd, I remember seeing that.  I don't remember what Malcolm X said, but I think we all knew what Malcolm--we all know what kinds of talks that Malcolm used to give.  I don't remember the specific subject that day.  He took me with him when Jackie Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame [National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Cooperstown, New York].  I'll never forget that.  It's--I've already told you how baseball was a passion for me as a kid growing up and my friends, and we all certainly all knew Jackie Robinson.  And I had the great good fortune to--one of my best buddies was, happens to be a nephew of Jackie Robinson.  And, so I actually got to meet and speak with Jackie Robinson, and ride in the car with Jackie Robinson, and up to Stamford, Connecticut where we used to--Kirk [ph.] and I used to play with the David [David Robinson], who's our contemporary, Mr. Robinson's son, David.  So that was, you know, that was an experience that, you know, a kid can't really expect to have, but I had it.  And so he, every once in a while, he would, he would take me a place or two, but usually, he was gone.  He couldn't take me.  I was in school or doing whatever I was doing, and he really couldn't take me with him.  But, yeah, so there were a lot of--I think difference sources of information as you, as you put it.  Certainly there was no Internet at the time--that was a long way off.  So, you know, from the books to the newspapers to the magazines to the conversation, travels, as limited as they were.  Yeah, and, of course, school.
Story_ID: 635716
Speaker 1: Now do you remember any discussion around the March on Washington just--now that happened the August just before President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, you know, I remember, I can tell you now, I don't, I think I wanted to go and I don't know why quite--he covered that.  He went there to work.  And I don't remember why I wasn't able or didn't go, to tell you the truth.  I know my, one of my best buddy, Kirk's [ph.] sister, JoJo [ph.] or Rhoda [ph.] went.  I remember a photograph my dad [Moneta Sleet] took of her with this--just a wonderful look of curiosity as she looked up at Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  She happened to--must have been near, somewhere where it was, she was required to look up to see him as he spoke, and I remember that photograph.  So she was there, and I didn't understand why I wasn't there, you know, but I do remember that march, and the fact that dad was off to, going off to work.
Story_ID: 635717
Speaker 1: Was he [Sleet's father, Moneta Sleet] sent o- overseas very, very often?
Speaker 2: Yes, very frequently, yeah, he spent time in a number of countries.  But he spent an awful lot of time, as I understand it, on the continent of Africa covering the emerging, many of the emerging countries, such as Ghana.  He was there when Nkrumah [Kwame Nkrumah] was inaugurated.  And there's a pretty well-known, I think well-known, picture that he took of Emperor Selassie [Haile Selassie] on a trip that he took to Ethiopia, was, for some reason.  He covered many of the independent celebrations in between, right on up through Mr. Mandela [Nelson Mandela], covered that.  Not too long before he died, I think that, to put the timeframe roughly, before my father died.  Yeah, so he traveled extensively--Russia, Europe, different places.
Story_ID: 635718
Speaker 1: Now did he have a darkroom at home?
Speaker 2: No, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Moneta Sleet] wasn't a freelancer.  He had a darkroom in, at work that they would use to process the black and white stuff, but all the color stuff went out, were sent out to a lab.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: But I spent a fair amount of time, and learned a little bit about the darkroom, learned my way around the darkroom, and developed an interest in photography, and actually was sort of a nerd, nerdy guy in that regard.  And high, in junior high school, I was on the audio- audiovisual staff and we used to, I used to take pictures and develop them.  Learned how to use an enlarger and that kind of thing, yeah.
Story_ID: 635719
Speaker 1: Now what about TV?  Was TV important growing up or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I don't know if it's, was important as it is, seems to be today.  I remember that my dad [Moneta Sleet] and I had a, had a routine when he was in town of, we used to watch 'Bonanza' together.  I remember that, and there might have been one other show that he liked that I would watch with him.  But, you know, there wasn't as much TV fare nearly as there is today.  I remember, I liked the Westerns.  I remember liking 'Gunsmoke' and 'Have Gun - Will Travel.'  And Steve McQueen had a, had a show.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: You remember that one?
Speaker 1: 'Wanted Dead or Alive.'
Speaker 2: 'Wanted Dead or Alive,' that's right.  So, I liked to, you know, I liked 'Rawhide.'  And Clint Ea- Clint Walker had a show, 'Cheyenne' and those guys.  So I was a Western watcher, yeah, Westerns watcher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about radio?  I think that was the age of the transistor radio (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was.  I remember, I finally had a radio by my bed when we were in Roosevelt [New York].  And I remember my first recollections of really being aware of radio in the sense of being, becoming a listener was when I started becoming really interested in, and probably in girls (laughter).  And WWRL [WWRL Radio] was an AM station at the time that used to play popular music, and I remember listening to a lot to WWRL.  My parents would always have a WNEW [WNEW Radio, New York, New York] on downstairs, you know, with William B. Williams and news and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: So I remember that part of radio.  I remember--what other parts of television that I do remember, interestingly enough, is the, is 'The Today Show' ['Today'].  My father was an avid morning watcher of 'The Today Show' with--I guess it was a guy by the name of Dave Garroway and the monkey, J. Fred Muggs that he--remember that (laughter).  And, so I do remember that.  He was a, he was a, he was, he--well, I guess, in part, 'cause of what he did for a living.  He was a news watcher and a news gatherer.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, 'Today Show' has been on a long time.
Speaker 2: Yes, it has.
Story_ID: 635720
Speaker 1: Did you know any lawyers when you were growing up?  An- Any black lawyers or a- any lawyers to tell the truth?
Speaker 2: No, you know, how I knew lawyers was through reading.  I became fascinated through reading with the exploits of Clarence Darrow and--
Speaker 1: Now was this in--while a teenager?
Speaker 2: Yeah, while a teenager, yeah.  And I'd have to say that if there was any source of--the greatest source of inspiration for my wanting to become a lawyer was what I read about and learned, became to, came to know about Clarence Darrow, and the things that he did and stood for.
Speaker 1: Now what cases, what particular cases did, were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I just have a recollection of him taking on difficult causes, unpopular causes, and being there for the little guy at times, so when he needed to be, and when he was called upon to do so.  I mean, he had some big causes, too, you know, but that was my general recollection of him.  And then, you, as I got older and more serious about--well, next steps for me, and what I wanted to do, you know, once I went to college [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and had to decide on a major and that kind of thing, and well, what do you want to do with this major.  I ended up majoring in political science, took a fair, a fair amount of economics as well.  I decided, I think, in part, inspired by what I knew of Clarence Darrow, and what I'd come to learn about people like Justice Marshall and Hamilton Houston, Charles Hamilton Houston.  And that group of lawyers who prosecuted those cases are those, you know, the well known cases, and some the not so well known cases and, you know, in classes that I would take, learn about them.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever have a chance to meet Thurgood Marshall?
Speaker 2: Never did, never did, it's something I dearly wish I'd been able.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure.  I think Charles Hamilton Houston was, had passed before you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was gone.
Speaker 1: --came along.  But did you like 'Perry Mason' by any chance?
Speaker 2: No, no, I didn't, I wasn't a 'Perry Mason' watcher, no.  Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever see the dramatization of the Scopes Trial [State of Tennessee v. Scopes, 1925] with Clarence Darrow--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --being betrayed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, the old black and white, you're talking about the one with Spencer Tracy?
Speaker 1: 'Inherit the Wind.'
Speaker 2: 'Inherit the Wind,' yes, yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did that, were you moved by that when you were--
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, I absolutely was.  I was moved by the portrayal.  I used to love Spencer Tracy.  I thought Spencer Tracy was a great actor, yeah, yeah.  I guess he, along with, you know, and 'cause these guys did Westerns, too, guys like Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, guys like that.  But Spencer Tracy, I thought was, that I thought was a great, great performance.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I could see myself walking around a courtroom.  I didn't know if I was going to be wearing suspenders or not, but you know, popping off.
Story_ID: 635721
Speaker 1: Now was church a big part of growing up (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Church was a part of growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--to characterize it as a big part, I wouldn't say that.  I attended Sunday school regularly.  There was a local church within, well within walking distance of where I lived in Roosevelt [New York].  It was a Presbyterian church, and I'm trying to remember what it was called, but that's where I attended Sunday school.  That's where I was baptized, I actually was baptized as a Presbyterian.
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] go, attend there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They did as well.  They didn't, as far as I recall, Larry [Larry Crowe], attend a Baptist, local Baptist churches or church, a local Baptist church, as I recall.  I just, I think that's where they attended church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were nominally Baptist, but they didn't go to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were nominally Baptists, and I suspect, you know, when they were coming up, they went to church and went to a Baptist church.  My parents, I believe, eventually migrated to a church called Unity [Unity Church of Hempstead, Garden City, New York] which, as best I can understand about it, it's somewhat akin to--you're familiar with the Unitarian Universalists' view of, rather, nondenominational type of practice but Christians.  They were Christians.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), yeah.
Speaker 2: And I'm a Christian.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not an avid churchgoer (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I count myself as a Christian.
Story_ID: 635722
Speaker 1: You're looking at Clarence Darrow because of his sense of justice in the trials that he, you know, the Scottsboro Boy [Scottsboro Boys] case and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Scopes Trial [State of Tennessee v. Scopes, 1925] and other things.
Speaker 2: And I have to say, you know, the lawyer, Darrow [Clarence Darrow] and others like that weren't the only source of inspiration for me.  You know, I came up, and I guess we're probably, roughly the same age, I, you know, the times we came, in which we came up were turbulent times, were times of great protest.  And I wanted to, you know, I remember the Black Panther [Black Panther Party] protests, I remember Malcolm X vividly.  I remember Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I remember being drawn to the sense of needing to do something to participate in that, and over time, I learned that I had some rhetorical skills.  I participated on the, on the oratory section, in the oratory section of our debate team in high school [Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York].  I was a pretty decent speechmaker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I perceived that might be a way through the practice of law, as I used to think of it inside the system, be able to effect change.  And I, and of course, we saw other lawyers doing it because, you know, the exploits of Thurgood Marshall and his team were well known and by this time, you know, because Brown [Brown versus Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was, had long since been decided.  And they were, you know, they were lawyers still plowing those, that earth, and still trying to do it to this day quite frankly.  But, so those dinner table discussions, my father's [Moneta Sleet] travels, and while I can't necessarily tell you about a conversation, specific conversation I had with him, that was particularly served as inspiration.  I know that there were those conversations, you know, I knew because I was a fan of the struggles of Jackie Robinson.  And, so I feel like that, those things, those events, those experiences in my life all coalesced to help inspire my interest in the law, and as it eventually developed my interest in the area of criminal law representing indigent defendants which is, which was my first job as a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] public defender.
Story_ID: 635723
Speaker 1: Now you started high school in '65 [1965], did you, you cited the English teacher as being one of your inspirations there, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Ms. Gaffney [ph.], yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you, what kind of activities were you involved in high school?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Well, a number.  I was, jump to my senior year in '69 [1969].  There was a lot of protest going on in Vietnam, around Vietnam [Vietnam War] and civil rights, you know, there were the assassinations.  I had, I had played football throughout my high school time [at Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York].  I had run track.  I had--but then, in my senior year for some reason, began to develop an interest in other things.  I did some writing for the newspaper.  I joined the debate team.  And I joined the choir.  I knew that I could sing, and, so I guess I was sort of coming out of a shell or was losing some of the fear of being harassed and (laughter), and teased by my boys (laughter) about doing these kinds of things.  And, eventually, I was convinced by a friend of mine, young lady, Rosemary Shields, to try out for the part of Emile De Becque in the movie [sic.], 'South Pacific,' the lead role in the movie, in the play, 'South Pacific' [Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II].  And, yeah, I, back in the day, I could sing (laughter), and I won the role.  We had a very accomplished dramatic drama department and a wonderful--we had a world class high school orchestra, the only high school orchestra when I was there that was invited to expo in Canada.  I remember that.  We used to put on, the drama department used to put on wonderful productions every year.  It would be a three day affair, three, two evening performances and a matinee.  All of the roles in that particular show were double cast, except, and including Emile De Becque.  And I brag a little to say that they decided, the director decided that I was good enough that he only wanted me to do the role, so I did, I did that.  The football team came (laughter) to one of the performances, and I'll be damned if they didn't give me a standing, yeah, they did give a production, but when I came out, they gave a standing ovation.  And they didn't hoot and holler, you know, and I really felt good about that.  They, they next practice said, "Man, you could sing," you know, hey, what you (laughter), you know, and so, that was pretty cool.  But then, I said all that to say to give you background to, into something else I got involved in that was rather extracurricular and that was helping lead a walkout of students, some black students of the school.

Speaker 1: So I was beginning to tell you about the walkout I co-led.  We were 6 percent--we meaning African American students, black students at the time, of the high schools, a rather large high school, Uniondale High [Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York], I believe somewhere between 2,500, three thousand, perhaps more than three thousand kids.  And, remember, this is tenth grade through twelve.  This is ten, eleven, and twelve.  I said, that was a pretty big school, but we didn't feel, in keeping with the times, that our needs were being properly looked after by the school administration.  I was not a student, I was not involved in student government or anything like that.  What happened was there was a meeting in the, in the band room, back in the music area that I, you know, black students were told about and more or less summoned to.  And there was a fellow by the name of Brian Campbell [ph.].  That's what he called himself at the time, later changed his name to Ahmad Shakur [ph.].  And don't ask me how to spell that (laughter), but Brian or Ahmad was leading the meeting at the time.  And as I recall, he was, for my taste, a little bit too far left of left in some of the things he was, he was talking about doing or wanting to do to demonstrate and to protest and to try to accomplish, you know, some goals.  I spoke up and, apparently, what I had to say resonated with a number of people in the room as it happened, and I can't tell you exactly how it happened.  We both ended up in front of the room.  And we both ended up in front of the protests going forward and, eventually, after several days when certain demands were not met that we made, we led a walkout--shut the school down.  Police, everything, the whole, the whole thing, news, cameras, news trucks, and the new- and I don't know if they had news trucks but, you know, the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Can you remember what the issues were?  What were the issues (unclear) in 1969?
Speaker 1: Oh, the issues were around what we were learning in textbooks, what courses weren't being offered, the failure, the what we believed to be the complete, if not complete, then all, near complete failure to address our place in history, the history of this country.  And, so those were the essential issues that we were trying to raise.
Speaker 2: Did the school capitulate on any point?
Speaker 1: I don't know if capitulate's the right word.  After the protests, we stayed out a couple of days.  And what they, they brought in some, I don't know what you call these--folks that supposedly had skills in dispute resolution and had dealt with issues like this before.  And we embarked--a number, me and Ahmad and a number of other student leaders and teachers and administrators embarked on a series of meetings and discussions facili- facilitated by these folks aimed at trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, trying to resolve our complaints.  And I don't remember the specific outcomes, but I do seem to recall that we achieved some level of success in getting atten- having attention drawn to the issues and then having a series of recommendations made.  And I think some of them--well, I know some of them did eventually get addressed.
Speaker 2: For an example though, say, in American history, were blacks mentioned in American history classes?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but only in passing.  It wasn't, it wasn't, unless you're a particular teacher had the industry and was a good enough teacher and the honesty, integrity, teaching integrity to, and the work ethic 'cause the teacher would have to work, couldn't teach just from the textbook and include us in the discussion in the way that we should have been.  If you're teaching from the text, that wasn't to get it done.  And most of the teachers will teach from the text, so in classes like American history and that kind of thing.  So, yeah, I can't tell you specifics but, yeah, we--I do have a general sense that we did accomplish something.
Speaker 2: So this is your senior year?
Speaker 1: It's my senior year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Senior year?  Okay.  So if they did change something--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --probably wouldn't have seen it anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you're getting ready to graduate, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah I have, one of the clear recollections I had--the recollection of walking out, but I have very vivid recollection of--we called a town meeting for the entire school to come to the auditorium be- because we recognized that the issues needed to be aired with the entire school and with our, with our fellow students.  And I, along with Ahmad and others, took to the front of the room and to the podium.  I always remember looking up and seeing my mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] at the back, way in the back of the auditorium (laughter), and saying, "Oh, my god," (laughter), "here we go," and she was very supportive, she was very supportive.  She was worried, she was concerned.  She didn't want to see me arrested or anything like that, but no one got arrested.  The protest was peaceful.  There was no destruction, no vandalism.  Our views were heard and respectfully so, and I believe some of them addressed some of our issues and goals.
Story_ID: 635725
Speaker 1: Were there any black political heroes that you had at this stage in 1969, either of the past or contemporary (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  Malcolm X was one of my (laughter), one of my heroes, you know.  'The Autobiography of Malcolm X' [Alex Haley and Malcolm X] had a tremendous impact on me.  I had the utmost and greatest respect for Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I knew at the time that I began first following the two men that they had decidedly different point of view about how to approach the problem.  As we all know by now, Malcolm evolved in his approach and in his view of both what the problem was and how to address it, so much so that I believe had they lived there would have been a coming together even more than was, history permitted, but, of course, we know what happened.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you were doing when you heard about Dr. King's assassination?
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: You would have been a junior [at Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I don't, for some reason, I don't have that vivid imprint that I had when president, the president was assassinated.  And I think what so indelibly imprinted that event on my mind, was the guy running down the hall, yelling what he was yelling.  As you might imagine, and I should suspect and surmise my parents [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] were devout Democrats and loved John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and respected him, thought that he represented some real hope for our issues.  And to hear this guy, you know, saying, "They finally got him," and I knew what he was talking about.  So I forgot the original question, I'm sorry, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I was just asking, in general--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like what the heroes you had in those days and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Reverend King or Dr. King, Thurgood Mar- Justice Marshall [Thurgood Marshall] was a hero.  Jackie Robinson was a, was definitely a hero for me.  I came to understand this as I grew into adulthood that he was every bit as much a civil rights pioneer as any of the others we've talked about, and every bit as important to the advancement of those issues as any we've talked about.
Story_ID: 635726
Speaker 1: When it came time to graduate [from Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York] then, did you, did you graduate with any honors or anything at--
Speaker 2: I was a, I was a middling B student, yeah.   No, no--I got some awards for leadership and that kind of thing.  You know, I was not, I didn't end up being an outst- I didn't continue to be the student I started out to be for some reason, but I was a good, I was a good enough student, got into a number of schools.  Wanted to attend Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut.  And long story, the long and short of it is that I really hadn't paid a lot of attention.  Other schools, had a scholarship offer to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], academic scholarship, had gotten into Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  That was my mother's [Juanita Harris Sleet] alma mater and got into some other schools, Ohio Wesleyan [Ohio Wesleyan University, Delaware, Ohio] and some other schools that I had applied to.  But I really wanted to go to Middletown, Wesleyan, and got waitlisted ultimately, didn't, didn't get in that year.  So, I decided I'm going to go into Hampton.
Speaker 1: Now why Wesley- why were you--
Speaker 2: At the time, Wesleyan, and you may remember was a real center of protest, student, student involvement, and these issues that we've been talking about.  It was on the cover of Time magazine.  It was the first school of, especially first elite school of its type that embraced, whose administration embraced the students' interest and actually nurtured that interest in protest.  I had--there were, it was, a boyfriend and girlfriend that, Bernice Goldson [ph.], and what was her then boyfriend's--they--one or both of them went to Wesleyan.  And there was another young man that was an upperclassman who I had become very friendly with over the years who was just a wonderful student in there, really a wonderful guy.  A white guy.  Just was, you know.  I say that for no particular reason, but that I want, yeah, you know, he had talked to me about Wesleyan.  You should come to Wesleyan, you know.  And, so I developed that interest in going there.  I think my SAT scores were probably not what they needed quite to be for Wesleyan.  My GPA [grade point average] was, you know, I think, in the ballpark--didn't get in.  Went to, went to Hampton with the determination to transfer to Wesleyan.  I really, I think I was a victim in a way of some self-hate (laughter) about our institutions, about--I can't say self-hate.  I just can't think of a better way, a better word right now.  I didn't have the respect that I should have had.  I didn't have the understanding, particularly with my, both my parents having been graduates of historically black colleges [HBCUs] and universities, of what they stood for, what they did, what one could accomplish with a degree from a Hampton, from a Morehouse, from a Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], from a, you know, a Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], from a Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And, so I went to Hampton with a decidedly, with a de- determination that I was going to get into Wesleyan.  I was going to transfer.  And I banged out a really great GPA, did, you know, did really well, and thought that I'd be a lock.  And by this time, I had developed additional friends.  There was a, there was a core of black guys, Dwight Greene and some other guys up there.  Dwight's now passed on that I became friendly with who were early on in Wesleyan's history, who were also very influential in my thinking about coming there.  And as luck would have it, I applied, and that was the year that Wesleyan went coed.  Wesleyan, at the time, prior to that time, had been an all-male school, so they weren't accepting any transfer students.  Still determined to move away from Hampton, I went to Connecticut College [New London, Connecticut] which, at the time, was known as Connecticut College for Women.  I was a part, ironically, enough of their first tran- transfer class of men where they allowed men.  And in the interim, Dwight and others had lobbied for my application, too, 'cause I applied to Wesleyan.  And I got admitted as a transfer to Wesleyan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Decided to go back to Hampton (laughter), drove my parents nuts.
Story_ID: 635727
Speaker 1: Now did you like Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?  I mean, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did.
Speaker 1: --what was your--okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: I take that you did, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was it about Ha- Hampton that you liked, and who was there at the time that (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what really motivated me to go back, I thought I--well, I was, I was in love at the time (laughter).  And the young lady was there, and I found that I was sort of missing her (laughter).  And, so I wasn't really, I didn't give Connecticut College [New London, Connecticut] a chance.  And by the time--I'll never forget Dwight [Dwight Greene] and Phil [ph.] and some other guys drove over in their car to say, "C'mon, man, we'll, let's go, you're in, get your bags together."  I, and I announced to them that I wasn't going, that I'd already made the decision to return to Hampton.  And I wasn't, by that time, I wasn't changing my mind, and they couldn't change it.  So I went on back and, of course, my then girlfriend ultimately, the next year, transferred to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] (laughter).  So as it happened, you know, how things are, things work out sometimes or don't.  But I enjoyed and do to this day, I'm very close with my classmates at Hampton, the camaraderie, the, you know, just the way it was.  It was a great place to go to school.
Story_ID: 635728
Speaker 1: Who were some of your professors there [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]?  And, now you majored in pol- political science, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, political science, you know, Dr. Park- oh, man, you're going to make me call out names.  I can't, I had a, I had a professor who taught, he was an adjunct actually, two of them, Colonel--what was his name--taught general semantics.  He was a colonel and he was adjunct.  He was a colonel over at one of the local bases, you know, there are a lot of bases around the Hampton [Virginia], the Tidewater area.  There was another fellow, also an adjunct who taught a class in rhetoric that I took.  Both of these guys were, in their own way, I think, great teachers and served as sources of inspiration for me and my pursuit of legal, a legal career.  Yeah, those would be the ones I would--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that come to mind immediately.
Story_ID: 635729
Speaker 1: Were the black students organized around issues--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Africa, the Caribbean and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, well, and not so much in Caribbean and, but we were organized around issues around the continent and, but more specifically what was going in our own backyard in this country.  Again, got involved in leading a--I became eventually vice president of the Student Government Association in my junior year, and it was in my junior year--was it my junior year?  Next year and my senior year, I was president of the Student Government Association.  I got elected president.  I think it was my junior year that we led a, again, led a (laughter), led a march in protest of the--I think it was my junior year--a protest of the shootings at Orangeburg [South Carolina] at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University].  And, yeah, it was my junior year.  The protest eventually led to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] making the decision to not end in the year, seniors.  The school was, we were all ordered to go home.  The seniors that year didn't get to take their exams.  It was a time of a lot of upheaval.  There was--we cordoned off, in part, as part of the protest, we occupied the student administration building.  We--there was a place called Katherine House with a board of trustees that happened to be in session and it was right on the Chesapeake Bay on the inlet there and the only way out was through this particular door.  They brought a boat up to take them off.  Somebody foolishly set a fire to a very historic building called the Wigwam where, when Hampton was just an industrial school, Native Americans used to be housed who were attending.
Speaker 1: Somebody burned it up, huh?
Speaker 2: Well, they set it on fire.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't burn it up fortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They got the fire out pretty, pretty quick, but this combination of events led the administration to shut the school down for the year.  Came back the following year and got elected student government president and or well, maybe I was elected before the year was out, I think probably and--
Speaker 1: Now, did, in light of all these, I mean what was your relationship with--well, what was the Hampton's administrate- who was the president then as a matter of fact.
Speaker 2: A guy by the name of Roy Hudson [Roy Davage Hudson].  And--
Speaker 1: What was their disposition toward the students in terms of dealing with these kinds of situations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, at some point, they attempted to end--well, they attempted to constructively engage us in conversation.  I was a part of that conversation in the admin building when we finally elected to move out, or we never got forced to move out.  I thought they actually on balance, the administration handled it rather well.  I remember actually appearing at a press conference.  We issued a statement because we wanted, we were rather strategic about how we went about things, and we didn't want to repeat what had happened at the, at either Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] or South Carolina State.  And, so we, in the press statement, really wanted to highlight the fact that these were peaceful, peaceful protests, what some of the issues were.  Some of the issues were very mundane academic issues.  For instance, I remember one being, once you flunked a course at Hampton, the, and took it and repassed it, that failing grade would still be factored into your GPA [grade point average].  We thought that didn't make any sense.  Okay, if you want to leave the failing, the fact that you failed the course on the transcript, you know, that didn't make sense either, but we eventually, we convinced, this was, again, a mundane, a little sort of part of, so it was a combination of things.  They wanted to shut down the architectural program.  Hampton had a rather famous, among black institutions, architectural program.  They had eliminated the baseball--they were involved in a series of what we thought were dramatic and draconian cuts to the program, across the board.  Hampton was, and at that time, having some financial distress.  And Roy Hudson was a temporary placeholder between Brud Holland [Jerome H. Holland], and the next president, Dr. Cotton [G. Robert Cotton], who was then succeeded by the current president, Dr. Harvey [HistoryMaker William Harvey].  And, so these were some of the things that we were about at the time and, so the administration, I thought, did well.  No state police came on.  No local police came on to disperse us or anything like that.  And we ended up in a series of constructive engagements.
Story_ID: 635730
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], you were, you were the student council--
Speaker 2: I was student, I was Student Government Association president.  I was president of the student body.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any other kind of honors or anything, distinctions--?
Speaker 2: Did I have what?
Speaker 1: Any other honors or distinctions when you graduated?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't, I don't think so.  I don't--you mean other than having served as vice president and president?  I, you know, I graduated with honors, you know, but nothing.  I wasn't magna or summa.  I wasn't Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] or anything like that, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what were your prospects in terms of school?  Now you were, you were determined to go to law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To go to law school, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I applied, and, eventually, got into Rutgers [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School] in Camden, New Jersey, and Boston College [Boston College Law School, Newton Centre, Massachusetts].  I had--I'll put it this way.  I applied to UVA as well, University of Virginia [University of Virginia School of Law, Charlottesville, Virginia], and my application had initially been rejected.  There was some, again, I had some friends there who were there as first-years who were working on, didn't feel that the rejection--they didn't, didn't, couldn't, they didn't understand me not getting in.  And they had actually petitioned, begun to petition the admissions committee.  I told them to call that off, and I had made the election to go and attend Rutgers.
Story_ID: 635731
Speaker 1: So Rutgers University [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey] in 1976, right?
Speaker 2: Seventy--it's '73 [1973], I finished Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Seventy--so this is '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're at Rutgers.
Speaker 2: So that's when I began.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That must be the graduation date they have here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So '73 [1973].  Now what was going on at Rutgers and did you like law school?
Speaker 2: Not the first year.  I detested it the first year.  I think you'll hear that from many law students that did.  It's, you know, it's the kind of study that you've probably--most have not done before in undergrad, perhaps unless you've been a science major of some kind, maybe an engineering major or, you know, some kind of science major to--the number of hours that it takes to accomplish the task, the academic task that you're assigned, are many (laughter).  And in addition to the other things you need to do to be successful in law school like participating in study groups, outlining courses, and if you want to do anything extracurricular, particularly if you want to try to do law review or something like that or moot court or, and I did moot court, and that kind of thing.  It was just a lot, a lot of hours.  They say the law is a jealous mistress, and law school is no different in that regard.
Speaker 1: It demands all your time.
Story_ID: 635732
Speaker 1: Who were the, some of the professors there that you, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember well Roger Clark [Roger S. Clark], who incredibly enough, is still teaching at Rutgers [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey].  He's become, he's gone on to become a really significant, as I understand it, international law teacher and practitioner, goes up to the UN [United Nations] and testifies, so all kinds of really neat stuff.  But I had him for torts (laughter), and I remember him well.  I remember a fellow by the name of Kepner [M. Donald Kepner] who taught civil procedure 101, and he was quite a, quite a character, somewhat in the mold of--remember the movie, what was the name of that law movie by--
Speaker 1: 'Paper Chase' ['The Paper Chase'].
Speaker 2: 'Paper Chase,' somewhat like Professor Kingsfield [Charles W. Kingsfield, Jr.], very much (laughter), in that mold.  I had a great contracts professor by the name of Hunter Taylor [E. Hunter Taylor, Jr.] who I remember well.  I remember Larry Palmer who I took for several courses in criminal law and criminal procedure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you gravi- well, you gravitated towards criminal law, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but in law school, you just take a general course.  You don't, you don't major necessarily in anything in law school like you do in undergraduate school or like you would come out with a, let's see, let's say a finance degree from Wharton [Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], or something like that and, you know.
Story_ID: 635733
Speaker 1: You were in law school [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey] during the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-three [1973] through '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So there was still, there was still a lot of social upheaval going on, and it was no different at my law school.  And there were a number of issues that arose around similar things to that which we were protesting back in high school [Uniondale High School, Uniondale, New York], in my high school days and in college [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], quite frankly, around subject matter.  Black law students not being successful at the school and flunking out and that kind of thing and our concerns about admitting people and, that might be borderline and whatever--the student's complexion or ethnicity or racial origin.  But not providing sufficient resources to help that student be successful, once you admitted them, so there, these are some of the things that were a part of those protests.  And, again, I found myself actively engaged in the discussions with the administration and Dean Fairbanks [Russell N. Fairbanks] at the time and others.  And these were fortunately very constructive conversations and, you know, as you get older, you mature, and and your tactics evolve, and your thinking evolves and you maybe become more strategic, more sophisticated in your approach to things.  I like to think so at least.
Speaker 1: Now did the black students organize a chapter of BALSA [Black American Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association] there?
Speaker 2: Yep, we did.  We--it was already there when I got there, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's the black, what does it stand for, the black--
Speaker 2: I think the name, it was BALSA, it was Black American Law Students Association then.  I think the name has changed though.  I think it's evolved to another name--I'm trying to remember.  No, it was, that's what it is today.  I think, it was the BLSU [sic.], Black Law Students Association then.  I think it is now, BALSA [sic.], I think, I think that's what it is.
Story_ID: 635734
Speaker 1: Now did you know a Dr. Ivan Van Sertima up there at Rutgers [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey]?  He was, became very famous, black studies--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was probably--I didn't know him.  He was probably, I'm sure, at the New Brunswick [New Jersey] campus, the main campus, yeah.  I was in, you know, Rutgers has two law schools.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I went to the South Jersey to the Camden law school.  The other one is in Newark [New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two independent law schools within the university system (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, that's right.  Okay.  So, now this is the time when there are a lot of trials in the news.  And you are in school when the Watergate hearings, though then a trial, they were going on.  Did you pay close attention to those at all?
Speaker 2: I paid attention to them.  You know, in law school, I'm trying to remember--was I actually in school at the time?  What year was that?  That was--
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I paid attention, but as I've said earlier, you don't have a lot of time to pay a lot of attention to other things, but I certainly did pay attention when I could, yeah.
Speaker 1: It seemed to be a showcase for lawyers, you know.  Here, everybody in the, everybody was a lawyer involved in it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody was.
Speaker 1: Sam Ervin and them, you know.
Speaker 2: Sam Dash [Samuel Dash] and, one of the more memorable figures for me out of that, those hearings and out of that whole episode was Barbara Jordan, congresswoman from Texas who, as you know, was a lawyer.  And I think, when she retired from [U.S.] Congress, went to, went back to Texas and taught law, I think.  I don't know if she was at University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] or where.
Speaker 1: You may be right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: So what did she do that was significant?
Speaker 2: Barbara Jordan?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I just thought her eloquence was (laughter), she was inspirational.  And she, you know, she had a great command of English and phrasing and, what was one of the things she said--oh, it was about the, about the founding fathers leaving us out of the constitutional discussion.  I'll have to think, if I, 'cause it's a great phrase and then, you want it quoted exactly but, you know, I thought her questions were penetrating.  And I didn't have the sense from her--I could be wrong--but my recollections, I didn't have the sense from her that she was grandstanding.  She seemed to have a really in depth knowledge of the [U.S.] Constitution and, of course, she stood out 'cause she was Barbara Jordan and, you know, there weren't many African Americans that participated in that, in that process.
Story_ID: 635735
Speaker 1: So when you, when you were on the verge of graduating from law school [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey], what were your prospects?  Oh, I forgot, I'm sorry, this is something I did not mention, that you were an Earl Warren scholar in law school (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the NAACP's [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Earl Warren fund [Earl Warren Scholarship].  I think it's still affiliated, would award scholarships and so I had applied for, and it's a, it's a merit based thing.  And, so I received a stipend each of the three years.  I don't remember what it was to help defray the expense of law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seems quite like quite an honor there (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it was.  I was quite--it was administered by a gentleman for many, many years by the name of--who did many great things for many young people like myself at the time--Butler Henderson [Butler T. Henderson].
Speaker 1: Is he still around?
Speaker 2: No, he's passed on.
Speaker 1: And he was a lawyer, too, I take it, right?
Speaker 2: I take, yes, I believe he was.
Story_ID: 635736
Speaker 1: So when you, when you're ready to graduate [from Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey], you, what are you focusing on?
Speaker 2: Well, by this time, I've pretty well formed the view that or the goal of working to represent indigent people during my time, in the criminal law area.  During my time in law school, I had, I had worked in the summer for the public defender in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], the Defender Association of Philadelphia, which was a Philadelphia public defender.  I had worked also during the school term--I can't remember which--it was my first or second year, for a public interest law firm, which was known at the time as Kairys, Rudovsky and McQuiggan [Kairys, Rudovsky, Messing, Feinberg and Lin LLP, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  K-A-I-R-Y-S, Rudovsky, R-U-, boy, you could probably look it up, and McQuiggan.  I can't spell any of those names.  That firm has since continued.  It's taken on, it's had different iterations as people have moved in and out, but Dave Rudovsky [David Rudovsky] is still there, one of, one of, one of the really fine lawyers in the area of civil, civil rights and, in the country, well recognized also professor, University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  We just honored him last night.  We have a defender organization that meets once a year of old defenders and current defenders.  He just go--we had, just had our third annual meeting, and it's, and he got, he was one of those honorees, so it was great to see him yesterday.  And, so, yeah, I had worked in, under, at the defender, and with David and his colleagues and knew that I wanted to represent poor folks who could not, who couldn't afford good lawyers.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, now the Def- you worked for the Defender Association of Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: That's the formal name, yes.
Speaker 1: Now this is a not- oh, that's, okay, and this is a not-for-profit that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --does what?  It's different from just having a public defender's office.
Speaker 2: It's a public defender, yeah.  It's, I don't say this out of any particular sense of a need to defend public defenders.  There are many great public defender organizations around the country, but this is generally recognized, has been over the years as one of the preeminent public defender services in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked for them at a time when they used to, years and years ago, when they were in their infancy, exist over a restaurant on Sansom Street in Philadelphia, a restaurant by the name of Stouffer's.  And they've evolved to this day to where I understand from last evening's events, I think they have over 230 lawyers, and actually lost about thirty because of some financial difficulties they're currently having.  But it's just grown into a really top shelf law firm that happens to be not-for-profit that gets its funding from the City of Philadelphia, probably some state funding and probably some federal funding in there as well and probably some private contributions.  And they, their mission is to provide free legal services and for people charged with crimes, all kinds of crimes, from capital homicide to retail theft, you know, petty theft.
Story_ID: 635737
Speaker 1: The American justice system, you know, I know there's lots been written about it, and people sing the praises of it, but what happens when you get in trouble, and you don't have any money?  What would happen if you didn't have a pub- public defender's office?
Speaker 2: Well, I think most jurisdictions now have set up public defender organizations because the [U.S.] Supreme Court has mandated it.  You have a, you have a right and an entitlement to a lawyer when there is the possibility of incarceration, so I don't know that there's a place in the country--there may be--that doesn't have, that hasn't provided for some type of free legal defense.  And, so I don't know that the premise of your question really works--
Speaker 1: Okay.  No, all right, I don't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) But the, if you--so the difference is in how the not-for-profits operate then, right?  Is that what you're saying?  If Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] has a preeminent one, it means that theirs operates better than, say, another--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it, all defenders organizations like anything else in life, I think, are not created equal.  All law firms don't function necessarily as well as one to the next.  But, you know, the Philly defender was organized by some dedicated and smart people who put a lot of, lot of energy into and gave a lot of thought to what was necessary to provide effective representation in a big city environment to people charged with crimes to push back against the power of the state.  And they went about their business in a way that has led them to set up a, you know, a board of directors to be one of the first organizations of its type to have formal training for its young lawyers to setting up something they call a special defense unit, which was dedicated with, filled, populated with very experienced lawyers to handle some of the more egregious crimes, and then eventually setting up a homicide division to have lawyers who either were or became experienced at handling homicide cases.  You should expect, I think, that you would find organizations of this level of sophistication and, in big cities around the country--Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York], Los Angeles [California], Boston [Massachusetts], you know, and I think you do of, to--we have a good defender service here in Wilmington [Delaware] on the state side.  There's also federal public defenders.  The organization in Philly has a separate arm called the federal defenders here [Federal Community Defender Office].  And around the country in the federal system, you have separately funded and organized federal public defenders.  Many of them are court affiliated.  In Philly, it's not court affiliated--it's what they call a community defender.  It's a part of the organization I described to you earlier, the Defender Association of Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], but they really are.  They're run by, they have a different chief.  They're different lawyers who deal with federal crimes.  So you have these two organizations for state public defenders and federal public defenders functioning, I think, pretty effectively, to provide good legal representation to people who cannot otherwise afford it.
Story_ID: 635738
Speaker 1: So everybody has a right to a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the state is obligated to provide lawyers for (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, if you're, if you're, if you've been charged, you can't be incarcerated unless you, without the benefit of counsel. If you've been charged with something that could result in your incarceration, you have the right to an attorney.  You can represent yourself.  You have a constitutional right to represent yourself, as well, but you have a right to, yeah, if you, particularly if you've been charged with a felony or a crime that's going to result in the possible incarceration, for more than a year, yeah.  The famous case that you'll recognize perhaps by the [U.S.] Supreme Court, decided by the Supreme Court, a number of years ago, Gideon versus Wainwright [Gideon v. Wainwright, 1963], which was a genesis of that right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess I--maybe I'm just unduly confused by--I'm just (laughter), thinking.  Now I know that everybody has a, there is public defender offices at different levels of government, but this is, but we're talking--the organization you work for in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], is a, like a city, a function of the city, or is it a separate not-for-profit?
Speaker 2: No, it's not, it's not an arm of the city.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, it's not an arm of the City in Philadelphia.  It's a separately organized not-for-profit which is generally known as a community defender organization.  In the federal context, most of the defender organizations are affiliated by the, with the courts and are funded through the administrative office of the United States courts or by the federal government.  The--now let me back up 'cause the Defender Association of Philadelphia [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], nonetheless, has contracts even though it's a community defender, and there, and has a separate board of directors.  There's no, in other words, the city council of Philadelphia [Philadelphia City Council] has no say over how that organization is going to be run.  That organization, the say in that regard is with the board of directors and, of course, the senior administration, the chief defendant, first assistant and that kind of thing.  But they do receive funds and substantial funds from the city because the city's got to provide funding for lawyers, for free lawyers, if you will, yeah, that are the result of our tax dollars, that go, you know, we get taxed, and these, a budget is created, and monies are budgeted to fund organizations like the defenders association and other public defender services around the county.  Federal government provides funding as well for organizations like this.  State government frequently provides funding for organizations like this.  So these are the funding sources and, of course, they're always, there's the opportunity for, in the case of a community defender, I believe, I'm accurate, I speak correctly.  And when I say that a private individual could make a contribution to a community defender as a not-profit, not-for-profit and help fund the organization.  I believe that's accurate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could a not-for-profit then, you know, in the public defender business then focus on an area that they want to provide, you know, do they do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do they focus on certain areas that they want to provide--
Speaker 2: No, they provide general, across the board, defense.  But for a long time, there was no homicide unit in Philadelphia, in the Philadelphia defender.  There was no special defense unit.  So it, the, if they can get the funding to fund those kinds of operations as they did in these instances, they can organize themselves in the way that they see fit.  But they have the obligation, as a result of the receipt of funding, to provide services at various levels of the various phases of the criminal justice system, of the process to individuals who are, get caught up in the criminal justice, get charged with crimes.
Story_ID: 635739
Speaker 1: Now you were with them from, you were with the Philadelphia [Defender Association of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --almost seven years you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, roughly, I think that's probably about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what were some of the memorable cases, or are there any cases that stand out or for--
Speaker 2: You know, I--a number of significant felonies.  As I said, we didn't have a homicide division when I was there, so I didn't do any homicides.  I did some serious major felony cases like rapes and robberies and armed robberies and some burglaries that, but none that were notorious, you know, that necessarily splashed all over the newspapers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you then.  Were there any demographic trends that you noticed as a, in your position as a public defender, in terms of who was accused of what?
Speaker 2: And, you know, in the main, it was, it was African Americans that I was representing.  I found that in the main it was African American men that I was representing.  I had white clients and clients of other ethnic persuasions, you know, Latinos, and might have represented an Asian or two--not many.  And that's a part, due to the demographics of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and in part due to the enforcement patterns and how, where the focus was at any given time by the police department, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I, you know, that's what I was kind of referring to, if there were any, yeah.  That was, if you can see that from that position, you can actually, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can see it, and by just eyeballing your client.  And I never, I'm sure the organization probably kept some kind of statistics.  Everybody probably kept--the police, I'm sure, kept statistics of the (unclear), kept statistics, but just my, just speaking anecdotally, I'd have to say that the significant majority of my clients were black, and those are black men in the main.
Story_ID: 635740
Speaker 1: Was there a prosecutorial trend that you could, that you noticed in terms of this--I mean, you know, that, in terms of the amount of evidence that was required to maybe charge someone who is African American and--
Speaker 2: Pros- I don't understand your question.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, did it, could you, would--well, the Trayvon Martin case now is a, is a example on some level of the, what happens, what happened there--a gentleman [George Zimmerman] shot a young African American, of course, we all know what happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I'm recounting it for the sake of this.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And, you know, he wasn't charged--I mean, the man that shot, that killed another person was not charged.  It was based on his verbal--
Speaker 2: Yeah, initially, he was not charged.
Speaker 1: Yeah, initially, he wasn't charged, and had it been the other way around, it's hard for us to imagine that a black kid, if he's shot with this gun, wouldn't have been charged, you know.  It's just the--I mean, so, you know, did you see patterns in terms of how prosecutors deal with, you know, who they charge, and who they don't when they--
Speaker 2: You mean, was there discrimination based on race?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: None that I could prove ever, as a lawyer, none that I could prove.  Do I have, and did I and do I feel in my gut that at times, a defendant wouldn't have been there but for the fact that he was black?  Yeah, yeah, that happened, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had an experience with a judge--I won't name him--where I felt that he was discriminating, and discriminated against my client who was black.  And the short story is that it was a private lawyer, a privately retained lawyer who tried a case.  This was a bench trial, a non-jury trial, in the front of the judge, and very similar facts, same charges.  I think it was some kind of assault.  And he permitted the young man to remain on bail, pending sentencing.  Similar backgrounds, similar absence of contact, previous contact with the criminal justice system.  I tried my case.  He convicted and locked him up.  And I was incensed, and I asked for the opportunity to speak with the judge in the presence of the ADA, the assistant district attorney and on the record with a stenographer.  Out of the presence of those in the courtroom, I asked for they call a side bar.  And I went to the side where only, pretty much, we could be heard, 'cause I didn't want to embarrass the judge.  And I didn't want him to feel, like I was grandstanding or anything like that.  And I said to the judge, I said, "Judge So and So, I don't think justice is being meted out here today in an evenhanded fashion."  That's what, pretty much, pretty close to what I said.  And he looked at me, "Mr. Sleet [HistoryMaker Gregory Sleet], I don't know what you mean."  I said, "Judge, you just locked up my client, and you didn't lock up the other one.  You tell me the difference in the two."  "You're being impertinent, Mr. Sleet."  I said, "No, I'm not being impertinent.  I'm telling you what I see and what I feel, and what I've just observed.  And I'm telling you this--you're not going to try another case in this, in this room for the rest of the week until you let my client out."  Now that bordered on contempt, being contemptuous.  It might have gone over the border, I don't know.  But in any event, what I meant by that, just as background for you, I was the public defender assigned to this particular room for that week.  This was what's called a list room.  They still have them where nothing but bench trials go on.  And if the public defender would, and still does, I'm sure to this day, have the, most of the cases assigned to that particular room.  So if you had a public defender who, for some reason, was not wanting to, and willing to cooperate, then you weren't going to try any cases, or you weren't going to get very much work done unless you replaced that public defender or locked him up or whatever the case may be.  And, so he said, "Well, we'll see about that."  I went back to the office [of the Defender Association of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], spoke with the chief defender, told him what had happened.  The chief defender, being a fellow by the name of Benler [ph.], he said, "We'll support you a hund- a thousand percent."  They didn't try another case that week.  They let him out--the judge let him out.  So that is an example of one of those times when I thought race played a role in what I was seeing in front of me.  And that was one example where I thought I could prove it and, so, you know.  But as far as describing to you patterns or that I could say resulted from a biased application of the law, I'm sure it happened, I'm sure it happened, but I couldn't prove it--not then 'cause, you know, nobody was keeping, you know, we weren't, that wasn't what we were doing.  We were representing, representing a defendant at a time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we got a good story (laughter).  That's a, that's a really interesting story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm glad this is one that only you could tell--
Speaker 2: Yeah, good.
Speaker 1: --you know, so thank you.
Story_ID: 635741
Speaker 1: So you were there [Defender Association of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for seven years and, now, now you went into--from what I understand you went into private practice at the end of seven years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I was actually approached by a very fine lawyer by the name of Dan Alva [Daniel-Paul Alva] one day who, so, you know, how long, much longer, you plan to stay over there (laughter)?  And I said, "Well, you know, I, it's just sort of gotten comfortable, and I know I've probably stayed longer than I should," 'cause you can get pigeonholed in life.  And I was really probably beyond the point where you run that risk and, you know, you sort of narrow your prospects.  And I was tiring of the job and the volume and the clients and the work and, so he offered me the opportunity to join his small firm, and I took it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was called LaCheen and Alva [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the time.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-A-C-H-E-E-N and A-L-V-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were with LaCheen and Alva and for--
Speaker 2: I don't remember the years I stayed with them.  I think I provided that to you, or it should be in my bio.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '83 [1983] to '90 [1990] it says here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Here's another seven year--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: Oh, not seven.
Speaker 2: I wasn't there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was it '83 [1983] to '90 [1990]?  Well, whatever it says, I guess is what it, what it was.  I stayed with LaCheen and Alva for a period of time in the private practice of law, doing criminal defense and plaintiffs' personal injury.  And we were also trying to get ourselves into the business of representing athletes and also some, had some elements of a music industry practice representing producers and perhaps trying to represent some artists and that kind of thing.  It didn't pan out so well.  It was my desire along with a couple of buddies of mine to have our own firm.  And we--I left LaCheen and Alva to embark upon that effort with a fellow by the name of Romaine Phillips and Mike Farrell [J. Michael Farrell].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We did that for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's, okay, so the name of that firm was that--
Speaker 2: Sleet and Farrell [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay, Sleet and Farrell.
Speaker 2: Sleet, Farrell, and Phillips actually--initially.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is before you become--it says here in 1990, you became the deputy attorney general.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's why I don't think, whatever you're looking at, I wasn't at LaCheen and Alva from--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the period of time that you have me there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So what's the question?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just trying to track that.  What happens next in your life?
Speaker 2: Well, after LaCheen and Alva, we started Sleet, Phillips, and Farrell--Sleet, Farrell, and Phillips.  And then, I'm becoming pretty dispirited about the practice of law altogether and wanting actually to leave the practice of law.  I end up joining up with a fellow by Ron Harper [Ronald J. Harper], who had a small firm [Harper and Paul Law Firm] in Germantown, the area of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It was a neighborhood firm, and I did some work for him.  And I began working from my home as well.  And then, if I, if memory serves correctly, an opportunity came along here in Delaware for me to join the Delaware attorney general's office.
Story_ID: 635742
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990], right?  Is this correct date for you joining the depu- as a, the state's attorney's office (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Delaware attorney general's office?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, De- the Delaware attorney general's office, right.
Speaker 2: That's approximately the right date, I think, though--was it '92 [1992]?  It might have been--I'll need to check that.  I'll need to look--do you have my resume?  I'll need to look at that because it might have been '92 [1992], trying to remember, it's '90 [1990] or '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I gave Delaware attorney general's office, it seems to me, I didn't stay four years there.  That was followed on by a relatively short stint with Hercules, Incorporated [Hercules, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware].  Let's see, so '90 [1990], yeah, it seems to me that might be right, '90 [1990] to '92 [1992] at the state attorney general's office, '92 [1992] to '94 [1994] at Hercules.
Speaker 1: Right, that's--
Speaker 2: I think, I think that's it, yeah, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything significant about the Delaware attorney general's office?
Speaker 2: No, what I did there was I was brought in as a senior lawyer to, on the civ- in the civil division to handle what they call major civil cases, significant lawsuits against the State of Delaware.  And there's nothing in particular that happened during that time that necessarily stands out to me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what about, what about the Hercules--
Speaker 2: What stands out to me about my job at the Delaware attorney general's office was the call I got one day from a friend who said to me that they need a lawyer over at Hercules, Incorporated.  And I said, "Okay, what kind of lawyer?"  And they said, "Well, they're looking for an in house general corporate lawyer."  I said, "Well, I don't know why, Charlie [ph.], you're calling me because, you know, you know me, and I've been a trial lawyer most of my time, and never spent any time in house, and never spent any time, any significant amount time in business consulting as a lawyer and or business litigation or that kind of thing," a little bit, you know, minor staff.  He said, "Well, go take the interview, Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory Sleet]," you know, "I've suggested you.  They want to interview you and, you know," so I said, "Okay."  So I went over to the interview with the general counsel of Hercules, Incorporated.  And the associate general counsel needed, I guess that was his title, who needed the help.  And the interview, the interview went really well and they liked me, and I thought that, from what they were describing, sounded like an interesting opportunity to me.  I never thought I'd want to go in house, but I said, "Well, it, here, it might be an opportunity."  The money was significantly better than I was making at the time.  I, by this time, now have, let's see, my son's [Moneta Sleet III] born in '87 [1987], my daughter [Kelsi Sleet] was born in '91 [1991].  So, you know, I've got a young family, and figured I've got to have my, a little bit on that ball in terms of trying to make more money (laughter).  And, so I agree to join Hercules, and that's where I practiced as a, as a general in house lawyer.  I was not doing litigation, though I did manage some litigation for them.  I gave business advice, business law advice, antitrust, things of that nature, contracts, wrote contracts, negotiated contracts with businesspeople and had a, had a pretty good time.  I really enjoyed the people.  It was a--Hercules had a very good legal division.  And I figured that I was going to be just fine there, that I would, I envisioned the rapid rise in the ranks of the organization in the legal department, and maybe perhaps even finding my way over to the business side of things.
Speaker 1: Now Hercules makes gun powder, right?  At least (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It used to be--
Speaker 1: --traditionally.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't any longer.  It used, it would--broke, it was ordered broken off from DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware] in 1912 or 1913--I think it is by a vice chancellor here in Delaware.  Antitrust issues, I think, generated that order, that decision.  And it was then called HPC, the Hercules Powder Company, and that's what they made.  They make gunpowder, they evolved, as DuPont evolved, and the many companies evolved.  They evolved to manufacture many other things, including Titan, Titan, Titan rockets which the delivery--it used to be the delivery system or main delivery system for intercontinental ballistic missiles (laughter) for warheads, rather, that could travel through continents.  They made many, many things--food additives, fiber, the wrapping for Frito-Lay potato chips, for instance, you know, stuff in the rugs, all kinds of things were made.  It became a commodities company, and then a specialty chemicals company, and I don't know what it is.  It's a pretty much been reduced in size significantly, and it went down in size from a Fortune 250.  I don't even know if it's lon- any longer a Fortune 500 company, but, yeah, that's what I did for two years there.
Story_ID: 635743
Speaker 1: Got, then got a call from a friend by the name of Jim Gilliam, Jr. [James H. Gilliam, Jr.] who had--he had a friend by the name of Joseph Biden--yeah, it's that Joseph Biden.  And as it happened, the vice president who was, of course, at the time, a senior senator, this was back in the 1990s was looking to replace the United States attorney because President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] had been elected.  And it fell then to the senior member of the congressional delegation, that was sort of the culture of the time, to nominate people for presidential appointments to significant positions like that of U.S. attorney.  The vice president clearly had it in his mind--I say clearly because that's the way Jim explained it to me that he was very interested in finding a so called minority to take the position.  He thought it was well past the time that someone of that ilk occupy that job.  Nobody had ever, no--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now he was Senator Joe Biden (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was Senator Biden at the time, yeah, senior senator.
Speaker 2: --of Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: From Delaware.
Speaker 2: From Connecticut.  Yeah, Delaware.
Speaker 1: Delaware, yeah.  And, so Jim called and said, "Would you be interested?"  And I said, "I don't think so."  I said, "I've got a pretty good job here [Hercules, Inc., Wilmington, Delaware], and I think my prospects look pretty bright."  And President Clinton wasn't altogether all that popular at the time.  And I said, "Why would I do that, Jim?"  And he said, "Well, you know, do me a favor, go over, and at least meet.  He has some senior people that would like to meet with you."  I said, "For you, Jim, I'll do it."  Jim was a good friend and mentor.  And, so I went over--he told me I would be getting a call.  In the next, in the coming days, I got a call from a staffer of the senator's, inviting me to a breakfast at the Hotel du Pont [Wilmington, Delaware], I--right up the street from here.  Went to that breakfast, and as I'm walking in through the lobby of the hotel, I see the senator himself talking with the then attorney general, a fellow, fellow by the name of Oberly [Charles M. Oberly III] of Delaware, state attorney general.  And I walked by and I wave, and they stopped me to say hello, and I told them I was on the, on the way to this meeting.  And senator said, "Yeah, I'll be joining you in a few minutes."  I said, "Oh, you're coming," (laughter)?  I wasn't expecting that.  And I, so I was pretty loose, you know, I wasn't fi- figuring I was going to have to meet with the United States senator, but he said, "I'll be there, I thought I'd crash the party."  So we went in, had a nice breakfast with Senator Biden, as you, as we all know, can dominate a conversation.  And he asked me some questions, and I gave the best answers I could.  He was very engaging and curious about me and we had a good talk and he--the long--the short of it is, he ultimately called up, or someone called me--I think he called me, and asked me if I would be willing to have my name submitted to the president for nomination to the United States Senate to be confirmed as United States attorney.  I had, by this time, conferred with family and my then wife [Mary Grantham Sleet] and Jim, Jr., and other people whose opinions matter to me.  It mattered to me also, and many of them pointed this out to me that it, that I was going to be the first African American to do this job, and that somebody had to do it, and it was an important thing to be done and being, you know, of after all, being a presidential appointee, they said, was a pretty significant thing.  And being the chief federal law enforcement officer was a pretty significant thing in this district.
Story_ID: 635744
Speaker 1: So I agreed with them and went ahead and did that job for four years, a little more than, when the then still senator [Joe Biden] calls me up and says, "Greg [HistoryMaker Gregory Sleet], there's a, there's job, there's a, there's a vacancy.  Do you need me?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Sorry about that.  There's a vacancy on the district court [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware].  One of the district judges has just retired.  Are you interested?"  I wasn't really interested in being a judge just like I wasn't really interested initially in being a federal prosecutor.  But what he said to me that made sense was, he said, "Look, Greg, you can be the U.S. attorney as long as I'm in office, and as long as we got a Democrat in the White House.  But you become a judge, a federal judge, you're a judge for life, if you choose to stay that long."  And he said, "Again, I want to tell you, you're going to be the first of your race, the first of any so called minority race to do this job.  It's an important thing."  You know, I went out and conferred with my mother [Juanita Harris Sleet] and my then wife [Mary Grantham Sleet] and others and Jim, Sr.--Jim, Jr. [James H. Gilliam, Jr.], rather, and 'cause he was also, yeah, you know, he was involved in discussions with the senator as well.  And I eventually after some period of time, agreed to have my name submitted.  One of the things that caused me to hesitate was I was really enjoying the job with being the United States attorney.  I thought I'd sort of really finally found and hit my stride which I described generally as being a leader of people on, and in this particular instance, leading an office of very bright and energetic minds who happened to be lawyers on what I considered to be a good mission, both as a prosecutor and as a civil lawyer for the United States.  And it also afforded me the opportunity to have a voice in our community in ways that people would ask me to have a voice, not necessarily in politics but just to try to inspire, and young people most especially, into that in the main.  And, so I was really reluctant, had a lot of friends there, I was really reluctant to leave.  We were, moreover, involved in a pretty significant investigation at the time that ultimately became one of national scope and notoriety and resulted in the writing of a number of books about it and a TV movie ['And Never Let Her Go'] that was--I think the principal character was played by Mark Harmon, the TV actor, involved the investigation and ultimate prosecution of a fellow by the name of Thomas Capano who had, was ultimately convicted in the state courts.  We took over and commen- commenced a federal investigation which ultimately led to a transfer of jurisdiction to the state courts because, ultimately, the charge ended up being first degree murder, wherein he was accused of murdering his then, a lady friend of his.  So I was, I was, felt I was very much needed to see this investigation through to the end, to provide the support that I needed to provide for the assistant United States attorneys who were involved in doing the investigation which at times was difficult, and where it required us to step on some toes.  Capano was very powerful, came from a powerful family, was a powerful lawyer in town, well connected.  We had to do some things that were not altogether popular and well taken by some people.  So I thought that it would be good for them to have the push of the presidentially appointed United States attorney behind those efforts.  And, so, ultimately, we got that done.  I finished filling out the questionnaire.  The then deputy attorney general called me up one day, Eric Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.], he was now by this time deputy attorney general.  He called me because I had been called by a staffer at home late one night in response to my sending the questionnaire with some question that I felt was, could have waited 'til the next day.  And I was very sensitive about my, what I perceived to be a massive invasion into, into my privacy and that of my family, which was necessary to investigate, for the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], to investigate my background and my bona fides and whether, you know, I was fit to serve.  But it's very intrusive, it's very intrusive, and this particular evening, I wasn't in the mood to be called at that hour of the night.  And I laid the poor young assistant out.  I get a call the next day from the then deputy attorney general--, "Greg, do you want to be a judge or not?"  I said, "Frankly, Eric, I don't," (laughter).  He said, "Well, don't say that to people" (laughter).  And he said, "We need you to be a judge.  You need to be a judge."  And we had a good conversation and he calmed me down, and so I went on and completed the work (laughter) I needed to complete to ultimately get nominated and confirmed.

Speaker 1: How was that process, the confirmation pro- process?  Now you were--this is at a time when you had a really contentious [U.S.] Congress, like we have now, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it was, it was pretty easy for me.  Number one, I was a prose- federal prosecutor, you know, the chief federal prosecutor, so I had already gone through a confirmation proc- process and investigation process.  The investigations, perhaps not quite as in depth for the U.S. attorney jobs as it was for this job, but it's in depth enough.  So from that perspective, they knew I was confirmable.  I was told, I believe I did an effective job as the United States attorney so from that perspective, I was, I was attractive.  I was going to be the first minority, so called, so that was, I guess, to some degree, to some people, interesting and attractive.  The most important thing, though, was that I was the protege, I was the--the recommender was Joseph Biden [Joe Biden].  That was the most important factor in my very easy trip through the confirmation process.  As you know, the senator had been, by that time, in the [U.S.] Senate a long time and by '94 [1994].  And he was, at the time, I think, still chair of the Senate judiciary committee [U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary]--no, he was not, no, he was not.  They were in the minority at this time.  He was, he was a ranking member, I think.  Orrin Hatch, I believe, was the chair of the judiciary--he was, he was the chair of the judiciary committee at the time.  In any event, the senator had, and I suspect to this day has--quite confident he does--many, many friends in the United States Senate.  Among them, Orrin Hatch, and a fellow by the name of Chuck Grassley, Charles Grassley.  I'll never forget we were--the senator had me down to lunch in the Senate Dining Room to talk about the nomination.  And we were walking underground, and he walks up to this tall gentleman, ruddy faced gentleman, and he grabs him by the jowls and he shakes his jowls, and he says, "I want to introduce you to somebody and I want you to be nice to him" (laughter).  And it was Chuck Grassley, who was known, could be rather hard on folks (laughter).  We were going through that process.  Particularly Democrats and Chuck greeted, the senator greeted me and Chuck Grassley greeted me warmly--the senator did, and promised the senator he would, he would be kind and take care of me.  Senator Hatch was very gracious during the confirmation process.  I was--my hearings were conducted along with three other judges, two for, I think it was actually one for the First Circuit and myself.  And I think there was another district judge for--I think, she was out of California, and one other, I can't remember.  The only senators who showed up in person for the hearing were Senators Biden and Hatch.  Staffers were there from every other senators' office who was on the committee and, so that was every bit as much they--we were instructed.  It's like having the senator there.  But the fact of the matter was that there was no one contro- it was controversial at all on the panel.  And I think we all benefitted from the very good relationship between Senators Biden and Hatch.  Senator Hatch came out into the audience before the hearing.  He was, he greeted us, all the families, he shook hands, he knew kids.  I mean, it was (laughter) really nothing like, some of what you've seen, and it was certainly, you know, you know, nothing like some of the more contentious hearings we've seen televised that have occurred in the senate judiciary committee.  So it was, it was, it was a very comfortable ride through that process for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, this is in 1994, all right, '4 [1994].
Speaker 2: Well, I came on here in '98 [1998].  I was U.S. attorney from '94 [1994] to '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the process took about--
Speaker 2: Oh, the process took more, longer than it should 'cause I was, I kept delaying the process, yeah.  I mean, I just--not delaying intentionally, but I wasn't as quick on the draws I, as they wanted me to be in terms of filling out forms and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 635746
Speaker 1: Now you were, in the interim, you were appointed by Janet Reno to the Attorney General's Advisory Committee [Attorney General's Advisory Committee of U.S. Attorneys].
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was U.S. attorney, ev- every U.S. attorney general, I believe--well, certainly in my memory, has a committee, a group of United States attorneys that he or she, and in the instance of Janet Reno, Janet Reno, she convened or appointed to serve on an advisory committee called the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, the AGAC.  And we would come together periodically.  I forget the intervals.  I don't think it was as much as one- once a month.  It was at least quarterly.  It may have been more frequently, and as needed, to help her vet any number of issues to, there were, you know, there was the committee of the whole, and then there were any number of sub-committees.  I served on a number of sub-committees.  I can't remember them now.  And, so I was appointed--usually, usually, I think the term was usually a one year term.  She decided to extend my term an additional year, and made me then the vice chair of the committee.  The chair was the now homeland secretary, Janet Napolitano.  So I was Janet Napolitano's vice chair.  So the chair, as you might imagine, ran the meetings, and the, and the vice chair would do so in her absence.
Story_ID: 635747
Speaker 1: So this is 1996, you say, where you're actually, '98 [1998], you're actually confirmed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '98 [1998], I get nominated by President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].  Again, he, of course, had nominated me before to the [U.S.] Senate and so he nom- this time, nominates me for the bench here.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so, well, was it what you--I mean, did you like being a judge?
Speaker 2: Not initially, not at all.  To be perfectly candid, number one, Larry [Larry Crowe], it wasn't something that I had necessarily--a job that I necessary- necessarily aspired to do.  I, from afar, perceived the job as unduly confining and restrictive.  And just didn't think I wanted to be cloistered like that.  And I like people and, you know, I talked to others who had done the job.  I knew other judges, obviously, I practiced law a long time.  I just didn't think it was a job I wanted to do, but I ended up doing it and, initially, not particularly liking it.  I didn't like being cut off.  I didn't like--I particularly, I think, would become distressed about the sentencing aspect of the job, sentencing people to periods of incarceration and the like.  And I remember one day I had a particularly difficult sentencing and it was a winter day.  It was snowy, I remember, and I needed to get out of the building.  It was an evening, evening time, and I just needed to take a walk before going home.  And I ran into my good friend and mentor, Jim Gilliam, Jr. [James H. Gilliam, Jr.].  And he, we, we stopped to say a few words, and he could see that I was stressed out.  And he said, "What's the matter?"  I said, "I don't know about this job, Jim."  And he says, "C'mon, let's go over here to the hotel."  He meant the Hotel du Pont [Wilmington, Delaware], "And let's have a glass of wine."  And we sat down, and he helped me through that evening, helped me through a difficult moment in my time as a judge and, you know, I have nothing but thanks and praise for him as a friend and mentor.  For that and many other things that, many other conversations that we had while he was alive.  Tragically and unfortunately, he's not with us any longer.
Speaker 1: Did the sentencing, did you, did you at the time disagree with the sentencing laws--I mean, how they were structured in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't like the sentencing guidelines which, at the time when I first came on, were mandatory, and I very much chafed against them.  I had been, I had grown up as a criminal lawyer in an unguided system, mainly unguided, in Pennsylvania.  It wasn't until my--near the end of my tenure as a Pennsylvania lawyer, Philadelphia lawyer, that guidelines became, or came to be introduced into the criminal justice system.  They were not mandatory guidelines, as I recall, but by the time I got to the bench [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware], the guidelines were mandatory and required in my view a fair number of (pronunciation) machinations on, machinations, however that word is pronounced.  But, you know, slights of hand and twist and turns to try to get to what I might perceive as a more just result than what I felt that the guidelines dictated.  And, so that, sentencing in general, I think most trial judges, who most of the judges who do the sentencings in state and federal court, are probably sentencing, is probably the most difficult job that we have as a judge, the most stressful for, I'd suspect most of us would agree.  It certainly is for me, still to this day, even though the guidelines are no longer mandatory.  And I'm very comfortable in an unguided way, in an unguided system.  So, yeah, that's the toughest part of my job.
Story_ID: 635748
Speaker 1: Now in--is there a particular case that you thought that sentencing was like too steep--I mean, that you could talk about.
Speaker 2: Sentencing that was too--
Speaker 1: Yeah, just way out of proportion to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Once, you know, like over time, you develop the ability to not take this stuff home.  And I call it the 'M*A*S*H' syndrome.  You get used to the blood on the floor in the surgical environment a little bit.  Maybe that's a little crass, but you do develop a thicker skin.  You have to in order to not internalize this stuff.  And, so there was a fellow by the name of John Walter Trala, who was, after a jury trial, convicted of a very serious bank robbery, a gunpoint bank robbery, which he had committed, I'm convinced, at the behest of a woman [Melissa Bailey], who was then at the time, the head teller in a local bank here, who was stealing money in significant sums to feed her husband's [Philip Bailey] cocaine addiction.  And this was around the time of Y2K [Year 2000], and she had devised a plan to stage this bank robbery, robbery.  And she enlisted John Walter Trala to come and commit the robbery, so that she could cover up her dealings, her, the thefts, significant--I think it was over four hundred thousand dollars in proceeds.  Trala dutifully came in at point of gun, robbed the bank, got caught.  The case presented some very interesting issues around for the first time in this district, the use of DNA, and because some items, some garments were left at the scene that had DNA matter on them.  They ultimately compared that DNA to the suspect's DNA, and ultimately, he was convicted.  Sentencing in federal court is a very detailed, it's very laborious, it can be, it takes time.  There's a significant and substantial background investigation done called the presentencing investigation done into the facts of the crime, the, or the, you know, the background of the crime and the background of the individual offender.  And then a recommendation is made usually.  And this, we were still in the mandatory guideline period.  The guidelines required at the time that I impose a sentence of twenty-six years.  This fairly young man, who had just an horrific background, from--no, no, I don't want to hasten to add just 'cause we talked, just because we talked earlier about the complexion of many that I used to represent and many in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when I was doing criminal defense and many that I see that we haven't talked about that necessarily yet, as criminal defendants in front of me.  But I will, I want to point out that in this instance, this happened to be a white gentleman who was just subject to the worst kind of abuse as an infant, a toddler, as a child.  And he was old enough to have gotten, you would hope, well beyond that period of time and so, that he could no longer necessarily use that as a crutch, but it helped him form who he became in some very sig- significant and substantial ways.  And at the end of the day, even though he committed this violent act, it was aberrational.  He was not, did not have a violent history, though he had an extensive criminal history.  He did not have a violent history.  He didn't--nobody was injured physically.  There was psychological trauma to those who had a gun pointed in their face that day.  But at the end of the day, the federal public defender here was able to preserve some issues that went up on appeal sentencing issues, that went up on appeal to the United States Supreme Court.  The United States Supreme Court remanded that case back, post-mandatory guidelines, what we call, we mark that as the Booker period.  The Booker case [United States v. Booker, 2005] is the Supreme Court case that rendered the guidelines that made them not mandatory.  So, post-Booker, I get a chance to resentence this guy, this defendant, and was able to impose a sentence that I felt, from my experience, and under the circumstances, was one that I would have imposed at the, at the outset, and that was a fifteen year sentence.  He--I'm recent, and I'm told--do you need to stop?
Speaker 1: Well, just finish your sentence.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He's just been released, I think.
Story_ID: 635749
Speaker 1: Now, 2007, you are appointed chief judge of Delaware, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we--I succeeded my colleague, Sue Robinson [Sue Lewis Robinson], as chief judge here.  We serve in seven year increments, and so, I guess it was 2007.  And, so I'm, I have two more years on my tenure as chief judge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are the responsibilities of chief judge and how do you like that?
Speaker 2: They're primarily administrative and to gather information to make sure that my colleagues are informed about matters that develop out of Washington [D.C.], how the administrative offices of the courts that develop here in the Third Circuit.  We're in the Third Circuit right now.  In other words, the Dela- District of Delaware is a part of the Third Circuit, along with New Jersey and Pennsylvania.  To be the leader of the court [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware], to speak for the court, give the annual address to the Federal Bar Association, to report on the condition of the court, to delegate responsibilities as well, where appropriate and where necessary, work with the--I work closely with the clerk of court, Dr. Peter Dalleo, and the discharge of his responsibilities as leader of the clerk's office.  You know, things as mundane as space, who's going to be assigned space, you know, in the courthouse, where you go and that kind of thing.  And everyday kind of details that you might imagine would come up in the, in the, in the running of any organization are the responsibility of the chief judge.  We're a small court for active judges.  We have three magistrate judges.  We have no senior judges.  So, because of our size, much of what we try to accomplish here is done on a conse- conse- consensus basis, so I try to identify--part of my role, as I see it, is to make sure that I identify those issues, that the other judges are going to want to have input upon, or input on, and to bring us together either through in a meeting--we have two monthly meetings--or we meet twice a month, and or through email, or phone conversation.  Or maybe I visit other judges' chambers and try to coordinate views, and try to see whether we have consensus on a particular issue or not.  On those matters that I consider to be relative- relatively (unclear) and where I feel comfortable, you know, I'm given certain powers to do certain things.  I go ahead and make the calls that need to be made 'cause they don't want to be involved in those anyway.  I didn't, when I wasn't, when I was--I call myself an associate judge when I wasn't chief judge.  There, you know, I didn't want to know about most of these things (laughter).  It's like a death by a thousand cuts (laughter).  It's just a lot of administrative, picky detail and, you know, no, who likes that, nobody likes that.  I don't particularly care for it.  Do I mind being or do I enjoy being the leader of the court and the judge who's sort of out front?  That's fun, I've enjoyed it.  I have good colleagues and, so they make it fun, you know.
Story_ID: 635750
Speaker 1: Two cases that we have--I guess if there are others, I guess we should talk about, but one big case in 2009, the Delaware sports betting case.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the other case was a case in 2010 about a sex tourist trial--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --of Thomas Pendleton [United States v. Thomas S. Pendleton].
Speaker 2: Pendleton, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Yes, so--
Speaker 1: --do you want to talk about these two or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, I can talk about those.
Speaker 1: There are two others.
Speaker 2: I'll talk about those, and one other--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --matter that's more recent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: State of Delaware had a statute, or has a statute, and they, and they wanted to bring--I'm going to make this real short 'cause it got rather complicated.  They wanted to bring Nevada style sports betting to Delaware.  They thought--the state did--that they should be grandfathered in by virtue of some existing statute, so on the Delaware books and endeavored and went about the business of contracting with casinos and other, you know, people who do that kind of thing to set up a sports betting operation or set up sports betting operations here in Delaware.  The NFL [National Football League] suit, the short of it is that before--I'm trying to remember the legal trigger for this--before we could get too deep into the case, the NFL appealed a ruling of mine that it resulted in, to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit], resulted in the panel, the Third Circuit panel, that decided the appeal, essentially deciding the case.  And, so I never got to decide that case, but I did have that case assigned.  I presided over it for some period of time.  And it was, you know, it was, it got a lot of national attention because of, (laughter) it's the NFL.  And so, that was interesting.  I don't know that I necessarily agreed with what the Third Circuit panel did, but they got the last word, they get the last word.  That's why we have appellate courts to review the actions of district courts.
Story_ID: 635751
Speaker 1: The Pendleton case [United States v. Thomas S. Pendleton] was a case of first impression here in Delaware.  I don't know if it was in the country or not, but Mr. Pendleton [Thomas S. Pendleton] was a gentleman who had sustained multiple convictions, and not only in the United States, but in Europe for various sex offenses committed against young boys.  The last one that he committed was in Germany, I believe, and he had been sentenced to a period of two years of incarceration, of imprisonment.  He had established some connection with Delaware, sufficient connections that the United States attorney's office here had their eye on him.  And when he landed, he found himself under arrest and indicted.  This is a separate sovereign, the United States of America, from that of Germany.  U.S. attorney, the prosecutor here, made a decision that they were going to prosecute him for that very crime that he committed against that young German boy several years ago, and they prosecuted him for crimes against the United States and that, and that child.  Again, it was a very interesting case, from a legal point of view, and one that I think was a case of first impression, at least in the Third Circuit, probably in the country--I'm not sure.  I issued a number of rulings involved in that case which got appealed to the Third Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit].  I was affirmed.  Ultimately, we had a trial.  They brought the young boy from Germany and he testified.  They brought a young man from California, whom this gentleman had molested as a child, when he was in New Jersey, I believe it was.  There were several states that he committed offenses.  By this time, the young man was a grown man, who I'll never forget, as he testified from the witness stand, was obviously still traumatized by what happened.  His mother--he's now abou- about thirty years of age, the gentleman--I'll never forget looking out into the well of the court where the audience was sitting and watching his mother weep uncontrollably as she watched her son testify.  This was the impact, just to describe to you some of the impact that these offense, this offense of this gentleman, this defendant, had on this family.  And this, the young boy who was flown from Germany was clearly traumatized, just visibly, you could see.  And as the individual test- individuals testified, and their voices trembled and tears rolled down their eyes, you could see the trauma.  Thomas Pendleton was a well educated--is a well educated man, and a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I forget how old he was at the time that I ultimately--he was convicted here, but he had developed a scheme, whereby he would run bicycle tours around this country and around in places in the world.  And he would befriend the parents of these young boys, and that was his modus operandi.  That was his entree.  And that's one of the reasons the mother was sitting out in the--crying in the, in the audience because she felt responsible for what had happened to her son.  And, of course, it wasn't her fault.  Mr. Pendleton--it was clear to me, was never going to stop doing what he had already been convicted five times of doing.  And, so I felt it appropriate, and within the meaning of the sentencing statute, and all of the cases that we've been given as guidance, appropriate to give him a maximum, statutory maximum sentence.  I've never done that before.  I've never come close, in my time, in my fourteen years now on the bench [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware], to giving someone a statutory maximum sentence.  I sentenced him to thirty years in prison.
Story_ID: 635752
Speaker 1: The other case that comes to mind, unfortunately, all too, it's all too vivid in my recollection.  I'm going to be a little careful in what I say about it.  But it involves, it's a very, very recent execution of a twenty eight year old African American by the name of Shannon Johnson.  He was executed on the morning of April the 20th this past.  He was executed after an appeal, a petition, for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus by the federal defenders [Federal Community Defender Office], Capital Habeas Unit, here in Delaware, on behalf of what was called and is called a next friend--the next friend in this case being the defendant, Sheldon Johnson's [sic.] half-sister.  That petition was filed here, and at the time of its filing, I was out of the district, away for several days.  I was able to have the petition forwarded to me.  It was about eighty-eight pages, plus five hundred pages of attachments.  I didn't get the attachments.  When the answer came in from the state a few days later, what, I forget the length of it, it was roughly forty pages, and some attachments.  I was able to read those two things.  By the time I got back home on Tuesday evening, that's what I had been able to read.  No further response had been made by the petitioner, the federal habeas unit.  While I was away, I instructed my staff to convene a teleconference in the courtroom, not a teleconference, a courtroom office conference, to discuss next steps.  I knew that I had not had sufficient time to digest the filings.  I know my law clerk was assigned to the matter.  I, therefore, advised the parties that I needed more time, and that was going to necessitate a stay of the execution.  That dissatisfied the state and the attorney general, the assistant attorney general.  The deputy attorney general advised that they would be appealing that ruling.  Of course, I said, "You do what you have to do."  In the meantime, I had set the matter up for a response, further response.  Now we're Wednesday morning at ten o'clock, the execution is scheduled for the 19th that week, that Thursday at 12:01.  The warrant was good from l2:01 to 3 a.m.  I asked the lawyers for the next friend, how long they would need to further reply.  They asked for a week.  I said, "I'm not going to give you a week.  I'll give you to the end of business on Friday," two days, then scheduled at that time, a hearing, for oral, for an oral argument, on Monday morning, now the following Monday morning, for the purpose of hearing argument about the briefs and what, if any, next steps needed to be taken or if the state needed to be, should just be lifted.  The Third Circuit of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit], the panel that was assigned the appeal that was made or taken by the state, reversed my initial stay order.  The initial stay order was very, rather brief.  It only mentioned in the main, the practical reasons that I had, that I had not enough time, that the result was irrevocable, if not given more time to properly adjudicate the matter, this gentleman was going to be executed beyond any, any redemption.  Now keep in mind that this gentleman wanted to be executed.  That's--he was what they call a volunteer and that's why he had what was called the next friend petition filed.  He elected, during his time in the state court, after his conviction and after a sentence to death, he, and after his direct appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court was rejected, he advised his appointed appellate lawyer that he didn't want to pursue any more appeals.  And that's the tact that he and she took in the state courts and here.  There arose, as a result of the appointment of what was termed the next friend lawyer, by the state court who engaged two experts--well, let me back up--there had initially begun, or risen, some question about his mental competence, whether he was mentally retarded or whether he was suffering from some other mental defect, that would have made executing him unconstitutional or would at least rendered his waiver of his appeal rights, or pursuing any further avenues of recourse would have rendered them involuntary and unknowing.  The state had its experts that it hired, along with his then lawyer who concluded that he was competent.  The next friend lawyer, appointed by the state, appoint- hired two law- two experts, a psychologist and a psychiatrist who, one who would determine that he was most likely mildly mentally retarded.  The problem for the next friend lawyer, and the, and the two experts he hired, was that the defendant would not cooperate.  He would not meet with the next friend lawyer, nor meet with the, the experts.  The trial court elected not to order him to cooperate.  As far as I know, no effort was made to urge him to cooperate by either the trial judge or the, his appellate lawyer.  So that's background you needed to know.

Speaker 1: Given that issue and given what I perceive to be a substantial question that is meaningful evidence of his lack of competence to make these decisions, I felt we needed to take a time out, as it were, and look further into this.  Third Circuit Court of Appeals [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit] disagreed.  They felt that the record revealed that there was no issue as to his lack of competence.  They reversed me in the rather short order I issued and, and said, "Judge, you didn't say this, you didn't cover this, you didn't cover that."  I then embarked--now we're getting into the wee hours of the morning.  We're starting, we're now almost inside, and then we eventually get inside, we're, well, we're almost up to the execution when, beginning of the opening of the execution--no, no, the first date actually, I think, took us into the execution window, beyond 12:01.  Court, the court reversed me.  I then wrote a eight or nine page opinion, addressing each--I thought addressing each of the points that they had made.  They didn't agree.  They reversed me again.  The next friend petitioners petitioned to the entire court of appeals, so the Third Circuit--what they asked for what's called the court en banc, E-N, new word, B-A-N-C.  The request was denied.  That is, they wanted the whole court to review what the panel had done, and reversed the panel's ruling, and affirmed mine.  We imposed the stay.  They decided that there was no reason to do that, to grant the en banc hearing.  The next day, avenue taken, of appeal taken was to the supreme court [Delaware Supreme Court] by the next friend petitioner.  They denied any relief.  The petitioner came back to me.  Now we're very close to the three [o'clock] expiration of the window, asking me to act again.  There was no basis for me to act again.  I had already been advised by the Third Circuit of Appeals that there was really no legal ground to, upon which to grant a further stay.  I so ordered.  He was executed at 2:55 in the morning.  My staff and I left chambers.  My entire staff was with me the entire time at 3:05 in the morning.  It was one of the more profound experiences, and it's probably the most profound experience I've had on the bench, and not in a good way.  It's an experience that will--I'm sure live with me for the rest of my time.  I could not have disagreed more with, and do not disagree.  There's no--I could not have disagreed more with my colleagues on the Third Circuit court of appeals, as to their actions, as to the substance of what they had to say in reversing me, and the manner in which the State proceeded--I thought was unseemly and precipitous and unnecessary under the circumstances.  After all, Mr. Johnson [Shannon Johnson] wasn't going anywhere.  He had already more than had the typical time that it takes to get through a full round of the appellate process in a death case.  He was convicted in '06 [2006].  This was six years later.  It takes typically a lot longer to, ultimately in this country, put someone to death.  I believed at the time, and believe today, that the system did not function very well.  I plan to say something more about this in a subsequent writing on my own time that I hope will add something constructive to the discourse around the death penalty, and its continued use in this country.  So those are the three cases that are memorable for var- for a variety of reasons.
Story_ID: 635754
Speaker 1: Can you give us your judicial philosophy just, you know, briefly?
Speaker 2: My judicial philosophy what?
Speaker 1: Your judicial philosophy.
Speaker 2: About--we have philosophies about many things.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  I mean, are you in favor of, well--
Speaker 2: Are you going to ask me, am I in favor of the death penalty?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't, I wouldn't think you would be--but are you?
Speaker 2: It--let me, let me first answer that question by saying that's quite beside the point in terms of my job.  I took an oath.  And let me hasten to add that my views on the death penalty had nothing to do with how I acted in the rulings that I made in the Shannon Johnson case.  That's as much as I'll say about my views about the death penalty.  I don't think that we administer it well, if you could, if I can say it that way.  I think I would be borne out by history when I say that I believe there are historical examples of situations where subsequent to the imposition of the penalty, we've learned of the innocence of the individual.  I think administering a system where there's a possibility is problematic at best.  We're seeing some movement, I think, in public opinion, away from the death penalty in America.  I think we continue to see a movement on a state by state basis.  Connecticut has just outlawed the death penalty a month ago, I think.  I understand California is likely to put it on a referendum.  And I think the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is about to, is thinking about taking a look at the death penalty.  I think thirty- there are thirty-three states that still have the death penalty.  I think we're one of the few Western nations--there may be one or two others that still use the death penalty, you know.  There are many arguments that people make in favor of the death penalty.  The one that, those who make against it that concerns me the most, and I think quite probably is the most concerning, and if there is one reason why we probably need to take a pause at least is that we don't always do it from a process point of view.  And that's what my complaint was here.  That was my concern here was the process.  Shannon Johnson was guilty.  There was no question about his guilt.  There was no question about the heinousness of the crime he committed, but that was quite beside the point.  The death penalty is something that's important, not only to the individual, who is made to suffer its imposition, it's important to all of us as a, as a, as a society.  And it needs to be done right every time that it's done, and it's not.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could go back and change it?
Speaker 2: In my life, no, you know, we all make mistakes, Larry [Larry Crowe].  I've made my fair share.  You know, I'm not married any longer.  I, you know, made some mistakes in my, in my marriage [to Mary Grantham Sleet] that I regret, yeah.  So there's some things in that regard.  I won't speak about those personal kinds of things, but that, yeah, that I would certainly do differently in this regard.  But in the main, there's not much that I would go back and ask for a redo on.
Story_ID: 635756
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, and you have received honors to mark some of these things, I think they've honored you as one of the top graduates of Rutgers Law School [Rutgers School of Law - Camden; Rutgers Law School, Camden, New Jersey] and--
Speaker 2: Rutgers University.
Speaker 1: Rut- Rutgers University law--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and other honors, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know, what I want to be my legacy, and the main thing that I want to be remembered for was that he was a good father.  I, you know, I tried to be a good father to my two children [Moneta Sleet III and Kelsi Sleet].  And, you know, I was, I was, I was fortunate to have good parents [Juanita Harris Sleet and Moneta Sleet] and a good dad, even with all his travels, was there for us.  We know that all too often in this country, in this world, that's not the case that children benefit from the experience of two parents, and particularly in the African American community from the benefit of a dad in their lives.  So that is what I hope someone will write on my tombstone: he was, he was a good father.
Story_ID: 635757
Speaker 1: In that regard then, can you tell us something about your children [Moneta Sleet III and Kelsi Sleet] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my kids are, you know, they're doing it in their own way (laughter) as it were.  It's a little different, it seems to be, this generation, a little, the route to, for instance, to where I come in terms of my education and career, they're taking a little more circuitous route.  My son spent a couple of years at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and didn't altogether like it, left in good standing, took some time out.  He's now back in school finally finishing up his degree at the University of Delaware [Newark, Delaware].  My daughter, after a semester in school at the University Arts [The University of the Arts] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] thought she wanted to get a mas- bachelor of fine arts.  Her mother [Mary Grantham Sleet] and I tried to suggest to her, did suggest to her, that you might want to go to a school that's not as focused on fine arts as U Arts is, and maybe if you decide you don't want to do arts after all, you'll have the opportunity to transfer into another division of the school.  She wanted to do it her way, spent a semester there, did well, didn't like it.  She decided she was going to travel around the country for a while--did that.  She paid for it and worked and paid for it, and now she's off, she'll be off to the University of Massachusetts [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts] in September.  So I'm holding my breath (laughter).  And I've taken a sigh, I've had a little bit sigh of relief, but I'm also holding my breath, and hoping that they'll check this box off, as it were in their lives because they both understand, and have said as much, they understand how important it is they get, at least their undergraduate degrees.  And I, for one, think my daughter is interested in anthropology, that she needs to go beyond that.  My son happens to be a gifted photographer.  When he was a freshman, had work published in the Morehouse's literary magazine, has sold work.  He, incredibly enough, he uses some of his [paternal] grandfather's cameras, his Nikon cameras.  He's really gifted.  He is going to, he's pursing his concentration in physics.  And he--I suspect is not going to become a scientist.  I don't know if he's ever going to use that degree specifically.  I rather think he's going to end up in the arts somewhere.  I'd like to see him after he finishes, go and get his master of fine arts, but education was important in my family.  I guess, let's see, my granddad [Moneta Sleet, Sr.], my father [Moneta Sleet], me, my son's fourth generation.  I've explained this to him when he, you know, was complaining.  I said, "You know, c'mon, you're fourth generation college man.  You've been given a lot--much is expected of you.  You've been hav- had a lot of opportunity in your life.  You got to, you got to understand that, and live up to your responsibilities."  And that's a lot to put on a young man.  And I recognize, that particularly for the male child, as it was for me, it can be difficult to try to fill shoes.  My father was a great man, you know, he broke ground.  I never set out to do, to try to do what, you know, to be a groundbreaker like my dad.  He--not that he set out to do those things, he just did his job.  I've just tried to do my job and things have happened and very much in the way of just being in the right time and the right place.  And I don't want my son to feel that pressure of his grandfather and his father.  His mother is very accomplished, you know, a graduate of Mount Holyoke [Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, Massachusetts], math major in Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], very, you know.  So education has been important in our family, and down through the generations and, so we want the kids to value that and to understand the value that added, that it has, even as difficult as it is.  And we know how difficult it is for young people graduating with degrees and graduating in tremendous debt, and not able to find jobs and, you know, we can only hope that the economy is going to right itself, and that the colleges are going to do a better job of explaining to these kids the debt load that they're encouraging them to incur and figuring out better ways for them to discharge that load.  But, you know, I'm hoping that my--I'm proud of my children.  They're not at the point in their lives that I was in my life, but that's okay.  They've sort of educated me and said, "Dad, you know, it's a different age, and different ways to do this."  Now I've come to accept that.
Story_ID: 635758
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My--one of my hopes is that young black men will--because of what I do, let me sidestep a little bit.  I, unfortunately, get to see too many, particularly during a period on this court [U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware] when we were doing a lot of gun offenses.  And I was, they were, the defendants were overwhelmingly young black men, probably between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five, in the main.  My hope for them is that we can figure out, as a, as a society, a way to help redirect their energies in a more positive way to help them realize dreams that I know they have, to not stray from the more positive path of education, to not embrace the street life that many of them embrace, to not, to reject being a part of a subculture that exists here in America and to join what I'll loosely call the mainstream and to grow and thrive.  We're losing too many young, promising young black men to criminal justice controls, to drugs and alcoholism, to death, to simply not pursuing and finishing their educations and not even their high school educations.  So that's, I guess, a combination of a hope and a concern that I have for our young people, for African Americans in general.  I hope that we will not fall down on our responsibilities as adults to recognize that we don't live in a post-racial world, in a post-racial society, and that we have every much the need today, in the aftermath of the '08 [2008] election as we ever did, to go to the polls and vote, to go to the polls in an informed way and vote, to participate in government at all levels, to run for office and to not let this country backslide and to, in ways that we--I think any right thinking person would not want it to.  Extreme example, the days of slavery, okay, we'll never see that again but the days of legalized, of Jim Crow, legalized discrimination, Jim Crow--not that we're going to exactly see what, that happen again but to have things--example, the voting laws that are being passed.  And I don't--I'm now a federal judge--I'm not passing judgment on them.  I'm not trying to be political.  I don't want somebody to ask me to recuse myself, but I have concerns about some of these voting laws that seem to be aimed at excluding certain groups and people from being able to exercise a franchise, that is to vote.  That, to me, is possibly an example of what I'm talking about, backsliding in this country.  And so, I think we have to be vigilant about these things.  Our young lawyers, we need young lawyers coming up who have these concerns, concerns similar to those of the great Charles Hamilton Houstons of the world, and will pursue careers in the public sector.  And will not just be out here trying to make a buck--nothing wrong, nothing wrong making money but will devote themselves to continue, smart young people to devote themselves to public service, and to moving these issues along, continuing to advance, continuing to help this country evolve to be what it can be.
Story_ID: 635759
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Anything you haven't asked me?  Larry [Larry Crowe], I can't think of a thing (laughter) at this point, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'm going to repeat what I said before.  I want to be remembered as a good, a good dad.  That's, you know, I want the people who matter to me in life to think of me that way, and most especially my children [Moneta Sleet III and Kelsi Sleet].  They are the most important things to me in the world.  And so, that's, I don't have any other real dreams or aspirations as to how I should want to be remembered quite frankly.  I hope that somebody would be able to say that he helped someone along the way, that he never forgot where he came from, and that he was always willing to--there's a fellow that I know from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], a guy by the name of Sonny Hill, who always talks about reaching back.  And I hope I will be remembered and I hope, because I hope I, I'd like to think I've tried to do that to bring others along with me.  And I hope I will continue to do that until the day I die.  So I hope that people remember that about me as well, that he tried to help someone else along the way, regardless of the shade of their complexion or the origins of their families.

Speaker 1: Yeah, this was recently taken about a month ago.  This is my good friend, the attorney general of the United States.  United States Attorney General Eric Holder [HistoryMaker Eric H. Holder, Jr.] had invited me and my staff to come down, and he met with everyone.  We took a tour of the [U.S.] Department of Justice and he met with us for a few minutes, and we got a chance to go into his inner sanctum, and that's who he is--that is.  Okay.  This was attorney, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno--that's who I work for.  And I don't remember when this picture was taken, but it's down at, in the same place, at main justice.
Speaker 2: That's my pretty daughter, Kelsi [Kelsi Sleet].  This is a--and that's spelled K-E-L-S-I, and this is when she--I met her at the airport, and this is on her return from her travels.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Nice hairdo--my daughter would like to do her hair.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's my son, Moneta [Moneta Sleet III], at a barbecue, I think.  Moneta is twenty-five, Kelsi is twenty-one.
Speaker 1: He's got dreads, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he got dreads.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  My daughter's boyfriend has got perfect dreads.
Speaker 2: Does he?
Speaker 1: I don't know he gets them that perfect (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: This guy's got perfect dreads.
Speaker 2: That's a photo of my son, my daughter, and my niece, Ashley [ph.], my sister's daughter.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, this picture's falling, this picture's falling apart unfortunately.  I can't take it out of there to get reproduced.  That's my dad [Moneta Sleet] when Kelsi and Moneta were very young.  That, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Have your son put it on a scanner and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  --make a good print.  Okay.
Speaker 2: This photograph taken in '64 [1964] by--actually, it was taken by my father's partner, G. Marshall Wilson at Ebony.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  G. Marshall Wilson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this was in a reception area in what was then known as Idlewild Airport, which is today Kennedy [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York].  And this was, my father invited me to come up when we dropped him at the curb, which we usually did, but he said, "Come on up, you come with me."  And he took me into the V.I.P. room and introduced me to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I was about thirteen, I guess then, and Dr. King was kind enough to autograph this copy of--oh, this is an original of the program.  And he wrote, "To Gregory [HistoryMaker Gregory Sleet], for whom I wish a great future, and whose father I admire very much."  That's the word very is underlined.  "Martin Luther King."
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: What's that?  I just thought I'd bring that.  That's my dad, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Yeah, unfortunately, we don't, I don't have much of my mother here at the office.  I don't--other than one picture, early picture in here.  But that's my grandmother, my father's mother, Ozetta Allensworth Sleet.  And that's my granddad, Moneta, Sr. [Moneta Sleet, Sr.].  And these are pictures of my dad when he was an infant and a toddler.
Speaker 1: Now who shot those?  Did his father shoot--
Speaker 2: I don't know who shot those.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Well done.
Speaker 2: And my dad and his sister, Emmy Lou [Emmy Lou Sleet Wilson].
Speaker 1: She's in Hamtramck [Michigan].
Speaker 2: She's in Hamtramck, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've been there.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  We have one of my mom--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --if you want.  That's my mother up there in the corner.  That's an earlier picture of my pretty mom.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Juanita [Juanita Harris Sleet].
