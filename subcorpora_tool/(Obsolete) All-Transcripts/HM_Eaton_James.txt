Story_ID: 6741
Speaker 1: Could you give me the names of your mother, father and your siblings, your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Sarah Cousin Eaton.  My father's name was John--Reverend John Jasper Eaton, Sr.  And my siblings were Virginia Eaton, John Eaton, Dr. Martha Eaton.
Speaker 1: Now, what are your--on your mother's side, did you know your mother's parents, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew my mother's father's name was Cousin, but I didn't really know him.  But I knew her mother very well.  Her name was Martha Cousin, and she was a domestic--she was a nanny.  She lived in the home of the very wealthy white people in Richmond, Virginia, and she took care of the, the kids and ran the house.  A very intelligent lady, well to do, and she worked for the president of the First Federal Bank of Virginia.
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Martha Cousin, Martha Ann Cousin.
Speaker 1: And what type of woman was she?
Speaker 2: She was a, believe it or not, very intelligent because she taught the white people's children all the way through college.  (Unclear), and that's right, they came to her.  And there were two children.  One was Lucy Carter Augustine.  The other one was Harry Augustine, Jr.  And she was, took care of them and educated them and one went to VMI [Virginia Military Institute, Lexington, Virginia]  and the other went to another school in Virginia, University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia], I think.  And she taught them how to play basketball and everything.  She was a amazing person.  And by living on the place, she had enough money left over to buy her own house, and build her own house in Richmond, which we, which we lived in.  And when she died or got ill, she was the only black person who had, could go to the white hospital to be treated at the white hospital because the influence of--the white people was able to influence that for her.
Speaker 1: Now, you, you said she taught and trained these white children before she was their nanny.  What type of education did your grandmother have?
Speaker 2: I really don't know, but she was just amazing.  In fact, I was able to talk to one of the fellows that she raised two years ago--of course, he's a retired man now, up in age.  And he was talking about how much she, she meant to him and what have you, and she, she put them even before us.  They were her favorite kids, yeah, yeah.  And, you know, she'd give them--she would call us little barbarians sometime.  You know, we would tear the posts down or take the plums off the tree 'cause she had a nice place too.  But she would call us barbarians compared to them because they, you know, I guess they had more class than us.  But once she taught us--she always taught us to have class.  And I picked it up from her.  I was her, I guess, favorite grandchild because as she got older--and I was the youngest child in my family, as she got older, she could no longer bake those cakes and fruit cakes for these white people cause of her arthritis, and I was young, and I began to bake cakes.  And one of the ways I got through school is that by baking cakes for Christmas, Japanese fruitcakes, light fruitcake, dark fruitcake, poundcakes, and those kind of things, that's exactly how I was able to get enough money to go to school with because people would give me a lot of money for baking these cakes.  I was a great cake maker from my mama's--grandmother's instruction.
Speaker 1: Now, describe the, the house, you said she purchased there in Richmond and it was family house?
Speaker 2: She had it built, two-story house.  Three bedrooms and about four rooms downstairs, and got a bath, but the bath came later because it wasn't, didn't have running water back in that particular time.  But we got a bathroom put in, that kind of thing.  It was a nice, very nice house.  In fact, the house still stands, still standing.  But the house belonged to, it belonged to my grandmother, but the land, when slavery ended, it seemed as if the white people gave us a huge tract of land.  It was in a place called Bowling Green Road, Richmond, Virginia, right on the outskirts of Richmond, in Henrico County.  And that land was divided among a group of kids, that--my grandmother, my great-grandmother was called Maude.  And Maude got this land, and each child got a portion of it.  So my aunt had a nice house there, the real big house.  And my other aunt had a house there.  Uncle Jake had some lots there.  Uncle Charlie had some lots there.  And my grandmother had a house there.  And then we bought another house next door.  It was some white people living next door to us, and they bought that house, later on.  And it was old, squat--from one street to another, it was a lot of land back in that particular time.
Speaker 1: What type of woman was your mother?  Describe her to us.
Speaker 2: My mother was, mostly did domestic work, and she would clean churches, and she would--she didn't have the education, went as far as, as the sixth grade.  And, but she was a hardworking lady, that believed in honesty and integrity, and she was tough.  She would hit you in a minute, you know, make you do, you know--but she also would love you, tough love, yeah, didn't have no crime cause she would knock it out of you.  And everybody liked her and come over and see her and what have you.  She--quite a personality.
Speaker 1: Now, was she an educated woman?  Did she--?
Speaker 2: No, she'd go no--any further than sixth grade.  My father was a educated, he had finished high school at that particular time.  But my mother was not.  My father died when I was seven years old [1937], and my mother practically raised me, but the other siblings, my father raised them, you know, they, they speak better, and they were better educated because they were with my father longer before he died.
Story_ID: 6742
Speaker 1: Your father [Rev. John Eaton], do you know his parents, your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: I really don't know much about it.  I think they came out of North Carolina as far as I know, Oxford, North Carolina.  But I think that the background was, came out of Haiti many years ago, so I heard.  And my father was in World War I, and he, he was gassed in World War I.  And he ended up having tuberculosis.  He came back, became a preacher, and he had his own restaurant and what have you.  But one of the dreaded diseases back in those days were what they called T.B.--I guess it's consumption, what people also called it.  So, when you had tuberculosis back at that particular time, you would move, remove the person from the home, and they'd go into what you call a sanitarium.  So he was in a sanitarium before he died [in 1937], which mean that I didn't have much time with him because I was seven when he passed.  Well, I must have been five when he left to go into the sanitarium.  And, but he was quite a fellow.
Speaker 1: Did you hear any stories about your father?
Speaker 2: Well, I had his sermons.  I, I collected his sermons.  I got them upstairs right now.  He was--written on old scratch papers.  I know he liked to chew tobacco, and those papers still smell of tobacco today.  And it was the rural preaching, you know how rural preaching would be.  It, it's amazing, and my sister [Virginia Eaton] had them put into some kind of little book like, copies of them put in a book like--and I'm talking about hundreds of sermons or what have you.  His name was, my father's name was John Jasper, but there was another John Jasper and famous African American who's supposed to be related to us.  That's that Sixth Mount Zion Church [Richmond, Virginia].  You might have heard of this church, but John Jasper, the picture is upstairs--no, it's in the other museum downtown, one of the oldest, most astounding slave minister in history.  He coverted--white people would come to hear and make fun of him, you know, cause he used broken English and everything.  But when they'd come to make fun of him, they would end up being converted.  He was that kind of fellow.  He's in all the history books.  His name was John Jasper, Reverend John Jasper.  And his famous sermon was "The sun do move and the earth stood still", and somewhere in my collection, we have that material here, a copy of that famous sermon.  And every year they what--at Sixth Mount Zion, they have that church there, where he started.  And when they built [Interstate] Highway 95, if you're ever going up Highway 95, going from Richmond to Washington, D.C., notice that the highway make a strange turn around a church.  That's the only thing, building that they did not remove.  It was so well known that they moved the highway, and not the church.  The church is still there right now, a place called Jackson Ward, that's a part of Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Did your father have a church?  Was there a church that he--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mount Tabor Baptist Church.  It was in Woodsville, Virginia, which is right outside of Richmond.  And now it's in Fairmount, on Fairmount Avenue, which is also in Richmond.
Story_ID: 6743
Speaker 1: Tell us about your household and who reared you and the influences in the household and how your brothers and sisters and how the household worked?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sarah Eaton] reared me because, you know, I told you my father [Rev. John Eaton] died when I was young [in 1937].  My brother [John Eaton] went in the military at, at seventeen, World War I--World War II started and he went into the military.  And that was a blessing to a lot of black people.  I know war is hell, but a lot of us got our start because if a fellow went in the military, they sent the allotment back home to their mother and mother took that money and then did some things for us that we couldn't get working in, washing the white people's clothes.  And we were able to get some money, and I was able to go on and finish high school.  I went to a private Catholic school, and then I was able to go on to college with some of the money my brother sent to help me go.  Then my sister [Virginia Eaton] also helped me.  This was a typ-typical traditional of one sibling helping the other.
Speaker 1: So what type of relationship did you have with your mother?
Speaker 2: We were tight.  I told you she was tough, but we were tight, you know what I mean.  And my nickname was Toad.  They called me Toad, that was my nickname.  And I got that nickname because they claim that I never did crawl, I hopped.  So at an early they called me Toad, and I was called Toad.  I still sign my name--with my friends it's Toad, even today.  Anybody who's a real close friend of mine, I would say, this is from Toad, and they know who I am because of my background.
Story_ID: 6744
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: A red wagon in the backyard, and you used to have--these little red wagons that you put one knee in the wagon and you take your other foot and you push around.  And I don't know why I keep remembering that wagon, but I remember that wagon.  I must have been four or five years old, yes.
Speaker 1: And was that your toy or?
Speaker 2: It was a toy, but it also was used to carry--see, mother [Sarah Eaton] washed clothes.  She would--did the laundry for the white people.  And after they got all this land, then the white people lived on the other side of this land, quite--a good little ways away.  And so that same wagon, they delivered the clothes.  I remember the clothes my mother washed, had them old fashioned machines, you know, the kind you put your clothes and you wash the clothes and you put it through a wringer.  You know, the Maytag machine.  And you go through the wringer and then you put, bring it to another tub with something you call bluing and it adds some blue into the water to make the white clothes look real white.  Then I would carry them to people she washed for.  And these were all white people.  They got (unclear) and they got, you know, they looked for Toad and they got to like me a great deal.  And, you know, they would always do little things for me.  It was a segregated life, but it was not the world's worst life, put it that way.
Story_ID: 6745
Speaker 1: Explain to me what, what Richmond was like when you were a child; that Richmond, Virginia, the neighborhood in which you grew up in?  What was that area like?
Speaker 2: Well, the neighborhood I grew up in was mostly owned by us.  And my grandmother [Martha Ann Cousin] working for this rich banker, who, whose daughter [Lucy Carter Augustine] was the, who was married to the attorney general right in the state there.  And see, they had a lot of pull.  Now, next to us was white people.  We called them poor white people.  And I liked Mr. Clayton, but we had a dog, my aunt had a dog named Blackie.  I remember that very well.  Blackie lived about three houses from me, at my aunt's house.  It's sitting on the same property that Maude used to have.  And I was scared of Blackie myself, but Blackie got a loose one Sunday morning, and ran into Mr. Clayton's house and attacked his daughter.  And Mr. Clayton took a ice pick--back in those, people had ice picks cause they ice boxes, and he stabbed Blackie and threw him in a ditch.  So I saw Blackie in the ditch and what had happened.  So I called my aunt, and my--that was the same weekend, my mo--my grandmother got off every other week.  That was that week that she was home.  So she got excited and said, "I'm gonna call my white folks."  I remember it very well; show you how powerful some black people happened to be.  She got on that telephone, and she called her white people, the Augustines and they in exchange called their relatives, I'm talking about the big wheels.  See, Richmond is the capital of the, I mean Richmond was the capital of Virginia.  And about a hour or so late, later, I saw--'cause didn't many cars come by our house.  We had a paved street.  And here come three cars coming down that street, you know, little boy that, we didn't have no shoes on, you know what I mean.  And I saw them drive down there in front of that house, and they got at the house and looked around, and they saw Blackie.  And they went down to Mr. Clayton's house--and Mr. Clayton was a white man, and he was in the right 'cause that, Blackie was a bad dog.  Anyway, Mr. Clayton was standing in the hallway, and they got at Mr., said, Mr. Clayton, if--"Long as you live, don't you ever bother with Barbar"--they called my grandmother, who was Martha, they called her Barbar.  That's what the white kids called her cause she was like a mother, I told you.  "Don't ever both--don't ever bother with Barbar or any of her people." And naturally, that made me feel.  You know, I got my little chest poked out cause we getting them told and what have you.  So one thing we need to know is that it isn't always race in the deep South.  It was sometimes economics.  If you were poor, you were poor, if you a poor white man, bothering with a black person who was sort of close to another big-time white person, you were in trouble, you know.  So that made me realize a lot of things.  And I was close to the Augustines.
Speaker 1: Now, this is interesting.  In the '30s [1930s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], we're talking here.
Speaker 2: This is, this would in the late, in the '30s.
Speaker 1: Late '30s, you were growing up in almost what can be considered an integrated area?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yes.  Integrated but see, when people count black people and ghettos, they ignore the white people 'cause white folks lived in black neighborhoods too.  They never look at that because they just see blacks as a group and maybe one or two whites.  And they, and they treat the white people like they treat black people.  And Mr. Clayton--see, I told you about a lot of land there, and that was like a farm.  And the next land was the Claytons' land.  And there were some people called the Kaplans who were rich, white people, lived across the street, back in, in the woods.  So it, it's, it's a strange life.  Remember that book called, 'The Strange Career of Jim Crow', strange life.
Speaker 1: Now, were there other blacks around you who weren't related to you who lived in--?
Speaker 2: Not when we first--not when I was young.  But they finally decided to build some houses across the street over there, and now it's a project, nothing but blacks over there, you know what I mean.  So, they cleared the woods off and built projects and put us together.  And there were black people living about--about a mile away.
Story_ID: 6746
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Sarah Eaton] came home every other week?
Speaker 2: My grandmother [Martha Ann Cousin].
Speaker 1: Your, your grandmother came home--.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Your mother--?
Speaker 2: My mother stayed with me.  I lived with my mother.
Speaker 1: But when she worked for the white people?
Speaker 2: She did work for the white people, but she didn't live on white people's place.  My grandmother did.  That's Martha, Barbar.
Speaker 1: Now, Barbar, she was like one of the most respected--speak, like why was she so respected amongst the, the white people?
Speaker 2: 'Cause she, she gave her life to them.  She had her own private room and bath and the what have you.  I couldn't use it.  When I'd go over to cut the grass at the Augustines, I wouldn't say that I couldn't use it.  I didn't use the bathroom and stuff like that.  But she had her own and everything, ran the whole house.  She, she had servants under her cause they had cooks and things.  But Barbar was the leader.  She ran the house, understand what I'm saying now.  She was the head, you know what, in charge.
Story_ID: 6747
Speaker 1: How do you spell Barbar?  That's the nickname [of Eaton's grandmother Martha Ann Cousin]?
Speaker 2: I think it's B-A-R-B-A-R, Barbar.
Speaker 1: Barbar, okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't call her Mama, called her Barbar, and maybe they couldn't say Martha or something.  You know what I mean or couldn't what they needed to say, so they--these are the white kids that named her Barbar.  And I called her Grandmama, you know what I mean because then I had no other choice.  And she was--.
Speaker 1: Are we rolling?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go into the house?  Would you ever go into the Augustines' house and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, once in a while.
Speaker 1: Now, were you accepted?  How were you accepted?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think that they kept me out.  I think I just kept myself out knowing the situation, you know what I mean.  I, they'd give me a glass of lemonade and a baloney sandwich, I'd eat it on the back porch.  I used to cut the grass, so I was the little boy that kept the lawn cut.  And she lived in a place, you might have heard of a place called Monument Avenue.  That's the biggest, widest street in Richmond, Virginia.  I'll tell you how you may know something about it.  That's the street they had a big fight over, over Arthur Ashe statue go in that morning, 'cause that was a street they had Stonewall Jackson, Robert E. Lee, George Washington and those kind of people.  And as I walked my little lawnmower, cause that's, days you had to push lawnmowers, the kind you had the iron wheels.  I had to carry it from my house up there, and I used to carry it upside down so you could roll it real easy.  And I'd walk up there.  So I got to see all the history.  I would see all these fine statutes, huge statutes, you know, a little kid looking up.  They were green, on a big old marble pedestal.  One had a picture of George Washington pointing south, and the, the theme was he's saying, "go south nigger, go south".  That was the theme.  It wasn't written on the statute.  That's what everybody in town said.  There was Patrick Henry, and there were all the great southern heroes there.  But I never saw nobody that looked like me cause it, that's before Arthur, Arthur Ashe's time.  There wasn't nobody on those horses looking like me, and I wondered about that.  But I would go up there, and I'd cut the grass, and they didn't give me but, give fifty cents.  And I would eat on the back porch, and my grandmamma would come out and say "How you doing" or whatever, you know what I mean.  So, you know, but that was accepted.  Then I had to come back, and the strange about it is, I kept wondering why in the world all these folks on these fine horses, house still there, the avenue is still there, and you can't see any black images that would encourage young black kids to try to be somebody.
Story_ID: 6748
Speaker 1: And then I'll tell you something that really bother me now.  I would get my little money, and I would go to the movie.  I would go to the movie on Saturdays.  Now, I couldn't go on Sundays cause my father [Rev. John Eaton] was a minister, but I could go on Saturday afternoon.  There was a movie called the Booker T. Washington Theater on Second Street in Richmond [Virginia].  I would go there, and I had two favorite movies.  One was one called 'Wild Bill Hickok', a man called Elliott, Will [sic, Bill] Elliott, and he played Wild Bill, and he had his guns turned backwards.  And he could do all that, you know, he'd shoot the Indians all day long.  And the other was 'Tarzan'.  Let me tell you something about Tarzan.  Now, I'm in this movie--and back in those days, you had the seats turned up. And I sat on the seat, you know how you ride the seats.  I was in a front seat, of course.  And this, the screen would be dark.  You'd hear a voice.  The voice would holler.  And here this white man jumped off a vine with a diaper on and a knife.  He would jump off the vine in front of the animals, and the animals would back--would lay down, elephant, and would bow down.  And the lion refused to roar.  And, "Me Tarzan".  And he's in Africa now with his knife and his big--I call it a diaper, a diaper, but I don't know what you would call it now.  But anyway, it was shorts.  So, and then later on, and I kept going to the movies.  Then I started seeing a lady called Jane.  A plane crashed, and this white lady fell out this plane, and she had a little bow on, had her bust kind of covered, and she fell out that plane.  And she became Jane, Tarzan and Jane, "Me, Tarzan, you, Jane."  And, of course, Jane got pregnant, you see.  So they had a boy called Boy.  Now, that amazed me because nobody called white boys "Boy."  They called black kids "boy."  We were all boys.  And you see, you can't better not call no white person boy back in those days.  Nobody told me that.  I--you just learn this 'cause that's the way the custom is.  And then they had a monkey called Cheetah, and you don't know nothing about Cheetah.  That's before your time, had a monkey called Cheetah.  And Cheetah had more sense than all the Africans put together.  I'm there watching Tarzan, and you know what I'm doing?  I'm rooting for Tarzan.  I'm telling Tarzan, "Look out, Tarzan, look behind you."  And here come these Africans coming by the hundreds.  Here's Tarzan standing on the edge of the cliff, picking them up, throwing them off, what you call body slamming them, down the ravine, you know.  And he's just throwing them off.  And I said, "Tarzan, I told you to look--getting close to you."  Boy, isn't mental genocide.  Why would a person--I, was black as I was, be cheering for Tarzan to kill his own people.  I had no idea of the importance of Africa and, now, history, and what you could learn from that.  And then another thing that bothered me, they had a little girl.  She had golden hair in little locks rolled around there.  Her name was Shirley Temple.  Now, me and my brother [John Eaton], there're all them cute little black girls in the neighborhood.  We didn't have nothing to do with them.  We had arguments over whose girl is Shirley Temple.  "She's my girl, no, she's your girl".  We had them sticks, rum sticks, and we were fighting each other, you know, fighting over this little white girl, who at the very time she was famous, had a man behind her, a big tall black, man called Mr. Bojangles, Bill Robinson, who was born in Richmond on the corner of Lee Street.  Bill Robinson was the best dancer in the world.  Fred Astaire will tell you in his book that he learned from Bill Robinson.  And the coon dancing and that stuff.  Arthur Murray, Fred--Bill Robinson was being--he was saying Mrs., Ms. so and so and so.  I remember a movie called 'The Little Colonel' and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 6749
Speaker 1: It's important for--to have archives and to have people look at things at the HistoryMakers because they will never know what we've been through and all the things at every phase unless they had that, that experience.  And I was one of the few people that was lucky enough to come up during the period of segregation.  It was hard, but it was unique.  And I wouldn't take anything in the world for it.  And I tell you why I think people my age--I'm now seventy-one years old.  But see I knew older people who knew people who were slaves.  They were not slaves themselves, but some of their parents or grandparents were slaves.  But they had enough memory to tell me in the oral tradition about slavery, and which had been handed down to them.  And then I also experience myself segregation.  And I also experienced integration or so-called integration.  So I saw how it worked.  So I know for all three stages, and I'm glad to be a part of this program because we need to let people know that things have gotten better, but not a whole lot better.  Your videographer called and asked me how to get to the campus.  He was at, I guess looking at a map and saw a street that carry you straight on through from [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr. Boulevard] straight on through the campus here [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  But what he didn't know, and what I tried to tell him, you had to go around that because back in the days of segregation, there were no open streets that led from white neighborhoods to black neighborhood.  You go down to the capital, all of that capital property.  When you get to a certain spot, you had to go around to come back in to get to the black neighborhood.  That's why you see, if you ever did any research, you will find that very few streets that existed during the time of segregation were open.  They were always, had a, some grass or something there, you know what I mean, a field or a park or something so that there wouldn't be no straight connection between white and black.  Of course, it's getting better now 'cause they are opening up some of these places and building a lot of housing and pushing the black people out and they're pushing up to slums and call it urban renewal, which is actually black removal.
Story_ID: 6750
Speaker 1: I would like to ask you, now, your perspective of, your perspective of Caucasians--what was that, because you had a pretty decent relationship.  What was your perspective of Caucasians in relationship to that age as a child?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Oh, I've been spit on--.
Speaker 1: As a child?
Speaker 2: Oh, I've had a tough time.  I remember riding on the streetcar one day--we had something called trolley cars in Richmond.  That's a car on a track.  And some white people got off of the trolley car and spit in my face.  And I was so upset about that.  I went home crying to my mother [Sarah Eaton].  My mother said, "Well, son, just pray for 'em."  You know what I mean, you know, just pray.  So I've been there, and I've been beat by white people and knocked around by them, but you know, that didn't mean that everybody white was knocking me around, understand what I'm saying.  I can't condemn a whole race of people, a whole group of people 'cause somebody--and the other thing is this we're still getting knocked around.  I don't want to talk about Florida and that last election [2000 national election].  So I'll leave that alone, but, you know, we're still getting knocked around.  So, I mean I don't know.  I did a lot on the Ku, the Ku Klux Klan.  I got the robe downtown and we got a big collection of Klan material and what have you.  And they would end up, you know, killing you and what have you.  And people still getting killed.  And then they--every time, sometime the police will shoot you.  Look what happened in New York City, you know, the man used a plunger and they got off [reference to Abner Louima abuse]; the man shot a man all them number of times and they get off [reference to Amadou Diallo shooting].  So I'm trying to tell you that, is it really better?  I mean is it really better?  Why would I be worrying about something that's over?  The Klan is now, not even functioning like it used--should be.  We done sued them to death.  But I'm more concerned about the man with the gun and the badge--Mayor [Rudolph] Guiliani was just a dog, but look now, he's a hero.  See what I'm saying.  He's able to come back and influence the election and get his man [President George W. Bush] elected, you know, the man that--and everybody, you can't talk about him now.  You talk about him now, and where are people killed more in electric chairs than in Texas, and half are not even guilty.  So what are we talking about?  But the man who, he got that program viable, is now our president.  And one of them, governor of the State of Florida [Governor Jeb Bush], you know what I mean.  You see, with them hanging chads and things, you know, they just didn't hang for nothing.  So if you hang me from my voting rights, you still hanging me.  Don't get me started, young man, you, you, you getting my fire going.  I mean I think sometimes we spent a whole lot of time worrying about things that we can't change, that have already taken place and not seeing what's going on right now.  But at the same time, I can't tell you, I will now tell you that my biggest benefactor, right here at this museum here happens to be white.  There's a white man that gave me a lot of stuff, almost a hundred thousand dollars, helped me open the archives up and what have you.  So I mean, you know--but he's one--and there's a lot of other people around.  So, you know, you, you know you just can't--I don't believe in hating anybody based on race or color.  You hate people--I don't hate, dislike people based on the way they treat you, you know what I mean, you know.  It's one of those things.
Speaker 1: So as a child, you have these experiences where you're getting spit in the face, and then you have the Augustines who treat you pretty well, pretty decent and look after you and your grandmother [Martha Ann Cousin]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, as much as they possibly could under the circumstances.
Speaker 1: But, so what type of racial--what thoughts, thoughts of Caucasian people are you having?  What are you--what type, what was developing in your mind at that age as a child?
Speaker 2: Some good and some bad.  When I carried, when I carried that little wagon full of stuff, these clothes to some of these white people, there always would be someone that would have a little piece of cake for you or bun for or something, you know, they'd give it to you.  Now, I know that might be patronizing, but that's a bun.  How many buns could I really afford?  I walked over there in the hot, you know what I mean, they give you a glass of lemonade.  But they didn't let you in their kitchen, sitting at their kitchen table.  At least that's somebody.  Some of 'em would jump on you and want to, want to whip you.  You understand what I'm saying?  Let me tell you something, do you want to know what made me a historian?  There was a man called Theodore Currier, C-U-R-R-I-E-R.  He was the professor that made John Hope Franklin.  I'm from the same teacher, Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  Mr. Currier had more influence on my life than anybody else.  He taught me, took me under his wing, worked with me.  I had black teachers too, though, I had some of the great teachers, Aaron Douglas and all that I had--the great boys all was at Fisk at one time, but you probably know that, Charles S. Johnson.  But the one that took the most time with me was a white man named Theodore S. Currier.  He was the, he got the first Phi Beta Kappa at Fisk University, and he was a Phi Beta Kappa.  John Hope Franklin was one of the first people who was able to get in that situation.  He helped to pay John Hope Franklin's way to school.  He offered me a car when I was coming up, and I didn't have a car at one time, offered me a car.  I didn't have, didn't get it, but he offered to give me and I could pay him for it later on.  When I, when I finished school, finished my master's, master's degree, wanted me to come back to Fisk to take his place.  But I came to A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I mean I just want you to understand that there are some people who have influenced my life, and they were all not black.  They were all not racists.  And I was gonna be on TV one time, and they, they wanted to know who inspired you the most.  There was a program going on right here in Tallahassee and because I said Mr. Currier inspired me the most in my field, they wouldn't even show it on TV 'cause it was black history month, they wanted me to say that, somebody else.  But it was another man, Dr. Rufus Almbush Taylor (ph.) who was also my advisor.  He was black.  He was as good as--a Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] grad.  He was good, but he was my secondary teacher, you know what I mean.  He was not as great as Currier was, an influence in my life.  That's, you know, that's how it is.  When I was department chairman here, when the first white student came here, she came in the African American Studies.  I was then the chair of African American Studies.  There was a bunch of girls, you know, all of these are my students, college students, and they didn't like the idea that she had decided, being white, to major in Afro-Amer--African American Studies.  And we were walking down the steps one day, and this was a group of us, and one of the girls pushed her, pushed down the steps.  And I became furious.  You can't push a person just because they white, want to be in black studies.  What you gonna push her for?  She married a black fellow, had a baby--I became the baby's godfather.  And then those girls who pushed her became very good friends of hers.  See, it's a matter of knowing people.  You can't just intimidate people. That's just like pushing a black kid down the steps, which you wouldn't dare do at any school.  But, you know what I mean, you have to understand that.  I met a lot of white students.  All of 'em, every last one of 'em will swear by me that I was gonna be fair with them, you know what I mean.  I'm not gonna give you anything.  I ain't gonna take nothing from you.  I'm gonna defend your rights to be here as well as anybody else's rights 'cause you are at a state school, and you pay your money, and you need to get an education.  If I can give it to you, that's what I'm here for, regardless of what color you might be.

Speaker 1: Your schooling, your elementary school, the name of it and what it was like?
Speaker 2: I went to a school Van de Vyver [School, Richmond, Virginia], capital V-A-N, then small D-E, and capital V-Y-V-E-R.  Van de Vyver was a private Catholic school, only fifty cents a month I believe to go there.  It was run by the Franciscan Sisters and the Josephite fathers.  They had a church in the same thing.  And it was the same school my father [Rev. John Eaton] had finished years ago.  You notice I said, Eaton, and not Eton, and we don't say--Eaton because it's--nuns all there were from foreign countries, and they made it quite clear that Eton is not the way you pronounce that one.  Eton is E-T-O-N, mine is E-A-T-O-N.  It's Eaton.  And they made me say that, and they had taught my father the same thing.  And so that's how, and my father had gone to that school.  And then my sister [Virginia Eaton] came back and finished college, Virginia State University, and she started to teach there.  And I was still, she was the first non-Catholic--she was Catholic, but she was the first black teacher, non-sister to teach at this Catholic school.  And she was there, and I was there.  I was in the sixth grade then, and I was able to go to become the president of class and president of this and that, and make several trips to Washington, D.C. and see historical things just because someone--and these were all white people, except for my sister, gave me an opportunity.
Speaker 1: Which one, which one of the, these teachers, nuns, had a real influence on you, if you could pick any one--?
Speaker 2: Sister Pancratius.  That was her name.  I can't spell it to save my life, P-A-N-C-R-E-A-U-S [sic], something like that.  Sister Pancratius was a short lady, and some kind of mean, hit me behind the head with a book one day, said, "Boy, what you doing?"  She talked like a man, but she kept me straight, and I love her today for it, yes, indeed.  And there was other sisters, Sister Mary, Sister Monica, and stuff like that, but Sister Pancratius was a lady who everybody feared, you know, everybody knew her, through the ages, you know what I mean, yeah.
Speaker 1: What class did, what lesson, I mean what subject did she teach?
Speaker 2: She taught literature and, and--what you call it, Catholicism or that kind of thing.  You know, we had a lot of Catholic teaching in the morning and other things, church history.  And I liked--she taught ancient and medieval history, which I got very much interested in, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your high school, what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Same high school.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's one through twelve?
Speaker 2: I didn't get there until the fifth grade.  I was going to a little school in Woodsville [Virginia] before then.  That was Woodsville Elementary School.  That was not--that was a four-room school, two classes in each room.  And I wasn't doing anything.  I went to a school called Booker T. Washington, and the teachers, this is a black teacher, "You can't read, you can't write, and you can't spell".  And I've seen this teacher, black teacher, Ms. Stevens, I'll call her name, would take a little black girl in front of the class, and she would comb their hair.  You know, you know, we had--I don't what they called, it ain't bad hair, just hair.  But we called it bad hair in our little--and she went ripping through the kids' heads and have the kids crying in front of the class.  And there was a good friend of mine, a neighbor of mine who was very fair skinned, Patricia, long black, silky hair.  And she became the teacher's pet.  That's always the case, you know what I mean, when they're attractive and became a teacher's pet.  And the thing what's strange about that is that, that little black girl went on to school, went on to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], became outstanding, and that other girl didn't stay in school but two years, college, because, you know, she didn't have the background.  And I remember that very well.  What I'm trying to tell you, when I left and went over to Van de Vyver, this private school, I was just--all everything.  So I was gonna quit school.  I, I repeated that grade twice.  I was gonna quit Booker T. and quit school, but I went to that Catholic school, and they saved me--just go to show you, all it took was a little love, a little love.  And the reason why I get so much of a thrill running the black archives here at A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida] because I see kids who come in here with no idea of what they're trying to do, no self-esteem, fixing to drop school and quit and leave and not even finish high school.  And then after I talked to them and talked about all the greatness of black people, they soon began to realize, you know, that they can be somebody too.  Not only that, see most of my groups come here integrated.  There are many more white kids coming than blacks, because there're more whites than black in the system here.  And they come here thinking all the blacks steal, rob and do the boogaloo.  When I finish talking about people like George Washington Carver and all the good African Americans, they, their whole image change.  So one thing about it is to prevent racism, people must know that you make some contributions, that you're doing something, and to prevent so much crime in the black community, especially among young boys, they must know that they can be somebody besides Michael Jordan.  And so, that's where I'm standing.  Of course, I like Michael Jordan, like basketball.
Speaker 1: In your schooling, you say you were leader, you were a leader, and you became a leader and all these other things.  What was the reason that you left the one school in Woodsville and went to the other, the Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Well, I stopped--in between I went to one middle school for one year.  I failed.  One of the reasons why I got, I had to, I repeated the Six-L twice.  See, they used to call it Six-L and the Six-H.  Now, you fail one time, that's bad enough, I had to do the Six-L twice.  My mama [Sarah Eaton] said, the same woman that was tough on me, said, "You're going to go to Van de Vyver," and I went to Van de Vyver.  And within one year's time I was writing poetry and everything and editing the school paper, just that much difference.  So you can't make me always accept the idea that everybody who have another color on their skin is just anti-you.  Some of it is, you got to do the best you can.  And sometimes we, we, as black people make a terrible mistake.  We hang on class, you understand what I'm saying, that we think that if you got some money, and you're doctor so and so and so, you can do this.  And I'm saying that, give me a break, and I can do it too.
Speaker 1: What other extracurricular activities were you involved in?  You were, your newspaper, and you're president of your class.  What other--?
Speaker 2: Played intramural football, and what else did I do?  I wrote poetry and editor of the school paper.  It wasn't a big class, you know how it is, Catholic school is not that, all, all that large, but--and I was, you know, involved in whatever that, whatever the school had.
Speaker 1: So what kind of child would you say you were?
Speaker 2: Odd, difficult, you know what I mean.  Just like I, just like I am today, and I just don't go by any special mode.  I just go by, you know, what I think is right.  And I might not be all right, but I think I, you know.  I never entered any competition.  I didn't come up near the top.  I'm the only professor in the state to get what you call the case professor, the only one, white or black, to, considered by the Council of Education of being a top-rank teacher when I was teaching classes, I mean got a big five thousand dollar reward for that kind of thing.  I've been voted teacher of the year at A&M thirty times, thirty times over forty-three years.  I mean it's all in my vita somewhere.  No--no comparison.
Story_ID: 6752
Speaker 1: What type of student were you when you were a child growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I wasn't the very best, you know, but as I got to move on, making progress, you became--you become better.  But I hung, hang with--I hung with the right people, put it that way, yeah, yeah; didn't have to worry about cheating.  I spent a summer at the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia] where you had to take that special code, you know, where I have not cheated, and I learned a lot from that.  But I was good enough to come back here and teach at both schools.  See, the, what got me involved in the creating this archives, believe it or not, I had gone to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].  I had, was interested--the same white professor [Theodore Currier] at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], taught Russian history, and I was interested in the history of Russia.  So I applied to Duke for a scholarship to go in the Russian history program, and they turned me down because I couldn't speak the Russian language, and I couldn't, couldn't even spell those Russian words, but interested in it any way.  So they said, "Well, I'll tell you what we'll do though," they looked at my thesis, "You got a excellent thesis in the history of the South.  So go into southern history"; said, "Okay."  I went to Durham, North Carolina and I went into southern history.  But history requires having five fields.  My second major field would be Russian history, and I studied under a fellow called Dr. Curtis at, at Duke University and a boring class and what have you, but I learned enough Russian history to be interested in it.  But you don't know why I was interested in Russian history.  Because Russia has something you call serfdom.  They had serfs and serfdom ended in the year of 1860 under the czar.  All right, then we had--slavery ended 1863.  So my thinking is that, I wanted to do what you call a comparative analysis of serfdom versus slavery.  And young man, let me tell you, you think slavery was bad.  Being a serf, I know you're religious, was worse.  We need to know how the Russian people treated their own people.  They had to stand still, at the big people's plantations and become whitewash to be a statute, a human man put in something like plaster, plaster of parish, and they had to stand there 'til the guests go by.  They would put horse hair in their feet so they couldn't run away.  When it was time to go to war, they had to put you in a special place and lock you up because you'd rather be dead than go into the war.  When they fought the Crimean Wars, they had pasteboard shoes.  This is baffling.  Now, that's a terrible situation.  I found it very baffling.  So a comparative study of African American slavery, it was called Negro slavery, that Negro slavery compared to Russian serfdom would shock you.  Yet the Russians were criticizing the South for slavery, they couldn't understand they had something in Russia even worse.  So I studied Russian history.
Story_ID: 6753
Speaker 1: When I came back from Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] in the 19--the later 1960s, they were trying to integrate these two schools.  One is called Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida].  That's on the other hill, right across the other hill here, and this was Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida].  I was then the department head of history over here, and the federal government had passed a law that you had to integrate these two schools, with its, with its faculty.  And what happened is that they asked me to go over there 'cause I was head of the department, so they didn't want to trust anybody over there.  And they sent over here two men to take my place.  Now, what does that mean?  That they were gonna count us twice.  They didn't want many outsiders 'cause a outsider actually might be somebody they couldn't control.  So I worked for the state already.  I'm under the same kind of contract.  So I go over there, and they gonna count me as a part of Florida State faculty and a part of the faculty of Florida A&M.  Now, when I taught Russian history over there--same students 'cause they had--both students went to the same classes different days, they all thought I was such a great teacher.  Oh, Professor Eaton, you are great, you know your Russian history.  But when I taught the Old South, and the Old South is black history, how in the world can you talk about the Old South and not talk about the history and contributions of African Americans?  If cotton was king, then the slave was the throne.  I always say that.  If cotton was king, then slave was the throne because everything based, what, on the back of the labor supply; didn't want, didn't want to believe it.  So I said, how can I convince these people of something important enough to get them to see what I'm talking about?  So I decided that the only way to do that was to get a museum started and an archive started.  And what convinced me more than that is that I had a class over here called "historiography".  I sent those students down to the courthouse, county courthouse, right here in Leon County [Florida] to check on lynching in Leon County.  And what happened is that, there'd be some older ladies--that's when I was young, I was young once upon a time, and these ladies would take around on Sunday mornings, and they'd show me all these trees and things where they used to hang black people.  So I gave my students a assignment, an assignment to go around to the courthouse and find some records that you can use and talk about lynching as it, as it occurred in Florida.  The people said, "We never had any lynchings here"; told my students that.  They didn't know that I had another white class, same professor, I didn't go myself, that could go down there.  So they went down there two weeks later and had the same assignment.  And the lady said, "Oh, yes, we got several boxes of papers on lynchings, and furthermore, in the old county jail there's a whole backlog on racism and lynching in Leon County"; same lady, two different groups of students, which meant that unless we control some of our documents, what we gonna do about it?  Now, I'm not one who believes--I don't--I do believe that anybody should be able to write history, white, black, blue or polka dot, but somebody who's writing the history of African Americans must also be African American to have experienced some things that whites have never experienced.  But that's why today, almost all of the major publications on black subjects are done by white people because they get asset to the--access to the records.  And we don't have 'em.  So what I decided to do, right, I'm gonna collect my own records.  That's how we, how we got started, right here [Black Archives Research Center, Carnegie Library, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Story_ID: 6754
Speaker 1: We're gonna go back to, go back to Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to know about your church, the church you went to growing up, in the--the church that, you know, Richmond that you and your family--?
Speaker 2: I went to, I went to my father [Rev. John Eaton]'s churches first, Mount Tabor Baptist Church [Richmond, Virginia].  Later on, after my father died, I went to the Catholic school [Van de Vyver School, Richmond, Virginia]--I became a Catholic, went to St. Joseph Church [Richmond, Virginia], and an altar boy.  And after I got married in Chicago [Illinois], many years later, I went to a church called St. Stevens Church and now don't go--you know, every so often, and I go to different churches because I married a preacher's daughter, my first marriage.  And he wasn't gonna have no Catholic married to his daughter, didn't get baptized in the Baptist church.  So you know, I, I been to several different churches.  Now, I go to any church I feel like going to.
Story_ID: 6755
Speaker 1: You're about to graduate high school.  What decisions are you making about where I'm gonna go to college and why would I go there?
Speaker 2: Well, a man called Jack Atkins, a great, famous black coach, was coming through, and he was looking for some football players.  This is after the end of World War II.  A lot of boys coming back were good--the Korean War think they were--and they were good because, you know, they were veterans.  And he checked me out and asked me did I want to play ball 'em.  I said, yes, and I went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and played ball a couple of years there before I got hurt.  And, but I met this fellow named Mr. [Theodore] Currier and got interested in history and what have you--nah, we talking about going back to--.
Speaker 1: '52 [1952] when you go to Fisk.
Speaker 2: '52 [1952], okay.
Speaker 1: Your undergrad years, your undergrad years.
Speaker 2: Okay, '52 [1952], I finished Fisk from '48 [1948] to '52 [1952].  Then I went back another year.  I got married, and--my first wife, and I stayed there another year 'cause she finished her undergrad degree.  I was working on my master's.  I did all that work except for the thesis, and then I came back to Richmond [Virginia] and took the police job and was a patrolman for a year and a half or almost two years.  And then when I found out about that rule they had, they offered me another job for the state as assistant principal.
Speaker 1: Talk to us about the police experience.
Speaker 2: Police experience was that you could--they didn't want you arresting white people.  And I was assigned--the unit fifteen was like a patrol wagon, and you--I could work downtown in the black communities.  But they wouldn't, necessarily work in the white community.  But if I got, got promotion and became a sergeant, they had to work anywhere.  So then they tried to do right to avoid this, so they made the time of probation a much longer period of time.  In the meantime, they offered me job at the boys' school for juvenile delinquents, Hanover [Manual Labor] School for [Colored] Boys in [Hanover] Virginia, that--eighteen miles from Richmond.  I took that because they also offered my wife a job teaching there.  Both of us worked there, and I stayed there for a year and handled the school and Hanover School for Boys.  And then I ran a little restaurant for a friend of mines.  He had a restaurant.  I ran that, and then I went back and finished my master's degree, finished the--finished that thesis, and I came on down to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  That was in '58 [1958].  I been here ever since, been here forty-three years.
Speaker 1: Now, in your undergraduate years, from '48 [1948] to '52 [1952], what type of experiences did you have there, choosing a major and things of that sort?
Speaker 2: Well, I met this fellow, I told you, Mr. Currier, this white fellow that I, who--I was sleeping in class.  And they had something they called temporary civilization.  And it was a big class for all the freshmen.  I was going to school on a biology scholarship, had a scholarship in biology.  And I was going to school on that.  And I was sleeping in class, and the man say, "Wake up, young man, why you sleeping in my class?"  I was embarrassed.  "What you come to college for?"  And I said, "I came to make some money."  And he chewed me out and gave me a challenge.  The challenge was to do better.  I say, "I'm gonna show you what I can do.  I'm gonna major in your area, history and minor in chemistry."  That's what I did.  I majored in history, minored in chemistry.  Now, Fisk was a school kind of blue blooded.  One of the things I remember very well that it was really a school for real fair-skinned black people.  It wasn't for, a school for people like me, but the football players was okay.  But then they had what you called the king and queen, spring king and queen, and I won first place in that.  And the white professor told me--not the same one, another one, Mr. St. John or Dr. St. John told me, that you can't be queen of this because you too dark, believe it or not, and they gave it to another fellow named Patterson cause he was fair-skinned, a fellow from Indiana, Gary, Indiana became king of the, of that spring festival.  So it's the kind of thing I remember very well, but, you know, I got along well, you know, we had a good time; all football players, you know.  I pledged Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and those kind of things, and a wonderful time there, and met my first wife there, and what have you, and it wasn't bad.
Speaker 1: What made you very serious about history?  When do you really--I, I want to really know more and more 'cause you had the childhood experience of seeing those statues, that got your mind--?
Speaker 2: And I told you I also got the help of the Catholic sisters way back then 'cause something, something called the Freedom Train came through Richmond, had all those documents on it.  And I was chosen to represent the school to see the Freedom Train.  So all those things put together, plus Mr. Currier, made me interested in history.  And I got interested in history and Russian history and all kinds of history.  I had more hours of history than I had anything else; had enough hours to have a double major in history; I had political science; then I had the chemistry.
Speaker 1: Now, during that four-year undergrad period, how did you and Dr. Currier's relationship grow?
Speaker 2: Oh, it grew real well.  You know, I, I don't think he taught a class I didn't attend.  And also true with Dr. Taylor, yeah, those two people--a two-man history department, and we were really close.  And that's why the term I use now, Mr. History, that's my nickname.  My other nickname, and it started back then, and I was a graduate assistant during my last year and my--first year of my master's degree.  And I, I liked it.
Speaker 1: Now, what are your experiences like in the city of--where Fisk University is?
Speaker 2: In Nashville, Tennessee?
Speaker 1: What are your experiences like that, in that city, of living there?
Speaker 2: Well, Fisk was a kind of, off by itself.  It was in the heart of the city, but it was, you know, like a private school.  And we had several white students come to us because it's--Pomona College [Claremont, California], I think it is.  What is that school that Rich [President Richard] Nixon went to?  They all came to--students, exchange programs.  And that was okay, as long as you on the campus.  And we had some African students.  Now, you know, they let--it was a racist city.  There was African fellows, thought they were white.  They didn't know they're black, see.  And they liked, they, they had a great love for white girls.  And those white girls on the campus would be sitting around, and they'd be sitting around lounging, you know, with their head in their lap, on the main drag.  Well, you know, on, on Fisk campus, you could do that.  But they thought they would go downtown when the time came for Christmas, and going for Christmas, this African boy went down with this white girl to the train station, I think it's Broad Street station, Broadway or something, and put her on the train.  And the white boys caught him and jumped him.  He didn't nothing to do with us 'cause, you know, he, they didn't want to be black.  And the white boys beat his tail, and he called us at the dormitory, football player, come on boy--come boys, come boys, come boys, me, me need help, me need help, come on boys, help me out, help me out; they beating me, they beating me.  And we said, we ought to tear your behind, see what I mean, 'cause he was down there, you know--there are some things you just didn't do by yourself.  And that's one experience.  I never will forget that experience.  Then I remember the teachers.  I had some teachers.  You know, Fisk was like a Mecca.  Fisk was even better than Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] at that particular time.  And it had the leading people, artists and professors and things.  You didn't have, you know, like you normally had, Aaron Douglas and people like that, George Redd, and [William] Faulkner and people like that.  We just had some great people there.

Speaker 1: So at this point, you graduated from Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  What are your thoughts on what you would do next?
Speaker 2: Well, find a job.  It was my thought and everybody's, find a job.  I didn't teach because I did not take a lot of education courses.  So I didn't go in the public school system, you know what I mean, and I came back, and I went into the--took the police test and made a tremendous high score.  And so I worked there a little while, and then went over to that school [Manual Labor School for Colored Boys, Hanover, Virginia].  It was a juvenile school.  It wasn't like a regular school, and I became assistant principal of that school.
Speaker 1: Now, you were saying, you were the first African American officer?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the first in uniform.  The other ones were plain clothes.
Speaker 1: Now, what brings you, what are the steps that bring you to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical] University [Tallahassee, Florida], right before you get there?  You're teaching at--you get your master's--?
Speaker 2: Well, when I finished, went back and wrote my thesis, the people at Florida A&M was looking for a teacher cause the people here had, had the bus boycott, the, the Tallahassee bus boycott.  And they were not fired, but they were not gonna get an increase.  So they left at the last minute and went to Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], a couple of Ph.D's went to Southern University.  So they were desperate to find somebody to replace 'em, and this was almost September.  So they called the professor at Fisk and asked him if they had anybody, did they know anyone they could get.  But the meantime I had gotten a call to go to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] to teach.  I wanted to be a college teacher.  But Tuskegee said, okay, I could come here for a year and come back to Tuskegee the next year.  And I heard so much talk about the rattler, the [Florida] A&M Rattlers 'cause a lot of the boys at Fisk, on the football team with me were from St. Petersburg [Florida], and they were all talking about the mighty Rattlers.  So I came here to see what a rattler looked like, and I planned to stay one year.  And now, forty-three years later, I'm sitting right here talking to you.
Story_ID: 6757
Speaker 1: So what was it like when you first came here [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?  And your job, what--your description--?
Speaker 2: I came as an instructor, as an ordinary instructor, and went through every phase of the game, and I became a prof--full professor, got tenure, outstanding professor, I told you, over thirty-some times; honorary degrees and everything else and teacher of the year constantly.  So, you know, I taught hard and I work hard.  And developed the Black Archives [Research Center and Museum, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Finally, twenty-seven years ago now, I decided that the archives were more important than this teaching because I--it's sort of important for the records and things.  But also the bicentennial year.  They were paying little white kids and white people to crochet the confederate flag and to paint these little fire plugs.  So my argument was that I need to do something for black history.  How you going to show the history of the nation, two hundred years and not show the history of the largest, single, non-English speaking group in the New World.  And that was us.  And so I got fifteen thousand dollars from the centennial commission and I got five thousand dollars from a company called Wynn-Dixie, and we got started.  It grew and grew and grew and grew.
Speaker 1: Now, in 1958 when you got here, what would you say was the status of black history being taught on this campus?
Speaker 2: Didn't have any, didn't have any.  After being here, I was able to get a course called "Negro History", and later on I was able to get a minor, using my influence and the influence of Dr. [Leedell W.] Neyland, my dean, were able to get a minor in Black Studies only here and University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida].  A lot of schools couldn't even offer it, and we had to do that without any money.  And later on in 1971, a man called Joe Lang Kershaw, that's where we are right now, in the Kershaw Room.  He was the first black man in the state legislature since Reconstruction, had a bill passed that mandated that there be a black archives and research center on the campus of this university, headed by a recognized authority in African American history.  So I took that position, and here I am.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about how the focus changed during the '60's [1960s], especially in that Civil Rights Movement period, how your classes in the hist--what you were teaching in history, were affected by what was going on right there in the '60's [1960s] during that Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: But they were participating in it.  A lot of the kids were marching and stuff like that.  I got one student I think, still think he got killed in Mississippi, a fellow named Best.  I don't--something happened to him, and he was killed, but he was a good history major, and I had students going downtown trying to integrate the movie house.  They were trying to integrate the, the eating places, drugstores and what have you.  And the policemen arrested them and walked on them--more people arrested than they could keep in the jail so they put them in a long field, it was football, like a football field at the fairgrounds.  And they was stepping on the girls and everything else, and it was big, big struggle.  University couldn't mix--couldn't condone it and didn't want to condemn it.  So I took sort of to leading, leading the students a lot of times down there.  And I was not necessarily out on the ground, but I would watch and see what's going on.  And the president would call me and say, "Eaton, since you're in history, sort of let me know what's going on, but don't, you know, get to the point that, get too involved that they beat you across the head with a stick."  And it just--I was asked to leave town several times by the big white people in this city; offered me a one-way ticket to anywhere I wanted to go, just don't come back, president of one of the banks here.  The judge, Rudd (ph.)--the judge was threatening to put me in jail cause I wrote a letter criticizing his decisions.  And just writing letters to the paper was dangerous.  Ku Klux Klan came to my house--I mean they came.  And when I called for help, they said, "We gonna get you and don't"--what did they say?  "Call back after something happen to you."  So I got my gun and got a bunch of students, and we went up there on, where I used to live, and had our guns on and a dog named Frog.  And we all got together, and when they came to my house--the cops came by to see what's going on, I had my shotgun in my hand and my pistol on my side.  I heard they thought I was crazy, and they didn't mess with me anymore, yeah.  That's well documented.
Speaker 1: Now, did this at all dissuade you from teaching what you were teaching or being as active in the community?
Speaker 2: No, I'm still active, much as I can do, much as I can get around.  I, I'm diabetic now, so I don't get around like I used to, but I'm doing the best I can.
Speaker 1: Now, did you see a shift, not just here where you were teaching black history at FAMU in the '60s [1960s], but did you notice in the '60s [1960s] at that turbulent time, black, being taught black studies or African American studies or whatever, colleges started picking up on this, in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but white schools had to pick up on it too and had the money and, you know, they took it, they were the one who carried it.  And they didn't want to recognize black people, you know what I mean, all the great black people or many that you talked about some time, got in the limelight, and really didn't pay the price.  I don't want to go into all that because I know a lot of the things that took place.  I was right there, but they became very popular, say, "I rode with Freedom Fighters", or "I was marching downtown".  Well, they were some of the ones who were trying to block it; same folks was trying to get 'Amos and Andy' off TV shows, you know.  So that's why records so important.  That's why, young man, it's important to have those documents, so I can go and put 'em up there and say, look, you were writing things about not participating.  Of course, I won't do that, but somewhere along the line somebody will have to do it sooner or later.
Story_ID: 6758
Speaker 1: Earlier on, you spoke about the moment when you realized you needed to start collecting these documents.  Tell that story.  You touched on it earlier about when you realized that it was important for us to start creating archives and--?
Speaker 2: Well, because if the students can't get the documents 'cause they're not the right color, how in the world can you write the history?  Do you think that [Ariel] Sharon is gonna let the Arabs have all the documents of what happened to the Jewish people?  No way, nor the Nazis, and I don't blame them and vise versa because you got to have two sides of that story.  And while I'm not on either side of that, you need to have somebody writing about it that had the experience.  Who better to write about what's happening right now to [Yassir] Arafat but somebody who was there, that might not tell the truth.  They might be telling a bunch of lies, but you need that point of view too.  So when you get ready to compare notes, you compare notes.  So I realized soon that we had to have these documents.  And the black school and the black church was a Mecca of these records.  Now, what I'm worried about now, young man, is that this computer is gonna eliminate all of that, see, 'cause when you had--the olden days, you had what they called Xerox copies.  And every time a president wrote a letter to another president, black president, you would have that copy made of that letter as well as a copy of the reply when it came back.  So together, stapled together or either clipped together, there would be a letter out, a letter in, which is a lot of history.  It won't happen anymore.  See, so that's why I'm trying to get there records while I can because once you got in that computer, anything can go wrong.  Go to the bank and the computer be done, get erased or something.  But you need--you got both sides together.  And I have trouble trying to tell my staff how important it is to know your history before you try to catalogue this stuff.  And then, like I said, I've been saying, like the things like Bill Robinson and stuff like that.  Most young, black people don't know anything about it.  And the whites know somebody, when they gave their dissertation, they get interested in it and get it all together and put it in a book.  Then you can't use it no more, yes.
Speaker 1: What were the first documents that you collected for your archives [Black Archives Research Center and Museum, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?  What year was that, if you can at all kind of--?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had started before '71 [1971], I had started some documents before that.  Mr. [John Gilmore] Riley, one of my--the man who hired me here, had taken over responsibility of starting the archives--it wasn't but four or five boxes, but I took those and went with those, and went to the basement--I go places and find things and, all kinds of things, and put it together; come up with this, these types of things.  Man minded now that, I mean every single black student in high school had to go to school on scholarship by impressing the president of a black university of how good these students were.  So if you were in a little high school in Micanopy [Florida] somewhere, they would send this program up here to the college president.  This girl is good in drama.  Therefore, would you give her a scholarship?  So if I don't get the scholarship for her, this same girl's program will be attached to this letter.  So not only am I getting the history of the university, I'm getting the history of all of these other rural schools in the whole state of Florida.  And I got grants, I, I've gotten over--right now, I think the, the grant total is about ten million dollars to collect and stuff like that, you know, so I do it.  All his--all black schools in Florida, one grant.  We got another grant right now, and stuff like that.  And, and build--building a new building, so, you know, you got to have a zeal for it.  I had the zeal.
Speaker 1: What I really want to know, is, I'm sitting here and looking at all these collections, and it's gotten this point, the process?  When did you start realizing the process about how I'm gonna go about collecting, creating this archives and the purpose for it?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, the need created the process.  I just collect.  Then I try to put it together 'cause it's all thrown together in some places, even those dumps.  I've been to dumps and trash piles to get stuff.  And then I go through it, and, you know, if it's a church program, it goes in the black church collection.  If it's a school, then it goes in the black education collection and put it together.  If it was already organized, I kept it organized.  So you have to sort, you know, something new--we, we were the first school to start this.  And now we call it the Southeastern Regional so we encompass the whole Southeast.  Then I used to have--I had a mobile unit, not the one up there, another one, and they would go all over the state of Florida and as far as Washington, D.C., it would collect--I would collect, and I would take things.  I had it set up so I could tape, Xerox, collect and also exhibit.  So I collected things almost everywhere.  Knowing that most black people are still angry because the white people went and integrated these schools, kicked the black people out of a teaching position and put them in some kind of coaching or some kind of counseling position, they didn't give the records to the school board.  They gave the records to me.  That's how I ended up.
Story_ID: 6759
Speaker 1: That story you spoke of earlier about the lynching papers in the files.  Have you--and you saw how some Caucasian people who were in charge of these information didn't want to give it to blacks.  Have you come across that often, where there is information that, right now is controlled by other people and it's--?
Speaker 2: No, not any more, but it's mostly by scholars.  See, since most of these scholars are white people, they still control, 'cause scholars are, scholars are dangerous for archives, believe it not, 'cause they think whatever they working on belong to them.  And when I give a scholar or professor my papers to use, I try very hard to watch him, 'cause he'll steal it.  See, you're looking at me funny, but that's the first person--almost all the books in library that get misplaced, are misplaced by professors, 'cause they figure that, "I'm the only person interested in Zora Neale Hurston, I ought to have all of these papers."  Then they came here and got all the books we had on Zora Neale Hurston and refused to return 'em, and you couldn't make 'em return 'em, other than the library.  She gave us some paper back, but it ain't like the originals.  See, first edition, and my thing is rare books.  I got some books go back to 1799, the only copies in the world, right here [Black Archives Research Center and Museum, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I got maps, and I take great pride in those.  I mean, and, and my problem is getting enough time to get them catalogued and get, get 'em out, which I probably won't be able to do, but at least they'll be here.  Somebody else could do that.  They're in those fireproof containers.
Speaker 1: So you're saying scholars, or scholars--and what you, you're saying scholars aren't--?
Speaker 2: Scholars will steal.  So I don't know, I don't any other way, any other way to put it.  They will take it because they think if they interested in it, they got to have it.  They didn't want to sit there and copy it all down and if we ain't careful, they'll stick it in something else, yes.
Speaker 1: So what do you think has been the biggest impediment from archives, especially for black people, their--our archives has been from the information being out there before now?  What was the problem before now that it wasn't out there?  Why wasn't this information available and out there for us?
Speaker 2: Well, getting enough money to get 'em, get it, get it catalogued and what have you.  And it was also a friendship thing.  If I know you and, and you're one of my former students and you sent to [Florida] A&M, I'm subject to let you have a little break and see some things, you know, just telling about it, give you something to look forward to.  But obviously they shouldn't do that.  The biggest trouble I have with my staff is don't--you not supposed to do the work for them.  They supposed to know what they looking for.  See, it's not a library.  It's the hardest thing, young man, in the world to get people to realize that archives keep records.  A library give records out.  But a archives keep original records, and a library usually give printed material out.  You got to come and ask for something.  You don't just don't go and say, I got so and so and so, and here, look in this box and so and so, just because you got it.  You got to know what you talking about.  It's for serious scholars, and a serious scholar ought to know, I know what you got on so and so and so.  Then they, then they will write you a little note and they e-mail you know, I'm working on Joe Blow and would you check your archives--what you got on Joe Blow?  Who's gonna do all that, searching on that?  They say, I see you got in your catalogue some material on Joe Blow.  Will you send me copies of it, and if you pay for the copies I got to make and the time somebody to make 'em, that's fine.
Story_ID: 6760
Speaker 1: In 1976, tell us about what was formed and what began, in 1976?
Speaker 2: 1976?  Well, we started the Black Archives [Research Center and Museum, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Tell us how that came about?
Speaker 2: It came about by getting these papers, me and a fellow named Dr. Don Hill, white man, picture right over in that case over there--spent the night setting up things.  We didn't have a whole lot.  He had some artifacts.  I had some, and another graduate student named James Bruton (ph.), he had some stuff, and we, we just put it together.  All I can't--if you got something that I think should belong to me, I'll just take it. I was big, bad and black, so I'll take it.  You can't take my history.  That's important to me.  I mean take it.  Everybody know that.  They, and they come bringing it to me.  They bringing it before Eaton take it.
Speaker 1: Now, were there people who were trying to not give to you what should have been controlled by Africans Americans in your perspective?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I mean--nah, people always think.  Nah, I take that back.  They always feel that if I wanted something that's, it's unique, it's worth something.  And most things aren't worth anything by itself.  You know, everybody say, if he want it, it's worth five thousand dollars.  It ain't worth twenty cents, but it ain't worth nothing if you got it over there.  They can't preserve it.  They have, they have staples in it.  Then they have scotch tape on it and everything else.  I take it, and I clean it up and wash it and everything else, get it like it's supposed to be, make it safe, to preserve another hundred years.
Speaker 1: What have you had to go get?  Give us a story about something you had to go get?
Speaker 2: Oh, man, anything, I mean if you got it, once you tell me you got it, I'm gonna come and get it.  And they ain't gonna take it back.  I took the building downtown at Union Bank [Tallahassee, Florida], an old building, built by, it was built by slaves, was a Union bank.  It was a, had money in there that came from black people.  How you gonna claim this building?  And I need a building too.  No, siree.  And they let me, (unclear) it for a year, and I been in it every since, yes, sir.  That make sense to you?  If you dedicate it.  All they can do is kill me, and I'm a old man anyway.  All I'll do is go.  He died fighting for a cause.
Story_ID: 6761
Speaker 1: I would like to know the story about your attempt--your getting of the slave cage?  Could you please tell the story of where you found this and--?
Speaker 2: Somebody contaced me, I don't know who, somebody in New York contacted me.  I don't know--people will contact me, see.  If something good around, then you get, you know about it.  They, they call me and offered the slave cage and gave it to me, and pay your shipping costs of it, but I couldn't do nothing with it.  It needed to be fixed up too, you see, and had to be on the outside.  I mean maybe when I get this building, new building, I'll be able to put it on the outside some kind of way and have it painted some kind of paint that it won't rust anymore, and, you, you know, get it restored.
Speaker 1: Now, what was this cage, and what was the importance and significance of it?
Speaker 2: Used, I guess it was, it came to be used to haul slaves around, you know, go in this cage and, and haul--take 'em around, so I heard.
Story_ID: 6762
Speaker 1: What have the challenges been, and not only accessing and getting archives [Black Archives Research Center and Museum, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], but trying to maintain them and getting a larger space for it?  What has that challenge been like?
Speaker 2: A constant lack of money.  And a constant, trying to convince black people they got a history.  See, a whole lot of black people, especially in this environment, don't want to be black.  You know, they have been so brainwashed they think they are way above everybody else, and they don't want to hear about it, yeah, and give out these big donations.  I've had a donation box here, and in the course of twenty-some years, we haven't gotten, from black people, two thousand dollars, not, not in the donation box.  Then in walk a white group one day, EDS [Electronic Data Systems Corp.], a group from EDS, and they threw in almost ten thousand dollars at one time.  See, the difference I'm trying to tell you, and so we don't realize that it costs money, you know.
Speaker 1: And what do you think, do you--what do you think the problem is with blacks and our history and understanding the importance of it?  What do you think that is?
Speaker 2: They want to forget about it, a lot of them, I think, because they--it's not always positive.  So they want to ignore it.
Speaker 1: And why don't you think it should be ignored by them?  Why don't you think they should ignore? Some of the more--the uglier situations of their past, our past?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think they want to, they want to face reality.  They think they doctor so and so and so, and they always had it, you look, you talk to them, a silver spoon in their mouth, and, you know, this and everything.  Just like Yankees.  First thing a Yankee will tell you, is that I'm from the North.  I'm not prejudiced.  Everybody's prejudiced.  Everybody is (unclear)--I mean I don't see any difference between a person in the North and one in the deep South.  They're good and bad.  It doesn't make you not prejudiced 'cause you from the North, but maybe cause your heart is different, your soul is different, but not necessarily your location.  You know what I mean, and a lot of things people do is just stupid, but they do it because they get caught up with the times.
Speaker 1: My question is really, it's like especially in these archives you have so much, and speaking back to that kind of a hatred or--I shouldn't say hatred, a denial to want to remember certain things, do you not understand why some blacks wouldn't want to remember something like the 'Amos and Andy' or Stepin Fetchit or the slave, when we were slaves and the brutality of that?  Do you not--?
Speaker 2: Well, you look at the slave chain I got over here, and all the other stuff I got will soon convince you, but it's here.  And you need to look at it.  You'll never understand the brutality of slavery 'til you actually see the slave chains.  So you need to understand it, and you need to understand that Stepin Fetchit was the only person that was doing movies that particular time, and he was doing it because he was hired to do it, you know what I mean.  You see black professors and things treat black students any kind of way some time or programs.  It isn't always the, the white people.  It's just that people just don't understand some things.
Speaker 1: And what do you think the role is of the black historians into changing that thought that black people have--?
Speaker 2: Is to teach history, teach it as it is.  I don't know exactly what the role would be in terms of convincing people that you have to accept it, but you ought to know about it.  You ain't got to like it or dislike it, but you ought to know about it.  I don't like the Ku Klux Klan, but I got the material here.  Why I got it here?  I got it here because what?  You got to know about the Ku Klux Klan.  The Black Panthers, you might not like them, but what?  They--it is a fact you got to deal with they did exist.  How you gonna talk about history and leave out the black, the Black Panthers?  So it doesn't matter whether you're on this side or the other side, you don't take sides. You just deduce the evidence, the facts, the facts, young man, nothing but the facts.
Speaker 1: So what do you think the role is, the role right now, a black historian for the black community?  What do you think his purpose should be?
Speaker 2: His purpose should be to tell the truth, to portray life as it was, as it is and try to predict what it's gonna be like in the future.
Story_ID: 6763
Speaker 1: Now, your archive [Black Archives Research Center and Museum, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  There's a building going up not far from here that will most--that will bear your name.
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about that.  There'll be a building going up right next door here, but I don't know about, whose name it's gonna bear.  It doesn't really matter, but I want to build it.
Speaker 1: And what do you think the importance of that building will be?
Speaker 2: We can, a lot of stuff we can show, a lot of things you could see what's at the Union Bank [Tallhassee, Florida] if it's over here, see, right now.  A lot of things we can show, we can do, yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: And how long--how much more space, if you could just dream of it, how much space do you think is necessary for this southeastern regional archive would need to show, for your archive system?
Speaker 2: Never enough space, never enough cause we're gonna keep growing.  Right now, if we could get thirty thousand additional square feet, this is ten thousand square feet we got already.
Story_ID: 6764
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That African American history is the history of America.  That's my--and I want people to realize that, that it's American history.  I don't teach black history.  I don't teach white history.  I teach history.  And I try to prove history.
Speaker 1: What would you, as a person, and the name Dr. James Eaton, is said, be remembered for most?
Speaker 2: Dedicating to the historic preservation, dedication to historic preservation.
