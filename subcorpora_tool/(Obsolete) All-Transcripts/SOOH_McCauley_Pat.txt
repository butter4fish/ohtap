 Finchum  McCauley  Today is June 9, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re doing an oral history  project featuring women Extension educators. We   re in Anadarko,  Oklahoma, today to talk with Pat McCauley, who started with Extension  in 1970 and retired in 1992. During that time she was with the  Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program. Thank you for  joining us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your youth, where you  were born, siblings and that sort of thing, and then we   ll move forward.  Well, I was born in Beggs, Oklahoma, which is in Okmulgee County,  and I was born at home. It was February 22, 1936. I have heard that the  night I was born, the creek rose and my dad had to go get the old country  doctor and bring him out to the house to deliver me. So, that tells my age  a little bit. That ages you a little bit when that happens. I had one  brother, and he was born the year I started school. So, I kind of grew up  like an only child, I guess. He was born in 1941, and I was happy to  have a little brother come on the scene. That   s the only sibling that I  have. My dad was in the oilfields, so we moved quite often, and I don   t  remember much about the first few years.  The first home I remember is a home in the oilfield north of Hominy,  Oklahoma, and we lived in an oilfield house, of course, but there were  advantages to that because our house usually had electricity. We didn   t  always have the other indoor facilities that you needed sometimes, but it  was a very comfortable place, and I wasn   t in school then. I know we  had a big screened-in porch on the front of the house, and that was  wonderful because you could go out there in the daytime and take a nice,  cool nap. I remember our canary bird used to hang out there on the front  5  porch. Mother and I were out there having a nap one day, and I looked  up and a snake was   you know, it was a porch out in the woods, and  there was a snake there. I think he got my canary bird, but anyway, it  was a nice home.  Then from there, let   s see. We were there until my dad   he was an  oilfield employee. So, he was deferred from the service once because of  that. Then he had two children, but right before he turned thirty-six they  called him up to go to service. He went in for his exam, and he passed it  1-A. He requested that he be put in the navy, and that was going to be  okay. So, the folks went in town, and they found this little house in  town. My grandma and grandpa had a grocery store there in Hominy,  and they found this little house in town. He bought it so she would be in  town, and close to her folks while he was gone. About that time, the war  ended, and he never did have to go, so that made a change in our life.  From there, we moved to Chandler, Oklahoma, and he worked for an  independent oil company. The only thing, it was west of Chandler, there  on Route 66. I would sit out there on the swing and watch the traffic go  by on 66. The troops would come by, and I   d sit out there and wave at  them, and they   d wave back. (Laughter) I just remember it seemed like  line after line. I don   t know where they were going, or where they had  been, but it was interesting. We used to have tramps that came by. The  only thing I can remember about the oilfield very much is that we had  electricity, and we had a modern house then. I went to a one-room  schoolhouse that was very close to where we lived, and I could ride my  bicycle there, but it was all eight grades. There were two of us girls that  were in the first grade, and we had a man teacher. We had a potbelly  stove in this one-room schoolhouse, and we had boys as big as the  teacher was there in the school. The teacher would take our sandwiches  and toast them for us and warm them up in the winter time, and he was  just really nice.  Well, now I   m getting this crossed up a little bit.  The teacher  had to go  to service, but I know this was after the time my dad didn   t have to. I  don   t know where I got that switched around, but anyway, he had to go  to service. So, they just put his wife in his position, and she came out  and taught us the rest of the year. I went there two years, and my dad got  transferred to Drumright, Oklahoma, and we lived east of Drumright. In  Drumright I went to another school that was called Pleasant Hill also,  and there was more than just one room to it. It was a nice little country  school up on a hill, and it was pleasant most of the time, so it was  appropriately named. We rode horses and bicycles and sleds. I enjoyed  my growing up.  I went to school in Drumright until before my junior year started, and  6  Finchum  McCauley  when I started my junior year, we found out we had to move. Drumright  High School was the school I hated to leave. I was just broken-hearted  when we had to move, but it was for the benefit of the whole family,  because my dad was getting a promotion or a better job, and he went to  work as head roustabout for Texaco. At that time, we moved to Apache,  and that was the first time I   d been down in southwest Oklahoma. It was  a real blow, I thought. (Laughter) I thought,    Oh, this is the end of the  world here in Apache.    Being a sixteen-year-old girl, I had other things  on my mind, I guess. I enjoyed the school where it was, but we moved.  Started high school there and got acquainted with the kids, and it all  worked out for the better.  I was going to say, when we moved to Apache, I thought it was kind of  barren. Well, then I met my husband and dated him. He lived in Altus,  and we went over there, and I thought that was more barren than Apache  had been. (Laughs) It   s all relative, isn   t it? And then it got to looking  better, and my kids moved to Hollis a few years back, and I thought,     No. This is it. Hollis is it.    (Laughs) So, what we grow up with is what  we like, but that basically covers my growing up until I got out of high  school.  In high school did you plan on what your career might be? Did you have  any idea?  Well, I was thinking the other day. We didn   t have counselors when I  was in high school, especially in small high schools, and I was  impressed with my home economics teachers. One of them was Mary  Ellen Goodman. She was one of my home economics teachers, and the  other one was Virginia Darnell. They both impressed me, and talked  with me some about it, but I really hadn   t made up my mind. My parents  probably hadn   t planned on me going to college too much, but I decided  it was something I was going to do. Nobody was pushing me to make  any big decisions at that time, but I decided I was going to go to college  if I had to work and do it myself. I decided that Cameron would be  better for me at Lawton because I was from a small school, and I just  thought I could do better at Cameron. I enrolled, and my folks helped  me, of course, but I had jobs all the time. I had a job on the weekend  working at the drugstore, which was the main part of town in Apache at  that time, and I had a job at college.  My first job I think was, oh yes, working for Allie D. Swackhammer.  That was our home economics teacher then, and she kept us busy. I think  we put a few grey hairs in her head. My roommate and I worked for her,  and we learned a lot by doing that and had a good time. I thought home  economics was all right, if I could just get through chemistry (laughs),  so it worked out. I knew I wanted to go into home economics, but I  7  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  graduated, finished my two years there and transferred to OSU. At OSU  I took home economics education, HEE, took that curriculum. It was a  nice experience I wouldn   t trade for anything. I was ready for a big  college by then, and different. I knew I wanted to go to OSU because it  was back up, what I considered, home, moving up that way.  What year would that have been?  I graduated high school in 1954, and then I was at Cameron    54 through     56, and then OSU. I graduated in 1958.  Did they have the practice house at that time?  Yes, we did. (Laughs) That was interesting. It was, I bet it   s not even  there now, the one out north of campus, kind of. It was a white house. It  wasn   t the brick one that was down on the main drag there. And our  director there, or instructor there, I cannot think of her name, and I   ve  been trying to do that. She was allergic to eggs, and we decided that she  just made that up to give us a challenge, and perhaps she did. Perhaps  she didn   t. I don   t know, but there were two or three things like that that  she couldn   t do, or we couldn   t do it that way, making us realize that  that   s what you run into, I guess.  What was your favorite class? Not chemistry, obviously.  Obviously. Well, I liked my classes in family relationships about as well  as anything. Those were probably my favorite, and then I liked housing.  I thought that was very interesting, and nutrition came around about  third, I think, or foods, anyway.  When you graduated, at that time did you think about Extension, or  doing something different?  Nobody ever talked to me about Extension, really. I mean, very little,  and if they did, it didn   t soak in very much. I had a little bit of 4-H when  I was in school at Drumright in elementary school, but we just met at  school or after school. I really wasn   t very active, I guess, but it didn   t  seem the club was, at that time, either.  Well, when you graduated what did you do next?  After I graduated. Well, while I was going to school, another one of my  jobs was working at Fort Sill for the Department of Engineers. I had  passed the Civil Service test. I knew I was going to get married in  December, the year after I graduated, but I went home, and I applied for  the home ec job at Carnegie High School. They called and told me I got  8  Finchum  McCauley  the job. Then I had to call and tell them that I wouldn   t take it for half a  term, or for a term, and then leave them. So I told them,    Well, I  appreciate it, but I had a change of plans.    And so, I got married, and my  husband and I moved to Shiprock, New Mexico, right after we got  married. We lived on the Navajo Reservation in a little compound out  there right on the San Juan River. I wasn   t going to do anything for a  while, so they called and asked if I would come and teach at the school  in Shiprock. That was a lot of Navajo kids who didn   t speak English, for  one thing, or pretended they couldn   t, whichever the case might be. I  taught science for the last semester of that year.  In Shiprock, most of the time, we got a plan and had a good job, had  good friends and could go whenever we wanted to. There was several  other ladies out there that were newlyweds, too, and we enjoyed life for  a couple of years. Then we got promoted and got to come back to  Anadarko, and my husband worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I  married George Albert McCauley from Victory High School, was where  he graduated. That   s the one west of Altus on  Highway  62. It   s not  there anymore.  When you moved back to Anadarko, did you work, initially?  Yes. We moved back in the springtime, and we couldn   t find any place  to rent. My mom and dad had been kind of looking for us because we  were out in New Mexico, and we wanted to move just one time when we  came back. We couldn   t find a place to rent, so they called and said they  found this pretty little house on the corner in Anadarko, and it was for  sale. The people that had built it were getting a divorce, and they had to  turn the house. So, they were wanting us to buy this old house, or they  had found this for us. We bought this little house and lived there until     79, I think, on that corner in that little pink house. Had one child there,  Melissa.  I was out mowing the lawn one day in the summertime, and it was  getting about time for school to start, and these two gentlemen drove up  and stopped to talk to me. Of course, I looked like The Grapes of Wrath  in my mowing clothes (laughter), and it was the school principal for  third grade and the superintendent, and they wanted to know if I   d be  interested in a teaching job. I said,    Well, yes, what do you have?    They  had this third grade teacher  who  had become terminally ill, and they  needed somebody to replace her. I said,    Yes, but I don   t have a  teaching certificate. I have a home economics certificate.    I had applied  for the home economics job, and I didn   t get it that first year. When we  went back, I applied in the summer after we got there, and so that   s one  reason they came by. He said,    That   s all right. You can get a  provisional. It   ll make you a certificate.    And I said,    Well, I   m willing  9  Finchum  McCauley  to try.     So, I went to work in about three or four days and taught third grade, and  I taught for five years there in third grade. I remember that first year we  had thirty-four kids in a classroom, you know, just a regular-size  classroom, little third graders. It wasn   t fair to put  that many  kids  in  one classroom , it really wasn   t. I mean, I did the best I could, and they  did the best they could, but that was before we changed class sizes and  things. I hope it doesn   t go back to that, which it sounds like it might  could. When my daughter was born, in    66, I got the home economics  job, after I taught five years in elementary because it came open again.  We had applied to adopt a child, and at Easter time that year they called  and told me that they had our child. So, we got a little girl, and after I  finished that year I decided,    Well, I   m just going to stay home and  enjoy my daughter.    I always told George,    Well, you can do what you  want to, but I don   t want to get into debt any more than what we can  afford so I can stay home and raise children if I want to.    Of course, I  didn   t do it that much, I would do my part, but I didn   t want to feel like I  had to be at work all the time while I had little kids.  So, she was the only one, and I went back to work. The year she was  ready to start school, Mary Jackson, who was a home economist in  Caddo County at that time, came to my house one day to tell me about  this new program. She asked me if I might be interested in talking to the  district director. I said,    Well, yes, I   ll talk to him.    It was supposed to  be a pilot program, and it would probably last a year or two. They  weren   t sure. It was an Expanded Food and Nutrition Program, so that  was a nice day that I found out about that. I went down and talked to  Harold Liles. He was our district director at that time, and then Mr.  Cook was over, and I was back at work again. They were always trying  to get me to work. I don   t know why. (Laughter) Don   t know why, but I  enjoyed the job very much.  What did it entail?  It   s a federally-funded program, and it   s still in effect. I   ll go ahead and  tell you what it entailed. It worked on the premise that we would use  paraprofessionals to teach homemakers. Our audience was low-income  homemakers with children in the home still, basically, and we were to  teach basic food and nutrition. I had to first get acquainted a little bit  with the county and go to some training in Stillwater before I started on  this. There were some other counties starting up at the same time. I was  to teach paraprofessionals, but first, like I said, we had to find them.  Harold Liles said,    Go into the neighborhoods that will be your target  neighborhoods, talk to people and see who they feel are the leaders in  their community. Choose your paraprofessionals from those if they   re  10  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  available and you can.    I did that, and we interviewed. Of course, he  helped me with some of the interviewing, too, and I was glad he did, but  we interviewed several people.  We came up with eight or ten ladies for that first training session that we  had, and we did training there in Anadarko. We had ladies from Eakly,  in the northern part of the county. We had some from Apache and  several from Anadarko, because that   s the most populous part of our  county. It was just designed for Caddo County. We had in-service  training for them. I had to schedule all the training. We did most of our  training at the community action center and the lower-end housing  center that   s in Anadarko here. They had a community center and they  let us use it, and we did some at the Extension office and it went on. I  had people from Stillwater come down to help with training. Irma  Manning was our program leader for the Expanded Food and Nutrition  Program, and was until she retired. We had classes in all sorts of   subjects  like budgeting, preparing food to preserve the nutrients to be  the best or most nutritious they could be for you, how to store your food.  I mentioned budgeting. Helped them with their budget and meal  planning.  Then we had a youth element to our program, too, and we would work  with youth in the home or even in small groups. We would have youth  meetings sometimes, and we would try to work the youth into 4-H  programs if at all possible. Tried to interest them in that. And one of our  purposes, too, I felt like, was to kind of get these people interested in the  OSU Extension Center and using our resources, or  getting  acquainted  with it and feeling comfortable to come into the Extension office. I was  housed with the rest of the Extension employees there.  At the courthouse?  Yes, at the courthouse. They   re still at the courthouse. I was in there this  week.  Did you have to travel quite a bit in that job?  I worked half-time for the first several years that I worked, and we had  to have in-service training once a week after we had our initial training. I  would set up training for them, and, yes, I traveled. I traveled to Eakly  and Carnegie and Fort Cobb, and different parts of the county. I had to  go on home visits with them sometimes, schedule home visits with my  NEAs.  Which stands for what?  11  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  Nutrition Education Assistants. We called them aides, but we decided  that didn   t sound very good.  Did they get paid?  Yes, they were paid. They made minimum wage, anyway. They were  also evaluated on an annual basis, and they usually got some raise every  year if they were doing a good job. And they got paid travel. They had to  have a car. That was a bad part, and, you know, you tried to get your  assistants from the audience they   re going to be working with so they   ll  be accepted into that audience, and cars are sometimes a real problem. I  remember I learned to break into cars pretty good, too, because there  was always a bunch of women locking the keys in the car, (laughter) but  we learned to handle that.  Flat tires, too?  Well, I didn   t ever deal with any flat tires, but I had calls saying that    we  have a flat,    or    we couldn   t get to work,    or something. One of the  things that bothered me about working, after I moved to Lawton, I  would be at home, and I lived up on a hill. My roads can be icy, and you  can   t get up my hill or down my hill. You could get down it, but you  couldn   t get up it, and it was hard to get to work sometimes in the  winter. I mean, I was responsible for these ladies getting out on ice or  whatever, so I had to be the one to use the judgment of what not to do.  That kind of worried me, because I called in a time or two, not very  often, but I thought,    They think I   m just telling them it   s icy around  here, and I can   t get around.    It would be  icy  at home, but it wouldn   t  be at Lawton, thirty-five miles difference.  Our extension office was a very pleasant place to work. I   ll tell you, we  had a nice group of people. Mary Jackson, Mary Easterling and Harold  Liles. J. D. Nelson was our 4-H agent then, and we worked with the 4-H  program, too. At one point in our program, we hired another home  economist, and she worked on the youth part of the program. That  worked out very well. We had youth camps in the summer for low-income  children who didn   t have some experiences they might have had  at that time. You know, there weren   t too many opportunities for camps  and things back in the sixties, and what have you, in small towns. We   d  go out to the mountains. We had a fishing derby with the youth, and we  worked with several different organizations or networked with different  organizations to do those things.  Would you take the mothers grocery shopping, or would that be part of a  lesson?  12  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  The paraprofessionals did that, and for our training we would meet. Part  of our meeting had to be spent on reports since this was a federal  program. When the NEA started working with the family, first you have  to gain her confidence for letting you into her home, because that   s a big  step for people. It   s a hard thing to achieve. I mean, I marveled at how  well some of these ladies could do that that are my assistants. But we  would take a dietary recall. You would simply put down what you   d  asked them about what they   d had to eat the last twenty-four hours,  when you   d feel comfortable asking them that. They   d bring them to me,  and we   d kind of look it over.  I would have conferences with the NEAs to help them see how they  could better work with their families. The dietary recall, we   d take  another one, then, in about three months, and see if things had improved.  Many times they had, whether sometimes they may have just known  what they should put, but at least if they did they   d learned something  that they could use. I mean, we had no way of really knowing that that   s  what they   d had to eat. They were paying some attention. At first when I  first started, we still had the commodity program, and we would go to  the commodity center and do demonstrations sometimes. I know one  thing we did. We made a little cookbook just for commodity foods.  Which was usually cheese or     Cheese and flour and     Dried cherries or something?  Yes, yes, not too many in there. Canned chicken, I remember. Thought  I   d never forget those things, but cheese was a big item. (Laughs) We  made master mix. Well, it   s like Bisquick. You can bake biscuits out of  it, or you could bake a shortcake out of it, or whatever. Just flour, fat and  whatever we were using at the time.  Let   s see. We had records to do on training day. Then we would share  doing programs or teaching on training day, and, of course, we   d always  have announcements to make and things that they needed to do. They  had a little diary, too, to jot down what they planned to do the next  week, or what homes they had scheduled, or what group meeting they  had scheduled, and I could go to any of those that I wished. I made home  visits, and I usually went to most of the group meetings with them.  Sometimes they   d do the lesson, and sometimes I would, and we had  homemakers oh, maybe twice a year. We did a lot of that in Lawton, and  we   d do it out at the fairgrounds, or if there was an Extension program  that had to do a leaders lesson, or a program with one of the specialists  coming in that had to do with foods, I would usually let the NEAs come  13  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  to that as part of their training for that week. I figured that was as good  of information as they were going to get anywhere.  The home visits, I went several times. I mean, I   d try to go with  everyone about every other month, a visit. I didn   t go every day. I went  to the group meetings and things more. And if they wanted me to go,  anytime they   d come and ask me to go, I was glad to go.  Were there ever any men NEAs?  No, there wasn   t, and there hasn   t been that I know of.  What about any in your position? Men doing the nutrition?  No, no. I hadn   t thought about that. Now, they were exposed to Mr.  Nelson and Mr. Liles. He came in and helped me with training some,  telling about Extension so they   d be familiar with it, administration of  the Extension office and what our purposes were.  And you did that roughly for twenty-two years?  Well, when I went to Comanche County, I went on three-quarters time,  so it was twenty-two years, yes. Wow, didn   t seem that long. (Laughter)  We got to go to Stillwater for a couple of days. Well, we were gone  three days by the time we went up and spent two nights and came back. I  would take the NEAs to training in Stillwater, and they got to stay in the  Student Union, and of course eat at the Student Union. We had our  meetings at the Student Union, and they looked forward to that every  year. They got a chance to tell about some of the programs that they  were doing, and some of their achievements that they   ve made, and it  was nice. I   m glad they included that in our training.  Did they turnover quite a bit?  You know, I was thinking about that. I saw two of them yesterday that  started when I started, and the turnover was not too great. I mean, not as  much as you would think, but there were about, let   s see, out of probably  ten, I think when the program ended, I think I still had five of those  original ones. Every time they turned over, I had to do training again.  And this Extension home economist and ethnic home economist, the  head one in Comanche County before I went over there, we   d be training  together. We   d usually wait and hire. We   d hire them, and then wait  until we got three or four, and then do training. Then we   d switch off  like every other day or something on training.  Well, the main reason for switching counties was     14  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Our program was over. That two years ended about ten years later  (laughter), but we had finished here. Our funds were out at that time.  And you just transferred over, then?  Yes, I transferred over. None of the NEAs did, but most of them found  pretty good jobs, because the experience they had was valuable to them  in their work. One lady was a cook out at the hospital for a long time,  and it was a good job. One of them worked for Community Action.  Several of them got good jobs after that. We tried to kind of help them  find one, if we could. We did a lot of networking in our program, and we  worked with DHS to find families that would like to have us come and  visit them, and where we could do programs. We worked with  Community Action, and we worked with the tribe some, because they  liked to get a group of people, or they could get a group of people  sometimes or be influential. You know, they might tell them this is to  suit her or whoever, that she needs to visit with this lady or have this  lady come and visit with her, and that service is available. Sometimes  that paid off.  We worked with Marie Detty  Youth and Family Service Center , which  was the shelter, women   s shelter, in Lawton, and we would do programs  down there. One NEA would usually take Marie Detty and work with  those women, and that was our group meeting. There are ladies that  don   t want anybody to know where they are, you know. Their  husbands   if they   ve been abused or something usually, or just don   t  have a home at the time, and maybe they have children.  So, the NEAs could choose which group they wanted to work with?  Yes.  To some extent?  Yes, they could work up their own groups as long as they met the  criteria of being low-income. Yes, we worked with Head Start parents  some, and WIC  Women, Infants, and Children, federally-funded health  and nutrition program . We could go down to the WIC office and recruit  some clientele from time to time.  AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent Children? That may have not  been what they had here.  No, I don   t guess so. That would be like DHS, Department of Human  Services. We worked with those and public school. We did a few in the  15  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  public school. In Lawton they had a program, I can   t think of the name  of the program, for high school students, pregnant girls. We worked with  them.  In college, had you taken that many classes in nutrition to     No, but I received plenty of in-service in nutrition  training .  Well, you had the basics.  Yes. I had foods, quite a few foods courses.  In a typical day, did you get there by eight and stay until five, or did you  have some nights that were     Well, no. I didn   t have a lot of nights, unless we planned something,  because people don   t want you in their homes after five or before ten or  so in the mornings. Our office opened at 8:30. I went to the office at  8:30, and I usually worked my time on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday  and Thursday, and then I was usually off on Friday. There wasn   t a  typical day, because some days you might have to go up to Eakly and  make home visits up there, or attend meetings up there, and then get  back. I had to have conferences with the NEAs. I think I did two a  month from that. We   d come in and look at their records. It was a lot of  recordkeeping for me. I had a good secretary who kept that straight, and  we sent them into Stillwater. Being a federally-funded program, they  were evaluated.  I guess they were typed, then, or handwritten?  They were mostly handwritten. When I combined my report   I was  trying to think how often I sent in. I sent in a monthly report. It was  usually typed, yes.  By the secretary?  Yes, the secretary typed it.  When the program ended, and you switched to Lawton, what type of  work were you doing then? Similar?  Yes. I was trying to think of where the other home economist went.  Right now, I don   t recall, but I just moved in and used the ladies that she  had there. I think I had to do training not too long after I got there to fill  up our quota there, and I worked longer days there. And the work was  basically the same except (laughs) you   re in a city instead of a rural area.  16  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Most of our work was in Lawton itself, and we worked with Fort Sill,  the social services at Fort Sill, for some references. We worked with  DHS over there and basically about the same networking. That Marie  Detty Home was at Lawton, that I was talking about a while ago.  The distance you would have to travel would not be as broad as it was  there?  No, it really wasn   t.  It was more city.  The aides that were here had to travel in. One lived at Fort Cobb, one  lived at Eakly, and one lived at    I think they got travel for that one  training day, and if they lived close together then they would share it.  That was part of their job that they were supposed to do.  During this time, were you active in the state and national association?  Yes. I went to National in Tulsa and to Tan-Tar-A  in Osage Beach ,  Missouri. I think I went to those two. I was in the state organization, too.  During lunch you were talking about something the Association got  going for women. Do you want to discuss it on tape?  Oh, well I can, what I know about it. (Laughs)  No one else has, so we might as well  Well, it was part of the home demonstration clubs. I   m trying to think of  what year. It   s probably been twenty-five years ago, but Dr.  Joann   Haberman, she was at Presbyterian Hospital when this all started, or  Presbyterian office buildings. She   s moved out to an expensive area out  there north of Penn Square, office buildings and all.  There   s Village Green.  No, no. Anyway she still has an office, and she   s doing research in  breast cancer. Extension homemakers, they had one of their state  meetings, and I may not get all of this exactly correct, but this is what I  remember. She came and spoke to them, and told them what she was  doing, and she gave us a little bit of a cut in what it costs to have these  tests done. Extension homemakers gave a big push to getting people to  do this for their own good. You were supposed to go once a year if  things were normal, and when you   d go in you did a food recall, and you  documented your lifestyles as to how much coffee you drank, how many  17  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  cigarettes you smoked, or if you drank liquor or anything, or if you ate a  lot of fatty foods and all of these things, you   d write it down. She kept  that, and she   s using it in her research. I   ve been up there every time and  almost always run into somebody that started with that original group, or  started while they were a PH member.  That was for breast cancer screening?  Breast cancer. She had this thermogram, which I had never seen before,  but she   d take you in there first. It   s a cold room, and it   s just like a slab  of marble or something. You   d lay there for about fifteen minutes, and  they come in and do, it   s not exactly an X-ray machine, but it   s similar  to that, and it picks up the hot spots in your body where there might be a  problem.  A bad cell.  Yes, and she does a manual exam, and she starts doing the sonograms,  which I think are very effective, too, and of course, the mammograms.  She lets you know, unless there   s something really strange going on, that  day. She   ll let you know how you are before you leave that day, or if  you need to come back. She   ll tell you that. I think it   s been a  worthwhile program.  Going on for twenty-five years, that   s pretty good.  Yes. I   m wondering when she   s going to want to retire. I wouldn   t say  that for her. (Laughter) She   s a lovely lady.  All of your workers seem to pull together, network and accomplish  things like that.  Right.  Too, for the good.  Well, somebody else will probably tell you about it, but my  understanding was that the Extension homemakers in Comanche County  were the ones that finished up their 9-1-1 addresses and things and got  all of that information out. I shouldn   t mention that, because I don   t  know. (Laughs)  Could be, though.  But, they can accomplish a lot. Yes, yes.  18  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  In    92 you decided to retire.  My husband died January second of    92, and I got an offer to take early  retirement. I thought,    Life   s too short,    and I could think of all these  nice things I   d like to do. I had a farm to run, too. So, I just decided to  retire and take that opportunity. I   m glad I did. I enjoyed working with  the people I worked with. I couldn   t have asked for a better office staff  in either county.  Since retiring, you   ve just mainly worked on the farm, then?  Well, no. I   ve traveled quite a bit. (Laughs)  You haven   t taken a second job.  I think I got a call, but I didn   t think of going back.  So, in high school, you weren   t expecting to work with nutrition, and in  college you really weren   t either.  Well, but I had enough classes in home ec, the plan, the work, the  planning of what you   re going to take. There   s enough nutrition to be a  teacher.  Did you have to help with the county fairs?  No, we really didn   t have to. A lot of times, we might go. I would tell  the NEAs, if their homemakers would like, they could bring them out to  the fair and see some of the things we do, and what can be done. It   s an  interesting thing for them.  Would some of the lessons be on canning? Would it be that type of  nutrition?  Well, it   s cooking so that you conserve the most nutrients, and cooking  the basic four  food groups  at that time, the foods that your family  needs in their diet every day. Try to include those. It   s hard to get people  to plan their meals. It was kind of hard at that time to get five fruits and  vegetables into your diet.  Especially with a tight budget, too.  Yes, right, and meat. We   d do meal planning with them. Of course, they  had to consider their budget when we   d do that, and food preservation.  Usually if we had something that the county was doing on food  preservation, they were invited to come, and we used all of the fact  19  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  sheets and handouts that OSU Extension had. We had access to those,  and then we had some designed just for our program, too. It showed you  in pictures what to do as far as mixing or measuring in a cup. They were  pretty elementary.  It still sounds like you had to be very organized and plan ahead a lot.  Yes, and we   d do demonstrations for them. The NEAs, for part of their  training sometimes, we would assign somebody, or they   d volunteer that  they wanted to try a certain dish. We had opportunities to buy supplies  to do that with if they needed to. And then we   d have Homemakers    Day  and prepare dishes for them, and let them see how to prepare those  dishes.  Did they do much work with the elderly?  Not really, but really our target audience was for people with young  children. Young homemakers with young children. We worked with the  WIC program quite a bit, I think I mentioned. The elderly, if somebody  was in the home and had questions, we were glad to address those. I  mean, sometimes a mother or an aunt or somebody that was staying with  the family, perhaps.  The program guidelines weren   t focused on that age group, then?  No, that wasn   t their focus.  Do you have a favorite moment or two you want to share?  Oh, I guess it was just seeing achievement. They could graduate their  homemakers when they had reached a certain criteria, and they had  worked with them as long as they   d wanted to. Some of those were very  interesting, I thought, to see them get a little award of some kind, and  feel like they had achieved something. People don   t get enough praise  and compliments.   What was your  least favorite part of the job?  Reports. (Laughter) If you   d ask any of the ladies that I worked with,  they   d say reports, too. (Laughter) That was the least favorite. I did have  the opportunity in I think this was probably around    84. OSU set up a  trip for 4-H agents to go to Detroit, Michigan, and study the 4-H  program there, and I believe there were three of us ethnic home  economists who got to go. We had, pretty well, a bus load of agents, and  we took off in a snowstorm and went to Detroit in March. We got there  that night and got to our hotel, and the hotel was having problems  20  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  because some gangs, this was downtown Detroit, had gone in, and  started water running in the elevators of the hotel some way. They   d had  a big problem with that. So, we found right away that you needed to be  on your toes, and watching for what was going on around you.  We worked with the Extension office there, and it was downtown, the  one that we worked with. When we went to the Extension office, we had  to have a key, or you had to ring this bell to get into the office there.  They had a big complex, almost like a courthouse or something, a big  building where they did their programs. They had a gymnasium. I guess  it was an old school, probably, and they would have youth   the 4-H  youth would come down there, different groups of them, or those that  were interested, and they would work with the teens and preteens. They  had drill teams and basketball teams, and they did grooming with the  girls, and taught them how to fix hair, and take care of themselves, and  do nails and things just for something for them to do that was  constructive. I got to go with some of the NEAs there in Detroit in their  cars in the traffic, and we went on a home visit. We went to a soup  kitchen. I   ve never been in a soup kitchen before, but it was really a neat  trip.  Got to see the other side.  Got to see downtown. (Laughs)  Similar problems, just different environment, I guess.  Yes, people thrown closer together, a lot of people. They had people  movers, like a monorail thing, that would take you from one place to  another. We stayed pretty close together, though, because we didn   t  want to get too separated, but the home visit was a unique experience.  Good memories.  Yes, right. Good memories. I think everybody gained something. I think  OSU spent their money well to send us off to that.  When you were initiating the program itself, did you have to struggle to  get the NEAs to join you?  Didn   t seem to be too difficult. Well, like I say, they were people that  would be accepted by their audiences.  How would you make contact with them?  How did I make contact? I think I called and had them come down to the  21  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  office, but I went into the neighborhoods, too.  When you did that, did you knock on doors or     That   s been a long time ago. School probably. Three schools.  That would make sense.  And Community Action. Community Action was real helpful back then.  If someone had referred you to someone, then you had to start     Well, Mr. Liles, he helped with that, too, because he had been thinking  about the   but that was in    71, so that   s been a while.  That   s been a while, yes.  (Laughs) I can   t remember.  I just wondered if it was challenging.  Oh, yes, it was challenging, but we must have done a pretty good job,  because they were pretty lasting people that we got. They stayed with us  pretty long.  Was integration or segregation an issue at that point? It would have  been maybe a little earlier than that.  Well, it was kind of getting through that part. They came to our  meetings. I think they worked out pretty good, and as far as sending an  Indian lady, or a black lady to an Indian family, we really could have  done that, and we did that sometimes. But we did it on individual  situations, basically, how they felt about it, and NEAs themselves knew  what they were     What their community would stand for and what not.  One of my ladies that lived in the black community, she had lost two  children. One of them stepped off the bus, and he was being bussed to  school. Well, that was before I got in the program with her, but she still  remembered all these things. This was a little girl. She was being bussed  to school, and she stepped off and was hit and killed. Then she had a son  that was hit with a baseball, and he came home and spent the night. He  got hit in the head. It didn   t kill him, but he died the next day. Of course,  integration didn   t have anything to do with that, but I felt so sorry for  her. But she had a really good understanding of people and how to deal  22  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  with people, and what some of the problems were. I think she had six  children, and was a single mom. Her husband was in the service, but I  don   t think they were still married, actually. He sent part of his money  home to her, I know.  So, some of your training had to do with personal-type     Well, that comes up every now and then, yes. That   s where the  counseling part came in, too, with my visiting with them or counseling  with them when they had problems. When they got down a little bit,  we   d try to get them back up. Makes you appreciate what you have and  how things are going in your own life.  You see a little bit of everything it sounds like.  You were asking about any men who were NEAs. One time I went on a  home visit. I particularly remember this one, but the husband was there  that day, and he had this dog that he was over there pulling its ears and  everything else. I got the impression he was trying to impress us, and he  said something about he was going to make him a mean dog. I thought,     Oh, do I want to be here?    (Laughs) Of course, it was still a puppy, but  that was his intent, I   m sure. So, I know what they come across.  And going into a home by yourself is kind of unnerving, too.  I know. Well, they still have NEAs in Comanche County, I think. I  believe the program is still active over there. It is run a little differently,  I do know that. I   m sorry I can   t tell you how it goes now.  Well, the major change in the job for those twenty-something years  besides going from rural to city, were there any other?  Well, commodity foods kind of went out, and food stamps came in.  People don   t cook as much now as they did then, I don   t think.  More fast food places?  Yes, right. More fast food places. People don   t garden as much, I don   t  feel like. I know when we went to Detroit that time, they did have areas  there in the downtown area that were vacant lots, and they were trying to  turn those into gardens for low-income families, and interest the young  people in that. Well, they would do it through the 4-H. The children  would come into their group things, and they would have a garden for a  group of them, maybe, and let them take home the vegetables, and take  care of them, weed them and things. I don   t know how that turned out,  but that was in the making.  23  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  It   s kind of like a takeoff of victory gardens, I guess?  Yes, right.  Well, budgeting with the fast food now, and staying away from starches.  Right. Well, now there   s a lot more emphasis on salt and fat and that  kind of thing than there was even then.  And fresh stuff is supposed to be less expensive than canned, or maybe  the other way around.  Well, yes. I haven   t even stopped and compared that right now.  Supposed to be.  Like a bag of potatoes will go further than     Potato chips. (Laughs)  Yes, right, for comparable price.  The money, yes. Things like that, and then the nutritious snacks. That   s  always been a point, you know. What people snack on is an important  part of their diets, and most people kind of look at that as being free  gratis, (laughs) that you don   t have to count those as food.  So, when you sit down to a normal meal, do you sit and think,    This is  good. This is not good.    Are you a little bit more choosy?  Pretty well. Not as much as I should, but I am conscious of it, yes.  It   s a side effect of the job?  Right. Everybody is more conscious of nutrition now than they were  back then, even that few years ago. Whether they do it or not, that   s the  thing.  Do you remember what your beginning salary was, or ballpark, in  1970?  I don   t know for sure.  And it was part-time?  Yes, mine was half time. I don   t really know. It wasn   t that much, I  24  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  don   t think, but it was comfortable, what I needed at the time.  Enough to get you a reliable car to get you to and from?  Right. (Laughter) That was the case. I was thinking, and I said I knew  my first salary from teaching in New Mexico was like  4,000 a year.  Well, that   s about what a new car cost, too, like a new Pontiac at that  time. I think our car cost about the same thing that my salary was.  (Laughs) Now you could get more than a car, anyway.  Maybe.  Depends on what kind of car, doesn   t it?  Is there   s anything you want to add before we close?  Well, I enjoyed working with it, and I   ve learned more than anybody,  probably, during the course of those twenty-two years, working with  different people and understanding them, and then still further going to  different people and understanding them. I   ve had two or three calls  since I   ve retired, with people telling me,    How did you do so and so?     (Laughs) One of them, she said,    I know you had surgery. You had to be  going through the change.    She said,    How did you keep so even  tempered all the time?    And I said,    Well, I just knew that something  was going to happen, and I had to deal with people. I liked to treat other  people the way I want to be treated. If I deal with them good, they   re  going to be good to me, too.    So, that was a compliment. I   ve had two or  three say,    You never did so and so,    and,    You never did this and that,     but I probably did. They just didn   t notice it.  You built some long-lasting friendships, too, it seems like. Community  people and co-workers.  Right. Oh, yes. I   ve had no complaints with any of my county directors.  I   ve had three county directors. I had Lonnie Sellers, who is retired, and  I had Harold Liles and I had John Moten of Comanche County.  No women.  Not for county directors, not then. Well, this is a very agricultural part of  the state, too.  That makes sense. Well, I usually end up asking, when history is written  about you, what would you want it to say? How do you want to be  remembered?  25  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Finchum  McCauley  Well, I want to remembered as a kind, caring and productive person. I  hope I   ve been a good teacher, mother, wife and friend. I have no sisters,  but a bunch of friends, and a lot of them are home economists.  Well, I   d say they   d all say you   ve accomplished all of that.  Well, thank you. Thank you.  Thank you for your time today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
