 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, April 18, 2009, and we   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma interviewing Ben Bancroft. Now Ben, you   ve played on the  1959 National Championship baseball team and you and your  teammates are on campus today for your 50th year reunion celebrating  that championship season. I want to ask you a couple of questions about  the team and the championship year, but first could you give me a little  bit of background on where you grew up and your early life?  Well, I grew up in San Antonio, Texas. Joel Horlen and I played on a  national championship team, a pony league team, when we were 14 and  wound up playing for Oklahoma State. Coach Greene came down and  saw us play one summer in San Antonio and offered us scholarships  here, so we came up together to play at OSU. My father was a national  champion wrestler here in 1929, and I think he probably wrote a letter  on our behalf and my high school baseball coach was also an Oklahoma  State graduate, so I   m sure he wrote a letter for us, too. We were happy  to be able to come up to Stillwater to go to school and play ball.  What were your first impressions of Coach Greene?  Well, of course, the first time I saw him was when he came out to see  Joel and I play, and I was favorably impressed. We didn   t visit with him  very long. The first real encounter I had with Coach Greene is one I   ll  never forget. I got into an inter-squad game when I was a freshman up  here   and I   d never played the outfield before. I always played  shortstop and third base in high school. He put me in the right field in an  inter-squad game, and they hit three fly balls out to me and I never saw  any of them. I lost them in the sun and they all hit the ground and Coach  Greene called me names I   d never even heard of before. I know what  was going through his mind. He was thinking,    I got this kid for a  scholarship for four years.    I felt terrible about it but fortunately I  5  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  improved my performance over the years up here.  Now while you were here on campus, what was your major?  I was a general business major. I started out thinking I was gonna be an  engineer, and then I took calculus and I decided,    I don   t think I   m  gonna be an engineer.    So I wound up getting a general business degree.  And your freshman year was what year?  1956 is when I started, the fall of    56.  And coming from San Antonio, what were your impressions of  Stillwater?  Well, of course, I hadn   t been on that many college campuses. My dad  had gone around and visited the University of Texas and Rice and SMU.  I didn   t know what to expect, but even then Oklahoma State was a  beautiful campus. We had some outstanding facilities here then and, of  course, they   ve been improved quite a bit since   in the last 50 years     but the Library and the Student Union building, particularly, were just  beautiful facilities. I always felt at home here even though I didn   t know  very many people   didn   t know hardly anybody when I came up here.  There were a lot of folks that made me feel at home, and it was a good  place to go to school.  Tell me a little bit about the baseball facilities back then.  Well, of course, we played at the same place you   re playing now. They  were not nearly as nice. We had a chain link fence and, of course, the  grass wasn   t as nice, didn   t have any locker rooms for the teams, but it  was the same dimensions as far as I can tell and the seating, didn   t have  as much seating as is available now.  Did you have to work as part of your scholarship?  Yes, sure did.  And what was your on-campus job?  Well, I don   t remember all of them. It depends   I think the fella   s name  was McElroy, the man that was in charge of that, and he   d assign us  whatever he wanted us to do that day. I can remember one thing that  stands out. I used to change light bulbs in West Bennett Hall, and East  Bennett, too, I guess   it hasn   t changed much. I haven   t been inside, but  it   s the same size. It   s a big building   has a lot of light bulbs to change.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  I remember occasionally we   d go out and rake the baseball field and do  some other chores around the field, but whatever he wanted us to do that  day, we would do.  So tell me about playing for the team. What position did you start out  as? I know you changed a little bit throughout your career here.  I did. I started out of course being an infielder like I was in high school.  Freshmen were not eligible to play then and I couldn   t have played  anyway. I wasn   t good enough. My sophomore year I was a second-team  third baseman. A fella named Jerry Webster played ahead of me, and  Jerry Adair who was later a major leaguer played shortstop   and Adair  that year was a junior and Jerry Webster was a sophomore. So I thought,     They   re gonna be around next year, too.    I really didn   t think I was  gonna get much chance to play. But sometime before the school year  started I found that both of them had signed professional contracts, so I  decided maybe I   d better get ready to play some ball.  That sophomore year I think I   d only been in half a dozen games and I  remember very specifically I got up to bat 16 times and got three hits.  That   s a batting average of about .186, so I didn   t do very well that year.  But when I found out that I might play, I got real serious about playing  and I went on a program. I got my dad to hollow out the barrel of a bat  and put lead in it, liquid lead, which made a very heavy bat. For about  six months I swung that bat a thousand times every night. About 500  times just cracking my wrist and then the other 500 a full swing, and in  addition to that I lifted weights and ate four meals a day so I put on  about 20 pounds of weight. So I went from about 160 to about 180 or  185, and I went from being a second-team third baseman my sophomore  year to being second-team All-American my junior year when we won  the national championship.  Wow. That   s amazing, the work you put in.  Well, it paid off for me. It made me a whole lot better ball player.  Now that year   your junior year, the national championship year   you  led the team in home runs and RBIs while hitting .314?  Yes.  That is crazy. Do you think practicing with that lead bat really helped?  It helped a whole lot. I had a little problem with my bat speed my  freshman and sophomore years, and by the time the season started after  I   d swung that lead bat that many times every night for about six  7  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  months, the regular bat felt like a toothpick. So it just enabled me to  swing a lot faster and get my bat speed up considerably.  So tell me a little bit now about the pre-season workouts under  Gallagher-Iba Hall.  We went through that facility the way it is now, and I wouldn   t  recognize it because it was just an old clay dirt floor and we had a  batting cage and it was musty. We had to practice down there for a  month or two before the season started, and even then it was still too  cold to play up here in February and early March so we   d make a road  trip down to Texas and play at Sam Houston State or the University of  Houston or Rice. We   d usually play at least two teams down there and  then come back to start a schedule here when the weather got a little  better.  So how would you travel as a team to road games?  Back then we traveled by car. My friend Tim Green and I, we always  got assigned to ride with Coach Greene and his wife, and that was an  experience in itself. Coach Greene never said much. His wife did about  90 percent of the talking while we were on trips. We   d pull into some  place to have lunch and we   d go in and Tim and I   d order a hamburger  and about the time we were halfway through Coach Greene would be  out there honking on the horn. So that was   it was quite an experience  to travel with Coach and Marie Greene.  Wow. So all the players were assigned different people to travel with?  The older players took their own cars and they got paid mileage for it.  Things are a lot different nowadays.  Oh, yes. Now everything   s different. (Laughter) This whole facility is  different, and much for the better. It was a nice facility then, we thought,  but nothing compared to what you have here today.  Well that Cowboy team in 1959, they weren   t expected to do much.  Not hardly. I mean, we started with sophomores, never played a game     starting catcher, first baseman, second baseman and third baseman. Bob  Andrew played shortstop and he   d been in the Service   came back out  of the Service   and then Connie McIlvoy and Don Soergel rotated in  left field   I don   t think either one of them had ever played college  ball   and Tim Green played right field and I played center field, and  we   d just played a little bit the previous year. So we really had two  8  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  veterans, Joel Horlen and Roy Peterson, our two main pitchers, and of  course, Dick Soergel turned out to be a great pitcher, too. But starting  the year, those two veterans, Joel Horlen and Roy Peterson were the  only thing we had and nobody expected much out of us.  Did you and your teammates think that you would be a great team and  actually have the potential to compete for that national title?  You know, we never talked about it. I suppose at some point we had that  in mind, when it became obvious we could compete for the Big Eight  championship   it was the Big Eight then   and then I guess   I don   t  know. When we got up to Omaha, I imagine some of us were shaking  our heads and thinking,    What are we doing up here?    But we did think  we were pretty good, and it turned out that we did have a good team. I  think we exceeded expectations and one reason was we just got along so  well. It was good chemistry. We didn   t have any people with big egos  and we all liked each other   all got along well, nobody ever got their  feelings hurt or anything, and we just had a good chemistry as a team.  What were some of the other strengths of the club, outside of teamwork,  that led to such a magical run?  We had a lot of good competitors. Almost everybody on the team was a  good competitor. Two that stand out in my mind, Dick Soergel and  Bruce Andrew, a little second baseman, were both tremendous  competitors. I talked to Dick about that this morning. I mean, even  taking batting practice, Dick Soergel never threw you an easy pitch. I  mean, anytime you were competing against Dick, it was game time     and of course that made us better hitters, but he was such a competitor  that even at batting practice you had to work to hit Dick Soergel. And  Bruce, I remember when I was a freshman, Bruce Andrew was playing  second base and he was working on his double-play throw and trying to  get rid of the ball very quickly. About half of what he was throwing was  going into the dugout and several of us were kind of laughing about it,  and he wound up being a top-flight second baseman and played  professional baseball and wound up   his occupation was as a baseball  scout. He didn   t care what anybody else thought. He worked until he got  that double-play combination down right and made a tremendous second  baseman. But we had a lot of competitors on that team.  Was there a significant game or turning point that season that you  recall?  I remember one swing, and I had a good year, but going into the national  tournament and in that I wasn   t playing well. I only got two or three hits.  I didn   t get hardly any hits until the final game and felt real bad about it,  9  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  and we were playing the University of Arizona in the final game. In the  top of the seventh inning, we were down three to two and I led off the  inning and hit a home run over the left field fence which tied the game  and I think gave us some momentum   at least that   s the way I look at it.  We went on and scored two more runs and that was the end of the game.  I mean, we beat them five to three. It wasn   t the end of the game, but we  finished it on out. If it hadn   t been for that one swing, I would   ve had a  hard time feeling good about being a member of the team because I  didn   t feel like I   d done my part in the College World Series, but just  that one swing made up for it because   and I still thank God every once  in awhile for that one swing.  What a great memory. Looking back at that regular season before the  College World Series, what was the most memorable game for you that  you can recall?  Before the College World Series? I remember hitting a grand slam home  run against Oklahoma University over the 400-foot sign in right center  field, and that was a good experience for me.  Was Bedlam still a big thing back then? The rivalry between      Oh, yeah, sure. You bet. Everybody wanted to beat OU. (Laughter)  Still do. So the    59 team that qualified for the College World Series,  back then was the College World Series a big deal like it is today?  It was. The people of Omaha have always done a great job in promoting  the College World Series. I was talking to Roy Peterson, and he said he  thinks the first time they had a College World Series was somewhere  around 1950. It started in Omaha and they still have it because they just  do such an outstanding job. They promote it real well, and the whole  town turns out. They really get involved in the College World Series in  Omaha, Nebraska.  So take me through that time. What was it like going up there and just  give me a snapshot of that whole experience.  Well, it   s kind of hard to summarize the whole experience. It was a little  bit like going to the other road games that we went to, only on a bigger  scale   a lot bigger crowds and of course we knew what was at stake.  We weren   t just playing for a Big Eight game. We were playing for the  national championship. Got pretty serious about it, and we got beat early  in the series by  the  University of Arizona. We were fortunate enough  to win enough games to come back and play them in the finals, but it  was just a great experience. The people were good to us, treated us real  10  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  well. We had a lot of fun and at the same time took our business pretty  seriously.  What was the atmosphere like?  You mean around the team or the town or what?  Around the team, around the town   when you would enter the stadium,  what was it like? Did you have a lot of fans in attendance?  We didn   t have a whole lot of fans. Mostly it was family   some of our  family members were up there, but there wasn   t a big following of  Oklahoma State people. I think a lot of Oklahoma Staters were listening  on the radio. At that time you didn   t have a lot of fans traveling with the  team. We had some and we   d see them around town, but we didn   t have  a big following at the World Series.  Outside of the memory you shared hitting the home run and the College  World Series, do you have any other special memories?  Oh, they   re all pretty special. Like I say, it was 50 years ago. It   s kind of  hard to remember. If you asked me that ten years after I got out of  school I could probably think of some other high points, but just  generally it was a good year all year. We had a lot of fun playing  together. We had a lot of guys on the team that had a good sense of  humor. We were serious about what we were doing, but at the same time  we had a lot of fun. We had a good time and enjoyed being around each  other and playing ball with each other.  How special it is for you to have been a member of the only OSU  baseball team to date to win that NCAA championship?  It   s very special and you know we might not have been the best team  that Oklahoma State   s ever had   we probably weren   t. I remember  Coach Greene right after we won it said that his 1954 team was   it was     54 I think   was the better team, and they probably were. I know  something about the guys that played on that team, but it takes a lot of  good fortune along the way if you win a national championship. You not  only have to be good, but you   ve got to have some good breaks, and  there are probably two or three things if they hadn   t happened the way  they did we probably wouldn   t have won it.  I remember watching Oklahoma State one year after that when they  played the University of Georgia in the final game and I really felt like  Oklahoma State had the better team that year and should have won it.  That particular year the major television channel that was televising the  11  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  game, they required that the final game that they broadcast be the game.  Now, at that time Oklahoma State had not lost any games. You know  when we played it was a double elimination, and that year Oklahoma  State went to the finals and hadn   t lost any, The University of Georgia  had lost one game already. So anytime before that Georgia would have  had to beat Oklahoma State twice, but that particular year it was decided  that was gonna be the final game and if Georgia won that one game then  they won the College World Series and they did. I watched that game  and I felt like if it had been a two-game series like it should have been  that the OSU team would have won that year. I know Gary Ward had  some great teams here, had some great players and some great teams, a  number of which could have won the World Series, but as I say, you   ve  got to be pretty good and you   ve got to have some breaks along the way  and they just didn   t have enough breaks to win a second championship,  but I   m sure a lot of those teams were capable of doing it.  Absolutely. So after the    59 team wins the College World Series and you  come back to Stillwater, is there hype? Is there a ceremony? People  welcome you back to campus      I understand that we had a big parade sown Main Street in Stillwater  when we got back to town, but I don   t remember it. Fifty years does a lot  to your memory.  Over the years, have you stayed in touch with many of your teammates?  Quite a few, probably more Roy Peterson and Tim Green than the rest,  and we   ve been together a couple of times as a group. Once we had a ten  year reunion, I think, and then we had one ten years ago when they  inducted our team into the Hall of Honor. That   s the only two times  we   ve been able to get together as a group, but I do visit with them  occasionally on the phone. They   re a great bunch of guys and wish we  were 50 years younger.  And how special is this reunion for you here today?  Oh, it   s very special, very special. It   s always good to get together with  these guys, and I can   t tell you how much we appreciate what the school  did for us putting this together. It means a lot to all of us.  You mentioned some players that you are particularly close to. Are there  some players that you have enjoyed reminiscing with this weekend?  Oh, yeah, all of them, and I should have mentioned Joel Horlen,  somebody I stay in pretty close contact with, too, because Joel and I  grew up together. As I say, we started playing ball together when we  12  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  were 14 and played some summer ball together and then came up here to  school together. So I do stay in touch with Joel quite a bit.  Any thoughts of ever playing professionally or in the minor leagues?  Yeah, I thought about it, but didn   t really have the opportunity. So I  decided to go to law school, and it was probably a good thing because I  don   t think I had the potential. I didn   t have the ability to play major  league baseball and on reflection I probably would have spent a couple  of years in the minor leagues and then done something else. It worked  out all right for me.  You graduated from OSU in which year?  1960.  And then after you graduated, what did you go on to do?  I went to law school the following fall. I got out of law school and then  went into the Marine Corps for three years   served three years on active  duty, including service in Vietnam   then got out and started practicing  law in private practice, and I   ve been practicing law ever since.  Now baseball has changed quite a bit over the years. In your opinion,  how has college baseball changed?  I think a major change is the aluminum bats. It makes a big difference, I  understand   I   ve never hit a ball with an aluminum bat. They always  used wooden bats, and I guess the reason they changed is because of  economics. We used to break a lot of bats and bats were expensive.  Aluminum bats I don   t think break, but that   s a big change. Other than  that, the pitcher   s mound   s still 60    6       and the bases are still 90 feet  apart and I don   t see that much of a change.  So you   ve toured around today and you   ve seen the facilities here. What  do you think about the current facilities and the proposed new stadium?  I think it   s outstanding. I just finished Boone Pickens    book and when I  get back home I plan on writing him a letter and telling him how much I  appreciate what he   s done for this university, and I know he   s not the  only one either. There   s a lot of people that have contributed to what this  university is today and it   s a tremendous facility we can all be proud of.  How has the campus changed since you were a student?  So many more buildings. Bennett Hall is still here   that   s where I  13  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  started   but there   s so many more buildings, and of course the football  field has expanded. Gallagher-Iba Arena is much bigger. It   s just a much  bigger place. It   s a big campus now. When I was here, we had about  10,000 students and I imagine there   s 30,000 or 40,000 now. So that   s  the main thing is it   s just so much bigger. It   s always been a beautiful  campus   still is a beautiful campus.  Going back to your time on campus, where did you live as a student?  I lived four or five places. I started out in Bennett Hall. I spent a short  period of time   Mike Mulvihill reminded me that he and I shared an  apartment, or a small house, for a period of time. I lived in a fraternity  house for a year or so. And four of us, including Tim Green   s brother  and a couple of other guys, we rented a house for a year and stayed in a  house, the four of us. So I stayed in quite a few places on campus.  And do you have favorite hangouts, both on and off campus?  Well, of course, on campus I loved the library. I always enjoyed reading,  and we had a tremendous library then, had a beautiful building and  whatever you wanted, it was there. The student union building was state-of-  the-art. It was a great facility, and as far as off campus, I really can   t  remember anything. There were a couple of haunts   Deke   s and Louie   s  or something like that we   d go into occasionally, but I can   t remember a  whole lot of places off campus. Of course, the downtown area, I drove  down there a little bit today. A lot of it looks just like it did then to me.  Was it hard balancing school with team practice?  Well, not as hard as it is now. I can   t imagine these young men playing  60 or 70 games a year and making grades. Our total season the year we  won the national championship was 32 games, and even then, you  missed a lot of class time. So my hat   s off to them. If they can play 60 or  70 games and make their grades, they   re working hard at those studies,  but it would be awfully difficult for me to have done that.  What was graduation like for you?  To tell you the truth, I don   t remember much about it. (Laughter) I think  we had it in the football stadium, as I recall, and I can   t even remember  walking across the stage. You know, when you get to be my age you   ll  realize that you have a hard time sometimes remembering what you had  for breakfast   but I can   t remember a whole lot about the ceremony  except I was there and glad to be there.  Any special memories of Oklahoma State that stand out among all  14  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  Bancroft  Nykolaiszyn  others?  No. It was just a great little college town and still is as far as I can tell.  It   s not like going to SMU in Dallas or going to the University of Texas  at Austin. It   s just a smaller community and I think it   s just a great place  for a young man or a young lady to go to school. It   s a college town, and  I love the college atmosphere and I just wouldn   t take  anything  for the  experience here and I   d highly recommend it to any young boy or girl  that   s thinking about someplace to go to school.  We talked a little bit about the    59 team and your experiences here on  campus, is there anything else you   d like to mention today that we  haven   t really asked?  I can   t think of anything, Juliana, except to thank you and everybody  that   s been involved in putting this together. I know that I can speak for  everybody when I say we really appreciate it. It   s nice to be remembered  after 50 years, and it   s been a tremendous experience for all of us.  Well we appreciate you and congratulations again on winning the  national championship in    59, even if you didn   t have a crowd then you  have a good crowd out here cheering you on today.  Thank you, Juliana. Go Cowboys.  Thank you.  -------  -------
