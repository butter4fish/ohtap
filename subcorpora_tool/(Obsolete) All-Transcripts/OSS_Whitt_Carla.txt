 Milligan All right, so this is Sarah Milligan with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program. I am in Blanchard, Oklahoma today. It is February 23,  2016. I am talking with Carla Whitt for the Cowboys in Every County  Project which is part of the O-STATE Stories collection. So, let me just pull  up my notes again that I had gotten from you. You have a really interesting  story. Usually, I like to get a bit of background and know a bit more about  you. I think in this sense, I want to get a bit of background and find out  about your family and their intersection with OSU.  Whitt Yes.  Milligan Maybe let   s start with a little bit about, let   s start with you specifically, like  where you were born, where you grew up, and a little bit about your  parents. Sort of move backwards from there into your grandmother and the  story you hinted towards with her intersection of OSU. Does that sound  good?  Whitt That sounds fine.  Milligan Okay.  Whitt I was born in Oklahoma, in Oklahoma City in 1963. My mother was Betty  Lou Oyster Greiner.  Milligan What a great name.  Whitt Yes, yes. Both sets of my great grandparents on my mother   s side settled  around Stillwater during the Land Run, back in the 1880s, 1890s. My  grandmother was Ruth VanArsdell of Oyster later. She was born in 1892 in  Stillwater. She attended Oklahoma A M. Attended classes at the Old  Central Building in 1908 and 1909. She was just sixteen years old. At that  time, she had completed her schooling in the one room school house and  was making plans to be a school teacher herself. She attended classes at  5  Oklahoma A M. She was a teacher in a couple of different small school  districts that were located just a few miles west of Stillwater back in the  early 1900s. That was all before she married my grandfather. They were  married in 1918 in Stillwater. They had my mother and also two other girls  and a boy. They had a total of four children. All four of those children  attended Oklahoma State. They were all raised on a farm just west of  Stillwater. Some of the family is still on that farm, about five miles west of  Stillwater. As I said, my mother and her three siblings all attended  Oklahoma State. My mother gained her bachelor   s degree and her master   s  from OSU. She became a school teacher and taught for about twenty-four  years.  My aunt, my mother   s sister, she attended OSU. Her name is Alice Oyster  Bennett. She met her husband, my uncle Courtney Bennett, at OSU. I think  the story was they saw each other in one of the rooms of the library. They  saw each other and that was it for them, back in 1948. My uncle Courtney  had been to World War II and was then going to school and met Aunt Alice,  and they were married. They were married for about sixty-three years until  Uncle Courtney passed away in 2012.  My mother, as I said, received her bachelor   s and master   s from Oklahoma  State. Then, I was born in    63. There was me and a total of six grandchildren  including me that attended Oklahoma State during the    70s and    80s. I think,  at one time, I realized I was the youngest grandchild. For about seventeen  years, from about 1968 to 1985, my grandparents had at least one grandchild  enrolled at Oklahoma State, sometimes two. My grandfather was still alive  during all that time. My grandmother passed away in 1977, but my  grandfather was alive until    85. In fact, he passed away the same week that I  graduated from OSU. It was like he no longer had any grandchildren at  OSU, so it was time to go. I don   t know.  Anyway, since then, we have, that basically tells about three generations of  my family. Then we have a fourth generation, there is six kids in the fourth  generation that have attended and graduated from Oklahoma State. A couple  of my cousins met their spouses at OSU. A big part of my family history is  intertwined with Oklahoma State University. That   s for sure. One of my  earliest memories, like I said, is my grandparents lived in Stillwater when I  was growing up, so I became very familiar with Stillwater and Oklahoma  State even before I attended there. One of my earliest memories, I think I  was about five or six years old, we had had a family gathering at my aunt  and uncle   s farm out west of Stillwater, and my oldest cousin was already  attending Oklahoma State, and so we dropped her off on-campus after the  family gathering was over. I was five or six years old. That   s one of my  earliest memories of being on the OSU campus. It has been a big part of my  life, that   s for sure. A wonderful part of my life.  6  Milligan Sounds like it has been consistent. I wonder, that is what I think is so  interesting. I wonder, did you ever talk to your grandmother about what it  was like whenever she was there as a sixteen-year-old. I mean, that was  such an early time period for the university in general. That was pretty new,  I think what, the college hadn   t been around for that long at that point. I   m  just curious if she ever talked about it.  Whitt She talked a little bit. She said it was   it wasn   t really for her, that much of  a change from her earlier schooling. It was all in one building at that time.  There wasn   t a big campus like there is now. It was just, it was very, there  was a small group of students. I think there might have been a 100 or a little  more than that. Everybody knew everybody. It was kind of a nice time to be  there.  Milligan That   s interesting. I wonder, I wonder what the ratio, how many women  there were?  Whitt You know, I don   t remember her mentioning that.  Milligan It just seems, to me, I think, well, sixteen. She went through a one room  school house until the end and that is where she came out and decided that  she wanted to be a teacher. I just wonder if   and you may or may not know  that. That   s fine, but if many of her schoolmates went with her, or if that was  a natural progression since she was sort of in the area or if it was something  that was out of the ordinary?  Whitt I think it may have been out of the ordinary, because my grandmother, and  also my mother, well, my grandmother, kind of spread it to all her children.  Education was a very big part of their lives. Even for me, I remember  growing up, I don   t really remember a time when I didn   t know I was going  to OSU. I knew I was going to college for sure, that was a big thing in my  family. It wasn   t even, when I grew up in the    70s, it wasn   t a big thing in  every family. Really, Oklahoma State was the only college that really ever  talked about in my family. I just kind of knew that was where I was going. I  have heard my aunt Alice talk about that too, how she remembers growing  up that it was all about you are going to get your education, you are going  to, when you finish school, you are going to college. We are going to make  sure that happens. It was a big thing in my family, going way back there. I  think, even for my grandmother, it was probably was somewhat out of the  ordinary. I didn   t know her parents but it maybe that they were really big,  really thought education was important too. Of course, her being there close  to Stillwater. I do remember she talked about riding a horse to get to go to  class. That seems kind of foreign to us now.  Milligan It also seems foreign to think there was a horse, not a stall area, but that  that would be common to see that on campus.  7  Whitt Yes, yes.  Milligan People doing the commute. Well, that is part of it is I am wondering if your  aunt Alice said it was sort of expected for them to go. I   m curious a little bit  more about that if the gender as well, that still, that would have been when  your mother   s generation and your aunt   s generation, that would have been  the    40s, probably the    30s to the    50s in that sort of time     Whitt Right, my mother and her sister sort of grew up in the Depression era. Of  course money was tight. They talked about how, education was very  important. They were going to make a way. My mother talked about when  she attended Oklahoma State. When, for some of the time, she lived with an  aunt down there in Stillwater. I think it was a deal where they didn   t really  pay, (I think her name was Aunt Sally) pay Aunt Sally, but she helped with  the house cleaning and that sort of thing. That gave my mother a place to  live part of the time. I do know that my mother part of the time, lived in  Willard Hall. It was a dorm at that time. I also lived in Willard Hall. It was  still a dorm in the early    80s when I attended Oklahoma State. My mother  and I both lived in Willard Hall for a time.  Milligan That   s interesting. I imagine that the rules for Willard Hall were quite  different from when your mom was there and when you were there?  Whitt I would imagine   I remember she talked about how there was a curfew. I   m  not sure what time it was. They did have some sort of curfew. You had to be  in your rooms, and by the time I was there, there was really no curfew. You  were pretty much free to come and go as you pleased.  Milligan What did your mom major in when she was there?  Whitt My mother majored in elementary education.  Milligan Do you remember what your aunt or any other     Whitt Aunt Alice, I believe her major was language arts education, and she later  taught high school English. My major for my bachelor   s degree was also  language arts education, but then I came back to OSU. I did teach school for  a while. Then, I came back to OSU and got a master   s in business.  Completed that in 1989. I was actually at OSU for most of the    80s with a  little break in the middle. I loved the place so much. I really hated to leave  when it was time to leave. You can   t always stay there forever. Ever since     89, I have been in my current occupation which is, I work as an agricultural  statistician for the US Department of Agriculture  USDA . I do some  instruction with that job too. Mostly I teach adults on some of the  agricultural surveys we do.  8  Milligan That   s interesting. So you remember as sort of a young child, being on  campus. That   s obviously stuck with you. Is there a particular thing about  campus that has stuck with you, a feeling or a visual memory or anything  like that? I   m just always curious what sparks people   s     Whitt Right, right. Well, for me, it was always the place that was home, seemed  like I belonged there. I talked about my early childhood experience of being  there when we dropped off my cousin or something. Then, later I was in 4-  H, and so I attended 4-H Roundup that was held at OSU for several years. I  became very familiar with the campus being there for 4-H events. I  remember when I came there as a student, as a freshman, some of my  friends, they were so amazed that I knew where everything was. I was  already pretty familiar with the campus. Things that always stand out to me,  I always liked the Theta Pond area, that was just always so beautiful. As a  young child, I remember being just in awe of those tall dormitories. I guess,  those are about to disappear if they haven   t already. I just remember that just  being so   I had, I had been to Oklahoma City a little bit. I lived in the  country in Eastern Oklahoma (that   s where I grew up). We didn   t have any  tall buildings around. I just remember being in awe of those big tall  buildings and everything.  Milligan If you were born in Oklahoma City, where did you end up growing up?  Whitt I actually ended up growing up in a little town called Depew, Oklahoma.  That is D-E-P-E-W. Depew, or Depew, some people pronounce it  differently. That   s where my parents had a farm. I was born in Oklahoma  City because my mother was forty when I was born, and she needed to go to  a specialist in Oklahoma City.  Milligan So circumstance, but that wasn   t your home?  Whitt Right, right. That was just where I was born. I grew up in Depew, at the  farm. My mother had taught school for eight years before my father and she  married. Then, they married and had me. That   s where I grew up. We didn   t  live anywhere else. My mother lived there until she passed away in 1991.  She lived there until then.  Milligan Yeah, so you grew up in a rural area. You were in 4-H.  Whitt Yes.  Milligan Which I think is pretty, a pretty common way for folks to interact with OSU.  What did you do when you were in 4-H? What were some of your points of  interest?  9  Whitt I gave a lot of speeches. Public speaking, sewing, and cooking, and kind of  the traditional stuff. I lived on a farm where we had cattle. I never really  raised animals for 4-H though. That just didn   t really interest me that much,  I guess. Those were the main things I did. I remember, too, when I come for  OSU Roundup, we would usually have some sort of ceremony there (and of  course the old football field was called Lewis Field I believe). Of course, the  football stadium we have now is so much nicer. Really nice. I remember  back then, Lewis Field seem bigger than anything I had ever seen in my life.  It was just so big. I remember being awestruck by that.  Milligan That makes sense. Maybe tell me a little bit about school and things like that  in Depew. Was it, for example, was it a small high school? Or what was sort  of the class size?  Whitt It was a small high school. My graduating class had forty-six students.  Really, being a small rural school, there wasn   t a big emphasis on furthering  your education there either. As I said, that came from my family. I believe,  I   m in contact with some of the people I went to school with, out of forty-six,  we probably had ten or so that went on to college. That wasn   t a big  thing that was really encouraged. We didn   t have a lot of extras. Everybody  knew everybody.  Milligan Did you ever get any push back, not from your family, I understand they  were supportive, but maybe from other people in the community about your  plans to go to college?  Whitt No, not really. Of course, everybody in the community knew my parents  too. They knew my mother was a school teacher. I think, they just kind of  thought that was natural.  Milligan Well, I wonder if by the time you got to Oklahoma State University, if you  felt like you were prepared for classes?  Whitt Did I feel like I was prepared for classes? Probably not as well as I could  have been. I had good grades at my high school. I did find some of the  classes at OSU to be a little bit difficult, more difficult that what I was used  to in high school. I remember at times, feeling like I could have been a little  more prepared, but I was pretty determined. I was going to work one way or  another.  Milligan What made choose major you chose, language arts education?  Whitt Oh, I mentioned my aunt Alice. She was a high school English teacher about  this time. She was a person that I greatly admired and looked up to. I  mentioned that my mother was a teacher. That   s a big occupation in my  family too. I am kind of the one who has gone a different way, really, but  10  that   s okay. We have, in my family, we have over I mentioned my  grandmother also taught school for a while. Over about four generations  now, we probably have about fifteen teachers or so in the family. Even, it   s  kind of interesting, even my mother   s older sister, she and my mother both  went to work in Washington DC during World War II. Aunt Alene met her  husband out there and stayed out there, and raised her children in Virginia,  close to Washington DC. They didn   t really have quite the same upbringing  that the rest of my cousins did here in Oklahoma, (me and my cousins here  in Oklahoma), but yet she has a grandson who is a teacher. Like I say, he  never spent time around the rest of our family, yet he drifted that way too  which is good. Really good. It   s just   it kind of seems to be   that was  something that was really ingrained in my family too. I think that is why I  chose to pursue it.  Milligan When you got into the coursework for that, did you feel like it was good fit?  Whitt I did. I did. It was courses that interested me.  Milligan Good. You mentioned that you lived in Willard, so did you live there the  whole time you were there?  Whitt I lived there for two years and then I moved off-campus after that.  Milligan Was that an easy transition, from on-campus to off-campus?  Whitt It was fairly easy. I liked living at Willard. I liked the dorm life experience. I  lived there the first two years, so I think it was really good for that time. You  didn   t have to worry about fixing your meals or anything about that. When I  moved off-campus, I think it was something I was ready to pursue. I had a  good friend that I shared an apartment with. We were both pretty frugal, I  guess, with our money. We realized that to share a small apartment was  really cheaper than to live in the dorm at that time. It seemed like the right  thing. They were both good experiences.  Milligan What were some of the things that were going on on-campus while you were  there? Were there things that you participated in socially or sports or clubs  or anything like that?  Whitt The big, the main organization I was involved in was called Chi Alpha. It   s  a Christian Student Organization. I believe they still have a Chi Alpha house  on Duck Street right across from the YMCA. I   m not really sure. I haven   t  been there lately to see if it   s still being used for that purpose or not. At this  time, in the    80s, we had weekly meetings there. It was just kind of a place  to fellowship there with other students. We would have a weekly meeting  where we would sing songs and usually have a devotional or something like  that. Then, the house was a place to hang out at other times, too. We could  11  go there and watch TV and play games. Just kind of a nice place to go hang  out. We also had what was called the Chi Alpha Choir.  A group of us that would travel around to churches all over Oklahoma at  different times. We would sing some songs that we had learned and usually  give a devotional, or something like that. It was a way to raise money for  Chi Alpha, and kind of publicize Chi Alpha to prospective OSU students.  That was the big thing I was involved in. I was also, for a time, involved in a  group called Kappa Phi, which I   m not even sure if it still exists. (I know  Chi Alpha still exists.) Kappa Phi, we met in the Methodist Student Union, it  was an all-women   s group. It was like a Christian service organization. We  had a couple of service projects we would do each year. I remember one  year going to the Salvation Army building (there in Stillwater) helping just  do some maintenance and cleanup and organize things there and that sort of  thing. Those were the two main organizations that I was involved in.  Milligan How did you find out about them? How did you get involved with them?  Whitt I think both of them, I had met somebody in the dorm that was involved.  That   s how I came to be involved. One of the big things that happened on-campus  while I was there. It was 1988, that   s when I was there getting my  master   s degree. The presidential election was going on like it is this year,  and Dan Quayle came to the OSU campus. I remember that specifically. I  even (Laughs) something he said in his speech, because it was so  outrageous. Nineteen eighty-eight was of course, when we had a really good  football team. That   s when Barry Sanders won the Heisman. I remember  that too. That was of course, one of the great moments in OSU   s history.  Milligan Were you at the game?  Whitt I was at the games that year. I remember Dan Quayle during his speech, of  course, I realize he probably didn   t write it, somebody wrote it for him. One  of the points he made, well, let me back up. The football team was really  good that year. We were really good on offense, but the defense was not so  good. Most of the games we just managed to score more points than the  other team. Anyway, in Dan Quayle   s speech, he talked about how he and  George Bush, (of course, the team that was running for president), they were  taking after our football team and promoting a strong defense. (Laughs)  Obviously somebody hadn   t done that much research on the football team,  but that   s okay.  Milligan Was there a lot of talk about that afterwards? Did a lot of people pick up on  that?  Whitt Yeah, yeah. Everybody was laughing about that. Well, he has not been to  one of our games, but obviously not. That   s okay.  12  Milligan Oh, you try and do sports analogies, right?  Whitt Of course, it turned out to be   it   s one of my funny memories from OSU, so  that   s good. (Laughs)  Milligan Was he a guest speaker, or a commencement speaker?  Whitt He was a guest speaker. It was a campaign event. I think they had him set up  in front of the library. I remember we were all out on that lawn there in front  of the library. It was a campaign stop. It was just a couple weeks before the  election, I think.  Milligan How interesting. I can visualize that too in front of the library.  Whitt Yeah. I remember, there was big crowd gathered there. In fact, I remember,  I   m not, I know they have remodeled things, (I   m not sure how it looks these  days), but you know how you have the area in front of the library and you  have the Student Union just over here a little ways to the south, and you had,  or you used to have the kind of porch out in front of the Student Union, I  don   t know if it   s still there. I think, a bunch of us, I was among a bunch of  people gathered there on the porch, and we could see if from there. There  was   the library lawn was just full of people.  Milligan That   s interesting.  Whitt That was a big event I remember.  Milligan That would do it. Was there, I wonder if there were a lot of, that, let me  rephrase this really quickly. The fact that they made OSU campus a stop on  their campaign event, I wonder if the campus seemed like there was a lot of  political activity with the students? Was there, do you remember there being  a sense, because it seems kind of weird to me that they would go all the way  to Stillwater.  Whitt Yeah.  Milligan I wonder if there was sort of a reason for that.  Whitt You know, there may have been. I remember hearing about Campus  Democrats and Campus Republicans. I wasn   t a part of those organizations.  I wasn   t a part of those organizations, but I do remember hearing about that.  They must have been pretty involved. I guess they may have thought that  was a good place to stop in Oklahoma. I don   t know.  13  Milligan I will have to look into that and see if they went to OU  University of  Oklahoma  too, that   s interesting.  Whitt Yeah, yeah. I   m not sure where else he went.  Milligan You went to the sporting events, and you participated in a couple of different  organizations. Was there   what about academics? Do you remember some  of your classes or any classes that you particularly liked, or that stand out,  because they were problematic or professors or anything like that? Anything  stick in your mind?  Whitt Coming from a small high school, I remember it was intimidating at first to  go to some of the small classes at first that I had as a freshman. I remember  having   it was like a freshman orientation class in the Seretean Center, and  it was in that auditorium that holds about 500 people or so. There was 500  people in my whole town where I grew up, well maybe 600. You know, that  was a little intimidating. There were a couple other classes I had like that  that were pretty big and I remember that being a little intimidating, but we  had smaller classes too. I had biology my first year, I remember. I remember  we went to a lecture that was a big class like that and then we had a lab that  was just a lab of just a small group of fifteen or twenty students.  That was, certainly much more, gave me certainly much more personal time  with the instructor and that sort of thing. Really, one of my memories, too,  was I was working on my master   s, I took some math courses that I needed a  little bit of help with at times, and I remember being able to go to the  professors during their office hours and they were always really helpful. At  that time, I think they were over 20,000 students. (I   m not sure exactly how  many.) Most of the professors were willing to take time like that with you.  You know, it didn   t seem that intimidating all the time, really. Even though  it was big, it seemed like a lot of the professors made it personal. That was  good. As far as something that really stands out. I don   t really     Milligan If the answer is no, that   s fine too.  Whitt I don   t remember anything in particular.  Milligan I think you actually answered what I was thinking about. Are there, what are  the challenges of coming from a small community and ending up in a  university that does have a lot more students in it, and if that was   if it  ended up being sort of a classroom situation for you that was comfortable.  Whitt I think for me it was probably more comfortable than it is for some. For me,  I was already familiar with the campus, so I wasn   t having to figure out  where each building was located. It can be intimidating for a new student  that hasn   t ever been there and is having to learn everything all at once.  14  Milligan I wonder, too, about finances. Were there a lot of scholarships available?  Was it something that you could work in or maybe did work and help pay for  your college or was it something that. I   m just kind of curious about the  situation. That is sort of the big focus of what we talk about with students  now. I   m curious on how it has been in the past decades as people have  gone to school.  Whitt I was very fortunate. I   m the only child that my parents had. They married  later in life and they had me. As I mentioned, education was very important  (especially to my mother) and so, and to my father too, he didn   t go to  college, but it was still important to him. He saw   he realized that it was  important. He and my mother had started to save for my education early in  my life. I was very fortunate. I did work some of the time. I did not have to  work all of the time. A couple of memories I do have of working   I actually  worked at the library for a time. In the area where they check in the  magazines and I don   t even know. With everything being online now, they  probably don   t even do that anymore. We would get magazines and  publications, we had to check them in and get them filed in the proper places  and all that. I remember, that was when I understood how you could read a  foreign language, but not really understand what you were reading, because  we had some foreign publications that came. I kind of knew what they were,  because I would see them over and over, and would recognize the name  from having seen it before, but I had no idea what it said.  I worked there for a time, for about one semester. I also worked at the  architecture building as a sort of a secretary for the professors (I would type  letters for them and whatever they needed me to do). That was a really good  job. I had that job for about one year. That was while I was working on my  master   s degree. Really, most of the time, my parents were able to support  me. I did not have to work all the time. I worked during the summers. That  was usually, I did work at the Student Union one summer. I was attending  classes one summer and I worked at the food court in the Student Union. I  was fortunate, I didn   t have to work the whole time I was in school. Of  course, it was much cheaper back then, or more affordable back then. I  think, I you know, I wouldn   t guarantee that this was exactly correct. When  I started as a freshman, in 1981, the I want to say the lower level classes  were like sixteen dollars per credit hour. I know that sound very unreal now,  the way it is now, but by the time I was working In my master   s, I think the  graduate courses were about fifty dollars a credit hour. That was the late     80s.  Milligan Yes.  Whitt Of course, I was in state. It seemed like back then, it was more affordable  for most students than it may be now. I   m not sure exactly what it costs  15  now, but I have heard it is up in several hundred dollars per credit hour. That  is just hard to imagine.  Milligan I wonder if you had peers that sort of worked to help put themselves through  school. Was it possible to do that? I   m really curious.  Whitt It was. I had some friends there in Willard. I had a couple of friends that  worked in the cafeteria there in Willard. They were supporting themselves  while going to school. I think jobs, if you needed a job, they were pretty  readily available.  Milligan Okay, interesting. When you graduated with your undergraduate, what  happened? What did you do?  Whitt I went to Prague, Oklahoma, and taught high school. I was there for one  year. That was a good experience in a lot of ways. For me, though, I just  realized teaching high school might not be what I want to do for the rest of  my life. I still had some friends at OSU. That was when I decided to go back  and get my master   s. That was a great decision. I had some great time with  friends that I made during that time. That was and is one of the great parts of  the college experience, I think. You make friends that stay with you for life.  Milligan When you went back to get your master   s, you went for business, correct?  Whitt I actually studied business education. I was one of the   I   m not sure what  they have now. At that time, they were phasing out the business education  program at OSU. I   m not sure if they ever phased it back in. At that time, I  was one of the last people to graduate in business education.  Milligan How did you decide that that would be your master   s?  Whitt At that time, I wanted to expand my horizons a little bit. I felt like I might  want to teach in some capacity. I wanted to have other options available to  me, too, so I decided to go with business education.  Milligan Was there a difference to when you were an undergraduate to a graduate to  the way you interacted on-campus or your experience in general?  Whitt I think by the time I was a graduate student I   of course, I was more  mature. I think I realize the importance of what I was doing. I knew it was  important as an undergrad, but I think I was like a lot of kids as an  undergrad. I went through right out of high school. I think maybe I didn   t  have realized how much my experiences would impact my life later. As a  graduate student, I think I felt like school was more important than I did  before. It was important to dig in and get everything I could out of it.  16  Milligan Yeah, do you feel like your classes were easy to come back into switching  majors from language arts to business education? I guess they are both in  the education, but they still have different programs.  Whitt Right. It was a little bit different. It seemed like a natural fit for me. I had, in  my bachelor   s, I had majored in language arts, but I had also gotten a minor  in math, and so a lot of your business classes are somewhat math related. It  seemed pretty natural for me. Of course, by the late    80s, computers were  getting to be more in vogue, but you know, still kind of a new thing for a lot  of people. There were a lot of computer related classes. I really liked those  classes.  Milligan Interesting. Was there a big transition on-campus, then, to make computer  equipment available to students?  Whitt I   m sure there was. I don   t really remember being that much aware of it at  the time, I guess.  Milligan I wonder if you had computer assignments for classes and stuff like that.  Were those in class labs you had, or were there computers you could use  like in the library or other places like that?  Whitt It seems like they were just starting to have computer labs you could go to  and complete some of your work, you know. This was the late    80s. Not  everybody, everybody didn   t have their own computer yet. We were, that  was just a few years away, I guess. I do remember there being a computer  lab you could go to and do some of your work.  Milligan Well, so what did you do after you left for the second time?  Whitt I   you know, I mentioned that my master   s was in business education. I did  look at a couple of teaching possibilities, but I also looked at some other  avenues. I had a friend who was   she had gone to take a test you had to take  at that time to get a government job. She told me about that, she told me  mainly about getting the test, and trying to get on at Tinker Air Force Base   Oklahoma City, Oklahoma . I pursued that. I went and took the test. It was  the US Department of Agriculture that called me first, and they had a  position in Oklahoma City with the agriculture statistics division. I hired on  with them and I   m still with that agency. At that time, I started as a   what   s  called a support staff person, or an agricultural statis   agricultural statistical  assistant was my official title (that   s a mouthful). I worked in that capacity  for two years. I had taken statistics as part of my master   s.  In order to meet their requirements, the agency   s requirements, to be a  statistician, I had to have one more statistics class, so I just went up to UCO   University of Central Oklahoma  in Edmond and took it. Then, I was able  17  to qualify to be an agricultural statistician. That   s still my current title,  although it   s a little bit misleading. I don   t do much with actual statistics.  These days, we have computers that do a lot of the actual statistical formulas  and stuff like that. Mainly, what I do in my current position, we have field  enumerators all over Oklahoma and in every state in the country. They go  out and interview farmers on the various agricultural surveys we do.  Basically, they collect the data and then it   s compiled, and anytime you read  in the paper about how the crops are doing this year (the big thing in  Oklahoma is wheat, obviously, and cattle). That   s what we do. We put out  these reports. My main job is being the coordinator of the enumerators to  make sure they have what they need to do all the surveys we do and  providing the training for them, as I   ve mentioned. I do some adult training,  answering a lot of phone calls from them. Making sure they   answering  their questions and that sort of thing. That   s mainly what I do today.  Milligan It   s interesting that you still have the statistician title, but it sounds like you  are more, sort of a     Whitt Kind of a human resources type person.  Milligan Yeah, or a, well, an administrator for a group of surveys, right? You sort of  manage the ducklings so to speak, and send people back out.  Whitt Sometimes it sort of feels that way. It   s a really good job, though. I   m really  glad that is where I landed.  Milligan Yeah, talk to me a little bit about that. When you decided to go take that test,  did you have expectations?  Whitt I did. Like I say, a friend of mine had recommended it to me. She   d  mentioned getting on at Tinker Air Force Base and how they had an upward  mobility program, where you could move up through the grade levels of  being a federal employee, so that was what I was thinking I would do. Like I  say, I heard from the Department of Agriculture first, which has been a  really good fit for me too. While I did not major in agriculture per se, I did  grow up on a farm with cattle. I did have somewhat of an ag background.  I   ve learned much more about agriculture since working for the US  Department of Agriculture, so that   s been good.  Milligan Well, it   s interesting since OSU has such a huge agricultural program. I  mean, it   s a big component that that is the line of work you ended up in. You  were one of the sort of, not minority, but from a rural background coming to  OSU, that sort of is a minority     Whitt Right.  18  Milligan    to not going into the agricultural school, but yet still ended up in a USDA  position. I   m curious too, you, not to just jump around, but when you were in  Prague, and you were teaching, was there something in particular that  made it a good fit for you. That is a pretty big decision, to think I   m going to  be a teacher, and then after your first year, be like, yeah, I   m going to go  back and do something else.  Whitt I don   t know. I think I just on some level, while teaching was something that  I thought I wanted to do, I think I was doing it more to please my family  than more because it was really what I wanted. I think that was a lot of it.  After I saw what all was involved and everything, I think I just realized,  maybe this is not what I want to do.  Milligan It sounds like it was right decision.  Whitt Yes, yes.  Milligan So, you worked for the USDA. Have you worked for   you worked for their  Oklahoma City branch now?  Whitt I do. I started in Oklahoma City in 1989. My agency has   we have an office  in every state. We have a headquarters office in Washington DC. They have  realigned, or restructured the agency, in the last few years. It   s a little  different than it used to be. I worked here in Oklahoma City until the year  2000. During that time, I married my husband too. He was active duty Air  Force, stationed at Tinker, actually. He had to move to Whiteman Air Force  Base in Missouri. My agency also allowed me to move to my office in  Missouri, which was in Columbia, Missouri, the middle of Missouri. I  worked there for eight years. We lived there. Then, in 2008, he had retired  from the Air Force at that time. He still had contracts back here at Tinker for  doing contract work. He is an electrician. That   s a skill he picked up in the  Air Force. We both really wanted to get back here to. We have family here  and everything. The agency agreed to let me come back to our office here in  Oklahoma, so that has been a really good opportunity for us.  Milligan You landed in Blanchard?  Whitt Yeah, we landed in Blanchard at that time in    08.  Milligan I   m curious about the community here in Blanchard, actually. It   s a pretty  small community. I don   t know much about it. Is it   do a lot of people that  live here, for example, work in Oklahoma City. Is there an industry here that  sort of drives people or keeps people here? Any ideas?  Whitt I think it is mostly what they call a bedroom community. A lot of people  work in Oklahoma City or Norman. We are just ten miles from Norman.  19  There is some industry here and they are trying to bring more in. Not that  much currently. It   s mostly a small town where people like to live because  it   s a nice community. They do have a good school system and that sort of  thing, but as far as industry, they don   t have that much.  Milligan There is still a little downtown area. There is still stores, a couple of store  fronts.  Whitt Yes, there is some downtown businesses.  Milligan A very nice library where we sit.  Whitt Yes, yes. A nice library, we also have a nice park down at the south end of  town. They have, in the summer time, they have concerts there on Friday  nights. They have a Bluegrass festival in August. They have a lot of good  little community events like that. They have, they have, Halloween time,  they have a big event on Main Street for the kids. They are getting ready to  have a Saint Patrick   s Day Parade, and they have a Veteran   s Day Parade.  There is a lot of community involvement. It   s a nice place to live.  Milligan Good. Well, do you still get back to the OSU campus at all?  Whitt I do occasionally. Not as much as I would like to. I   it   s been a couple of  years since I have been able to go to a football game. I am part of what is,  what might be considered a unique group. I am part of the OSU Alumni  group that meets in Norman.  Milligan Oh, right.  Whitt We have Cleveland and McClain County Alumni Association. Interurban  restaurant there in Norman is where we meet. That is where we go to watch  the football games. Actually, they seem pretty happy to have us. Which is  nice. It   s kind of funny. I don   t get back to Stillwater as much as I like to. I  am sure that I would if I was closer. Since I am just ten miles from Norman,  I go there to shop some. Sometimes I will be wearing an OSU t-shirt. A few  people might look at me funny, but most people it doesn   t faze them too  much. Then, sometimes, I   ll see other people over there wearing OSU t-shirts.  (Laughs) It   s kind of funny.  Milligan Hold strong while you are in Sooner territory.  Whitt Yeah, but I   m glad to be part of the OSU Alumni group that meets in  Norman.  Milligan It   s a good group. I   ve met some of them.  20  Whitt It is a really good group. Really good group.  Milligan Strong group.  Whitt I tell people that, and they just look at me like     Milligan Pretty brave.  Whitt Yeah.  Milligan Brave, yeah.  Whitt I have been able to get back some to the campus, and it   s amazing how  much it   s changed, all the new buildings and that beautiful new football  stadium. I mean, I   m glad for all the remodeling they   ve been doing and  everything. It   s a little different than I remember it, but change can be good,  certainly. It   s really, really good that the students today have a beautiful  campus to attend class. It   s good.  Milligan That   s true. It does just keep changing. That   s not going to change in  anybody   s lifetime, I don   t think.  Whitt Yes. In fact, for a time, when I moved off-campus, I lived   it was on  Northwest Street, which I think has been torn down. The apartments that I  lived in have been torn down now. I think they are, that or they are part of  the OSU campus now. It was off-campus; it was about three or four blocks  north of the baseball field. That is all part of OSU now. That seems kind of  strange, but that   s okay.  Milligan I   m sure that is different. Have you been inside the Old Central building  since they renovated it?  Whitt I have not. I would like to do that.  Milligan It   s interesting. I was just thinking with your family connection they have  sort of brought it back to where it   closely to what it would have been like  in its early years     Whitt I will have to go visit it.  Milligan Yeah, they have some little like reading books that are more of the original,  even the classroom space in there, it   s really interesting, because you can  visualize what it would been like to be a student, when Old Central was your  building.  Whitt How neat. I will have to check that out.  21  Milligan It can be interesting. We will have to go back and look at our archives and  see if I can find your grandmother Ruth     Whitt Ruth VanArsdell was her maiden name.  Milligan I   m glad you wrote it out to me whenever we originally made contact. I will  have to go back and see if we can find anything about her in some of the  early material we might have at the university. It shouldn   t be too hard to  distinguish when there would have been a 100 or so students. I think that is  accurate. There was a very small population. Do you still have a lot of  family that lives around the Payne County area then?  Whitt I do have my cousin, and his family, live on the part of the farm that was  first homesteaded in the Land Run. It was about five miles west Stillwater.  Yeah, their name   s Oyster. In fact, my cousin has twin sons, that are, they  are grown now. They are there also. I think they are the fifth generation to  farm the land there. I think they are the main relatives that lived there.  Another one of my childhood and early adulthood memories, is I had a  great-aunt, her name was Carrie VanArsdell. She and Uncle Jake, they had a  farm at Morrison, Oklahoma just a little ways from Stillwater. Then, he  passed away in the    70s and she moved to Stillwater. I remember going to  visit her quite often. She was even still there when I was a student at OSU. I  would visit her some. I mentioned my grandfather was still alive when I was  getting my bachelor   s. That was neat to have them there when I was going  to OSU. I could visit when I was able to. That was one of the neat parts of  being there too.  Milligan Yeah, have family. I wonder, you said both sets of grandparent families were  in the Land Run in the land around sort of what is now the Payne County  Area, right around Stillwater. Do you know anything about where they came  from or how they ended up making that run?  Whitt I know a little bit. My grandmother   s family had been in Kansas. In fact, her  name was Ruth Augusta Oyster, or VanArsdell. Augusta was the town in  Kansas where they lived before come to Oklahoma during the Land Run.  Actually, part of the land they settled is now under the waters of Lake  Blackwell. My mother talked about how obviously the family did not have  much money during the Depression. Then, when they went to put in Lake  Blackwell, they bought up the land that had belonged to my grandmother   s  family. My mother   s family was able to get some of that money. I think that  helped with their education some too. Yes, my grandmother   s family came  from Kansas. My grandfather   s family, the Oysters, they came from Iowa. I  don   t know the exact town. I   ve heard it, but I don   t remember it right off  hand. I know it was Iowa. They had formerly lived in Iowa before coming to  Oklahoma.  22  Milligan Did they ever talk much about that sort of general experience I guess they  would have     Whitt Well, my grandmother was born in Stillwater.  Milligan I was going to say     Whitt My grandfather was born in Iowa, I believe. He was about three years old  when they came. He talked about it a little bit, about being in the covered  wagon when they came and how there were lots of covered wagons at the  time of the Land Run. I don   t really remember him talking about it that  much. He was     Milligan He was three.  Whitt He was three, so his memories weren   t all that clear, but yeah. It was  fascinating to hear about it.  Milligan I wasn   t sure when you grandmother was born since her middle name was  Augusta. Sounded like she was named after the city in Kansas.  Whitt Yeah.  Milligan I wasn   t sure if she was born in Kansas because of that, or     Whitt Another memory I have of my grandfather, I remember going to visit him  growing up. He would usually have one of OSU   either baseball or  basketball on the radio. You know, back then, they didn   t have every game  on TV like they do now. He would always have it on the radio. He got me to  listening to the games on the radio. My husband is not really a sports fan at  all. I kind of drive him crazy sometimes. If OSU is on the radio, it   s on.  (Laughter) I   m like,    Honey, that   s just the way it is. Just deal with it.     Milligan Learn to tune it out. So you grandfather, I don   t remember you mentioning  that he went to OSU     Whitt He did not go to OSU. He lived in and around Stillwater most of his life. It  was a big part of his life, too. Even though he did not attend college. He  was, it was still a big part of his life. It was, he was a big sports fan for sure.  I think, especially in the later years, my grandmother passed away about  eight years before my grandfather. He was alone during that time. I think the  radio, especially, was something that kept him company. It really gave him  something to listen to.  Milligan That was a time period when you were in school, correct?  23  Whitt Yes. Yes. Yes.  Milligan That   s interesting.  Whitt Yeah, of course the OSU sports in general have been a big part of my family  too. I mentioned that my mother passed away in    91. Fortunately, that last  year she was alive was the first year Eddie Sutton was the basketball coach.  I remember watching a lot of the games that were on TV that year. She had  cancer, so she was kind of sick most of that year. We had some great times  watching those great games when Eddie was first there. The really god  teams that they had then.  Milligan Are you following what the chatter is about Eddie Sutton is in the Hall of  Fame right now?  Whitt I don   t guess    Well, I knew they hadn   t put him in the Hall of Fame I  think. I   m not sure what     Milligan Nope, he is up for potential. I   m just curious. Some people have opinions  about that. It   s   you don   t have to.  Whitt It seems to me, I know, I know some, it   s unfortunate some of what  happened, but I believe he deserves to be there. He had such a great career.  Milligan That   s a good memory to have with your mom, though. That was definitely a  good time to be excited about OSU basketball.  Whitt It is. Yes, and when we had the really good team in 2004, that is when we  were living in Missouri. I really wanted to go   they were playing in  Columbia that year, that is when Missouri was still in the Big 12, you know,  and they were playing in Columbia that year. I was able to go to that game.  Unfortunately, we did not win that game. I was like, that was like the only  game they lost in a whole twelve-week span, you know. I was still glad I  was able to go. Obviously, I didn   t get to go to many games in that time. It  was neat to be there even if we didn   t win.  Milligan Have you ever gone to games with like your family, like with extended  family, that have OSU groups, OSU ties, is that something that has ever  been a big deal?  Whitt We haven   t been able to do that that much because everybody   s schedule  doesn   t jive too well. Certainly, when we are together and it   s on TV we are  able to watch a lot of games together on TV. It   s always good.  Milligan I   m sure loud.  24  Whitt I did, in 1985, we had a good football team at that time, too. I was able to  take my mother to some games then. That was before she got sick. That was  great to take her to some football games.  Milligan That   s true. Those were good football years.  Whitt Yes, they were.  Milligan I think for me, that was pretty much what I wanted to cover. Was there  anything else that you wanted to talk about or that I left out, or     Whitt I think I mentioned most of what I had thought about, that I wanted to  mention. Can   t really think of     Milligan Okay.  Whitt Can   t really think of anything else.  Milligan Yeah, well I appreciate your time and your willingness to share for sure.  Whitt It   s been great.  Milligan Good.  Whitt As you can tell, OSU is a big part of my life.  Milligan Well, it   s true you have some deep ties there. Some deep ties there. All right,  well, I am going to go ahead and stop this.  -------  -------
