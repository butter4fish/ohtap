VASQUEZ: 	My name is Kirby Vasquez.  It is May 25th and I'm here for the Alumnae Oral History Project.  Do you want to start out by introducing yourself and your class year?
RIDEOUT:	Actually, just one more thing.  I just want to make sure I focus -- Okay, go for it.
DUFFY:	My full name is Paula Barker Duffy.  I was known as "Polly" Barker, class of 1967 at Smith College.
VASQUEZ:	And why did you decide to come to Smith College?
DUFFY:	I came to Smith because I had fallen in love with a French language instruction beginning in sort of 6th grade, but then in high school it got serious and I had an extraordinary teacher at the little school that I went to in Evanston, Illinois, who wasn't formerly trained as an academic or as a teacher, but she was a World War II bride from Paris and a very animated French woman who instilled a love of the language and I had a counselor, an English teacher and a Latin teacher and a Spanish teacher, because I took lots of languages in high school, who suggested that Smith would be a great place because it would potentially take me to Paris in my junior year, and that was really a dream that I had and I thought, well, if I apply to that school on the East Coast from this little school in Evanston, Illinois, I was living in Chicago at the time.  My folks had – were Chicagoeans – that it would be a new life and I'd be able to do some things that I had dreamed about doing.
VASQUEZ:	And how was it like when you first got here?  How was the campus atmosphere?  How did you feel about being here?
DUFFY:	Well, I suppose that being a scholarship student, partial scholarship, I was a little bit sensitive to what that would mean.  I had a father and a grandmother who thought it was ridiculous to be sending a young woman to an elite East Coast school.  I had a mother who was thrilled that I was going away to school, and would have done everything possible to make it possible.  So I think there were some pretty conflicting emotions, but I think from the day I got here, I met a friend who became a roommate.  We weren't assigned to be roommates, our respective roommates didn't show up, so we chose to live together and we decided to room together until I went off to Paris.
VASQUEZ:	And how was the house community?  What house did you live in?
DUFFY:	I lived in Hubbard House.  I must say when I first saw the campus, I fell in love with -- was it -- you know the one with the big white columns?
VASQUEZ:	Capen?
DUFFY:	Capen.  I thought -- when I looked at that book, that I was going to be moving into a southern mansion, but I had a friend from high school who preceded me at Smith by three years.  It was a small high school and she was in Hubbard, and she was very strong on Hubbard.  So I was delighted to be in Hubbard, and it turned out that it had a great sense of community.
VASQUEZ:	Can you describe that house community?
DUFFY:	Well, there were people from all over the country.  I think the day I checked in I was standing in the front hall with my father, and a woman and her daughter walked in and I realized that it was somebody I had gone from first through fourth grade with in Canton, Ohio, who had moved from Ohio to Mamerrinick, New York, the year before my family moved from Ohio to Chicago in 1955.  And -- so right away I recognized somebody from my grade school days.  I had never known that her mother was a Smith graduate and that's partly why Carol Chase, now Carol Chase Oppenheimer wound up at Smith, but it was a very welcoming community from the very beginning.
VASQUEZ:	And did you have house mothers still?
DUFFY:	Yes, Mrs. Schulte was a fabulous house mother.  I went away just about every weekend the fall of my freshman year and Mrs. Schulte had to call me into her office and tell me in November that the college was very upset because my parents had never signed a release form to let me go away on weekends, and so I had to get on the phone -- we never made phone calls to our parents.  It was once a week writing lengthy letters home, but I had to call my mother and plead with her to get Mrs. Schulte off the hook because it was her -- the house mother's responsibility to make sure that if parents hadn't given blanket permission to leave campus on weekends, and she felt terrible and my mother was appalled that I had been going away on weekends, but did agree to sign the form.
VASQUEZ:	Where were you going?
DUFFY:	Oh, to Princeton, Yale, various schools around.
VASQUEZ:	What were your reasons for going to these schools?
DUFFY:	They had mixers.  I mean we -- that was sort of the way weekends were spent if you were interested in meeting people.  And so I worked like a dog from Monday through Friday in order to be able to go off, and I had this friend who was a senior and who was engaged to somebody from Yale, and she was always eager to fix me up with his friends, and so I went.  It was fun.
VASQUEZ:	Sure.
DUFFY:	Just socially.  Let me make a point.  I was very sensitive to the fact, because without a lot of financial resources, I was enjoying my social life far more than -- I had an older brother who was at a college in the Midwest, and he of course came from the same financial circumstances, but those years in the '60s were when the guy paid for everything.  So his dating was really limited to what he could afford, which was minimal, and I was in hotel rooms that guys paid for, because if they invited a girl for the weekend, they picked up the tab.  It's much more equal now, it's much better, but there were -- you know, it was a different time.
VASQUEZ:	Yeah.  It was a different time.  And so do you have some favorite Smith traditions that you remember?
DUFFY:	Well, I was part of the very first female, white rock and roll group on campus called The RhymeStones.  And our reunions have always remembered this.  I don't know how many photographs there are in the archives, but we were fully functional, the three of us from Hubbard House who started it.  We gave campus performances.  We performed for the Rotary Club at The Whale Inn somewhere out -- Greenfield, Massachusetts -- somewhere near here.  And we basically did female rock group songs, Motown sort of sound, the Shirelles were sort of the group that we modeled herself after.
VASQUEZ:	What did you play?
DUFFY:	I was the vocalist.
VASQUEZ:	Oh wow.  And how -- how was that experience?  That's -- I'm not --
DUFFY:	Well, it was great.  We broke up when I went overseas and when one of our group had some medical problems and didn't come back junior year.  But, for two years, we were off and running.
VASQUEZ:	Did you ever get any -- were you ever judged for this or --
DUFFY:	Well, at the Williamstown talent competition, I don't know, it was some local group, but we -- we had a really fabulous time, and the women on campus were our main supporters.
VASQUEZ:	And what about other Smith traditions?  Do you remember them, like --
DUFFY:	Of Rally Day, I was a big -- you know, involved in rally day our senior year.  A wonderful woman, Sue Boris who is not here this reunion, but was active for a class in many ways, and she I think was the first woman in our class to go to Harvard business school.  I went to Harvard business school 10 years after -- or eight years after I graduated from Smith, but Sue went immediately, and she was a great organizer of campus productions, and I was deeply involved in theater and other things while I was at Smith.
VASQUEZ:	Can you describe how your schedule would work out balancing like The RhymeStones and school and theater?  What do you remember about that?
DUFFY:	I just remember being busy all the time.  I wasn't very fond of the physical Ed requirement.  I mean I did it but I wasn't -- there were a lot of girls in my class who were really involved in hockey and -- I had never been particularly attractive to athletics, so that always seemed like having to do something that, you know, was really biting into my time.  But I remember I went to bed every night at 11:30 and I got up at 7:30 just without fail.  It didn't matter whether it was exam time or just what, but I worked all the time.  I didn't -- a lot of kids played bridge, and you know, did things into the night, but I was pretty much at the library or studying somewhere during the week.
VASQUEZ:	Did you also have a job while you're here?
DUFFY:	I didn’t have a job and that was the time -- I did have summer jobs every year that paid and help defray the costs, but I didn't have a work study.
VASQUEZ:	How was it going to your summer jobs?  Like was it different like atmosphere, a different way of thinking?
DUFFY:	Well, I always was under explicit instructions from my parents that I had to come home and save money.  I couldn't go to New York or the Cape or places where friends were going and sort of taking their earnings and paying rent.  I had to go home and earn the money and save it.  So I worked at Marshall Fields selling clothes after my freshman year.  I worked for Inland Steel Company as a receptionist and mail clerk after my second year.  I worked -- I can't remember where I worked before I went junior year abroad.  I may have gone -- I know I worked in Chiloboy, Michigan for a family one summer.  Yeah.
VASQUEZ:	So, can you talk more about your junior year abroad, that experience?
DUFFY:	Well, I think my life -- a number of lifelong friendships were formed with Smith people during junior year abroad.  It was also absolutely formative in terms of the things I wound up doing after I left Smith.  I was of a generation where if you majored in a foreign language, people on campus made the assumption that you would teach, and I think one of the biggest shocks of sort of recognition that women were viewed differently from men at Smith was coming back my senior year from Paris, sort of full of what I had been through and trying to think what I would do, whether working for the foreign service or things that there weren't a lot of women involved in.  You could be -- basically, you could be a stewardess with Pan Am, or you could teach.  That was what people thought, but I was not going to do either.  And we had a Thursday night formal dinner where a friend had invited the president, Thomas Mendenhall to dinner.  I was seated next to him and he asked what we would be doing, what our majors were and I said that I had spent time in Paris, and he said, "Well, where are you going to teach?"  And I said, "Well, I'm not going to teach."  And he said, “Well, you know, are you going to go to graduate school?”  At the time I thought I was going to go to graduate school, and I had been admitted to the doctoral program in French lit at NYU.
But once again, family circumstances intervened.  I didn't wind up going because my mother was very ill.  I went back to Chicago and I got a little notice from the Smith career office, and it said that a former chair of the government department, Gwen Carter, had moved from Smith to the head of the African studies program at Northwestern University, and she was looking for a secretary who was bilingual because many of the French speaking African students were -- could use somebody who could help with their transition and also be involved in programming for the African studies Association, so at the time I had been offered a job teaching third-graders French at the Latin school in Chicago.  And this notice, I'll never forget, this notice came from the Smith office in the mail because we didn't have computers, saying Gwen Carter was looking to hire a secretary.  I think it took me two minutes to try to make that appointment.
I went and saw Gwen Carter at Northwestern.  She had been there may be six months, eight months.  She had been my government professor at Smith and my sophomore year, and I remember her offering me the job before I left the interview and flying home I was so pleased that I would be back on a campus, a very different environment, filled with people who spoke some French, were from all over Africa.  I formed wonderful friendships with the faculty who taught in that program, and with Gwen Carter.
She was known for sponsoring the careers of Smith women, and two years after working with her, my mother died.  She called me into her office and you know, this was a job where I was learning to type while working for her, taking dictation.  She was dictating the perfect three paragraph letter to everybody in the State Department, everybody -- head of states in Africa, to Winnie Mandela about Nelson Mandela's incarceration in South Africa, and I'm just sitting there typing these letters and learning an incredible amount about contemporary African affairs.  And after my mother died, she called me in her office and she said, "So you don't need to be in Chicago anymore, right?"  And I said, "Well, that was the reason I came home was to be there, you know, during my mother's illness."  And she said, "Well, I have a colleague at Connecticut College who needs a research assistant in Africa.  And you should do this."  And I – “Yes,” you know, and that really changed my life, because I wound up working with Louise Holborne in Africa collecting documents for a history of the UN High Commission in Africa.
We came back to the states.  I went back for a month or two to Northwestern, and Louise called and said, well, can you move here to help write up the results of the study?  It's massive history published in 1971.  We were in Africa in 1969.  And so I worked on the project at Radcliffe Institute.  We finished the manuscript.  I got hired, you know, at Brandeis to be the editor for the African Studies Association.  I started a journal there, edited all their publications, met my husband who was a historian of Portuguese colonial Africa.  Later decided to go to business school and to build on the publishing experience, because I really love the putting together of magazines and publications, but I didn't really have any background in business, and it was a very wide-open time at Harvard Business School, where they had never -- it had been a male institution when I was an undergraduate, but by the mid-70s, it had begun to eagerly recruit women, and my husband and I weren't married.  We were living together and he was a romance -- he had come up through Romance languages into history, Portuguese history particularly.  And he encouraged my application, I didn't apply anywhere else to business school and I went and the rest is sort of history.
So it was all really because of a couple of Smith people that pushed me in certain directions at a time when we didn't feel that we had to make all these career decisions as undergraduates, that we could just sort of explore the world and -- it's a very different environment now, and I often think it was a very unusual time in American history that the economics of life are different for young people now, the pressures they feel, but we were able to experiment in just about every sense.

RIDEOUT:	So what did you -- just to finish up what you've done since Smith, what did you do after going to business school?
DUFFY:	I had two little children, I was asked to stay at Harvard and start the Harvard Business School Press -- well, I had like six months working for a firm that published materials used in the classroom at Harvard, casebooks.  So I worked for the Dow Jones-Irwin publishing company and then the dean at Harvard decided to set up a book publishing operation.  And I was a recent graduate and I had had some publishing experience so I worked to set up the book side. The Harvard business review was 75 years old, but they didn't they had never before published books so I went in as an acquisitions editor and then became director of Harvard Business School Press in 1990.
Then decided when my husband was retiring that I would like an experience to take my family overseas, and I had been approached by the international labor office in Geneva to run their publishing program.  I’d always been interested in sort of the labor side of issues as well as the management side, so this seemed like a perfect opportunity to affiliate with an organization that was committed to worker rights in standards and it was also -- we published -- the ILO published everything in three languages, French, Spanish and English and sometimes German.  So I moved everybody over.  My oldest daughter was in college, but my youngest was in high school, and my husband became quite ill while we were there.  I came back to the states and -- to New York in publishing and then after his death to Chicago -- the University of Chicago press.  I was director for seven years.

VASQUEZ:	Wow.  That's a very good life that you've led.  So why did you decide to attend reunion this year?
DUFFY:	Well, this was a tough year because 45 is neither here nor there in terms of, you know, sort of -- I knew that some of my dearest friends wouldn't make it, but I had a number of really long term great friends from the Boston area for whom it wasn't such a difficult trip, and I think -- you know, over the last 15 years since -- you know, since my children have grown up and I am single, those friendships -- and I've tried to impress this upon my two daughters who didn't go to women's colleges that those friendships -- they go through phases, and the older you get and the less competitive, the less keeping track of who is doing what, the more value you find in just the simple exchange with people who you had a great deal in common with temperamentally and, you know, I've never really found in my professional life the level of humor in people that I enjoyed with my Smith friends, you know, you are always in professional situations, they are -- at least in my generation, this may not be true in your generation, but there was a public life and private life, and maybe those distinctions are being erased now, but certainly in my private life, I always valued the really close friendship of a half a dozen women and these have been long-standing friendships formed here on this campus, or in Europe as part of this program.
VASQUEZ:	Okay.  Do you have any more questions?
RIDEOUT:	I don't know if you want to ask anymore about the diversity -- history of diversity.
VASQUEZ:	Oh, yeah, I forgot --
RIDEOUT:	(Inaudible)
VASQUEZ:	Oh, yeah, that should be the last question, but how did you feel about Smith being -- like how did you consider Smith -- would you consider Smith an accepting place for different like religious or class or race, like was that visible and --
DUFFY:	Well, you know I have -- I have a lot of institutional experience at -- you know, both as an employee of I think there was one African-American woman from the Chicago area in my class.  I happen to know her because we were on competing hockey teams in high school, and Louise Hall -- I was struck by how few urban African-Americans there were on the Smith campus.  The only -- there were a number of Africans and I often -- and a couple of Asian students, and I often have thought about, you know, did they enjoy their experience?  They were always in their national costumes it seems, you know, whenever there were big gatherings.  The Korean student was wearing, you know, a major kimona and the African students were wearing the Nigerian national garb, whatever, and it always seemed that it was too bad that they had to be singled out all the time as the foreign students, but that was the diversity.  It wasn't Americans who -- it was a largely white suburban, you know, there weren't even that many of us from urban areas.  I grew up in a city, and I remember always always, always having to correct people when they would say where are you from, I would say Chicago.  They would say, “Oh, you graduated from New Trier.” I’d say “No.”  I went to a high school in Evanston, but it wasn't New Trier.  Everybody just made the assumption that if you are from Chicago, you are from the fancy suburban areas.  So it was a lily white campus pretty much, and it was -- if you grew up in a city, you were mindful of the lack of diversity, but you were never sure why that was.  You know, was it recruiting, was it the students didn't apply, didn't want to come to a -- you know, just didn't know.
VASQUEZ:	And I'd really like to hear if you have any advice for current or future Smithies about your time here or afterwards?
DUFFY:	My advice would be talk to people about careers, think about what you’d like to do but take the courses that you think you really will enjoy.  Don't concentrate in something because you think it's a ticket to a lifetime employment.  Life is long.  You’re smart.  Most really first-rate graduate schools pride themselves on a diverse student body with diverse interests.  If you -- I mean it may be different for students who want to go into medical school and need to get all of that done, but I know there are lots of places that offer, you know, in between college science courses if you -- if you're a college where there is something you really want to enjoy it because it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have contact with a particular professor or writer whose work you like and you think you'd like to spend time in the classroom of that poet or that writer, do it, because you can only be a fuller human being for studying in the humanities.
VASQUEZ:	Great.  Wonderful, I think we're done.
DUFFY:	Okay.
VASQUEZ:	Thank you very much.
DUFFY:	Enjoy.
