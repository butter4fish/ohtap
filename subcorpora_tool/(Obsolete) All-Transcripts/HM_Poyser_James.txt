Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And if you could tell me her name and her year of birth and what you know about her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Lilith Poyser.  She was born (laughter) in 1930 something.  You know, she's in her eighties and she's always been supportive.  And my mother is, is Jamaican, as is my father [Felix Poyser].  And they're extremely, extremely supportive and extremely loving and a great cook and (laughter), and th- just the type of mother that, you know, she epitomizes what a mother should be.  And that, again, I will say it again, she was extremely supportive with me and, you know, always has advice.  And her main thing in life with me is in me with her faith in God and how I should remain close with my faith.  And she's always stressing that to this day, always stressing that.  And was always an advocate for education and, and being kindhearted.  And that's what I would say about my mom.  She's just that kind of humble person.
Speaker 1: Now where--she grew up in Jamaica, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: So do you know where she grew up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in a town, Duanvale, Jamaica, which is in the Trelawny area [Trelawny Parish], the Fairmont district [ph.] in the Trelawny area of Jamaica.  It's a little one road town, a little dirt town up in the mountains.  And that's where she's from there right (unclear).
Speaker 1: In what part of Jamaica, would you say?
Speaker 2: Say it--like Trelawny, in that area (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, Tre- okay, in the Trelawny--okay.  So (cough) did she talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was an only child.  And it was her and her mom, her mo- her mother, my grandmother and, you know, just the hardships that they had at that time.  They, you know, they weren't wealthy by any stretch of the imagination, but at the same time, it was just all about the family love between her and her mother and all the people in this district where everyone was one, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I met my grandma.  She passed unfortunately, some years ago.  But I went out to Jamaica a few times and stayed in the house where my mother grew up.  And I ran around in the back and got mangos and ran around with the chickens and experienced that part of it, which was great at the time when I was a child.
Story_ID: 672545
Speaker 1: Now do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: They grew up in the same district so they--I think my father [Felix Poyser] and my father's family, which was a large family, and my mother [Lilith Poyser]--they grew up as friends.  My father's sisters and my mother were good friends.  And they all grew up together and, you know, been together (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you know what age they were when they, when they met or--
Speaker 2: I'm not really sure of age--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but my dad tells a story about how my mother was in the church first.  And then my dad met--well, I don't say he met, but he became involved in the church, I think, because of my mother and that's when their relationship grew.
Speaker 1: And, now he's a minister, too (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now he's a minister, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672546
Speaker 1: So, tell me about--give, give me your father's name and what--do you know his year of birth?
Speaker 2: It's in around the same time.  So my father Felix, his middle name, Fitzroy, Poyser [Felix Poyser], and he was born in 1930 something also (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And does he talk about his growing up?
Speaker 2: He does.  He talks about again the same thing, the hardship, a little more of the work that he used to do because as a boy at that time, he had to go and do the farmers' work and work in, off in the, in the woods or the bush, as he called it.  And he also talks about being disciplined quite a bit from my grandfather and how, you know, that, those lessons that he learned helped him develop as a man.  And talked, you know, again he had more brothers and sisters, so the--all those stories of them growing up and roughhousing and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So what--how many, how many kids in his family?
Speaker 2: Oh, my god, oh, you're going to make me mess up now.  I think there was eleven of them, you know, there's some that unfortunately passed away.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how many, how--do you know how many boys and how many girls (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Some, again, some were gone by the time I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you came along, but you came along.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And he said--so his father was a strict disciplinarian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --I take it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Which is, a lot of times, the case with Caribbean par- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, men--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --especially, yeah.
Story_ID: 672547
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Felix Poyser] and how would you describe your mother [Lilith Poyser] in terms of personality?
Speaker 2: My mother is (laughter), my mother is the nice person 'cause she's the nice one on the outside, but she's the, she was the disciplinarian inside the house.  I guess, I'll call my dad the big ticket disciplinarian, disciplinarian though.  When it came down to the extra heavy handed (laughter), he was the one that laid that rule down.  But at the same time, I was the youngest one.  I'm the youngest of three kids.  And as my brother's [Stephen Poyser, Sr.] apt to say, I got the least amount of discipline because, you know, I knew how to be their friend and kiss up to them, so I got away with just a little bit.
Story_ID: 672548
Speaker 1: And give your, give your siblings' names--
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: --in birth order.
Speaker 2: My older brother, my eldest brother is Stephen Poyser [Stephen Poyser, Sr.].  And then my sister is Andrea Jane Poyser [ph.].  When I say Andrea Jane, it's because we call her by her middle name, Jane.  And coincident- coincidentally, we were born on the same day four years apart.  So I was the best birthday present in history (laughter), born on the fourth birthday then.
Speaker 1: So you share the birthday every year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we share a birthday, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's unusual, too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to be born on the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, for a parent to have two kids--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --born on the same day.
Speaker 2: I was born at, I was born at home.  And the (unclear) (laughter)--I think, that my cousins were over at the house celebrating my sister's birthday.  And my aunt delivered me (laughter), in another room so that was kind of interesting.
Story_ID: 672549
Speaker 1: So you were born where?  Where were you, were you born--
Speaker 2: In Sheffield, England.
Speaker 1: In Sheffield, England.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So do you know how--do your parents tell you at what point--or do your sister [Andrea Poyser (ph.)] and brother [Stephen Poyser, Sr.] tell you how--when the, when your parents [Lilith Poyser and Felix Poyser] moved to Sheffield, England?
Speaker 2: They moved in the '50s [1950s].  You know, if--the history lesson of Europe at that time after the war [World War II, WWII], the borders are opened up for cheap labor from the islands and from Africa and so forth.  And my parents came in on that, in a wave of that and moved there.  And my father was a pastor of a church there, of course, had the children, and we--I grew up there.  I left, we left when I was nine and we moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your father, what did he, when did he begin to minister a church?  And that's sort of--so when--by the time he went to Sheffield, he was ministering?
Speaker 2: He was ministering.  I think he had finished bible school and so forth and then moved there and became involved in a church body, the Church of God church body and became a minister, became a pastor of a church, I should say.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so what denomination?
Speaker 2: Church of God--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which is a worldwide church body--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) Church of God.
Speaker 1: But not Church of God in Christ (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) God in Christ, right.
Speaker 1: It's Church, it's Church of God?
Speaker 2: Right, related--it's the same kind of Pentecostal experience (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672550
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what your earliest memory is of growing up? Earliest, so your earliest--
Speaker 2: Earliest memories, the memories that I have are the house that we used to live in on Granville Road.  I remember that and the steps and then the backyard, which led to a wooded area, and me going to--walking up the street to school at that time by myself, you know.  At that time, I guess, it was, it was fine to be unsupervised going to school (laughter), and then living with my cousins and my aunt 'cause my father [Felix Poyser] came, my father and my mother [Lilith Poyser] would come over here periodically to sort--start setting shop for us to come over.  So just those experiences of, of playing with my cousins and, you know, playing with my brother [Stephen Poyser, Sr.] and my sister [Andrea Poyser (ph.)] and all the neighborhood friends, that--those kind of memories always stick out to me.
Speaker 1: So what were the--who was, what was the neighborhood like?  Do you remember the neighborhood?  Or was life more inside the home?
Speaker 2: A combination of both.  You know, the--the home, the home, and (unclear)--well, home at that time, church and home were pretty much one thing.  So there was that experience.  But the neighborhood and being around the kids at the time, playing sports, playing soccer, stealing apples--apple scrounging, as we called it back in the day.  Those kind of things were, were, were there, you know, it's--that's--I guess it's all, it's all one thing to me.  There's no separation of everything, of anything.
Story_ID: 672551
Speaker 1: And, so with you--I'd like to take you back when you were a young person and especially because you were there until the age of nine.  That's when I--and your sister [Andrea Poyser (ph.)] is five years--
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: --four years older than you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay.  So can you tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Fish and chips (laughter), I remember fish and chips, you know.  Back in those days, they would wrap them in paper and they wrap them in newspaper.  God, I'm aging myself, am I?  Yeah, so, yeah, I just, I do remember that, you know, that's the equivalent of hot dogs and burgers over here.  So that's, that's a memory, seeing Sheffield United [Sheffield United Football Club] and Sheffield Wednesday [Sheffield Wednesday Football Club] playing soccer.  Just had a flashback of me hiding in the attic with covers over my head because they were downstairs watching the Dracula movie, and it scared the mess out of me (laughter).  Remember playing outside but being scared of my uncle who was the, who--he's also a minister, you know, from a minister family, but he was also the tough guy.  He was the disciplinarian.  And he used to drive a truck, which we called the lorry.  And when he would drive that coming home from work, it was like uh-oh, let's get out, let's stop whatever bad stuff we're doing.  Playing marbles in the grates.  Playing drums with knitting needles on my mom's [Lilith Poyser] pots and pans (laughter), things of that nature, I guess.
Speaker 1: So what about smells?  Do you--
Speaker 2: Smells--again the--the smell of vinegar, salt and vinegar (laughter) on the fish, on fish and chips.  Smell of apples, this is weird.  We used to do a thing called apple scrounging where we'd--we climbed over--there was an apple orchard not too far, and me and the neighborhood kids were being bad, go in there and stealing (clears throat), borrowing bags of apples (laughter).  Yeah, so that's--
Speaker 1: Sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds, just sounds of music.
Speaker 1: What kind of music?
Speaker 2: The music in the church, the music, records are being played at the house.  Music, my brother [Stephen Poyser, Sr.] playing 'cause my brother is a musician also.  Sounds, the double decker bus, the sound of riding the bus and hearing car sounds and the bus sounds.  Again the kid, the sounds of kids playing on the street, sounds of kids playing in the schoolyard (pause), yeah.
Story_ID: 672552
Speaker 1: So, you know (clears throat), I think of, you know, I--was the transition to the United States different for you because I think of England as a different environment--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you know, and, so I would like to understand what--'cause you're--so you, so it's not just your mother [Lilith Poyser] and father [Felix Poyser] and your brother [Stephen Poyser, Sr.] and sister [Andrea Poyser (ph.)].  You have cousins.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So really how many members of the family you, do you think migrated from Jamaica to England?
Speaker 2: At the time, it was my--and I don't know if they all moved--migrated at the same time but quite a few of my aunts, my aunt and my uncle, I do know, migrated also.  Actually two uncles and an aunt migrated, and they all had kids and fa- started families over there also.
Speaker 1: So you're living right near each other?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were not too far from each other, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And again, like I was saying, my father and my mother, periodically they would have to come over here to set up stuff.  And, you know, live long enough to get the visas and so forth to set up life, so we'd moved in, in essence, with my aunt and my cousins, four girls.  And I still, I still--they're equivalent of my older sisters.  Well, I speak to them all the time, you know.  Thank God for certain apps on the iPhone that we just throw a quick text at least a couple of times a week.
Speaker 1: Are they still in England (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They're still in England, yes, and they all got their families and so forth themselves.  But we all grew up together as one big family, which was a lot of fun, a lot of comedy.  There were so many funny, funny (laughter), silly stories and things (unclear) what we did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like what?  Just give some examples.
Speaker 2: Just silly things, like you can flashback to when so and so would get a beating, which was just funny at the time or a flashback to sneaking me on a double decker bus without proper payment.  I don't know how that happened, but they wanted to get me somewhere.  And the joke is they got me on the bus and, you know, of course, this might not be funny out of context, but to us, it's hysterical, you know.
Speaker 1: So it was a warm family growing up, that's what your--
Speaker 2: Yeah, totally, totally extremely warm.
Speaker 1: It's warm--warm family?
Speaker 2: Extremely, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this really--so what you're saying, if I understand it--I should ask.  So your family, they moved to England, but the goal was to come to the United States, or do you think once they got to England, they wanted to come to the United States (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, I think that's--I don't know if it was goal to move here, but once they got there, you know, the opportunity came for us to come to the land of opportunity and that's what happened.  And he came over here and started the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] here.
Story_ID: 672553
Speaker 1: So at your father's [Felix Poyser] church, who, who are the members of the church?
Speaker 2: A wide range of people, but a lot of Caribbean folk, so not only Jamaicans, but Trinidadians and St. Vincentians (laughter), if there's such a word.  People from Barbados, a lot of Africans as well as, you know, Americans from the states, so it's a wide range of people.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your time in church, like being, your father being a minister, what was your role and responsibility?
Speaker 2: My role was to stay out of trouble (laughter), and not have him yell at me from the pulpit, which happened at least once a Sunday.  You know, as a small church starting out, it would always be "James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], move over here," you know (laughter).  So that was my role, you know, as a kid.  And then I became interested--and again I started off playing the pots and pans, and it was always a love of music in my heart.  And when my church got a drum set, it was like, oh, excuse me, let me take this, let me take over, you know.
Speaker 1: So how old were you?  I read that it was like three years old but--
Speaker 2: When I was playing on the pots and pans, yeah, we were doing that thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pots and pans and that.  So how old were you when you started playing on the--
Speaker 2: Well, when we moved over--see, when we moved to the states.
Speaker 1: That was when you're nine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, after--it's nine.  Then, you know, so it was really no, no formal thing.  And at the time, as a little child, I wasn't playing at the church that we had then, which was a larger church in England.  But when we moved here and started off from a smaller congregation, the opportunity was there.
Speaker 1: And when you say there was music, you said all kinds of music.  But is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) reggae or is it gospel--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is it, what is--
Speaker 2: I will say yes to that, so you can imagine, gospel music but reggae, uh-huh.  And, so it was not only the gospel music of the time, which was your Andrae Crouches and The Hawkins Family, but it also--like the reggae artists that were singing gospel.  I don't know a lot of the names, but there was that also.  And remember also, it was a West Indian church, so the musicians were playing in a style of the Caribbean with the reggae influences and the soca influences and so forth.  So I had all of those influences on me.
Story_ID: 672554
Speaker 1: So what about school too because you're going to a British system of education then (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so what, what--'cause it's A level and then O level but, so do you remember school?
Speaker 2: I do remember school.  I do remember, like the hall--from a flashback in my mind, I see the hallways of the school.  I see school classes and I see the schoolyard where we played.
Speaker 1: So how much of the school--is it a mixed school, a lot of Caribbean, or it's, you know, you know, British?  I mean, who's going to your school?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't say it was a totally mixed school.  I was definitely in the minority but, you know, all the blacks there were Ca- were Caribbean.  But it was definitely--I do remember being a minority, like a--there was quite--not a few of us, not a lot of us, I should say, that were going to the school.
Story_ID: 672555
Speaker 1: And did you have--was there any racial experiences that you had growing up, or do you not remember any of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: --in Great Britain, none of them?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't experience anything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So is, so your neighborhood is also mixed?  And you're in the minority.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very mixed, yeah, very mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But you're still spending a lot of time with your family members more?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but again when I'm, when I'm playing on the street, playing with all of my friends, yeah.
Speaker 1: Friends, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you have a nickname or anything?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, no, I'm laughing 'cause a little--my mother [Lilith Poyser] tells a story of a friend, a little kid from down the street coming to the house knocking on the door and asking for Bobby.  And my mother is like, no--Bobby?  Obviously there's a, there's a football player, a soccer player, Bobby--I don't know his last name now, that I was a fan of.  And I told this, I was telling everybody that was my name (laughter).  The equivalent of saying, "I'm--my name is LeBron [LeBron James] (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were bragging (laughter), you were, you were the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she's saying, "There's no Bobby here" (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was, it was actually me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So were you--what were you like as a little boy?
Speaker 2: Cute. No, I'm joking (laughter).  Fun loving--I, which I am to this day, you know, just a fun loving person.  I have the curse of daydreaming, which I do (laughter) all the time, which I think I've handed down to my son [Jadyn Poyser] (laughter).  He daydreams a lot.  And I still daydream--that was--that's my, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: So, what would you daydream back--about, about--back then about?
Speaker 2: I couldn't tell you.  I do not, I have no idea (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All kinds of things?
Speaker 2: Just everything, everything.  Are we talking England or over here or just--
Speaker 1: I'm talking England right now.
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Story_ID: 672556
Speaker 1: So do you remember moving over here, that--so how is that 'cause that's a huge--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big thing.  They had a big sendoff service at the church.  I remember crying my eyes out.  They don't want to go, they don't want to go--come all the way over here.  My mother [Lilith Poyser] came back--was there first, she flew over with us.  I remember crying the whole plane ride.  We flew into Philly International Airport [Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], looking outside and seeing these gigantic cars.  It's like, whoa, what is going on (laughter)?  I do remember looking out the door, like look at the size of these cars because Eng- at that time in England, they were all--the car, and even now, the cars are a lot smaller.  And just remember, you know, I think halfway through the flight, I stopped crying, and it was like, oh, I'm getting ready to go see my dad [Felix Poyser] now, you know.  But the whole night before and everything, it was, it was sad times but, you know, it turned out to be great.
Speaker 1: So there were, so all three of you came?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, your mother and the three kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --but your father was already there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672557
Speaker 1: So, what was the name of the church that he--I mean, is it the same church he (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's--still the same church, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: New Testament Church of God [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And, so was he, did he feel he was called or was--
Speaker 2: I think so, yes, yes, definitely he was called.
Speaker 1: And do you, who did he take the church over from?
Speaker 2: He started the, he started a whole new church.
Speaker 1: He started it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so it was, it was a very small membership.  You know, it started off in a house, I think, and then a really small sanctuary and then moved to another larger sanctuary, to the one we're on now where it's large enough.
Story_ID: 672558
Speaker 1: So what was the address of your family--or is it the same family home?  And I don't need the--
Speaker 2: No, we grew up at 5814 Ashland Avenue, Philadelphia, PA [Pennsylvania] (laughter).
Speaker 1: And can you describe that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It's just--I'll say middle class at the time, low middle class, you know.  It was still in the hood, but it was a, you know, we were right next to a park [Cobbs Creek Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], so there were a lot of trees around.  And, you know, predominant- you know, predominantly black neighborhood and, at the time, I think I stayed in--and we moved in the summer time.  And I stayed in for most of the summer and eventually became friendly around when school started--became friendly with everybody.
Speaker 1: So, it was lonely when you got there then?
Speaker 2: I don't want to say it--I still had, you know, family around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Family--
Speaker 2: --and the people I met at the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know, had kids also.  There was--so, but it was just the people in the neighborhood, I, you know, I didn't know.  And at that same time also, you know, after--when school started--and starting to see everybody and meet everybody, you know, that's--
Speaker 1: Became--
Speaker 2: --it came out.
Speaker 1: But, you know, did people talk about your accent because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All the time.  You know, "Speak some English for me."  I am speaking English (laughter), so it was that kind of thing.  You know, I had to change the way I dressed a little bit.  I remember getting teased about some of the British clothes I had, which were a little different, a lot different from over here.  But I, you know, I adapted, I adapted pretty quickly.  At nine, you tend to adapt pretty fast, you know.  If I moved when I was a little later in age, it wouldn't be as easy.
Story_ID: 672559
Speaker 1: --Seven or eight channels compared to three--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it was like, oh!
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is be- this is, this is before cable television, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, way, way before.
Speaker 2: ABC, CBS at least.

Speaker 2: So, so you're saying then, you spent a lot of time, you know, watching--
Speaker 1: I watched a fair amount of TV, a little bit of TV at the time but--
Speaker 2: And then you're learning about the culture--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and things like that?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, now, but what are you thinking about the states?  What have you, what have you heard about the United States and what are you thinking at that point?
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'm--I think I might have been oblivious to everything, except just the family.  At nine, I don't know, you know, maybe I was a little weird kid, but it was just okay, I'm here with the family.  Okay, there's the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  There's Bugs Bunny, (laughter) yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you like Bugs Bunny?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's funny, to this day, like we come in contact with a lot of the 'Sesame Street' characters.  We've done a parade with 'Sesame Street.'  And other guys in The Roots are like, oh, you don't know this person?  I'm like, no, when I was nine, when I came, I was nine.  I passed the 'Sesame Street'--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --age so I missed all of the 'Sesame S-'--I don't know any of the 'Sesame Street' characters.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I didn't watch it.  I was, again it was Bugs Bunny.  I know every Bugs Bunny cartoon ever made but (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Bugs Bunny is a staple, been around for God knows how long.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it's a staple.

Speaker 1: What--did your uncle, did your other relatives come here (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they st- they stayed.
Speaker 1: So they stayed there that's why you're saying--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they stayed.
Speaker 1: --your cousins are there but your--
Speaker 2: They're still there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's pretty bold of your, your father [Felix Poyser] and mother [Lilith Poyser]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to come and, you know, I don't mean bold, but in a way, you know, so he was moved to come here--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear).
Speaker 1: --and, and start the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  Do you know why Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?  Why not New York [New York]?  Why not--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You never asked (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I and, now, I think--well, the church body, the Church in God, Church of God body didn't really have a church presence in Philadelphia at that time, which my father sort of oversaw.
Story_ID: 672561
Speaker 1: And, so how--what is, so what school do you go to?  What's your first--
Speaker 2: The first school was Anderson, which was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Elementary?
Speaker 2: --elementary, Anderson Elementary [Add B. Anderson Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and I started fourth grade, that's, like fourth grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'd be probably fourth grade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, fourth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So what were you as a--what was it like attending 'cause that--see, now you're in school.  And you say that first year, it took--but is that first year difficult for you?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember any difficulties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just remember--other than the speak English for me and just the--okay, I can't wear these sandals to school any more, mom [Lilith Poyser].  You got to get me some sneakers (laughter).  After that, everything was fine.  Just again, I have good memories of getting the work done and just having fun times with the other kids there.  When I think back, it's just fun times.  There's a few friends of mine that I still stay in contact with from fourth grade.  And, you know, everything is just, you know, I've just--from thinking back, it was just, you know, good times.  It wasn't, it wasn't a difficult thing at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 672562
Speaker 1: So can you share some, either (clears throat) family memories together, holidays together, that you can, you know, just special memories that you have with your family?
Speaker 2: I remem- (laughter), I remember, what is the game?  There's a video game, the Coleco [ColecoVision] football, the green football game ['Super Action Football'].  I forget what it was.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: It's--it was one of the early video games.  I remember giving my parents [Felix Poyser and Lilith Poyser] a hard time like, you have to get this for me.  And nothing got--turned into brat mode.  And, you know, Christmas turned around, and I was upset that I didn't get it.  But then they gave me the box so, and I got it.  And I just remember like, being--feeling really bad about myself (laughter), so those kind of memories.  I remember Eddie Murphy jokes about it, but I actually had the G.I. Joe with the Kung Fu Grip (laughter).  And I had just those kind of toys at the time growing up.  Yeah, that, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And were holidays big?
Speaker 2: Yeah, holidays were big.
Speaker 1: So how--what were holidays like?
Speaker 2: Just--and again the holidays always had a religious slant to it because of, you know, the faith that we keep.  So holidays were a big dinner, you know, a big meal, but it was also a time of like, really going to church.  The little kids' programs that they had, where you had to learn your little recitation and stand up there and say what you had to say.  And then the--passing out little toys at the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (laughter), that kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: And when you say--so what were meals like?  What was the standard meal at the Poyser house?
Speaker 2: Oh, turkey, stuffing, but the West Indian slant.  We have the rice and peas and the curry chicken and that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Plantains?
Speaker 2: Yeah, plant- yeah, you know about plantains (laughter), plantains and that kind of thing, yeah.  Everything that we did was to just get a  Jamaican twist to it, which I love, which I love.
Speaker 1: And to this day.
Story_ID: 672563
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to sort of understand like, so you're at, what is the name of the school?  You said it's the--
Speaker 2: Anderson [Add B. Anderson Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Anderson.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're at that school until--'cause it's--
Speaker 2: Actually, I was at Anderson just for the fourth grade.  And then fifth grade, I went to Turner [John P. Turner Middle School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And then Turner for fifth and sixth grade.  Then seventh and eighth grade, I went to (laughter) a school that I forget the name (laughter).  Oh, my goodness, wow, I just drew a blank.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: So you--but, now why the difference in fourth and fifth and then--
Speaker 2: Well, in seventh and eighth, the school that I went to was a--the--was a little more academically gifted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: So you were always a good student?
Speaker 2: I was, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so from the time, from the beginning?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you think though, when you came to the United States, you had a better--
Speaker 2: I think I did have a better grasp of certain things, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, and, so you also, so what were you, describe what you were good at--what subjects you were good at.
Speaker 2: I was good at math and, very good at math, and a good understanding of science, and so forth.  So I actually remember going in fifth grade--going to a third school, which had a, which was one of the first schools to have a computer and taking computer classes at that, at that time, which was a walking distance away--taking classes at that time.
Story_ID: 672564
Speaker 1: When do you start, you know, playing the drums in the church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  And that's--do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly what age.  I think I might have been like ten or so.  There's an older--one of the teenagers at the time brought a drum set in.  And, you know, part of me is like, I can do it better than him, so I pretty much took over and stuff (laughter).
Speaker 1: You did that to yourself?
Speaker 2: I didn't, I think I said that to a couple of my friends.  And I said it to myself and, you know, and of course, this is me having no real experience on a drum set, other than playing around and playing on my knees and so forth.  So I wasn't the greatest--well, I was better than him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Better than he was.
Speaker 2: And my, again, and my brother [Stephen Poyser, Sr.], my older brother was the church musician.  He played the keyboards and guitar and bass and drums so, you know, he was the main guy there.  And this other guy was playing along with him.  And I was like, let me try and get this guy out the picture 'cause I can do this (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what age did you start playing with your brother?
Speaker 2: I think we were like the--ten and (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were playing at age ten (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was playing.  I mean, this time, it was a gradual moving, you know, like, can I play, can I play?  All right, cool.  Can I play some more?  And then, you know, I got my feet really wet and really got to actually practice on an actual set.
Speaker 1: So, now at--what--at school, did you have music lessons?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So during, not during any time in school?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You know, this is--that's interesting--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because, you know, I think the next--starting the change in the urban school systems 'cause it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so nowhere in the school?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't--what I could think of, and I'm going, going ahead of the story.  But in high school, there was a band, there was a band, but there was no--
Speaker 1: In junior high--
Speaker 2: --no, no--
Speaker 1: --so in the seventh and eighth--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --there's no, no music?
Speaker 2: Was there? I think there might have been a general music class, but no one on one lesson thing like that.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, and I started taking piano lessons around that time also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were taking piano lessons in the neighbor--
Speaker 2: Private lessons, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the, and the, okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so your brother also took them?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't take piano le--
Speaker 1: He took--
Speaker 2: He took lessons earlier on--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he learned to pay--play by ear, you know.
Speaker 1: And what about your sister [Andrea Poyser (ph.)]?  Was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She took piano lessons also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she still to this day, can play the one song that she knows--the one song.  And doesn't play it right, no (laughter).  But she'll be the first one to brag and say, "I took piano lessons before him."  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: So (clears throat), so when you, so when you get to--so seventh and eighth, you're saying you're in a gifted program?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did you recognize the difference in that program or--
Speaker 2: Not necessarily, yeah, yes, I'm sorry, let me change that.  Yes, there was a bit of a difference.  Work was a, I guess, a little challenging but, you know, I got that done also, yeah.
Story_ID: 672565
Speaker 1: So what were your responsibilities in church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?  Let me ask that and--
Speaker 2: At, at that time now, I was again really playing.  And I think I might have been, might have been playing other instruments also, which were like the bass guitar and guitar.  So, and I was there singing in the, in the youth choir.  At that point, the church had grown to the, to the tune of having a small youth choir.  And those--that's where most of my close friends were, guys my age, that we're still, you know, in the church, and hanging out and playing on the streets 'cause they didn't--they lived pretty close by.  So my role was continuing to try and stay out of my dad's [Felix Poyser] (laughter) crosshairs in terms of acting up at church (laughter).
Speaker 1: But you said your fa- really--I mean, you were the baby--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so they were pretty easy on you.
Speaker 2: They were easy but again they--it's strict, but still, it was a little easy but I--
Speaker 1: So what things was he saying that you had to do, and what kind of chores and things did you have around the house?
Speaker 2: Around the house, I had to (laughter), I had to clean.  I had to va- oh, god, I hate vacuuming to this day because of that.  I had to vacuum the house and clean up the furniture every Saturday.  That was my job.  Oh, God, I hated it, I hated it (laughter).  Yeah, I had to do all of those things and sometime, and hedge and go out and--
Speaker 1: Cut the hedges (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) cut the hedges and all of that.  I had to do all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you--was there a lawn that you had to mow?
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't a lawn.
Speaker 1: There wasn't a lawn.
Speaker 2: Thank goodness (laughter).  Yeah, those responsibilities--
Speaker 1: And, so did you feel also sometimes the--I mean, the responsibilities--your father and mother [Lilith Poyser] talked to you about the responsibilities of the church, and how everyone had to pitch in, or was it more the message of the work of God?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know what?  I, to this day, I felt a responsibility to--I'm not going to say I was perfect by any stretch of imagination.  But where everybody went way left, I just go a little left.  I couldn't go all the way out (laughter), yeah, just because of the sense of responsibility I felt to the, I guess the family name.  And then, it wasn't them browbeating me to do a certain thing or anything.  It was just--I guess, instilled in me some sort of way.  But the music part of the equation, it wasn't, it was just something I wanted to do, you know, so I had to be there, you know.  It was my chance to really play, you know, at church.  So cool, I can go there and play on Saturday, on Sunday and Sunday nights, you know.
Story_ID: 672566
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, so church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was almost--how involved was church on a weekly basis?
Speaker 2: Every day (laughter), for my parents, pretty much every day, you know.  There's all kind of--there's a service every day, so they were there dealing with that.  And I'd be in church quite a bit myself.
Speaker 1: So your mother [Lilith Poyser], what--and how far was the church from where you lived?
Speaker 2: A ten minute walk.
Speaker 1: I see.  And, so your mother, did she play the, I know she played the role of the first lady--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but did she help administratively?  Or did--were there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, in the beginning.  But then they got somebody to do all that but, so she's still involved, was involved with pretty much every aspect of it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so is your father [Felix Poyser], is a lot of his time there, so you're spending more time with your mother?  Is that, or is it both?
Speaker 2: It's both.  Actually my mother was a nurse, she was a practical nurse.  And, so, now, like I'm thinking back, I remember my father being the home keeper in a sense.  He would do most of the cooking and so forth, as well as dealing with the church.  Now he used to work--he still--he's a painter by trade.  And I think when he came here, he got a job as a longshoreman, you know, again immigrant, immigrant work, I guess, but he hurt himself.  He had a really bad accident at the job.  I remember coming home and seeing him laid on the, laying out on the floor, you know, in agony.  And he says that was God telling him, "You got to get rid of that job."  And, you know, God saying, "You know, this is what you have to do all the time," and he thrived at that ever since.
Speaker 1: Ever since--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wow, that's--okay.
Speaker 2: And he still paints to this day, you know, he--that's his thing, he just loves to paint.  If I have a painting project in my house, I cannot say it out loud because he'll show up at the (laughter), show up the next morning with his ladder.  It's like, "Dad, you know, I--please, we got this" (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: That's what he loves to do now.
Story_ID: 672567
Speaker 1: So tell me then high school--where do you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I go to high school, I go to the High School of Engineering and Science [George Washington Carver High School of Engineering and Science, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania],
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: For two years and then I transferred to West Catholic High School for Boys [West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys; West Catholic Preparatory High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for my final two years.
Speaker 1: Now why is that?
Speaker 2: I wasn't focused too much on the work.  I didn't, you know, the--I can't say I really liked it (laughter).  It was a lot of work. It was a lot of math (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mean, the--
Speaker 2: --and a lot of science and those kind of things.  And, you know, my parents [Lilith Poyser and Felix Poyser] were really, really pushing me towards this 'cause this was a good opportunity.  It was a select school.  And I went there and did okay but then didn't do okay at the same time, playing around a bit, being the class clown.  And, you know, I had transferred out of there.  Everyone (unclear)--it's like, I don't want to go there.  And I was getting transferred to the neighborhood school, which would be, which was Bartram High [John Bartram High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which I definitely didn't want to go to.  So I begged my parents, please, so they like, you know, looked around for the best school--possibility in West Catholic, which they had to pay for.  But again that was the kind of supportive parents I had.
Speaker 1: And, and what was the difference in that school--wasn't as, as aggressive on the math and science?
Speaker 2: It was.  I actually, I forget how they had the different class ranking system but I was in whatever the top class thing was.  What's it like, level one or level--gosh, going back a few years, I'm sorry, I don't remember.  But, so it was, it was quite a bit of work and quite a lot of like, high level work at the time.  And I busted my butt quite a bit to get pretty good grades the last two years so--
Speaker 1: Now so you, what are you thinking you want to do at that point?
Speaker 2: At that point--
Speaker 1: And what year are you graduating from high school?
Speaker 2: I got to say this out loud (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yes, you do.
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-five [1985] (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (laughter) (unclear) don't want to give ages.  We haven't had that experience--must be this young generation.
Story_ID: 672568
Speaker 1: So 1985, isn't that the same year that MOVE, was that the--
Speaker 2: It was, MOVE was a few years before that [sic.].
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And it wasn't too far from where I lived actually.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that then?
Speaker 2: I remember that day.  I remember riding my bike around.  And somebody rides a bike from off the block and say, "Hey, you know (laughter), they're shooting up on--," whatever street that is, "they're shooting up there.  You want to go see it (laughter)?"  And I looked like--part of me said, yes, and I was like, wait a minute, they're shooting? No, I don't want to see that.  But I remember coming in the house and seeing, seeing on the news, them showing the helicopter hovering above and then dropping them--drop the bomb.  And they burnt down that whole block.  I remember that, but I would see before that.  There was a shootout in Powelton Village [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] with MOVE some few years before. The same MOVE thing.  They had another standoff, and there was a shootout, and some people got killed and so forth.  And you would see the MOVE kids walking through the neighborhood from time to time periodically.  Again we weren't too far from that.  So, yeah it was pretty devastating, yeah extremely devastating.
Speaker 1: So when that happened, how--where is the response of community, and what is the response of your parents [Lilith Poyser and Felix Poyser]?  'Cause wouldn't that have affected the people who attend your church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and, so--
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: I mean, in terms of the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: In terms of the neighborhood, yeah.  And I think--I'm sure my father probably, you know, continued to preach his general message of love and forgiveness and so forth.  But at the same time, just being smart in whatever your dealing with and but, the community--it was, it was, it was extremely deep.  I remember I had a classmate--I think she, she lived on that block, and her house burnt down.  And I just remember the backlash against Mayor Goode [Wilson Goode] at the time, too, you know.  Did he do it or was it from the governor's [Dick Thornburgh], was it orders from the governor or--
Speaker 1: No, I think he actually, I think, as I remember that he did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he felt, I think he also felt that he had to do it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, and that hurt him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, politically.  But what are you hearing in the neighborhood at this point?  What are people saying?  Were they--'cause the MOVE people, so people didn't have--you don't hear any issues about the MOVE people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it was, it was pretty deep, you know.  Of course, there's the, there was the point of view of, you know, you know, you got to fight the powers that be, of course.  And then the--well, you know, they had to get them out.  So there was the two different point of views going around.  And at that time, I just remember just being really heavy and (unclear) I just remember like, being really deep, a really, a really dark period, and it was very heavy at the time.
Speaker 1: And, so (cough) were people in the, in the neighborhood upset with Mayor Goode?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he--they was, they was dividing.  It was people that, people that were upset at that and then people, you know, and some agreeing with him at the same time so--
Speaker 1: So where did your family fit, or your parents fit?  Or where did you fit?  You're old enough at that point (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, I--this was, this was before high school [sic.].  This was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, this is, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  So at the same--I don't want to sound too ignorant to what was going on.  But at the same time, you know, this was happening, it's like, oh, wow, this is deep.  Let's go play ball.  At that age, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Certain things just don't affect you a certain way.  So I do remember it just being dark but I don't necessarily remember--it didn't hit the political aspects and so forth.  They don't really hit home at that time for me.  And I apologize (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, that's o- so, but let me--you don't have to apologize (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 672569
Speaker 1: What is occupying your attention though?  Are you, are you hanging out, are you hanging out?  And I mean, who are your friends?
Speaker 2: I'm playing, I'm playing ball up the street, you know, going down to park [Cobbs Creek Park, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and playing baseball, just playing in the park, doing homework, getting in a little trouble at school just by being the class clown.  I remember getting suspended one day from school for throwing someone's gym shorts around.  I remember my dad taking care of that trouble (laughter).  I remember me promising never to let this happen again.  I remember me, you know, getting--I used to remember like, things in the, in the, in the hood like, you know, I can't say I lived (air quotes) a boys in the hood lifestyle.  But I do remember like, guys pulling a gun out on me in the neighborhood.  I remember seeing friends on the playground at school during break getting in fights with older guys and seeing--I'll ne- I'll never forget one of my good friends laying on the ground.  This guy had a knife over him, didn't do anyth- he didn't do it.  But it's just the scare tactic, those kind of, those kind of images.  So it was still pretty, you know, there are still those violent things going on.  I can't, but I, again I didn't live the hardest life.  So if I'm to say that's the norm, yes, yeah, it's still pretty deep but that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But you didn't live the hardest life because you were protected also by church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I wasn't, I wasn't running the streets--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But still those things were around--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know--
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's hard to avoid those things so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: But were there many, were there many fights at school around--or in the neighborhood, or was there gang activity that you were aware of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely, oh, yeah.  Cedar Ave [Avenue] and Woodland Avenue and all of those--was the gang and all of those gangs around.  I didn't have to deal with any of that stuff, thank god.
Speaker 1: You didn't--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and why is that?
Speaker 2: I just, that wasn't my thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--but how, but a lot of times they say, young black boys get caught up in it anyways, so why didn't you get--
Speaker 2: My parents [Lilith Poyser and Felix Poyser], you know, it was (laughter)--I do remember playing outside.  But I do remember when it got dark, you would hear this voice in the distance, "James [HistoryMaker James Poyser]!"  "All right, you guys, I got to go" (waves) (laughter).  My parents were like, okay, in the house, after a certain while.  You know, they gave me some rope but they were very keen on pulling that rope and pulling me in.
Speaker 1: So you never rebelled against them--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in that way?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 672570
Speaker 1: So when it comes time to go to college, what are you thinking at that point?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, at college, the--I was thinking of different schools.  I was thinking of going away to school.  But I had an opportunity to go Drexel on a chemical engineering scholarship.  There was an opportunity for two students from around the city to get a, to get a scholarship, scholarship for chemical engineering.  I wasn't, I was interested in engineering, but not chemical engineering.  I'm thinking--I guess mechanical and electrical engineering.  That's where my thoughts was, but I said, "Well, chemical's not too far off.  A scholarship, cool."  Didn't get the scholarship, but I still got into Drexel University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and went there for chemical engineering, which I (laughter) still regret (laughter).
Speaker 1: Go on and talk about that.
Speaker 2: So, you know, I think we went to Rohm and Haas [Rohm and Haas Company; Dow Chemical Company], we went to the Rohm and Haas plant.  And one of the guys was like, this is what we're going to do if you're chemical engineering.  He was walking around with a smile on his face.  And I was like, no, I am not doing that, I'm not doing this for the rest of my life (laughter).  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what was he showing then?
Speaker 2: I don't, I blanked out, I blanked out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't remember.
Story_ID: 672571
Speaker 1: But I do remember at that particular time, if you can go back a year or so, just before colle- that's when the music bug hit me really hard.  I, again I took the basic piano lessons as a, as a kid.  'Mary Had A Little Lamb' stuff from an old lady, which I didn't really like going to because she had two little dogs that would smile in your face when you walked through the door.  But on the way out, if you turned the back, they would bite the back of your legs (laughter).  So, I would always walk out from the music lessons like, "All right, see you, Miss DeCosta [ph.]" (laughter).  And those little dogs would yap me all the way through.  And these little Chihuahuas, to this day, I don't like Chihuahuas (laughter).  So I, again I took those lessons.  I didn't really like, I didn't really care for it, stopped, but that's when I was really playing drums more and bass more.  And then I was like, we started lessons again with another teacher, and it was a little more interesting to me.  You know, I started doing--playing a little more interesting things.  Then I stopped that.  And then, I--we went to a church, and there was a kid my age playing a song on keys.  And it struck a chord in me like, whoa, if he can do that, I can do that.  And I took a cassette tape, I had a cassette tape of the song.  And I spent a few months just teaching myself the basics of that and from there, started playing.  It led to me learning other things, and other things and other things and other things.  So by the time, I got to college, the first year in college, my whole thing was playing the piano and just being around the piano when--trying to play and trying to learn.  So I was a chemical engineer but in my brain, I was--I'm going to be a piano player.
Speaker 2: So who are you playing with?  Is there someone that you're, you know, you come in contact--well, you come in contact with--I mean, how do you come in contact with Chauncey [Chauncey Childs]?
Speaker 1: Chauncey, well--
Speaker 2: I mean, or is that later--
Speaker 1: That's a little later, that's a little later (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a little later.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, not--your first two years, you don't come in contact with Chauncey?
Speaker 1: No, that was a (unclear).  When I, when I transferred to Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, you transferred to Temple.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.  So (cough) you're, so you're really at that point, developing your musical ear (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you haven't necessarily found your--I call it the musical voice.  I don't know how to say it otherwise.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you haven't found your own style, but you're developing your ear?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: So you're really listening and copying things that you hear?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Have you started, at that point, any improvising or things like that (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--it all was that.
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: It was just picking up everything.  So little things and little piece, little snippets in songs like, oh, let me learn this chord change.  Oh, they played this particular keyboard run here.  How do you do--put my fingers together to do that.  So that's really what it was till, you know, I could play some songs.  I could play through some songs and I was playing, started playing at chur- at my church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and just doing more things like that.  You know, by that time I'd left the drums and everything else, sort of alone--still playing though.  Matter of fact, the first year, first two years in college, I was playing drums for the choir, for the college choir, Drexel's [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] college choir, before I moved to playing the piano for them, so.
Story_ID: 672572
Speaker 1: But I'm going to ask you--the question I was asking you was if you began as a drummer, and you become a pianist, how does that take--I may not be asking the question right in musical terms, but you help me along.  How does that change your approach, or does it change your approach to music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the drum thing is more of a rhythmical approach, and the piano, while rhythmical, is--it involves more harmony and melody.  So for me to have, you know, the sounds that I was hearing from the, from all the music that I used to listen to, you know, being able to figure out how to put my hands on those notes to make those harmonic noises and play those, you know, play those melodic keys, that's the best thing, you know, the best thing ever for me.
Speaker 1: You like--so you're telling me--and if I, if I'm wrong in anything just feel free to correct me.  But are you telling me then, you really--your ear was hearing melodies?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I mean, then it's naturally that melodies--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --or harmonies--
Speaker 2: No, it--I guess, it was a marriage of all, melody, harmony and rhythm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But just to be able to play instruments that can bring those things out of you, so whereas the drum thing was strictly rhythm, and not having a lot to do with melody and harmony.  You know, the piano, you know, does all three.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 672573
Speaker 1: So when you, so when you're--are you playing with any groups?  Are you playing with groups in the latter, you know, in college or the latter part of high school [West Philadelphia Catholic High School for Boys; West Catholic Preparatory High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --'cause you kept talking about you would go off and practice.
Speaker 2: Well, in college, you know, again I was playing with the choir.  I was playing with the choir there and just playing, not necessarily playing with groups but more playing on the church scene.  It was, there was a couple community choir things that I was involved with and just practicing by myself, just listening to a lot of music.  I can say that, you know, growing up in a hou- in a, from a very church oriented background, I missed a lot of music.  You know here--even though I would sneak and listen to the radio and listen to a lot of things on the radio, it was still a lot that I missed.  So I was just gorging with everything, going back and listening to everything, you know, and speaking to the other guys.  And they were, and showing me, telling me about different things and things that I've missed, like obvious things that you, that you think you would know.
Speaker 1: Like what?  Give some examples.
Speaker 2: I remember a friend of mine in college giving me a mixed tape with (laughter) this [HistoryMaker] Herbie Hancock's 'Mr. Hands' album.  I was like, wait a minute, what is this (laughter)? You know, I remember like, you know, again I just didn't have that.  I didn't have access to that thing growing up.  I remember just a lot of--just going--being around the jazz classes, even though I was a chem e [chemical engineering] major and, but hanging in the music classes, hearing about such and such as a jazz musician, whereas some, you know, a lot of kids grew up with that in their household.  And they grew up learning that, I had to go back and absorb it later on in life.
Speaker 1: And learn, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are you, so you are sort of--you're saying though, you're hanging out in the music classes at Drexel [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] but--
Speaker 2: The music rooms--I shouldn't say classes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The music--okay.  The music rooms, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And though, now what was Drexel's music program like?
Speaker 2: It was a little small.  Professor George Starks was there.  And again that's where the gospel choir was--would rehearse, so just picking up the little bits there.  And eventually when I transferred to Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], it was that on a larger scale.
Story_ID: 672574
Speaker 1: Now you said you transferred to Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you really decided you didn't like, you didn't want to be a chemical engineer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chemical engineer, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I switched to, to finance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't ask me why (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that's what--so you--you're very--okay.  So you, you, you--
Speaker 2: I was--I'd say, I didn't lose my smarts.  I just lost the desire to use my smarts (laughter) in that, in the context of chemical engineering (laughter).
Speaker 1: So Temple is la- isn't Temple, is Temple larger than Drexel [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a--okay.  So you go there, and you're--so what is the difference there?  And who are, who, who is different in terms of who you meet?  I know you meet Ch- that's where you meet--
Speaker 2: I meet Chauncey [Chauncey Childs] in a class (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now Chauncey was, his major was what?  He had a, he was a fi- wasn't he finance (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Finance also, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was finance, too, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), so finance, finance majors, we met each other.  We--and the thing--we didn't start working then.  We were--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: You have, you have to tell more stories.  You're having me answer questions, and you're going yes and no.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay, right?
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know you can tell stories 'cause I've heard you do interviews.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So actually I had a class with Chauncey, and we became friends in this particular class, but our musical journey didn't start through that.  It started another, another way.  But in Temple, you know, there was a pretty heavy jazz program there.  And again I was a finance major but I would go to the music school [Temple University Boyer College of Music and Dance, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and use the practice rooms and jam with the guys.  And, yeah I was still a musician at heart, even though I was taking care of my work.  I was (unclear), you know, I did very, fairly well at Temple with my schoolwork.  But I definitely got the mu- the musician thing really, really going.
Story_ID: 672575
Speaker 1: So are you doing gigs at this point or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I am doing gigs at this time.  I'm doing some touring with some local groups and some somewhat major gospel groups.
Speaker 1: S- can you give names of--
Speaker 2: Like Vanessa Bell Armstrong, the New Jersey Mass Choir, at that time.  Started playing back then with Hezekiah Walker at that time also.  And again these were all learning experiences at the same time too, so, yeah.  God, Bruce Parham was another, another gospel artist I was working with, yeah (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're, so these, so you're doing, when you're playing with these, you're playing piano with them, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And there was a lot, there was a budding music scene there.  Even though he was a couple of years younger than me--friendly with a guy, [HistoryMaker] Fatin Dantzler, from Kindred the Family Soul.  And also there's another great singer, Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] singer, Carol Riddick was in Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at that time when we performed together.  And the group Zhane, Jean [Jean Baylor] and Renee [Renee Neufville].  Zhane were Temple students, and I remember a talent show where we all performed together.  I remember playing outside the student activity center [Howard Gittis Student Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] doing those kind of things and, yes, so it was a little bit of a music scene going, going now.
Speaker 1: Now Fatin, he's how many--when he--you say, how many--he's a couple of years younger?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't--I'm not sure exactly how many exactly (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --years younger, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a few.
Speaker 1: But he had gone into the creative arts--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right, school there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) School of creative arts [Philadelphia High School for Creative and Performing Arts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The school of the arts.  And, so have the--at that point in time, is the Black Lily, you know, or is that--
Speaker 2: No, no, that's not--
Speaker 1: This is, this is later.
Speaker 2: This is later, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's later, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're just, you're performing together, and you're, and this is at Temple?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I'm told that Temple, Temple really--I was told, I think, that it initiated a lot of, there was a lot of the music people that came out of Temple, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, quite a few.
Speaker 1: And people who ultimately became involved with what is known now as neo soul movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Definitely, that's true.  I could say names like again, Fatin and then Zhane.  And again the Temple experience, you know, there was, there would always be like some of the house music parties and the deejays and the deejay culture that came out of that.
Story_ID: 672576
Speaker 1: And actually that's when I started working, when I met and started working with Jazzy Jeff [DJ Jazzy Jeff].  And I started working with him around that time and became a little more entrenched in the Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] music scene, yeah.
Speaker 2: So how did you come to be involved with Jazzy Jeff at that time?  And then, and what I'm, what I'd like you to des- I really would like you to describe (clears throat) what people were doing because, I mean the fact that this came out of, you know, main- I don't want to say--it came out of different parts of the country.  I mean, you could (clears throat)--but Philadelphia had a very strong group there.  And, so I'm just trying to understand why Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], you know--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to say it was just Temple (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Temple, but there were quite, there were a few (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was a few, but I think everybody that moved out in this culture--and there was a lot of different things happening.  Again, it could be performances on Temple that involved some Temple students.  But out of that, there were people that did other things, but it was all of the same like-mindedness and, you know, we sort of grew together, you know, even--grew together or grew together.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I met Jeff.  I don't really, how did I meet Jeff (laughter)?  I, again I think it was through Jean [Jean Baylor] and Renee [Renee Neufville], yeah it was through Jean and Renee.  They were working with Jazzy Jeff at the, at the time.  I met Jeff, even though I always wanted to meet Jeff 'cause Jeff and Will at that time were doing their thing.  And Jeff grew up not too far from me.  And then we met and I started working with the Touch, the Touch of Jazz [A Touch of Jazz] back then with Jeff and another fellow, Vikter, Vikter Duplaix.  And that's when we started--I really wanted to learn, to write more, learn how to write more and produce, which I was doing on a smaller scale.  But I wanted to do more and I started working with their company, with Touch of Jazz.  And the thing--Jeff had a studio up in, in the suburbs of Philly, at Gladwyne [Pennsylvania], the Touch of Jazz studios.  And we used to work out of there, but it became more--so me and Vik doing a lot of work 'cause Jeff was doing a lot of the TV show stuff.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) With Will Smith.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  They was doing the--he was getting thrown out the house (laughter) on the Will's, on 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.'  So Jeff was still working doing his thing.  When he was in town, we'd work together, but he also had a studio set up at his house, so he'd work from there.  And then me and Vik--Vik and myself, I should say--were working occasion.  And we realized we needed somebody to help with the business side of things.  And Vik's childhood friend, coincidentally, was Chauncey [Chauncey Childs].  So Chauncey came and like, when he came to the studio like, "What are you doing here?"  It's like, "I'm here with Vik" (laughter), so that was that, beginning of that relationship.  So that's how those, that's the genesis of this relationship.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], what period of time are we talking about?
Speaker 1: Oh, it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Over what period 'cause I mean, you go into Temple, and then what--are you--
Speaker 1: I graduate.  So after, after Drexel [Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], took a couple of years where I was working in community college.  And then went over to Temple and finished up there.  So ninety--when did I graduate--in '92 [1992], '91 [1991], '92 [1992]?  Do you have that on (laughter)--I think, I think I graduated in '91 [1991], in that, in that time period, so started working with Jeff right in that, in the vicinity or area, '91 [1991], '92 [1992], '93 [1993].  And, yeah.
Story_ID: 672577
Speaker 1: I want to understand.  So you, how do you progress so quickly is what I'm trying to understand.  And at what point are you transitioning from gospel--so you just jump over all that.  I mean, how do you--and I don't want to say, transitioned from--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --'cause you never have left it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Cough) But how do you incorporate, you know, the other things that are sort of happening?
Speaker 2: Well, again I had an open ear and I was listening to everything.  And all those things were being absorbed, and I was learning, you know, being, being--practicing all the time, playing with, playing with the gospel choirs but then playing outside of that with--on the R and B scene and the jazz scene.  And I forgot to mention also--I think right after college, I got a gig touring with CeCe Peniston.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, so I toured with her for quite a few months and--
Speaker 1: And she was really--that's when she was hot, too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when she was hot, yeah so that was a learning experience, you know.
Speaker 1: And what did you learn?
Speaker 2: What did I--
Speaker 1: What did you learn?  You said it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just like, just, just different things in music.  You know, there's always something.  I think every time I hear music, there's something that I can pick up so.  So just learning the ropes of touring and living out of a suitcase, you know.  I was the rookie going in, you know, had to learn how to joke with the band.  I had to learn how to deal with their teasing me, you know, playing the dozens really bad.  The first few weeks are like, why do these guys--and then, I figured out, oh, I'm supposed to give back.  So to this day, my reputation of insulting people is unparalleled.  Thank you very much (laughter).  I'm pretty good with insults (laughter).  So, yeah I had to learn, just learn those things, just learn how to not be the young, dumb musician, which there's quite a bit of in these days (laughter).  You just don't--I got to experience life away from, away from everything.
Speaker 1: You know, but what I'm trying to understand, you really, up until this point, unless the story you--it's a pretty protected life you had been living.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And this is a whole different ball of wax that you're entering in (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: And that, and you just--I mean, so what are your parents [Lilith Poyser and Felix Poyser] thinking, too?
Speaker 2: My parents again were supportive, you know, like we, you know, this is off the beaten path a little.  But, you know, we believe that you have--your head screwed on tight enough that you won't do anything dumb.  And, yeah I didn't do anything dumb (laughter), you know.  I think I ran from anything stupid, you know.  I just couldn't allow my- I wouldn't allow myself to do anything that dumb, you know.  I decided, I guess, I thank God for that kind of filter that sort of kept me, you know, focused on what I was doing.
Speaker 1: And, so (clears throat) people obviously saw a lot in you, too.  I mean, you wouldn't be getting these opportunities from these--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --these (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I think it was a blessing.  I progressed pretty quickly and I learned quite a bit.  I think at that time, just before that gig or right after that gig, I felt the need to learn some more.  And I started taking lessons with a professor from Lincoln University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] named Charles Pettaway [Charles H. Pettaway, Jr.]--and for I think a year or so, I was taking classical lessons and I was really progressing that way.  And I could feel, you know, at that period of time, I was practicing, I was practicing maybe like, two hours a day, you know, just really into it, doing a lot that I--I'm sorry, I shouldn't say, two hours a day, quite a few hours every day, every morning.  And I was really progressing and really learning more, learning a lot more about music and listening.  And again everything was new to me, even though, you know, I'd absorbed so much.  And then I could just--all of these experiences that I had musically, I could put into, into one thing and use that.
Story_ID: 672578
Speaker 1: So when you and Jazzy Jeff [DJ Jazzy Jeff] came together, what are you working on at that point because he's, he's doing beats, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He's a--right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was doing beats.  There were--he had a few artists that were signed to the company [A Touch of Jazz] at that time.  So I came in, and we were working on, was working on those projects with him.  And we were doing, we were getting calls for remixes and things so we were just progressing like that, trying to do as much work as we could, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then Axis Music Group--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that is--that's--is that what you form with--
Speaker 2: With Chauncey [Chauncey Childs] and with, and with Vik [Vikter Duplaix] also (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Vik, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, after--
Speaker 1: So that's how you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after Jazzy Jeff went--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and start working with Will [Will Smith], then you form Axis Music?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So, no, we were working together.  You know, at that time, we were like, you know, we're really doing--by the time, Jeff was really involved in the, in the, in Hollywood, and he was dealing with that stuff.  And it was like, you know, we were working and we were keeping the lights on in this, in this, in this studio.  It was a full fledged huge studio that we were dealing with.  And we were doing all these projects, a lot of indie [independent] projects and so forth just to pay the rent.  It was like, wait a minute, we're doing all of this--well, we need the, we need to go do our own thing.  So that's where the birth of Axis Music was.
Speaker 1: I see.  So this huge studio, was that Jazzy Jeff's studio?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he's off, but you're using his studio?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you're doing work for him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we were taking care of, you know, this is our responsibility.  For us to use--it was still our responsibility, which I understand, but at the same time, it was like, okay, maybe we don't need this.  And I think Jeff came to the realization that he didn't need it also.  So he got rid of the studio thing and moved, and downsized.  And we were like, you know, we need to downsize and do our own thing also.
Speaker 1: And, so you, you got together and so, what were you thinking you wanted to do?  Are you planning at this point?
Speaker 2: We're planning to produce and to write and to continue doing what we were doing, but just to make a living off of that.  So while we're doing that, I was still playing with different groups, you know.  I was--the periodic tours and gigs, and things of that nature.  So anything that could be done musically, I was, I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were you thinking, you know, when someone starts to write and produce--one, do you know at that point what producing involves at that point?
Speaker 2: Here's the thing.  We had a, we had a little setup in Vik's--Vik had an apartment.  And we had a little keyboard setup and we soundproofed the room, and we'd go there every day.  And we're calling ourselves (air quotes) producers and working on little projects for this and little projects for that, making a little bit of money, this and that.
Story_ID: 672579
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Kenny Gamble is, is friendly with Chauncey [Chauncey Childs] and with Vik [Vikter Duplaix] at the time.
Speaker 2: Now how did they get to know him?
Speaker 1: I--not really sure.  I think that--like family friends, they--Chauncey's parents were friends.  And I think Vik somehow was friends with him some kind of way.  And Mr. G (laughter) was like, (imitates) "(Makes noise) What you guys doing up there?  You need to come down here."  So he opened the doors for us, and we actually moved into the Philly International [Philadelphia International Records] building.  He gave us the use of Linda Creed's old room.  I don't know if you're familiar with Linda Creed, who wrote 'The Greatest Love of All' and many other classic hits.  So we're working in this funky old room with carpet on the walls, like green carpet on the walls, this little room. And we're in their like (claps), okay, we've hit the big time (laughter).  So we go there--
Speaker 2: Because--well, they were legends (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: I mean even that he would--
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that's when we started to learn what was going on, 'cause Mr. G, Mr. Gamble and Mr. Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff], just by watching them, they were still working on certain things.  So watching them work on their things but even more so, just watching how they carried themselves, watching how they spoke, sitting down in meetings with them and just listening in on what they talked about it was like a master class of how to carry yourself and how to prepare, and how to work in the music business 'cause these guys are two of the greatest that have ever done it.  And I could say I learned so, so much, you know, so, so much from them.
Speaker 2: And I, I remember seeing--I think, an interview, and you were talking about, you know, looking at Huff play piano, you know, watching him play the piano--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and learning from that.  But what--how long were you there?  You talk about that, but how long did you guys stay there?
Speaker 1: It was like four or five years.
Speaker 2: Oh, so it was that long?
Speaker 1: It was, it was a, it was a good enough time, yeah.
Speaker 2: So you moved out of Vik's apartment into Philly International--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --for that--oh, I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were there, we were there for a few, for some years, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, so they really, in many ways, they somewhat incubated you, too?
Speaker 1: Yes, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 2: So do you--what impact can I ask you, that whole experience had besides learning, do you think--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  What impact did it have on you musically?  I mean, you talk about understanding the business and, you know, and seeing how they negotiate and they do things, but what things were they working on?  And were there other people they were incubating there or no?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were other young producers there.  Mr. Huff's son was working there.  And there was other crews of guys that were working.  Each one had their projects, you know, these guys working on some more hip hop things and so forth.  But Mr. Gamble and Mr. Huff were--they had some of the old timers in there, I don't wanna say, you know, insult you and say that, but like Billy Paul and Lou Rawls would come through.  I think when we first started there, they were working on a Phyllis Hyman thing, so just how, you know, they did their stuff with them.  They didn't, you know, Gamble-Huff music with these artists.  I remember seeing, just watching a string session and, you know, Gamble and Huff were legendary for knowing, for that sound of strings, which sort of--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --put a bowtie on disco.  I remember being in an assistant string session where the string arranger and Gam- Gams, as I call him (laughter)--Gams, the way he picked out certain things, you know, the arranger was doing the music.  And Gamble was just sitting back with his producer hat on, like, "You need to change this, you need to change that."  And it was just the control he had.  And he al- he always says that the key to his success, the key to his success is that they knew exactly what they were going for.  You know, they didn't leave any doubt to this is, no, this is what we want.  And this is what we're going to go after.  This is what we're going to target and this is what we're going to go after.  And just seeing that in action was a lesson like, okay, I have to really identify what I'm trying to do with every song, what I'm, what I'm, what am I trying to, what am I trying to present with this piece of music, and what am I trying to go, where I'm trying to reach, and let me try and aim for that.  And everything they did that they're--the collection of music that they've created is timeless.  What's the--I think they say is heard, some crazy record, one of their songs is played somewhere in the world every few minutes or few seconds or something like that.
Story_ID: 672580
Speaker 1: Well, look at the artists that came out of that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, all the great artists--
Speaker 1: --you know, there were a lot of artists (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --and the stories that they tell about--for example, they talk how--'If Only They Knew' [sic. 'If Only You Knew'], I think, say Patti [Patti LaBelle] came in with a, with a--some kind of sandwich when they were doing the song.  And I don't, I don't think she really wanted to sing it, and they were like, "You got to sing this song," you know, those kind of stories (laughter).  Jones Girls [The Jones Girls] stories, you know, just that kind of stuff.  You know, I don't think, I remember watching the video, and some girls' group was dancing back in the '90s [1990s], might have been Total or something like that.  Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff]--(imitates) "They pretty good, huh?"  "(Imitates) Yeah, ain't nothin' like them Jones Girls, huh" (laughter), those kind of, those kind of things, you know.  But just again, just knowing--know what you're going for and know how to get there.
Speaker 1: But you know at the time that you're--'cause, I mean they, you know, they did Teddy Pendergrass (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, lots of artists.  So the, but the thing that, and people--they became known for what is known as the Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] sound.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the thing that I--at the time that you're there, the music industry that they knew is going through changes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's going through a lot of changes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And (clears throat), so do they really understand, or do you guys really understand what you are doing?  And you mean, you, you know, or what you're even looking for?  You said that you should know what you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wanting to do but are--is that, does that make any sense to you?
Speaker 2: It does make sense.  I mean, they were going for--the music style is different, where it's just still--the goal is the same, you know.  I guess it's the, just the way their approach to what they were doing musically and what they spoke about how they approached their music.  I had to do that to what we were doing musically, and again our style of thing was a lot different from what they were doing but still having to learn, trying to learn that the level of professionalism and the, trying to reach that timeless goal in what we were doing, you know.
Speaker 1: So you would create music that had a timeless quality is what you're saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was trying to (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: That was the goal, that was the, that was the goal.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so that, that exposure, you think, really helped you?
Speaker 2: It totally helped us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I want to understand--so did they understand what you were trying to do musically?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they totally did, or if they really had to (laughter).  I think what they knew that they were doing would was giving us an opportunity to work on our stuff but, and do it in the way you're doing it.  But we'll, you know, sort of help you clear out the clutter in a sense.  So again just those lessons that we learned, it sort of drove us to learn that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: So would they listen to your tracks and things that you had and give you feedback on them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they would, they would do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and again some, some of the things they did--I can't, you know, might have been dated at this time, you know.  But they still kept working and kept doing what they were doing, you know.  I don't know if they missed--I don't want to say they didn't need to do that.  And I think Mr. G's [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble] focus was on his community outreach things more so.
Speaker 1: He was the--you should talk about that because Mr. G--talk about that part.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had--was it Universal [Universal Companies, Inc.]--I'm sorry.  It is (unclear), it is Universal, right?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it's Universal, but he's, but he--I forget the name of his group--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but he became very active as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was--wanted to develop housing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So Mr. G's focus really was on his--the--his community projects, you know, bought a lot of property and really, you know, invested in the community, invested a lot into the community.  And that was really his focus.  I for- he grew up not too far from where the studio was.  And he really put a lot of energy, a lot of his energies into that.  So I can't say his focus was strictly music, but he's a producer and a music maker, so there was always that thing there with him.
Story_ID: 672581
Speaker 1: So the, yeah, the roles that were played, I was, you know, again the, more the piano player, melody maker.  Vik [Vikter Duplaix] is a, more of a beat maker, engineer with aspirations to be a vocalist, which he eventually went ahead and did, and a deejay.  He's a dee- he was a deejay also.  And Chauncey [Chauncey Childs] was the business guy that handled, you know, numbers.  We handled colors (laughter).  Chauncey handled numbers.  So we were doing remixes, records for independent artists.
Speaker 2: So who was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nothing, nothing, nothing mainstream.  We were just struggling and grinding and just doing whatever came about.
Speaker 2: So who were some of the independent artists that you--
Speaker 1: I can't (laughter)--
Speaker 2: You can't remember?
Speaker 1: I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what are your first breaks then?  That's what I, you know, what--when does it start?
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: And how long does that grind--does the grind go on for--it doesn't--how long does it go?
Speaker 1: The grind, the grind was a few years so--
Speaker 2: It wasn't five years then?
Speaker 1: It was five years.  Let's go back.  Sixty years from, sixteen years from today is--let's do the math (laughter).
Speaker 2: So we're 2014, so 2008, no, no, 1998.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998].
Speaker 2: Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Nineteen ninety-eight [1998] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So 1998, my big break happens.  Let's go back a few years to my good old friend, [HistoryMaker] Fatin Dantzler.  So Fatin is working with this group from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called the Jazzyfatnastees, who are signed by The Roots.  And I've met The Roots before, but I never really had a relationship with them.  So Fatin, Fatin calls me and says, "You know, they--I'm working with this group.  You should come down and check them out and maybe should work up some stuff together."  Cool.  And this time, I was, not only was I working in my situation but I was doing everything I could.  I was working with this songwriter, that songwriter.  I was playing in jazz clubs at the time.  I was playing at bars with the bartenders walking around with guns on.  And I was doing, you know, how much are they paying--twenty dollars?  (Claps) I'm there.  I was playing at various churches, you know, every Sunday, as well as my church [The New Testament Church of God, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  But every other chur- you know, I was just doing whatever I could.  I was teaching piano lessons also.  I was teaching little kids the basics of piano so, you know, I was really just on my grind, as well as studying and playing and practicing and doing as much as I could.  So, I went with Fatin to Roots, to Roots' house.  I started working with them, writing some things for Fatin, became friendly with, of course, with The Roots, especially with The Roots' manager, Rich Nichols [Richard Nichols].  And one day, I get a call from Rich, and he's saying, "Hey, we're working with a singer, and just stuff isn't working right.  Maybe you can come and help us out."  So I go down to the studio and I meet Erykah Badu.  So--oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, what was before that?  I think, I might have--I'm sorry, let's backtrack.  I think I was working on some Roots' things here periodically, too.  And there was a couple of other things here and there, which I can't really put my finger on.  But anyway, so I--let's flip back to that--by the--
Speaker 2: So Jill Scott and Musiq Soulchild come after The Roots?
Speaker 1: They come, yeah, they come after that.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I go over to the studio.  And me and Ahmir [Ahmir Khalib Thompson; Questlove] vibe with Erykah, and it (snaps fingers) clicks somewhat instantly.  And we came up with three song- two songs, two and a half songs (laughter), that go on her first album ['Baduizm'], which was a successful album.  So that--
Speaker 2: Which were the two and a half songs?
Speaker 1: The song was, (singing) "Watcha gonna do when you come for you," "Otherside of the Game,"' a song called "Sometimes."  And there was a skit, an interlude called "Pick Your Afro, Daddy, 'Cause It's Flat on One Side" [sic. "Afro (Freestyle Skit)"].  That was the first break, that was my first major break.  When that album came out and became a critical and commercial success, and (laughter) I'll never forget going into the room with Gamble [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble] and Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff].  And I remember being in the room working on something.  And Huff sticks his head (laughter) in the door and says this piece of primo information, which I'll never forget, I will never forget this image.  He sticks his head--"Hey, that Erykah Badu, Erykah Badu stuff, pretty good, that's good.  Pay your taxes."  I'll never, ever, ever forget that, to this day.  Of course, I thank God I've always taken care of that.  So many in my situation that haven't take care, taken care of that.  But when he said that, it stuck with me, so if I can say the one thing (laughter) that I've learned in this industry from Mr. Huff--"That's good, that's good.  Pay your taxes (points)."
Speaker 2: (Unclear) 'cause a lot of artists have been hurt that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's so, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 672582
Speaker 1: Tell me the creative process.  What is happening between you and Erykah Badu?  This, you know, 'cause you were, you went on to work with, you've worked with her quite a bit?
Speaker 2: I've worked with her on every album ever since, yeah, so we just clicked.  There's something that--my style of playing at the time and my style of playing now, just meshes with what she does.  You know, there's a certain style that she, that she is going for and wa- and likes to hear.  And it just so happened that thus--some of the style to the stuff that I played and listened to, you know, stuff--music that sort of melds soul and gospel and jazz and all of those, all of those things.  And I guess I was able to bring it out harmonically, and it was something that just clicked with her.  And we just connected that way.  And Ahmir [Ahmir Khalib Thompson; Questlove] is the same way.  He plays that kind of thing.  He just has an all-incapac- all--
Speaker 1: Encompassing.
Speaker 2: --encompassing style of playing where he has everything in the, in that thing.  So, it just happened to work where it just melded together and made, you know, made those, made those records.
Speaker 1: So (cough) what--who was managing her at the time?  Who brought--you're saying who--I thought you said that Fatin [HistoryMaker Fatin Dantzler] said come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.  We came in for the Jazzyfatnastees stuff and we worked on those things and a few other things.  But, and then later on, you know, after this relationship was made between myself and The Roots and Rich Nichols [Richard Nichols], he made the call and said, "Hey, why don't you come through and help us on this project?"
Speaker 1: And, so (cough) at that point--'cause she has a reputation (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, this is the first album ['Baduizm'] too, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is the first album so, but I'm saying, she has also progressed--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --herself, so you're saying wherever she goes, you're able to go--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or you go, sort of together (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because she's progressed and changed.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, not only her music, her look or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, her approach--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that type of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, the whole, whole way through.  But (clears throat) what--can you talk about though how you work with her?  Can you talk about that a little bit more and--
Speaker 2: It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you even come into a session with her and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just, you know, she, she wants to grab a mic [microphone] and listen to you play and sing along with what you're playing.  And you might come up with a chord progression that just feels a certain way, and she just start, keep playing it, and playing it, and she riffs over it and comes over that.  That's how it works.  And it was that kind of, that kind of thing in the studio, Sigma Studios [Sigma Sound Studios, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] actually, in David Ivory's room.  That's where The Roots were working out a lot of the time.  And I just happened to play this thing, (singing) and it--I was, I think it was strictly by accident (singing).  And it was like, wait a minute, what's that?  And Ahmir was playing, was like, "Yo, play that again?"  And she was like, "Yeah, play that again."  And we just went and put another section of the song and just cut it and that was the record.
Speaker 1: So which song was this?
Speaker 2: This is "Otherside of the Game," of the Game.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The "Otherside"?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sure, I love that song.
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: I love her music.  I do.  You know, it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what I, what I wanted to ask you--so where are her lyrics coming--at that point, if you--I mean you're describing the creative process.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So where do her lyrics come in?
Speaker 2: They're coming from inside her, the songs (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I mean, but you're saying, she's coming in, she's listening to the music.
Speaker 2: No, she's right there singing along and she's, you know--
Speaker 1: But she's coming in with the lyrics?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she's not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, she's like, free styling--
Speaker 1: Free- that's--
Speaker 2: --and is coming up with things.  And then, you know, later on, she'll actually put it all together.  But, you know, she's drawing from her life experiences and coming up with what she, what she writes.
Speaker 1: You know, this--I--this sounds really, and I'm not sure I understood that part of the creative process.  It sounds very jazz like.  I mean, more than--I didn't know that that was your creative process there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, it's--
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know, you know, I don't know enough about music, but it sounds very--I mean, very improvisational (unclear)--
Speaker 2: It really is.  It really, it's all improv.  And it speaks to, again me and musicians like me, and, or really creative singers and musicians that--if they have a catalog, a really big back catalog of music, and they can just bring it out.  If they have this ammo that they can bring out at any time, which I guess, I can somewhat say about myself, that things can be created at any time.  I always say I like to create just by putting my hands on the piano.  Whatever happens, happens.  It's not always the greatest thing.  It's not--doesn't, doesn't guarantee that there's going to be a number one smash hit across the world, but it might feel good.  And then you go and adapt to do certain things, but I, I always find it best not to over, overthink it.  Whatever comes out is, comes out naturally to me, feels the best.
Story_ID: 672583
Speaker 1: So (clears throat) you, so you have this critical hit.  That's pretty quick.  Now what year is this--that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is ninety--was it '98 [1998]?
Speaker 1: Let me see.
Speaker 2: I think I may be, I may not be right.
Speaker 1: I have--no, you're talking about 'Baduizm'?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is ninety--I think it's like between 1996 and 1997.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So there's that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yep, that--it had--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's when, in fact, it debuts on, it says on February 11, 1997.
Speaker 2: So we probably, we wrote that in '96 [1996] then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's what it says.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Clears throat) And how, how many songs are part of that?
Speaker 2: Three songs that--
Speaker 1: Three songs (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) on that album.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That you, you produced them?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Co-produced, along with--
Speaker 1: Co-produced.
Speaker 2: --with The Roots also.
Speaker 1: With The Roots, okay.  So (clears throat) then you, so really, okay.  So it's released on Kedar, is it Kedar Records?
Speaker 2: Kedar Records, which is through Motown [Motown Records], I think.
Speaker 1: Right, it was Motown.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's why I want to, I want to ask your thoughts because this is much, he's much quoted and much attributed to.  And that's Kedar Massenburg.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he's the one, it says, who came up with neo soul?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you agree with that?  You know, that--I mean, he came up with the term neo--
Speaker 2: He came up with the term, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 672584
Speaker 1: What is that like, to be part, I mean, when you start seeing--and even when you said, was it Gamble [HistoryMaker Kenny Gamble] or Huff [HistoryMaker Leon Huff] who came in that day and said, "Pay your taxes?"
Speaker 2: Mr. Huff, yeah.
Speaker 1: Mr. Huff, okay (laughter).  So when he says that, what--that put you in a different league.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, so how does the payment work in the music business when you have things like that? 'Cause you don't have an agent at this point, do you?
Speaker 2: You don't necessarily, you don't need an agent.  You get paid, you know, you get paid your royalties.  And I mean, you get paid your producer fee, which is one thing.  Then you get paid, you know, your pub- your publishing, your monies from your writers and publishing thing and so forth.  So, yeah when that, when the money came at that time, I didn't have a publishing deal, which would normally--the company, you sign a deal with a company that handles, you know, the distribution and collection of those monies.  So I get a check and it's like, oh, this is cool.  But at this time, too, I was working on other projects also.  You know, you only need one for the floodgates to sort of open up.  So we worked quite a few different things that we started working so, you know, things were starting to be generated.
Speaker 1: So do you mind me asking what that check looked like?
Speaker 2: It was okay.  It was a, it was a cut, it was a few--
Speaker 1: A thousand?
Speaker 2: It was a few--there was a, there was a comma and, so (laughter)--
Speaker 1: It was a com- was it a comma and four or a comma and three--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was a comma and a couple--I can't, I don't want to say.
Speaker 1: Oh, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: But it was, it was, it was, it was well enough, it was good enough that I think I was talking, I called Vik [Vikter Duplaix].  And Vik was at lunch with his girl at the time.  (Gestures) I said, "Yo, this music thing is pretty, is okay, man."  He said, "Why?"  And I said, "I got paid such and such."  And he said, "Oh, cool."  He said, "Wait a minute, what?"  I said, he said, "Oh, I thought you said," this small--much smaller number, which was, wow, this is pretty good too, oh, wow, this is really good, so it was--
Speaker 1: So you don't want to say how much?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a lot.
Speaker 1: I want to (unclear) history, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was between fifty [$50,000] and a hundred [$100,000] (laughter).
Speaker 1: That is some--that's a lot of money (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's okay.
Speaker 1: (Makes sound).
Speaker 2: It's okay.
Speaker 1: I mean for you to start out.  I'm sorry, okay.  I see, but did you, so are you still learning though about the business like that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay--
Speaker 1: I'm still--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm still learning about the business.
Speaker 2: About the business because, you know, even with you saying about the publishing, you know, and the producing--'cause people in the older generation, a lot of times that, you know, they were, they were taken advantage of for long periods of time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: And I'm told that your generation learned from that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had to learn through those mistakes.  And thank god, that I didn't have to deal with any trash.  You know, I didn't have to deal with anybody that was out to get me in those experiences.  You know, again I've worked with Rich [Richard Nichols].  And Rich was totally above board and looked out for me, as well as his relationship with dealing with Chauncey [Chauncey Childs] 'cause they're working hand in hand with putting the business things together.  And I've always appreciated my relationship with Rich like that.  He's always looked out for me, even though I, when I wasn't a Root--working with The Roots, you know.  A lot of management kind of just look out for their party (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and not worry about--so Rich has always taken care of me.  So when I actually became into The Roots' fold, it was, you know, it's just normal and natural.
Story_ID: 672585
Speaker 1: Let me--and I want to understand your relationship with The Roots 'cause I--so is that the beginning, and you stay with them 'cause I think sometime--are you in and out of them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: And see that's what I didn't--because you're now there but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I, you know, when I look at their history and who went and left the group (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and everything, you know.  So tell me the--how that relationship was.
Speaker 2: The relationship again grew out of me when I came in and started working with them--
Speaker 1: With the--
Speaker 2: --through Fatin [HistoryMaker Fatin Dantzler] with the Jazzies [Jazzfatnastees], to work with Erykah [Erykah Badu] and then to all of these other projects, including Roots' albums themselves.  I came on, I would always call myself a stem, and not a Root (laughter), you know.  I would, I was around for a lot of the albums, worked on a lot of the albums.  I would tour with them periodically, maybe sub [substitute], do certain things with them so I was always around but I wasn't officially a member.  So I pretty much came on board once--when the TV show ['Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'] came about.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this, this is pretty--
Speaker 2: This is pretty recent (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) recent.
Speaker 2: Well, five years ago, yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, five--
Speaker 2: But I was, again I was always--
Speaker 1: But you were always around.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't like, you know, who's this new guy?  Hi, I'm James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], you know, I was always there, so it was just a natural thing.  It was almost like, we might as well formalize this 'cause we've been doing this, you know, so.
Story_ID: 672586
Speaker 1: So how does, how do the--what I want--how does the Soul- Soulquarians come, come about because that's also a very--I mean, that's an interesting--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, all the--
Speaker 1: --collection of--I mean, 'cause you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the only thing, there's only, there's--in reality, there's four Soulquarians--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --myself, Questlove [Ahmir Khalib Thompson], D'Angelo and James Yancey, rest in peace, J Dilla.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: And it was a joke one day at the studio, Electric Lady [Electric Lady Studios, New York, New York].  We were sitting there.  And we were saying, we all made mention that all our birthdays are around the same a- we're all Aquarians.  And the joke ran around, "Oh, we're the soul Aquarians" (laughter), "Yeah, Soulquarians," slap a five, and "Yep, yep, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."  And it just grew out of--the media caught wind of it, and anybody that was singing a song with the roads in it and a soulful sound was always--oh, he's a Soulquarian, oh, she's a Soulquarian, you know.  I always knew what the origins were.  I was there for origins of that word.  And I, you know, it didn't bother me or anything.  It became what it was--cool, but I know that was the four of us.
Speaker 1: Right, because I'm telling you what they, what I read--I mean, it's a lot bigger than that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because--but you said D'Angelo was there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at the beginning.  Then they have Erykah [Erykah Badu].  They have Bilal.  They have Mos Def, Common--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Q-Tip.
Speaker 2: Well, there was a move- at that time, the movement of the soul mu- soul music was popular, and you'd hear it on the radio--so cool.  I guess they had the, the neo soul thing came about and then they threw this tag line on there.  But it--I don't think it, it was definitely not fair to everybody because everybody was doing their own thing.  Everybody doesn't do everything together, you know.  How dare you say Q-Tip was birthed out of this?  Q-Tip and the Native Tongues were doing things way before we were doing, you know--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: They influenced me, you know what I mean?  So it was, it, it--things got a little messy with the title.  I guess, whenever you put titles on things that aren't supposed to be titled, it can get a little messy.  So again from what I know and what I believe, it came out of the joke of us all having--being of the Aquarian sign.
Story_ID: 672587
Speaker 1: When did you come to work with D'Angelo?  That's what--I mean, 'cause I, you know, I know that I, I think I heard you, you know, speak about how, with him, that his voice marries well with, with piano, I think you said.
Speaker 2: Oh, his voice marries well with any (laughter)--he's one of the greats.  So I met D.   He was in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], actually when we were working with Erykah [Erykah Badu].  He came down to Philly and was just hanging out.  I think he worked on some records with The Roots also.  And I remember a jam session we had, where it was myself and D'An- and Ahmir [Ahmir Khalib Thompson; Questlove] playing drums and Erykah and some other people around singing.  And I don't know where the tapes are, but this was amazing.  And then I was like, what is going here?  You know, I'd known this was D'Angelo from the 'Brown Sugar' album--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and so forth.  But I didn't realize his, his capabilities as a musician.  He's absolutely amazing.  So it was like, oh, man, what, and again my, my computer was like, spinning.  And I was like, (gestures) I'm learning this, I'm learning this, I'm learning this and learning this.  And, you know, we became friendly, and I did some dates with him.  At the end of the Brown Sugar tour, he did a couple dates here and there that I went on the road with him.  And then when he worked on the 'Voodoo' album, him and Ahmir, they did a lot of the stuff together.  I was fortunate to hang in the studio a few times with them and come and hang and jam with them on a few things and jam with them on a few more things.  And, you know, went on the road of the, on the 'Voodoo' tour.  Actually was involved in the writing of "Chicken Grease," the song on that album, which coincidentally came out of a session Common--one--was work- Electric Lady was the, Electric Lady Studios in New York [New York] were the hub, it was the hub for a lot of what was going on.  Erykah could be in one room.  D'Angelo, Common or Mos Def and Talib [Talib Kweli] and Bilal--there was a lot of that.  So there was a lot of going on.  Everybody was running in each other's rooms and playing music and jamming.  And D'Angelo was going to do--was doing a song for, for Common.  And we just started messing around, and "Chicken Grease" came out of there.  We just started playing this riff.  Again our hands just went on the keyboards and, oh, what's this?  And up--it was late like, four, five [o'clock] in the morning (laughter), and I remember taking a taxi after the studio--taking a taxi to a hotel.  It was daylight.  And D'Angelo pulls up with Ahmir in his, in his car and said, "Yo, go get in the car."  And we sit in the back.  And he's playing the song and D's like, "I need to somehow--Common can't have this" (laughter).  He said, "I got to have--I'm putting this on my album.  I need something like this."
Speaker 1: So you had recorded it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we recorded it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So you lis--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we just listened to the playback, I guess, on the CD [compact disc].
Speaker 1: So that's what I'm trying to understand.  So when you're just riffing, you're recording?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so he kept us on.  We did another song for the--for Commons' album (laughter).  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you--now what period of time though is all this--I'm just trying to understand again, when Electric Studios--what time did that, does that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was all the late '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: This is all--
Speaker 2: This is, this is af- this is after 'Baduizm' had hit and then subsequently started working on all these other projects.  So late '90s [1990s], you know, and then whatever time 'Voodoo' came out and 'Like Water for Chocolate,' Common's album came out.
Speaker 1: Right, Common's album.  That's all but--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: This is, everything is like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's all around the same, yeah, right in that same area.  So I don't exactly know the specific dates, but it was all in that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that same--
Story_ID: 672588
Speaker 1: And that, and, and, and shortly after that, I think he and Erykah [Erykah Badu] became an item.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They became a couple, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they--
Speaker 2: And that was on the, going into the next album, 'Electric Circus.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: And they--he talks, he was so hurt.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with his knitted pants (laughter).  I tease him.  Common's a good friend, and I still tease him 'cause he was wearing knitted hats and knitted pants.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm like, c'mon, man (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, you know, what?  It's interesting.  I don't know what website it was, but it was showing people Erykah's been involved with (laughter).
Speaker 2: And they all had (gestures) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --they all had, all these, all of them had--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You're both on the (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry, okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They always had--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: That knitted hat was the clique.  It was the clue.  It's like, oh, you're wearing a hat?  Okay, I got you (laughter).
Speaker 2: That was almost cute because it showed, you know, before and after.  And then there's Common, he's got (laughter)--oh, she has, she has powers (laughter).  I don't know her, but she has powers.
Story_ID: 672589
Speaker 1: So (clears throat), but also wasn't it, is it, J Dilla--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dilla was around for those things also, and he definitely influenced everything (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And didn't he, he--I had read that he did the main beat for 'Water for Chocolate' ['Like Water for Chocolate'].  Is that right?
Speaker 2: He worked, yeah, he worked on most of that album.  That's actually when I first met him.  By then me and Common had worked, you know, I worked on an album before 'Like Water for Chocolate' that Common had put out.  I've worked on a song ["Retrospect for Life"] with him with Lauryn Hill, actually a song with Lauryn Hill that was produced by No I.D. and myself.  And then Common--to work--worked on the 'Like Water for Chocolate' album.  I was working with Questlove [Ahmir Khalib Thompson] a lot and just being around, and Common thought it would be a good idea for me to work on some things with J Dilla or come in and work on some things.  So I flew to Detroit [Michigan] and that was my first time meeting Dilla, and it was just like the genius of, of J Dilla.  He truly was gifted, like immense, immensely gifted.  So went there and worked, and worked in his basement studio on a, on a few records that made on the album.  Yeah, and it was just--I learned so much.  Again, just--
Speaker 1: Now when you say you learned much--so explain.  And I'm wondering also what are your different influences because you seem to be--you're picking up from everything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: --and I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: --I try and learn from everything.  You know, I've--thank God for the aptitude of me being--having the hunger to learn from everything.  So, you know, somebody like Dilla, just his approach to music, it's not the--okay, we're going to learn a lesson.  You learn a, I'm sorry, learn a instrument, and take lessons and learn how to play such and such, and such and such.  He just had this grasp of music in its totality as a, as a deejay and producer.  He would listen to records and know how to manipulate that and make it into something completely different, which has been done by producers and beat makers in the past.  But his take on it and his rhythmic sense, the way he programmed things and then his sense of how to sonically approach it, was just breaking--it broke new ground.  It was like, this had never been done to this level before.  And it influenced everything (laughter), it influenced everything.  Everything you hear today is influenced.  If you listen to--I mean, there's the mainstream stuff that you hear on the radio.  Of course, that's going to sound a certain way, but anything that's interesting musically, from the jazz thing, the way, the way jazz feels now, where everything that jazz, what jazz is, which is all influenced by hip hop, is coming from Dilla, you know.  And you listen to, and Glasper will be the first one to tell you.  Rob Glasper [Robert Glasper] and art- and a lot of the Blue Note [Blue Note Records] artists that are doing things that feel a certain way, that's all Dilla stuff.  So he's definitely one of the, one of my major influences.  Questlove will tell you how we influenced his drum playing.  You speak to, you speak to, and you speak to--I saw a fleet--I'm sorry, I saw a tweet from Flea, the bass player for the Red Hot Chili Peppers not too long ago.  And he's saying J Dilla is his favorite hip hop artist, you know.  So he's--across the board, he's influenced so many, so many, so it was a, it was definitely a pleasure and an honor to meet him and work with him and also to become a friend of him.  So, you know, we'd--he didn't really communicate a lot on the phone.  But the few times that we spoke and again hanging out at his house, I would say he was my brother and was, you know, I miss him dearly 'cause he was, he was definitely that--a goodhearted person, a really, really good, warmhearted person once you got to really get to know him, but the music, and the musical genius on top of that, so.
Story_ID: 672590
Speaker 1: All of that's coming together and influencing you.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All of it?
Speaker 2: All of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what about--and maybe he, 'cause he just died but, you know, let's say, Frankie Knuckles, the house music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is any of that influenc- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Totally, totally.  Now Frankie's thing was extremely soulful also, you know.  A lot of the house music parties and things, you know, there's a certain repetitiveness to the music.  But at the core it's real, extremely soulful so that kind of thing is definitely part of me.  I grew up, you know, that's what the music of my Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] days and, you know, those days in the, in the, in the early '90s [1990s] or so forth and late '80s [1980s], or whatever.  That's definitely part of my musical knowledge that I grew up listening to so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I guess we had a really good--we interviewed him actually, got a really good interview with him but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he wasn't (unclear).  I don't know why he died.  Do you know why he died?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: But anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 672591
Speaker 1: So you've talked about Ahmir a lot.  You know, who, you know, how did Ahmir get Questlove?  How does he--where did Questlove come from Ahmir? And what is his real name?
Speaker 2: Ahmir, Ahmir Thompson [Ahmir Khalib Thompson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ahmir, okay.
Speaker 2: I think the name came out of, I think, and it's online.  There's--we did an interview for the Jimmy Fallon show ['The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'].  And he gives the origin of his name, which I forget (laughter), but I think it came from Brother Question.  And then it turned into like, the hip hop of having a surname of Love or -ski, you know, and it just turned into Question Love or Questlove.  That's how that came about, but he gives it more in detail description, which I don't know and then actually don't care to know.  I'm joking (laughter).
Story_ID: 672592
Speaker 1: So let's go into--what was your role with 'Voodoo'?  Talk about D'Angelo's 'Voodoo' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Voodoo,' again I--
Speaker 1: --can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I worked on that--the song "Chicken Grease" on the album and a couple other things that didn't make the album.  And then I went on the road, on the, on the 'Voodoo' tour [The Voodoo World Tour], which was interesting because it was the hottest tour of that time back then, you know, based off of that--the "How Does It Feel" ["Untitled (How Does It Feel?)"] video and so forth.  And people could look and say oh it was a popcorn thing and cheesy because he showed his abs--but musically the musicians on that tour, oh, amazing.  It was like, oh, it was incredible to be playing with the level of musicians that played on that tour.  Pino Palladino, one of the world's best bass players (gestures), (gestures) Roy Hargrove, Russell Gunn, Frank Lacy, (gestures) Jacques Schwarz-Bart.  (Gestures) Jef Lee Johnson, who--one of the greatest guitar players, rest his soul, he passed away not too long ago.  But he was one of--my big brother and one of my inspirations, and I learned a lot from him as a Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] legend.  So being able, being on stage, again Afro--I mean Quest--I call him Afro--Questlove [Ahmir Khalib Thompson] on drums, and it was just the funkiest, surprisingly churchiest, kind of thing, you know, Anthony Hamilton singing background, Shelby [Shelby Johnson] singing (laughter).  It was just, it was incredible.
Speaker 1: So who put together that tour?  Who was--do you know who the, the record label was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The record label--Alan Leeds was the tour manager at that--the world famous Alan Leeds, who has managed, managed James Brown and Prince.  So this is almost like the same legacy, you know, same kind of artist.  So Alan was, was the guy and took--learned so much on Alan, just all the stories and knowledge that he has, so it was amazing, it was amazing.
Speaker 1: And that was in, that was two thou- no, 2000, 'Voodoo' came out but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the tour was after that, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or part of that?  Okay.
Story_ID: 672593
Speaker 1: And then (clears throat)--now what about--so did you work on 'Mama's Gun?'
Speaker 2: I, see--that's the thing.  I had left the tour [The Voodoo World Tour] after a few months.  They were going to go to Europe.  And there was some things, and I had to leave 'cause I had to work on 'Mama's Gun,' this album.  So I had to go back in with, with Erykah [Erykah Badu].  And I executive produced the album with her, so I was involved in the whole aspect of that album.
Speaker 1: So when you say the whole aspect, you're talking about, so what are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just musically, just musically, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Just musically, okay, okay.  So basically at this point, you're saying that really she's only--is she at that point only going to produce if you're producing?  I mean, were--
Speaker 2: I don't want to say it was like that but--
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: --it, that's what it became.  You know, she was like, I need you to help on, help on this album.  I was like, I got to get over, I got to go, guys.  And at that time, I really honestly, even--as much fun as it was, you know, I realize that, at that time, the tour life really, it got old for me.  You know, I--living out of a suitcase is hard.  And, you know, if I don't have to do it, I don't really want to do it, you know.  So, you know, being (laughter)--I think I, when I was younger, I remember seeing a friend of mine who used to tour with all of the groups.  And, you know, he said, "Come over to the house and work us some music."  And I went to his mom's house, and we went in the basement--something wrong with that picture there for me, you know (laughter).  I was like, okay, you've traveled the world.  And then we're going to work on music in your mom's house.  I'm cool (laughter), you know, I was like, okay.  And then we figured it's got to be--what's that--how--what's the next step up in the food chain?  And, you know, the writing and the production things, which I enjoyed a lot--I won't say, I enjoyed it as equally, but I was like, you know, I want to do more of that.
Speaker 1: So you really decided early on that you wanted to be a, more of a creative--I mean, you wanted to--you--really what you're talking about, you want more control--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in some respects.
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're allowed to be creative.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Control, that's, that's a good word--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for what we become later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, huh?
Speaker 2: I said, that's a good word for what may come later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, so, but in any event--but also 'Like Water for Chocolate' comes out in 2000.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we'd worked on that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're doing all three of those projects the same, the same--you're on tour, you do 'Mama's Gun' and 'Like Water for Chocolate' all in 2000 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, did all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you are burning up hot.
Speaker 2: We were all--yeah, work- yeah, we were working hard, but it wasn't, it wasn't work.  It was just, it was what, doing what comes naturally was fun.
Speaker 1: But what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can honestly say that we weren't--I don't know, I can't speak for everybody.  I don't know if everybody was--for me, I don't know if I was making--trying to make records per se or just having fun making music.  You know what I mean--just, it was just the aspects of just playing some stuff and coming up with some cool stuff.  And, oh, it became a cool record (laughter), cool (laughter), you know what I mean?  So it was, it was fun, it was easy.  It wasn't, you know, like a thought out process.  I'm sure there was a lot of thought into it, but from my point of view, it was like, I'm just doing what comes naturally.
Story_ID: 672594
Speaker 1: But 'Mama's Gun,' it went platinum, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was fun.  It was, it almost killed me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now what do you mean by that because your role in it was more, it was--
Speaker 2: It almost (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just talk about it 'cause I asked you, I mean, she's known--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I shouldn't say--but she's known as being a little difficult.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: She eats up men and spits them out (laughter).
Speaker 2: Erykah [Erykah Badu], Erykah is like my sister.  She--and, but calls me her studio husband 'cause we argue like (laughter) husband and wife.  That's what her nickname is--my studio husband.  But Electric Lady [Electric Lady Studios, New York, New York] is three rooms--A room, B room and a C room a couple floors up.  So, we were working in those three rooms and another studio uptown, Sony Studios [Sony Music Studios, New York, New York].  We were working a four room--for the last month of the album, it was a deadline, so we were working overtime trying to get everything done.  We were mixing in a couple of rooms, still caught up with music.  Erykah was still writing lyrics.  The label was on--down--Kedar label [sic. Motown Records] were breathing fire down her back, which was breathing fire down my back.  So eventually I was dealing with the label like, trying to shield her.  I think I spent--I'll forget how long I stayed in the studio without going to the hotel.  I had a full beard.  I looked like--Common said I looked like Tom Hanks in 'Castaway' (laughter).  No sleep, you know, just all of that and I remember one session.  The top half of my body stopped working (laughter) from here up, just stopped working (laughter).  And I had to go to the doctor, and they thought I had a stroke or some kind of stress attack (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, you're serious about this--
Speaker 2: I'm dead, I'm dead serious (laughter).  Like I said, the album--everything I think of 'Mama's Gun,' I laugh and say, "Yeah, that album almost killed me."  So I just had a stress attack.  It wasn't a stroke.  They put on the EKG [electrocardiogram] machine and all of that.  I checked out, but it was just--I checked out fine.  It was, it was fine.  It was just a stress attack, and my body just shut down for a few like, yo, you got, you got to chill, dude.   And it just turned out fine.  I don't--I'll never forget, we finished the album.  The label sent this giant bouquet of the most beautiful orange roses and roses in the studio, some, some champagne and stuff.  And we finished the last mix, and they went to the mix--I went up to the master lab with her.  Actually, I grabbed a couple of bottles of champagne, put it in my bag, and we went to the master lab.  And I was like, "All right, you guys are, we're cool, right?"  And I had jumped in the car, and the car drove me back to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And then I think I slept for a couple days and I woke up in a few days.  And I found out they spent another two days or three days fixing more stuff.  And I was like, whew, I'm glad I wasn't (laughter) around.  They've just--she wanted to do some more stuff with--in the mastering, you know.  I should have been around but I was, I was no good.  But that's the control that she wants over thing.  And she believes what she believes in so she wanted it to be what she wants it to be.  You know, so I don't blame her.  I want to say, she's--I'd say she's crazy, but I wouldn't say she's crazy.  I'd say it jokingly that she's crazy, but she's not crazy.  She just knows what she wants and she just wants--fights for that license to create what she, what she believes in.
Speaker 1: So when the, when the studio sent the champagne and the roses, was that as a motivation--
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: --or they had heard--
Speaker 2: They were like, oh, we're done.  And I was like, cool, I'm done, so we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So they had heard it and they were pleased?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they--all along, they knew that--
Speaker 1: What was--
Speaker 2: --that everything was great.  But it was just these little fine, like fine tuning things that she wanted to add and take away.  But overall the things were still great, so. It's cool, I remember flying from Atlanta [Georgia] to Philadelphia carrying--and this was before Pro Tools, I mean it was still Pro- but I think we were working on two inch tape and carrying two inch tape through the airport and saying, "No, we can't put this through the machine, no," and like, having all the TSA [Transportation Security Administration] agents, whatever, coming over and me arguing like, "No, we have to check it another way," and so forth and doing that, coming up and cutting strings and then flying back to Atlanta and this, and flying to New York [New York] and doing whatever.  It was a great experience.  It was a lot of--I wouldn't have traded, I wouldn't trade that experience for anything else.
Speaker 1: So, that's all, that's all, like--see what you, remember what you said when you were trying to think of dates, you said, sixteen years, go back sixteen years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is two years after.  I mean, you are burning up at this point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.
Speaker 2: Yeah, hey, thank god, you know, just opportunities come, and I think I was ready to--to do what I did, you know.
Story_ID: 672595
Speaker 1: So (clears throat) let me, so, and what I have in 2001 is '1st Born Second'?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Is that Bilal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Bilal?
Speaker 2: Bilal, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And then The Roots--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'Phrenology?'
Speaker 2: 'Phrenology,' yeah.
Speaker 1: And then Common with 'Electric Circus' but that does just okay, right?  That just does okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his most misunderstood album (laughter).  Yeah, it was just funny.  He wanted to go in a different direction and do some things and, you know, we went along with him (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But is it--now have they broken up at that point when he does Phrenolo- isn't it around that time that they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Electric Circus?'
Speaker 1: No, yeah, 'Electric Circus.'  Did they, I think they broke--I don't know.  I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, you know, I stayed away from all that stuff.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: You do you, y'all do you, I'm cool.  I mean, they're my friends and, you know, they do their thing but, you know, as good friends should do, you stay out of other friends' business so, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, but that's pretty good because you guys all know each other.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't want to tell them--and it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what I'm saying, and you sort of going in and out and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it's all love, and we're all family, you know, but I--you do your thing, you know, I'm cool.
Speaker 1: Wow, that's--
Speaker 2: I'm never, I'm not going to intrude on anybody's, in anybody's thing.
Speaker 1: That's right, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I advise other people (laughter) not to do, to do the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's good, that's good, that's good.  No, that's good, 'cause maybe that's guys.  Okay.
Story_ID: 672596
Speaker 1: So let's (pause)--what about 'Love of My Life' ['Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)']?
Speaker 2: 'Love of My Life,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she'd--she started working on that song in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with Raphael Saadiq.  They came together, I think they, you know, got the call to do a song for the movie soundtrack, 'Brown Sugar.'  And they started working on something, but (unclear)--Raphael had a certain style at the time, which was very quartet, gospel quartet guitar.  I mean, Raphael is an amazing talent.  I don't want to pigeon hole in one thing, but I think that song sounded like that a bit.  And Erykah [Erykah Badu] wanted it to feel a little bit more like Erykah stuff.  So it was like, "Hey, James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], can you come help me and that?"  So I came in on the song and played some things, took away some things, edited some things and sort of put it all together, you know.  Rashad "Ringo" Smith [Rashad Smith], a friend of mine, came through.  And we programmed some, some things, and, and it just--that's where the song came about, you know.  It was just that kind of thing, just put it all together, and it became a hit, became a success, I should say.  Yeah (laughter), simple (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  But most times when you're working together, are these sessions--how long do they last?  You talk about the--I mean, is it a matter of days or it's a week--
Speaker 2: This thing, I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you're coming back and forth?
Speaker 2: This thing was a couple days.  This song was simple, so it was a couple days but it varies.  There's been such, there have been sessions where it's a few days continuously.  You don't see a hotel room.  And some things could be a couple of hours, you know.  For example, if you want to talk about Bilal's--song we did on Bilal, "Sometimes," and we started this song just by playing, again just the kind of thing--we just started jamming.  And seven minutes later, we have a song.  I come in the next day, and the lyrics are written and performed.  Next day, Pino Palladino plays on it.  The song was done in (snaps fingers)--it was just like that.  Some things just happen like that.  That's what it is, yeah.  And some things are a little more of a struggle, but those songs were just simple.
Story_ID: 672597
Speaker 1: So what else around this--like the, you know, like 2004, 2005 are, you know, are happening around that time?  What else?  'Cause Dilla [J Dilla], he dies in 2006?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, and I just have blood disease [thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura], but what, what else, I mean are lots of people at this point coming to you?  And are you, you know, how are you vetting your projects because, you know, there are others.  That's what I'm wondering.  When are you working with--you mentioned him earlier.  (Mumbles) What's wrong with me?  J, with a J, you know who I'm talking about.  Darn it.
Speaker 2: Not J Dilla.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, not J Dilla.  No, no we haven't mentioned it, darn it.  What is wrong with me?  Who is it?  I know her, and why am I drawing a blank?  Jill Scott.
Speaker 2: Jill Scott.
Speaker 1: When are you working with Jill Scott 'cause you said that had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometime in that, in that time period, we're working with Jill and--
Speaker 1: Now is Jill, at that point that you're working with her, is she with--
Speaker 2: Touch of Jazz.
Speaker 1: She's, oh, she's with Touch of--
Speaker 2: She starts off working with A Touch of Jazz.  The first album ['Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Volume 1'] that she did was primarily Touch of Jazz.  And I did a few things with Jeff [DJ Jazzy Jeff] with her.  And I--Touch of Jazz was a collection of other production groups together that were insanely talented, you know, these are all my brothers that I grew up with.  And they did a fantastic job on, not only her, but with Musiq Soulchild and a bunch of other parties (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause he--we had worked with Musiq--I've been trying to interview him.  By the way, if you see him, he's been promising for years, just about like, he--but, so all of that's com- but see, a lot of that's coming out of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of that stuff coming from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: --Philly.
Speaker 2: There's a, there's a lot that's the--I guess, in those periods, the Black Lily, and like other places in Philly, where you could play were happening.  You know, there's a spot named Wilhelmina's [Wilhelmina's Bar, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was more--where the Black Lily was more like the artists performing and the band's playing behind them.  This was more the musicians being free to do their thing.  And I remember a night in, I remember a night at Wilhelmina's, where I don't even know how many people were in the room.  It was a small room.  It might have been twenty people there, but it was a bunch of the guys from the International [Philadelphia International Records] players and Ahmir [Ahmir Khalib Thompson; Questlove], Black Thought, Common, Bilal, Anthony Hamilton.  I think, Jill Scott was there, too, just jamming.  Could you imagine the price of that ticket (laughter) today or could you imagine a fee--the price of that ticket at those artists'--the heyday?  So, you know those--that kind of thing was happening all the time.  And musicians would just go and play.  It was a magical time in the, in the city.  The Black Lily was on fire.  It would be crowded every night.  Fatin [HistoryMaker Fatin Dantzler] and Kindred [Kindred the Family Soul] would perform, and all of these different artists would perform.  And you look around, and there were quite a few celebrities that would come into town just for this 'cause the energy was in the city.  And all the artists were coming down to work with all the different producers that were doing things--myself, again the guys from Touch of Jazz, The Roots, you know.  Again I--it was separate but it was the same thing.  I'd work on things separately.  They work on things separately.  They would work on things together.  So, and I'd work with everybody, and everybody would just, it was just like a big table everybody was just feasting off of.  So it was, it was a really cool time in the Philly area.
Speaker 1: And then you're talking about late 1990s--no, even mid-1990s to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --mid-2000s.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That peri- almost like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a ten year period.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now Black Lily burned, right?  It--
Speaker 2: The actual--
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Black Lily was the name of the party.  The build- the name of the club was the Five Spot [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And the Five Spot did burn down some years ago.
Speaker 1: And the Black Lily was the name of the--
Speaker 2: The actual event.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They would have all these artists come in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.  I don't think I under- I don't think I ever really understood that.  So you're saying when you were working with Jill Scott, she had not gone with--what, I know him.  She had not gone with the new record label, or had she?  You know--
Speaker 2: I know who you're talking--
Speaker 1: California--god, what is wrong with me?  Probably, I--oh, wait, hold on, I should--let's see, I know who the father is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] Steve McKeever (laughter).
Speaker 1: Steve McKeever, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's, that's when she was working with him for that Hidden Beach--
Speaker 1: Hidden Beach Recordings, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hidden Beach, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: We were still through A Touch of Jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So Touch of Jazz--
Speaker 2: Was a production company.
Speaker 1: --was the production company.  And then they were, they were hired by Hidden Beach who was managing her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, well, no.  She's the, she had started out working with A Touch of Jazz and created--recorded her album ['Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Volume 1'], which attracted Hidden Beach to the--
Speaker 1: Okay (clears throat).  And then that--okay, but then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But I don't think--they had a falling out too, but it's in one place--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) or something.  Okay, you don't get (unclear)--okay, I got, I got--James [HistoryMaker James Poyser] does not get involved in anyone else's business (unclear).
Speaker 2: Nope, not me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 672598
Speaker 1: So (clears throat) the other--let me see, hold on, I want to--so what about Keyshia Cole and Lauryn Hill and Musiq Soulchild?
Speaker 2: So a lot of those--I think Keyshia was later on.  It was, that actually was a record I worked on with producer and hip hop legend, Kwame.  And he brought that to the table, and we worked on the song, and she cut it.  Musiq was a similar thing.  He was A Touch of Jazz artist that was signed through another, to another tour, to a label [Def Soul Recordings; Def Jam Recordings], so they did that.  Ivan [Ivan Barias] and, Carvin Haggins and Ivan, Carvin and Ivan, they, they did the majority of the album ['Juslisen'], along with Dre [Andre Harris] and Vidal [Vidal Davis], and D [Darren Henson] and Keith [Keith Pelzer], these are all production groups inside of A Touch of Jazz.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So again Touch of Jazz had a stable of different artists that they would work with and, you know, sign them.  And when they got signed, put the albums out.  Lauryn Hill, I worked with, initially when we worked on a song with--on Commons' album ['One Day It'll All Make Sense'], "Retrospect for Life."  And when she was cutting, when she was doing the 'Miseducation' ['The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'] album, she called me up and asked me if I would be able, would come through and work with her on it.  So I worked on that album, worked quite a bit on the album, on (laughter) pretty much most or all of that album.
Speaker 1: That's "Superstar," right?  Is it 'Super'--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was she like to work with, and how was the relationship different than (laughter), Erykah [Erykah Badu]?  Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was, it was, there was quite a bit of controversy (laughter).
Speaker 1: So can you tell me?  You can't?  Why?  C'mon.
Speaker 2: There was a lawsuit and stuff involved and all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, I see.  You guys didn't get along too well, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, it was, it was great working with her.
Story_ID: 672599
Speaker 1: So James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], let me ask you, you had said that--in one interview, which is the short interview, that the most difficult recording session you had or--was with Common and, no, it was, I think it was a redo of Com- it was a Mary, Mary J. Blige (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It, and it was, it really wasn't that--it's a, it's--it was more of a joke (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a joke because she--
Speaker 2: It was more of a joke.  It was--Common on the 'Electric Circus' album did a song, "Come Close,"' with Mary Blige, Mary J. Blige singing it.  It was a song that Pharrell [Pharrell Williams]--The Neptunes produced, and he was doing a remix.  And he asked her to come through.  I worked on the music and asked him to come through for the vocal session.  And I think Mary was in town for like a day.  She was on the, she was on the road or something and was tired.  And she sang this one part (laughter).  And I said, I just was like, "Okay, cool, yeah, let's try that again."  And she was like, "No."  And I was like, (makes sound), let me go to the back of the room and not say anything (laughter).  I mean, it just speaks to Mary being--have this stature that she was, as the artist at the, at the--I mean, she still is--and I guess I was a little too overeager.  And I mean what she did was fine.  But I guess, my ears wanted to hear something else but, you know, it was not to be.  So it wasn't, it wasn't like she was being evil or anything.  I don't want to be misconscrewed--misconstrued to think that she was being evil, but she was just being Mary J. Blige (laughter).  And she's, Mary's always been, whenever I see her, it's always love and she's always cool and gracious, so I mean it was nothing.  It was no bad drama but it was that period of let me put you into place.
Story_ID: 672600
Speaker 1: But what is your--besides what we were talking off camera, what is your hardest recording session that you've ever had, was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I don't, can't--
Speaker 1: --or most st--
Speaker 2: Most?
Speaker 1: Like it was, it was hard, like you talk a- you know, when you talk about (cough) Erykah [Erykah Badu], and even the time that you, you know, you, you know, you said your body got--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, whatever.  You still--what you produced was very prolific.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But is there a time when it just has not worked with the artist (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Been too many of those times.  There's been quite a few times of--and you wouldn't even know the artists because their albums didn't come out.  There's quite a few artists that get signed, and you work on the stuff, and it doesn't come out, or stuff could come out, and you never hear about it.  I don't know any names.  I can't say any names offhand but that happens a lot, you know, when it's forced, when it's not as natural as it can be when you work with somebody.  It's cool to collaborate with people and when the collaboration is right, you know, something cool happens from it.  It doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be a major hit, but it's a cool ex- writing experience, a cool working experience.  And the, hopefully the music is great and timeless but then there's times when it just doesn't click.  And you, you know, you're struggling in the studio trying to find a certain thing.  I remember, and I, and I cannot say the artist's name, I cannot say the artist's name.  I was working with a particular artist, and they, unbeknownst to me, they were, they were planning, they--the reason they wanted to use me was for me to bring somebody--another named artist in as a, as a--they would do--they're trying to use me to get through to another artist.  And I didn't realize it at the time.  And they kept saying, "When is So and So coming, when is So and So coming?"  And I was like, "I don't really know" (laughter).  "Why we're humping on this?  Let's do what we're doing."  It's like, "But this is the whole thing.  We're supposed to get So and So."  And it's like, "All right, c'mon, well, let's just make some music."  And it was like, "Go ahead, what you got?"  And it was just the pressure of what you got (snaps fingers), you know (laughter), dance for me (laughter).  You know, that kind of thing was, you know, nothing came about from there, you know.  And I thought, you know, I thought the person really hated me for a while after that.  I felt kind of embarrassed that nothing came out of it.  But eventually, you know, the relationship between us was fine.  But, you know, those kind of things happen.  What I hated the most and I try not to do anymore is, when the label calls you and say, "Hey, we have an artist here, and we want to send down to work with you."  "Cool, what's the deal?"  "Well, we need a single.  And when we spent all our money trying to get a single--we have the whole album, but we just need a single."  That's like, great because that means whatever you do with that person, it could be the greatest song ever written.  But if it doesn't fit the label's requirements as a single, and a hit single, they're not going to use it.  So I would hate to get those calls.  I got them quite a bit and would do them, you know.  All right, cool, let me try to get a single, but who knows what they're thinking?  You could come up with some great music.  I've written quite a few--was--what I thought were good songs.  Were they singles, were they hit smash singles?  Not necessarily.  But that kind of thing, you know, they'll spend their money on such and such a name producer.  But then they want to hedge their bets by trying to get something else just in case, when they usually go back to what they spent their money for with the name, the name hit maker of the time.  So, I--yeah, those kind of moments happen.
Story_ID: 672601
Speaker 1: So the- what I want to also understand, too, about this before we get to the, you know, the TV show ['Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'].  What was also, what has happened though in the music industry in this, in this ten year period--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because I think also I read where you were saying that the peo- there's no more patience.  And am I, you know, that they want you to produce quickly--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, there's no--they're not going to give time for things to sort of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they just want that (snaps fingers) hit and the style of music that they were looking for is just, you know, a lot of the success I had were---was going in the room and working with other musicians collaboratively like that.  And even though I did quite a few things with just me and the drum machine, you know, that's really what every--I mean, that's really what everything is.  And while again I've done that kind of thing, but my preferred method of working was doing something musical like that.  So it was not only that, but just destructive technology, I guess, you know, with MP3s and at that time, dealing with the whole NAFTA [North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement] thing and the file sharing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --and those kind of things.  So the labels and the music industry was a bit of a uproar with everything.  So, you know, things changed.
Story_ID: 672602
Speaker 1: I had, I got married.  I had a, I had a kid.
Speaker 2: You got married in what year?  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Seven years ago on June 2nd.  It's going to be eight years.  C'mon now, don't try and trick me (laughter).  So, yeah got married.  I had, I had a, I had a child.  And my kid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And who--talk about your wife.
Speaker 1: My wife, Tonita Poyser, you know, we met some years ago.  She--her sister is actually good friends with a young lady that worked with Chauncey [Chauncey Childs].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So she was like, "I think I got somebody I want you to meet."  I was like, "Yeah, whatever."  And then we actually met, and it was like, ah, she's all right.  I'll let her hang with me, you know (laughter).  So we kicked it for a few years and then it got serious and, yeah we got married, had a son that was two months premature.  So when he was born, he was two pounds, two and a half pounds.  Yeah, he was just a little, yeah it was, it was the craziest day of my life.  You know, go to the hospital, and it was like, we got to get this baby out of there.  And all of a sudden, a medical SWAT [special weapons and tactics] team comes out the wall.  It was like the movies where they come swinging through the windows and (makes noise) and I don't understand, like what's going on?  And somebody grabs me and pushes me to the back and says, "We're going to put a robe on you."  And they take her and then they say, "You want to see the baby?"  And this little two pound kid.  So he was in the, he was in the ICU [sic. neonatal intensive care unit] for two months, you know.  You know, so it was, it was a lot of stress dealing with that (laughter).  He was in the ICU, and they had this heating thing I call the French fry machine (laughter) that he was on.  I mean, I could laugh at it now because again he's seven and a half, healthy, hysterical, tall.  Just, just, like I said, I play the dozens well.  I'm proud of the fact that my son plays the dozen.  With his limited range of comedy, it's hysterical, though, you know.  Once he gets older and gets a little more creative with his jokes, he'll be good.  But at that time, yeah at that time, it was, it was, it was pretty rough.  And when he came home, I--whereas, whereas I used to go to my studio every day, I stopped going to my studio.  I just had a little setup at the house and I would just work at the house all the time 'cause I didn't want to be away.  I stayed around the house.  And again around that time, everything started getting small in the industry.  They don't need studios any more.  The technology was there for people to work like I was doing in their houses.  Everybody had access to this technology.  All the studios started going out of business.  The music business started.  It was on a shaky ground and then so forth and so forth.  So going back, goes back a few years now.  And then The Roots comes to me with the opportunity to do this TV show ['Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'].  Young wife and kid, yes, I'm doing this TV (laughter) show, and here we are.
Speaker 2: So talk about, so how did they--so first of all, what--your son's name?  Let's--
Speaker 1: Jadyn [Jadyn Poyser].
Speaker 2: J.D.?
Speaker 1: Jadyn.
Speaker 2: Jada, okay.
Speaker 1: Jadyn.
Speaker 2: Jadyn, Jadyn, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause your middle name is Jason?
Speaker 1: Jason, yeah.
Speaker 2: --Son, okay (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's a little play on words of that, but also Jadyn means God has heard.  So, you know, God has heard and gave me a little kid.  I forgot to--he had surgery a week after he was born 'cause he had a twisted intestine thing.  So he's gone through a lot, but he's a, he's a fighter, and a survivor and, you know, thank God for him.
Speaker 2: 'Cause two--I--two and a half pounds is very small.
Speaker 1: It's very small, yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, I mean you hear of premature but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --it's very small.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And he's, again he's totally cool and huge (laughter).  He needs a job, so if anybody is hiring, 'cause he's eating me out of house and home.  So if anybody's hiring, he, he does destruction, doesn't do construction, he does destruction.  So if you need some walls knocked down or TV remotes missing or something like that, he's good, he's good for that (laughter).
Speaker 2: You sound like a great father, you sound like a great father.  So you've enjoyed that part of your life then?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's the best thing that's ever happened to me, yeah, that's the best thing ever.
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know, it keeps me, it keeps me foc- I don't think I've ever been as focused as I've been, once I saw him.  I just knew what my purpose was.  And my purpose was to provide and teach this little guy how to deal with life, yeah.
Story_ID: 672603
Speaker 1: So when you, so what, what is the call?  You get a call from, from--do you get a call from--
Speaker 2: From Rich [Richard Nichols], yeah.
Speaker 1: Ri- okay, Rich (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Rich, okay.  And he--so what does he say?
Speaker 2: He say, "Yeah, we got this TV show, you want to do it (laughter)?"  I mean, there was a little more intent- involved in that, but essentially it was that, you know, we're about to be the house band for this show.  We could use, we could use another keyboard player to add some other things to it.  And I was like, wow!  And again with all that's going on in the recording business, you know, things have changed up, but budgets, budgets have changed.  The work isn't there, and it was like, yes, yes, I need this so--
Speaker 1: See, and really I mean, other--if you were, you know, the artist, I mean, you know, musical artist, they really were forced to go on the road, right, and performing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --because that's--
Speaker 2: Performing.  So a lot of the producers and songwriters, producers more, who aren't necessarily musicians, you know, they're going through a rough stretch of it.  You know, 'cause you make a record, and nobody's paying for it, as in the olden days, so you're not necessarily making any money that way.  So how do you make a living?  The musicians were like, shoot, got to go on the road.  I got to go play with so and so.  I didn't want to go on the road.  I don't like living out of a suitcase.  But this was a way of going on the road without actually leaving and living in a suitcase.  I get to play music every day, and it was a great situation, absolutely great situation.
Speaker 1: And it's gone on now for five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, five years of the, of the late show ['Late Night with Jimmy Fallon'].  Now we just started 'The Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'] in February.
Speaker 1: Did I know that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, because he--that's right, he took over.
Speaker 2: He (unclear), exactly--
Speaker 1: That's right.  Okay (laughter).  Duh!  (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was great.  It's another learning experience, too.
Speaker 1: So tell me what you, what you were learning with them.
Speaker 2: Just, again, I always--
Speaker 1: Because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) was of the mindset--I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Go on, go on.
Speaker 2: I'm of the mindset that, oh, yeah, music, I know it 'cause I listen to it and I study it and I know so much about it.  But then even more so like, you have to sort of live it a certain way, and just seeing how the, and just watching how the other musicians approach with their idioms of music, you know, the country guys, how they approach their thing.  You know, music that I didn't necessarily have a chance to go play, but I studied and I thought I could play, but just seeing how they played it--I wasn't necessarily running out to see much country concerts.  So I didn't get to experience all of that.  But seeing that is like, oh, he did that, you know, remember I saw, when I see D'Angelo play.  I got that, I got that or going around to the different churches and seeing those play or going to the jazz clubs.  But seeing other forms of music and other forms of musicians playing, playing their music and just, just experiencing a lot more things, you know, just seeing how--start-the--the entertainers are back stage just for a few seconds.  You know, there's something that you can, you can grasp from that, something you can glean from how they walk or how they treat people, you know.  So again it was all of a lear- all learning, you know.  Again I'm just trying to soak up as much information.  I got an eager mind and think (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So I, so you're saying because there's so much music coming through--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you're just really expanding your repertoire there, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) even, even more so.
Speaker 1: And your exposure, way more--
Speaker 2: Way more, yeah.
Speaker 1: --than what, than you would have had?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 672604
Speaker 1: So how does that work, like what is your relationship?  Is there--how does that work anyway?  Do you get the charts beforehand?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: Well, no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So before someone's coming on a show like that--
Speaker 2: It depends.  We don't always play for the musical guests.  But if we do, we'll get that--we can get, might get the tape of the song or the charts and, or forget the tape.  We'll write our own chart, so we just learn the song and perform it with them.  But we also have--prepare our own compositions of music that we'll play, that we play going in and out of commercials.  And then we'll do a cover song, too, for the, for the, for the guests to walk onto, something that's--relates to them or the project that they're pitching or something with a little bit of a snark involved because we like to be snarky.  So, so we'll do something that, you know, that's kind of fun and interesting that relates to them, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what does it involve though?  That's what I'm wondering.  How much time is it--
Speaker 2: It (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) involved with doing this because you take someone like--oh, god, darn it--Kevin, Kevin, Kevin--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Kevin Eubanks?
Speaker 1: --Eubanks.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he said aft- I mean, but he did it for a long time that he really was--I mean, this is, I don't know, I want to say twenty [sic. sixteen] years (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think it was close to twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Twenty, you know, that he was eager to get back into his music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, into music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because if he, he got--it was too limiting after a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's--I felt that, I felt the same thing also.  I had to learn to, I had to remind myself to constantly create.  So even though again, the technology changed and labels changed, I still had to keep myself involved in outside projects and cre- be creative as a producer and a songwriter but also as a session musician and doing outside things just to keep myself creative 'cause if not for that, I would just be going stir, almost stir crazy 'cause I'm locked in this house without doing anything else.  So it was funny.  The first few years, I really wasn't doing as much as I'm doing now.  And I was antsy and irritable all the time (laughter) and I real- when I really put it together, it's like, you have to create, and once I started really doing more--so it was like, it became a lot easier so.
Speaker 1: And plus, it's steady.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, you can't--there are not that many gigs.  It's--was--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Kevin Eubanks and then there was, god--
Speaker 2: Paul Shaffer.
Speaker 1: Right, Paul Shaffer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But he's--I'm talking about the black artists, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, there haven't, there was--
Speaker 2: You've got Rickey Minor.
Speaker 1: Rickey Minor.
Speaker 2: And [HistoryMaker] Ray Chew was out (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Ray Chew.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you also had--oh, god, what's his name?  But there haven't been that many, but they're actually in--on the other hand, they're, you know, it hasn't been bad for black artists with, you know, the late--the shows.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so.
Story_ID: 672605
Speaker 1: Where are you right now?  That's--I want to understand what things you've been working on, and what things you want to do, but what things are you currently working on?  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I'm again a musician on the, on the TV show ['The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'], dealing with that, as well as still writing and producing as much as I can, working on a new Erykah [Erykah Badu] album.  There's a, quite a few new artists that I'm involved in.  I'm doing sessions, different kind of, different kind of things, be it pop things, be it rock things, be it R and B things.  I have a session tonight that I'm going to run to and do (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tonight after we finish this?
Speaker 2: Yes, tonight after we finish this (laughter).  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Now why do you look at me (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So I'm doing those things, as well as I'm studying more.  I'm in the--I want to improve my playing.  I want to improve my--the--my mental facilities, you know.  I really wish I could go back to school, which I'm planning on doing.  I'm going to take private lessons actually for things like arranging and composition to really understand those, those things.  I mean, I, even though I, those--there are things that I do involving that, and I've done for years, but there's a certain level I want to get to.  But I love to be involved more so in the film and TV aspects of this.  Yes, I've done quite a few things like that.  I want to do more.  You know, I want to do, I just want to stay creative, do some cool things, you know, and just, just being involved in everything.  If it was back to the heyday, you know, those days, which you mentioned, where there was a lot of stuff going on, a lot of stuff popping--yes, I would love that, I would love that, so.
Story_ID: 672606
Speaker 1: What do you--are there people that you admire like, that you would like to be like?  A lot of people (clears throat), you know, when they're talking about doing TV shows or orchestrations and things--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --they often point to [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 2: Everybody points to Quincy Jones.  I would--see, Qui- what Quincy did, he made classic albums, as well as the TV shows.  So, yeah Quincy is the template, yeah.  And then do movies like, one of my favorite film composers is Thomas Newman.  I love his approach and I listen to his work often.  At the same time, I want to make some hit records just like--I love what Pharrell [Pharrell Williams] is doing.  You know, he's--I spoke to him recently backstage when he was rehearsing for 'SNL' ['Saturday Night Live'], and he has a, he real- and you can, he's always had a love of live music.  He's done all kind of stuff across the board from every, from the most ratchet stuff to some of the most musical things.  And, but he al- he really right now--he's pushing the envelope of live music, you know, and doing some really--that's--the 'Happy' song is one of the greatest songs ever.  You cannot stop singing that song (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's right.  Everybody loves the 'Happy' song.
Speaker 2: So, you know, to do the things, things he's doing.  Same time, I want to be able, I want to do more playing and, you know, like the players that are doing--like what Glasper [Robert Glasper] is doing and whatever guys I look up to.  I mean, there are so many, Jason Moran, Aaron Parks, oh, Brad Mehldau.  There's so many, there's so many great music pianists and musicians that I study and listen to and try and learn from and appreciate their gifts.  So, and then again the producer--producing a- producing aspect, producing songwriting aspect, as well as the playing thing, and as well as the arranging, you know, orchestration thing.  I want to be involved in all of that.
Story_ID: 672607
Speaker 1: So what about the British, British invasion (clears throat) of the, of the American music scene which is--you look at me like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --is that a wrong question?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: But I mean that there, you know, a lot of attention has been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: --focused--almost eclipsing African American--
Speaker 2: 'Cause they--the other cultures appreciate music.  I think this work we do, African Americans, we create something and then we run from it.  I don't know what that is, where we take something, create it--oh, this is great.  Oh, this is fantastic.  I'm tired of it, let's go to the next thing.  Or this is great, we created it, oh, this is cool.  Well, let's go to the next thing.  And we've created some, we've been--created and involved with some art forms that are great that, you know, could--should still be nurtured, which should still be viable today.  And you can go into how the, it's not how the radio stations don't play the stuff.  The politics behind this and behind that and behind that, how, you know, we as a culture, don't appreciate it.  So, you know, someone else is going to, is going to take it and appreciate it.  So overseas, you know, a lot of, a lot of the artists that do quote, unquote real music, they have great careers overseas.  So there's an appreciation for that kind of thing, and they learn it and do it themselves.  So, and then when they bring it back, it's like, oh, this is something new.  It's like, no, this has been here, you know.  But we've seen, we have the short memories and--on what we as a people have created.  So I'm--I appreciate music wherever it comes from.  You know, so I love--and I'm glad I was blessed and fortunate enough to work with Adele and play on that album ['21'] and things like that, like what Disclosure is doing.  That's reminiscent of some of the Frankie Knuckles stuff.  And then there's a group, there's groups from Australia, Hiatus Kaiyote, who's doing stuff that's reminiscent of the neo soul stuff.  There's a group in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] called Moonchild, which I'm in love with.  They're some little kids where they're doing some stuff--I won't say little kids to insult them--but they're doing stuff that's reminiscent of that '90s [1990s] soul stuff.  So (clears throat) there're still pockets of that stuff but just got to read--I think it'd be cool if we'd appreciate what we're doing and stay in love with it, you know, can't fall out of love with what we create.
Speaker 1: But I also--I'm a little troubled by the neo soul, and the short time period.  I mean, its impact was great, and it reached generations.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so--
Speaker 2: But a timeliness to it (unclear).
Speaker 1: There's a timeliness to it, though, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That is true, there's a timeliness to it.
Speaker 2: But again it's--
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about the--
Speaker 2: I mean, you're looking at hypo-political and talk about, you know, what we're allowed to hear and what we're allowed to, you know (laughter), you know, the what, where, what is allowed to be put out there, you know.  We're not in total, we're not in control of that.  So there are certain things that are under control that are pushed out there.  And, you know, and if you look at the--what is in our cultures today, the things that are hot in the culture today, it's, it's kind of depressing, you know, it's extremely depressing.  And then we just look at how we live our lives, and it's the same, it's the same thing so, but there's a place for that.  There's always been depressing (air quotes) ratchet stuff, but there was a, there's a place for that, but there should be a place reserved for other things also.
Story_ID: 672608
Speaker 1: The public and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the YouTube people that are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, showing up.  You know, artists are degenerated but--
Speaker 2: So there's, there's, there's things out there, you know, that you have to search for.  But again, the medium really that everybody wants--and the main medium is radio so--
Speaker 1: That's true, see--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that is true.  And people thought radio was going away, but radio is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's coming back again.
Speaker 1: --it's coming--
Speaker 2: It's still there, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: It's still there, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what everyone says.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what do you--but, you know, forty, it's hard to say.  You're still the--I mean, you're still young.  You're still a baby.  You just, you hit quick--early.  I mean, you hit it out early.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.  I know forty-seven really seems old.  Am I supposed to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Don't say that word.
Speaker 1: Am I supposed to (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Just think--okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Hey, again I've been--I'm blessed.  I'm--I don't want to say I'm satisfied in my life.  There's a lot I want to do.  You know, but you reach, reach a certain age and you start thinking about your mortality like, you know, can you still make, can you still be current?  You know what I mean?  Can you still, can you still converse with, with young kids musically?  Can you still converse with them musically, you know?  So you want to, I want to try and be as current as I can, just--but without being musically the old man at the club, you know what I mean?  So just got to do what I do.  That's why I want to expand my knowledge and learn more so I can do more and do other things.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 672609
Speaker 1: So what do you think?  How would you describe the legacy of the artists that you have been--had the pleasure of working with?
Speaker 2: How would I--can you tell me one more time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Decide, describe the legacy.  What are, what is that group that you've worked with?  What are they, what have they gifted to the world?
Speaker 2: It's simple, I think there was a bunch of artists that followed their musical paths and desires and did music that they loved, music that shaped who they are, music they grew up to, music that was part of their DNA, their entire lives.  You know, I'm just looking back at, say, Erykah [Erykah Badu].  She listened to a certain type of music her entire life, and it came out of her.  Questlove [Ahmir Khalib Thompson], he grew up in a musical family and grew up with all of this music in him, and it came out at that time.  It just so happened it was the perfect storm where everybody's thing sort of came out of them all at that time, whatever it, whatever their thing was.  It was still all--it was a lot of the same thing but little nuanced differences.  And everybody brought that to the table.  And we put out what I'm hoping is somewhat timeless and some great music.  And I, and I'm hoping that we'll still continue to do that, you know, and continue to, to inspire, inspire others to do that, and just be yourself.  You may, again if you want to create a hit and converse musically with everybody, okay, do you, do whatever, but some--try to be true to what you do, you know.  If everybody is true with what they do, is true to themselves, you know, there was a whole lot of stories and (laughter) musical conversations that can happen that haven't happened before, so just do, just do your thing.
Speaker 1: You know, I'm going to ask you just before I go to more questions, about Common because you've just referenced him and you've referenced your friendship with him and you've referenced some of the things you, you know, he did.  But what would, how would you describe his role within this whole genre and--
Speaker 2: I mean, he was--
Speaker 1: --and his artistry?
Speaker 2: He's one of the most gifted lyricists, the way, the point of view that he raps and his approach to music.  And he's extremely important, just again he--his, again his point of view and the music that was behind him was so extremely soulful.  And when you speak to Common, everything he says, he refere- he uses that word, soulful, so much.  It's like, "Man, I got to do this, and it's got to be soulful."  So that's his thing.  So it was important from that asset where he brings the soul musically and the soul spiritually and lyrically in his music.
Speaker 1: And he's very religious, too, in his (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he has definitely, he's definitely out there, I'd say.
Speaker 1: Now talk also about The Roots though.  I mean, because we've been talking about them but talking around--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what would you say their role, you know, as a group and a band and in this--
Speaker 2: Well, The Roots can--back in the '70s [1970s], can you, can you name any band?  You can name a ton of them and you won't even touch the surface of any bands, black bands, I should say.  Name a black band today (laughter).  I mean, (unclear)--Mint Condition, I'm sorry, Mint Condition and there was--maybe there's some, there's some bubbling on the surface of, and under the surface that are planning their way to the top.  Of course, but The Roots carried that tradition of being, you know, the Commodores, of being Kool and the Gang, of being Earth, Wind and Fire, being that thing, but from--in the '90s [1990s] where hip hop was the voice of the generation, of having that in there, as well as the other music thing.  So, you know, The Roots are carrying the torch of the black musical--popular music band.

Speaker 1: James [HistoryMaker James Poyser], you're one of the nicest people I've come to meet (laughter).  I don't know.  Are you like, you got another, you know, if I talk to someone else and they're like, that James is horrible but, no.
Speaker 2: Who said that (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, I know they didn't say it, but I just think, you're the, you know, from the moment you came in--I mean, you have a very--and you talked about this, you know, as a little person, you know, but you have a very nice, sweet--
Speaker 2: Thank you so much (laughter).
Speaker 1: --demeanor.  So with that said, you know, I want to ask you what you want your legacy to be.
Speaker 2: I want my legacy to be that--one of the things I value in this industry, and I think I spoke to you but--sorry, one of the things I value in this music business is having developed so many relationships and having some great friends, some great, great friends in this industry and having some fun and good times and just having a collection of memories of great times and things.  And I think I would like to--I would want to be known as this--it was, this is--he's a cool guy.  He made some cool music and he was not a jerk hopefully (laughter).  And, you know, and he, and he was, he played some cool music and helped create some music and was around some great music.  But most of all, you know, that he was a cool guy, yeah.  I want Jadyn [Jadyn Poyser] to be like, "Yeah, my dad, I think he was a cool dude (laughter)," if that makes sense, yeah.
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: In my lifetime, I would love for the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers] and Eagles [Philadelphia Eagles] and Flyers [Philadelphia Flyers] and Phillies [Philadelphia Phillies] to win championships.  That's all I'm asking, just one (laughter), just one.  The Eagles, can we get one, please, that's all.  And I was a great guy (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's fair enough.  And coming to Chicago [Illinois] (unclear) with our teams, too (laughter).
