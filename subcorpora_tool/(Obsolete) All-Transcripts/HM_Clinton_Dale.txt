Speaker 1: Okay, now before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish type questions that we always ask.  They just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: If I can.
Speaker 1: And, the first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Greens.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes, I look pretty good in red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like the summer.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would if I could, and if I do and that's Chicago [Illinois] because that's where all my family is.  I have brothers back there and a stepmother that I've had for so long.  She's like a mother, so that's where I go when I get a chance to go.  Other than every now and then, you know, we go to places like Las Vegas [Nevada] or Laughlin [Nevada] or Santa Barbara [California], San Diego [California], some of those places.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it's not repeatable.  Yeah, you know, I think like "A stitch in time saves nine."
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good, that's a good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you don't wanna hear the other one.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.
Story_ID: 75566
Speaker 1: Now, let's, let's talk about your family origin, I guess.  Do you know much about where your family came from and your ancestors --(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well, just, just a little bit because my family didn't really talk about a lot of stuff like that.  I was born in Tupelo, Mississippi.  I lived with--right across the street from one grandparent and lived with the other set of grandparents.  We lived across the street from each other.  In fact, my--the Head [paternal] side of my family, my grandfather was a minister and it was twelve children and my dad was the youngest.  On the other side of the street is my mother's family and it was the Wards.  And it was only--it was four children and one died early, a girl.  So, it was only three when I came along.  I only remember my aunt and uncle and my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward].
Speaker 1: What's the name again?
Speaker 2: Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay, W-A-R-D.
Speaker 2: Yes, and my dad [Benny A. Head] is Head.  And they from like around Baldwyn, Mississippi.  That's another little place which you can walk to right up the street.  And the others came from like Verona, Mississippi.  I think they've incorporated now and they are part of Tupelo, Mississippi, but that's where my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward] is buried and my grandfather [John Ward] and grandmother is buried.  So, and I do know that my grandfather [John Ward] on my mother's die is part Indian.  On my mother's side, you know, there's a lot of whiteness in their family.  In fact, I'm named from one of the people in the family.  And I, you know, that was a part of what used to happen in Mississippi.  You know, it, wasn't no big thing.  You know somewhere along the line you was kin to somebody on the other side.  And there was a lot of Dales.  Dale is, if you research it, you'll find that it's kind of a southern name and it's used for both male and female.  You know, so that's, that's where all this came from.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I know some Dales from Mississippi--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: That's where they came from.
Speaker 1: A lot of people from Mississippi in Chicago [Illinois]--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: That's where they all came to.  My father [Benny A. Head] came to Chicago [Illinois] in 1942 right after '41' [1941], the breakout of the war [World War II], and, and he went by freight.  He didn't pay.  And, you know, that was the thing too of that day.  You just go out and catch the train, get on--in one of the car, cars that was on the track and you go where you going to your destination.  And that's how he traveled to Chicago [Illinois].  But, he had gone to Chicago [Illinois] when he was younger because some of his family already lived in Chicago [Illinois].  And then he went to school at Wendell Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] too, a long time before I did.  And--but he didn't graduate from Wendell Phillips [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  He went back to Mississippi and went to school.  So, it was just one of those things.
Story_ID: 75567
Speaker 1: Did either parent or grandparents have any stories about what the family was doing in the nineteenth century or any stories about-
Speaker 2: No, see that is what I really missed other than I had an aunt, an aunt Rosa, on my daddy's [Benny A. Head] side.  My daddy's sister used to talk about old remedies, you know, medicine remedies and food and, and how she was a churchgoing lady and of course my grandmother was also a highly church, highly religious lady.  She didn't cook after five o'clock on Saturday afternoon.  Everything was done in that house and she would--I can remember her facing the west and reading her Bible every Saturday evening.  She did that.  And every Sunday morning everybody marched.  Everybody went to church, you know.  And it's funny she was Methodist, and my grandfather was a Baptist minister.  On the other [maternal] side, the Ward side, they were also Methodist.  So, everybody, that whole family, we would just all walk to church, every Sunday morning.  But, I never--I can remember my grandfather talking about his father and his father I can remember going to old farm a long time ago and his father was one of those old men that married young girl, and he had a young wife and some children like us.  And I can remember us playing with rabbits and chickens, that kind of stuff, but I, I don't know.  They never sat down and really told us about what happened a long time ago.  That never happened to us.
Speaker 1: --So you didn't discuss slavery or--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: No, no because see I was born in 1927.  By that time, there was no slavery.  My grand, grandparents on both sides neither one of them was in slavery.  So, I guess maybe that's why they never talked about it.  I don' know, but, but they never did.  I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Well there were still people that we have interviewed the slave, the ex-slaves in 1930s, you know.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, there were people-
Speaker 2: I missed that.  I am so sorry that I missed that.  You know, I tell my children today, you know, "get everything that you can."  You know, I, I want them to know everything that they can know and especially my grandchildren and we, we have a ball.  You know with this happening they really thought that this was really something, and it's something, you know, but like I told them, you know, it's nothing that you should put up on your shoulders and walk around like you've done something great.  Keep your feet on the ground and you know you, you'll make it."  And I can remember my grandmother telling me that.  "Always keep your feet on the ground.  Never take your feet off the ground 'cause the day that you take your feet off the ground and think that you are more than what you are you'll lose a step or two."  So, you know, to me it's like you, you talk about that box of goodies over there and it's true.  I've, I've been given quite, quite a few and I'm very thankful for it.  I believe that God's purpose for me was to deal with people.  I have dealt with people as long as I can remember.

Speaker 1: When I was a little girl in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: I don't wanna get too far-
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --ahead before we get--we got like a kind of systematic way of doing it-
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, but, I, I wanna talk about that, but-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I wanna take you back to your mother and father and can, can you give us the name of your father and birth date, date of birth and spell his name for us and the same for your mother?
Speaker 1: Okay, my father's name was Benny, B-E-N-N-Y, and it was A, the middle initial.  I know what it is it was A.C., but he never used it.  He just--Benny A. Head, H-E-A-D.  My mother's name was Sally, S-A-L-L-Y, Elizabeth Ward, W-A-R-D.  So, it was Sally E. Ward before she married my father.
Speaker 2: Okay, and--now when was she born?  Can, can-- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: My dad was born, my dad was born December 5th.  I was trying--that's what I was trying to find--I think it was December the 5th, 1905 or 1903; I'm not sure.  And my mother, my mother's birth was September 2, 1910.  I do remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay, and what kind of a person was your father?  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 1: Okay, my father [Benny A. Head] used to, in Mississippi, used to clean up stores.  There were very jobs that they had.  And you know something else he did and, and, and I don't whether I should tell this or not, but I am because it was a part of what happened to us.  My father used to sell whiskey, and they would, and, and I'm not name dropping, but I wanna tell you this, they used to go up in what they called East Tupelo [Mississippi] and that's also where Elvis Presley's father used to get his.  They all used to go up in the hills and get the whiskey, and the city police would let you know if the county police was coming.  I just thought I'd through that in 'cause that's a part of what really happened to us.
Speaker 2: The county police would arrest you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the county-
Speaker 2: The city, the city police were in on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the city police they were always in on it, you know, and you know of course they would have to scramble.  I didn't know what it was at the time, but as I grew up I learned what it was all about, you know.  But, but he did.  He, he, he sold whiskey, bootleg.
Speaker 2: And he worked, he cleaned up stores--(unclear)-
Speaker 1: Um-hum and--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Now did you all live in town?  Did you rent a place?
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We had a home.
Speaker 2: You had a home.  Oh, you owned a home.
Speaker 1: Um-hum had a home and I can't remember the address, but it was called Wilson Alley, but it was a street right off of the big street, Spring Street.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Before that, we lived on Green Street right next door to my grandmother Head because my aunt Rosa had a house there, and we stayed in her house after we moved from across the street from my grandmother Ward's house.
Story_ID: 75569
Speaker 1: Now what about your mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head].  What kind of person was she, and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a domestic worker.  She worked like most of the domestic workers.  They would go do breakfast and after breakfast I guess they would prepare whatever they were gonna prepare and do the lunch.  After lunch, they would get the dinner ready, but in the meantime, they came home to see after their own family and prepare whatever lunch, dinner, or whatever we were gonna have.  And then about four o'clock in the evening, they would go back and do what they call it was breakfast, dinner, and supper.  It was not lunch.  It was breakfast, dinner, and supper, and they'd go back and do supper for the folk that they worked for.  And that's the kind of work she did.
Speaker 1: Now did she, did she stay at home or did she have to stay at the place where she worked?
Speaker 2: No, she stayed at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Their--the custom was is that you went and you did breakfast and dinner, did your cleaning or whatever else you was gonna do, and then you would come home and then you'd stay until about four o'clock, and you'd go back and do supper.  That's what happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she didn't have to go far to work?
Speaker 2: No, and, and transportation was almost nil, so they walked.  Most people walked everywhere they went with the few exceptions.  My daddy [Benny A. Head], one of his other jobs was that he drove for--see he worked for the man who owned the largest dry goods store, the department store, okay.  And all of these folk were kind of like in the family and mother worked for another part of it, okay, and it, and it worked out pretty good, you know.  And at that particular time, you know, when I was first going to school you used to have to buy your own books and what happened was is that, you know, the white children had the books and if you, if your parents or somebody knew somebody then if you was a grade under that they would give you those books and you didn't have to buy books because, you know, there wasn't no salaries hardly at that time.
Story_ID: 75570
Speaker 1: Let me go back to your parents.  Did, did you parents have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I, I remember some things about, you know, the, the church.  That's where they met was at the church.  Like I said, my grandmother, both grandmothers was very religious and they all had to go to church.  And she went to church and they met and like a lot of people I guess they fell in love.  Anyway, they met before I was born, they had to, 'cause I was on the way.  My mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head], I think, was like seventeen, and my daddy [Benny A, Head] had been to Chicago [Illinois] and back and, you know, he, he, he knew the ropes or whatever, so anyhow she got pregnant and they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was, it was through church though.
Speaker 1: Now what denomination was your church?  Was it Methodist?
Speaker 2: Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, 'cause you mentioned one grandmother was a Baptist?
Speaker 2: No grandfather [Ward] was a Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: A pre--minister--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: But, the grandmother that he was married to was a Methodist, and they were CME's.
Speaker 1: Okay, yes there-
Speaker 2: Colored.
Speaker 1: Colored Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now it's Christian Methodist Episcopal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so let's see think back--how many other siblings in your family?  Are you are the only child?
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I had brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had three brothers.
Speaker 1: And you're the oldest, right?
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how many brothers did you have?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Three?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 75571
Speaker 1: Now, can you, you know, kind of reflect back and give me some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Tupelo [Mississippi] on that little street?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  The sights was always folks walking to and fro going to work.  There was a few, you know, we had grocery stores.  That was about all that they had other than, you know, you had your teacher who lived close by and you had your preacher who lived close by.  The, the sounds were the few cars that they did have and some people would be honking or children would be playing.  Where I lived it was a whole bunch of us.  It was a whole bunch of children, a whole bunch of folk, and you know everybody used to give everybody.  You know you would take a cow and you would, you know, raise it together, a hog and you would raise it together or if I, if my parents had chicken and you had the hog--you know if you killed the hog, on the day that you killed the hog everybody came to visit and whatever you was gonna give away you gave it away and the next time it was somebody else's house.  You know, so that--those were some of the sounds and other than--it, it was a lot of joy.  You know, as a child I didn't know too much to grieve about like children do now.  I, I couldn't sit in my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head] and grandmother's and their friends were sitting and talking, I couldn't sit with them.  They would say go play.  I could not listen to the conversation unless it was a conversation that they wanted me in.  If it was grown folks talk about marital problems or somebody being pregnant or somebody got jumped on last night, I couldn't hear that.  I couldn't hear my mother and father [Benny A. Head] argue or fighting, if that's what they did.  I was not allowed to hear that.  I was not--even though my father sold whiskey, you had to go around--people would go--I'd see people going around to the back door and I'd hear laughter in the kitchen, but in the part of the house where we were, they couldn't come up there.  We--there was no interchanging, you know like know folks come in your house, grown folk they talk to children and you know they get to friendly sometimes or what have you, but that didn't happen in my day.  Plus, my grandfather [John Ward] used to--he did all the painting in, in Tupelo--this is my mother's father now.  He did all the painting.  He did all of the people's floor, you know, the waxing and all of that.  In fact, the stuff that he used eventually gave him cancer, and he died from the throat cancer with the stuff that he used to clean the floors with.  But, my father loved to, my grandfather loved to drink and he could tell you some wild stories once he got to drinking.  My grandmother didn't like him drinking, but, but he was a funny fellow when he got to drinking.  And he could take it and do this if we were sitting outside and the wind was blowing and he could tell you which way the wind was coming from or where it was gonna go.  He only had up to a third grade education, but he could figure out something quicker than you can on a calculator now.  But, anyway, he had a green thumb as well, I'm trying to get to.
Speaker 1: Now this is the Baptist?
Speaker 2: No, this is the-
Speaker 1: This is the other.
Speaker 2: --this is the Ward.  This is John Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His name was John Ward.  And he had flowers all around the house and in between the flowers sometimes he would put hot peppers, you know, and that kind of stuff in his flower.  But, down behind the house was this great big open space where the toilet was.  You know we had an outhouse.  And he had anything and everything that you can imagine that you would want to eat.  And my mother and grandmother and my aunts they all got together and they canned every year all of the stuff that night.  We had peach trees, and we had our own well.  It was next door.  I mean between the two houses; that's where it was.  But, with all of, with all of that, you know, my mother on the back porch she had a thing where she put all the tubs.  You had three tubs and the pot was out in the yard and she would wash on this rub board and she would sing, and she was happy.  You know, and with all of the stuff that we have now it seems to me that we're not near as happy as it was when she was doing all of this rubbing on this rub board and singing, you know, but I had a happy childhood.
Story_ID: 75572
Speaker 1: Now, in the heart of Mississippi in Tupelo, what were the race relations like when-
Speaker 2: Bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just like it was anywhere else with a few exceptions.  See, that's one of the misnomers a, a, about the south.  You see, if the white person cared for you they still had the slave mentality.  If they cared for you, they, they took care of you.  You know, for instance, my grandfather [John Ward] drank; Tupelo [Mississippi] is dry.  But because of the people that we knew, my grandfather could get drunk and the police pick him up, bring him home, look under the flower pot if it was nobody there, get the key and put him inside the house.  Now, that really happened.  So, that's the dif, that, that's the difference in some of the other stuff that went on where race relation, you know, was about.  Because there was people that were very nasty too, you know, lynched.  You know for instance, I had a godfather that knew about some stuff that was going on with a lady.  She happen to have been a white lady and the wife of the man who owned the service station, and he was caught one night receiving a note from her, but it wasn't for him it was for the man that she was going with.  He was the go between.  So, what happened was the husband had a private detective or somebody watching him, and they thought that he was going with the lady and they beat him up.  They almost killed him, and just happened that I think that the chief of police at that time, excuse me, knew that it wasn't so and he knew what was going on and he had to get him out of town before they kill him.  But, then later on, you know, it died down for a while.  Later on the man found out that she was going with somebody else, and he killed them both and killed himself.  Apologized for what happened to the black man.  You know, so that's the other side of race relations.  On some sides, it was pretty good.  On some side, it wasn't good at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me do, do you--like where did you go to school and, and can you--(unclear)-
Speaker 2: I went to school at Tupelo High [sic, George Washington Carver High School, Mississippi]].
Speaker 1: And was that the-
Speaker 2: It was-
Speaker 1: --just one school for all grades or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was called Lee High, I believe at first.  I think now it's called Tupelo High [School].  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: It was Lee High when you went to it?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Named after?
Speaker 2: Who, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Lee.
Speaker 2: Lee I guess.
Speaker 1: Not Robert A. Lee?
Speaker 2: Probably (laughter).  You know, I've never really thought about it.
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)-
Speaker 2: I really never thought about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm supposing that this is a black school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, named after Robert E. Lee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was called--I'm not sure it was Lee High.  No.  Did, did they change to George Washington Carver [High School, Mississippi].  All that I would have to find out for you.  I'm, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do believe that they changed it.  I think that's what it is now.  It's--Tupelo High [School] I believe was the white school, and I think ours was, gosh, I think it was Lee.
Story_ID: 75629
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talking about school, right and you were--you said the name of the school was Lee School that you went to?
Speaker 2: Yeah-
Speaker 1: Or Tupelo High School.
Speaker 2: Actually, actually I believe that I was--I believe they changed the name and gave us [George Washington] Carver High [School, Tupelo, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and I think before I left there I believe that they had named it [George Washington] Carver High [School].
Speaker 1: Was it an all-white school or something that they gave ya'll?
Speaker 2: No it was always-
Speaker 1: Always black.
Speaker 2: --our school.  Right next to the city dump, but they took that one day and they caved it in, you know, and they mashed it over and they made a nice football field out of what we had our own football field just before I left, I believe.  And they had put a gym, the crevice, you know, it was a big wide thing, so they put a bridge across it, not the football field, but down further and you could walk across--I think they had just built a large gym across the street, across from the school.  And that's where they had all that March madness, but I left.  I didn't get a chance to really enjoy it.  And once we got to Chicago [Illinois], you know, I wasn't able to go back.
Story_ID: 75630
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Benny A. Head] moved the family to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And what grade where you in when he moved the family?
Speaker 2: Well, we moved in 1942.  Twenty-seven from '42 [1942] that made me about fifteen, didn't it--fourteen, I think I was about fourteen.  I don't think I had quite made fifteen yet.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: So, I had to have been-
Speaker 1: You went to grade school in Tupelo [Mississippi] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was that like and did, did you like school, and what kind of little girl were you in school?
Speaker 2: Terrible.
Speaker 1: Really.
Speaker 2: I was the only girl.  In my family, it's more men than anything else.  And I had real long hair.  I was the only girl and they used to dress me.  I had a lady that used to make my clothes because I was so small, and I was rough and tough.  I could climb a tree better than my brothers and my cousin.  And, I always got everybody in trouble.  I got my brothers in trouble.  I got all my friends in trouble.  There used to be a teacher that lived in front of us named Ms. Leeland (ph.), and every summer they had to go to what they called normal school.  They had to re-up.  So, this lady had peaches, pears, apples, everything in this orchard and I got my brothers and all my friends together and we got boxes and I told them that Ms. Leeland told us to pick her fruit so we'd have it so when she got back she wouldn't have nothing to do but can.  Put it up under my mother's house and most of the fruit was spoiled.  So, when she got back she asked my mother what happened, and my mother said, "but didn't you tell Dale and the kids to pick the fruit?"  And she said no.  So, my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head] immediately called me inside and gave me a whipping.  When she got through with me, you could roll me down the street like a tire (laughing), but I was bad.  I was terrible.  I was terrible because I didn't know how to be a girl.  I had, I mean-
Speaker 1: Are you--that implies that-
Speaker 2: No, not the gay thing, no.
Speaker 1: No, that, no, no, that males are not right or something (laughing).
Speaker 2: Oh, well that-
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--you were, you were terrible.
Speaker 2: Well, well, they wanted me to be feminine.  I climbed trees, you know, I did jump rope, didn't care about the dolls that they bought me, cared more about the airplane that peddled, you know, cared more about the BB gun that my brother got, that kind of thing.  I cared more about following the boys than the girls.  I cared more about--I wished I could have worn pants instead of wearing all these little old pinafore dresses and things that I had to wear.  That's what I'm talking about.  And see I had an uncle who used to drive what they called the drummer.  You know, he was the chauffer for the man who--see when I grew up there was salesman who had county, you know, they had to countywide to sell and my uncle was the driver for this man.  And because I had a small foot I got all of the samples.  You know, otherwise they would have just thrown them-
Speaker 1: What was he selling shoes?
Speaker 2: Shoes.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Red Goose.  And I, I wore Red Goose shoes when I couldn't eat sometimes maybe, you know, because I had so many shoes--(unclear)--.  That's kind of like I was an only girl.  I'm your only girl for a long time.  I have one other--there's one little girl on that side and her name Eileen, and she lives in Memphis, Tennessee.  But, it was no girls.  It was all boys and I, I want--I was a tomboy.  I didn't wanna be, you know, all that other stuff, but I, I was tomboy.
Story_ID: 75631
Speaker 1: And then-
Speaker 2: But why would you do-
Speaker 1: --I was part of the elitist kind of crowd, okay, because both my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head] and father [Benny A, Ward] worked; they made money.  We had a house, our own house, you know, the lady made my clothes and sometimes maybe we had--see you don't know anything about Streak o'lean, but it's salt pork and it's, it's like bacon, but it's salt pork.  It's not bacon.  Bacon comes from that side, and they used to--(unclear)--that and then fry it, and you'd have rice and maybe they'd make biscuits or hoecake break and some gravy.  Well, if that's what you had you didn't go outside and tell folks that you didn't have chicken.  See, didn't anybody know what went on in other folks houses, you know, unless somebody--the children couldn't go tell it like they do now.  You know, if you went to bed hungry, didn't nobody know it but you and your family.  I never went to bed hungry, but we had some lean meals sometimes, you know.  We had plenty canned food, plenty of pear preserves and I wished I had some today, you know fig preserves, strawberry preserve.  They even used to can ribs, can string beans.  They canned everything.  They made their own sauerkraut, their own hominy.  You know for Christmas we'd just have so much food to--we didn't know what to do with it.  So, it wasn't all bad, you know, living in the South.  It, it was pretty good.

Speaker 1: What would make you pick this woman's fruit and save it?  What were you thinking about when you did that, I mean, did-
Speaker 2: Just bad.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you dislike her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you want to do some, play a trick on her?
Speaker 2: Just, just, just lied.
Speaker 1: Did you really want all that fruit at the time?
Speaker 2: Didn't want it, just wanted to do something, needed something to do that day, so we picked her fruit.  It was about six of us, six or eight of us and my, but my mother [Sally Elizabeth Ward Head] whooped me for everybody 'cause I was the ring leader.  You know, and my mother was left-handed and see the houses was made up off the ground and you had the chimneys, remember?  So, no you don't remember, but anyhow they had the chimneys and I used to run behind the chimney and my mother being left-handed she could throw around the chimney and get me.  It didn't make no difference (laughter), but I deserved it.  And I have a little granddaughter that's the spittin' image of me right now and she just stays up under me, but she is bad, I mean bad, you know, really bad.  You know, not mischievous.  There's a difference in being mischievous and being bad.
Speaker 1: But, what's the difference?
Speaker 2: Bad is, is you go bother stuff that don't belong to you.  When people say no, you act like you don't hear them, you know, you just keep on going, you--at, at two years old she can tell you the biggest lie you have ever heard, and she doesn't know it's a lie.  She's--you are saying "Anetha (ph.) don't do this" and she's saying no.  I--that was me.  I mean, I would go in my mother's purse.  I loved chocolate.  At the time those large chocolate bars like this, you know, you could get them for a quarter.  Well, I must have eaten two a day, you know, and mother need her quarter 'cause they wasn't paying too much money, but she would leave the purse there and I would go and, and, and then the store man, the man that owned the store he knew me, knew all of us, and he would tell and I'd get another whipping.  But, that was just me, you know, and my mother used to have a saying is if you lie, you still, if you still, you'll lie.  They both go together, and she didn't like either one of them.  So, I got the whippings.  It didn't make any difference.
Speaker 1: You have no reason you can think of for that kind of behavior.  You were trying to you think--do you think you were trying to get attention or what, what do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I got--I had all the attention in the world 'cause I was the only girl and it was just that I wanted to do something different, I believe.  I mean, it wasn't the--it wasn't nothing psychological, you know.  I mean, I can't think of anything psychologically now that made me do it.  I just, I just did it.  You know it's like I always wanted to be a step ahead of my brothers and my cousin because they were boys and I was a girl.  And sometimes they would tell me "you can't go 'cause you a girl, and this is for boys."  And I think I did certain things to show them that I, I could, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got them in trouble too.  They got a whipping, but not like mine.
Story_ID: 75633
Speaker 1: What happened in school?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I loved school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I loved school and-
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Probably something that I could debate like we had English Lit[erature] and we had a teacher that would debate, that would allow us to debate English Lit and that was only because I wanted to talk, you know, and I wanted to show them how smart I was.  Again, you know it was that thing about being first.  If, if there's any psychological reason to it at all it's because I wanted to be number one.  So, that's, that's probably--because I, I remember Ms. Elda (ph.), a very good teacher, and she taught this class and she would let you debate.  Then you know we had radios, we didn't have TV.  She'd let you debate Amos and Andy whatever thing that came on that night, you know, and, and show where it was, could be helpful, you know as far as the class go and that kind of thing, okay, so anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who was your favorite teacher in, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Ms. Elda.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you-
Speaker 2: And there was another one Ms. Fannie.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what did she teach?
Speaker 2: Ms. Fannie Bryson (ph.) taught math and, math--I think that she just taught math and, and Ms. Talbot (ph.) taught biology and science.  So, all three of those were good teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They all lived close by.
Story_ID: 75634
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said that all of a sudden your father [Benny A. Head] decided to move to Chicago [Illinois].  He had relatives there already, so like 1942-
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: --that he decided to move the family.  Did he go first then, then send for ya'll?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, but my father by this time had gotten a job at the cotton gin.
Speaker 1: In Mississippi?
Speaker 2: In Tupelo [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Tupelo.
Speaker 2: And so, and to move a bale of cotton to where you put it on the train, I guess 'cause the tracks went right by and I guess they shipped it, well I don't know what happened, but anyway his supervisor, his boss, whatever, told him to move the bale of cotton and he said you know, "I can't move it, it takes at least four people to move it."  And he said like, you know, "Nigga don't talk back to me."  And my daddy [Benny A. Head] was tall and jet black and he had a short fuse.  And this man told him what he was gonna do to him if he talked back to him, and daddy [Benny A. Head] said you know, "I'm a man like you," you know, in other words, "I know you're my boss, but I cannot move that bale of cotton and it's not that I'm being smart, talk back to you, I'm just saying I can't move it."  So, by that time he raised his foot, I guess, to kick him and he put the hook in his leg.  So, wherever he is today he's kind of like minus a leg.  So, that's what made us go to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So, wait a minute let me get this--(unclear)--.  Now he told the white man that he was getting ready to kick him-
Speaker 2: He was gonna, he was gonna kick him.
Speaker 1: --and your father took his leg off?
Speaker 2: Well, see the hook--okay there's a long thing across where you catch hold to it and then--
Speaker 1: hold the cotton-
Speaker 2: --this, the, the crook--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so it was used to hook the bale of-
Speaker 2: --and then there was a hook, yeah and you pull it, you know, four people will sit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, he put the hook in the man's leg and it just tore the man's leg up.  Daddy [Benny A. Head] couldn't go back to Tupelo [Mississppi]--daddy didn't go back to Tupelo until maybe ten years before he passed, something like that.  Everybody had died before he went back.  He couldn't go back (laughter).
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--.  It always reminded me of Richard Pryor's story about mudbone leaving Tupelo [Mississippi].  He said that's when I--(unclear)-Chicago [Illinois].  He got on the train to Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are a lot of stories like that in Chicago [Illinois] and elsewhere.  I've heard so many stories, you know, where somebody is threatened and they retaliated and had to get out-
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --they, they know they can't stay.
Speaker 2: You catch the first things smoking.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: That's what you do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he get's--he sends for you all, how, how long did it take for him to send for you?
Speaker 2: Well-
Speaker 1: Were you all in danger there in Tupelo [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, no, no we weren't in any danger because like I said we had people on the other side.  There was nobody gonna bother us.  We ate steady and the whole thing after he left, so it was just that I missed my daddy [Benny A. Head] and I was a daddy's girl.  So, I went to Chicago [Illinois]--he left like maybe April [1942] something like that.  August I was on a train.
Speaker 1: Now, now you got a ticket right?  You, you-
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a ticket (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got a ticket.  They tagged me.  And there was another lady that was coming out here to meet her husband from Tupelo [Mississippi] to here because he was stationed here, so she--well she was going to California and I was going to Chicago [Illinois], so she took me as far as Chicago, and she came on out here, yep.
Speaker 1: They had some kind of express from Chicago [Illinois] to L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I think that I've read about it.  Anyway, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 75635
Speaker 1: --So, when you got to Chicago [Illinois] did you, were you impressed by the difference, I mean, what, what impression did Chicago [Illinois] make on you?
Speaker 2: No, when I first got there, I wanted to go home 'cause I got to Chicago [Illinois] in August and I wasn't--I had to stay with a first cousin who was very grown and she and my daddy [Benny A. Head] was the same age and I didn't like it because it was a little small apartment, you know, and the only thing you could do is go out on the back porch.  You know, and you couldn't go out the front door 'cause it was an apartment building.  I was new in Chicago [Illinois] and was very country, and they wouldn't let me out, so I didn't like Chicago [Illinois] at all.
Speaker 1: Now where did you live in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When I first went to Chicago [Illinois] I lived on 60th and what, out there somewhere.  It was a nice neighborhood, 60th and--where did they live?  It wasn't South Park Way [Martin Luther King Drive].  It wasn't going that way.  It was coming back this way.  They lived 6011 some street.  Just before you got to DuSable, I mean, just before you got to South Harper.  What street would that be?
Speaker 1: Vernon.
Speaker 2: West.
Speaker 1: Vernon or Calumet?
Speaker 2: Calumet, that's what it is 6011 Calumet.  That's where I lived when I first got there, and I didn't like it at all.  All those nice proper people, you know.  They would pass you on the street and they were all proper, whoever spoke to whoever, you know.  I just didn't like it.  So, finally daddy sent for mother and the boys.  They came, they didn't like it.  One of them went back home, two of them went back and stayed with an uncle and went on to school.  And we moved to 35th street, 35th right at Indiana on the third floor and I could hear down--(unclear)--Ruth Jones.  Her father's church was kind of like opposite us over there somewhere, and we just go out there, go out the window and sit out there and listen to the church and listen to her.  I've listened to her on many a night play that piano.  But anyway, I finally adapted to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: And you went to [Wendell] Phillips [Academy] High School [Chicago, Illinois]?
Story_ID: 75636
Speaker 1: Sure did, went to Wen, Wendell Phillips [Academy High School] from 41st Street.
Speaker 2: Okay, now who--where there any teachers there or that-
Speaker 1: Ms. Bousfield was the principal at the time.  And one of the teachers there the first gay person I ever seen in my life was that-
Speaker 2: --(Unclear)-
Speaker 1: Yeah, his name was Mr. Lee.  Very nice man, but see where I came from, you know, you didn't see that and 'cause you know being in Chicago [Illinois] the kids knew more than I knew, so they finally told me about Mr. Lee, and I, I guess maybe that's why I liked Mr. Lee.  I don't know.  I felt sorry for him 'cause somebody was always picking on him and some old boy there name Jonathan something.  You talking about gangs.  Gangs here is nothing.  These are poop butts here compared what was in Chicago [Illinois], you know.  But, anyway I guess Mr. Lee he did a commercial law class and at one particular time I thought that I wanted to be a lawyer and I liked his class.  I liked him.  But, see the teachers in Chicago [Illinois] were different than the teachers at home.  Teachers in Tupelo [Mississippi] was hands-on teachers.  Teachers in Chicago [Illinois] was constantly, you was constantly changing teachers and they, they didn't care nothing about you.  You know, you was just on the roll.  They would call the roll, and that was it, you know, so there was a big difference.  It took me, I guess when I got there it was in the ninth grade, eighth or ninth grade something like that.  Anyway, when I graduated I had just really caught on to the--you know it took me a good three years to just really catch on and be whoever it was that I was supposed to be.  You know, in tu, in, in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Now where you involved in high school activities or?
Speaker 1: None.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: None.  The only thing that I remember doing was going to football and basketball games and that was because of some of the young people that I knew.  You know they would take me with them.  I, I just didn't catch onto Chicago [Illinois] too quick.  I didn't catch onto Chicago until after I graduated from Wendell Phillips [Academy High School].
Story_ID: 75637
Speaker 1: When you were on the eve of graduation did you--what did you think that you would do?  What, what was your plan?  Did you plan to go to school or what did you-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  I had always thought that I would be a nurse and we went to--once I graduated there was another young lady named Lillian something--in fact, she is a nurse today--and there was--it used to be a Catholic hospital [Holy Family Medical Center, Resurrection Health] on Cermak Road [Chicago, Illinois].  I think that's where it was.  And we both applied and we both went for our first classes and they taught you how to, you know, wash your hands and you had some classes--you know your classes is mostly reading and a lot of other stuff before you get to the good stuff, you know, but it just so happened one day they brought a cadaver in and that was it for me.  I fainted, when I came to I went home and never returned because I'm afraid of dead folk.  So, there was really no reason for me to try to be a nurse.  And, and I think that that was because in Tupelo they always wanted me to be a nurse and they wanted me to go to one of Booker T. [Washington]--
Speaker 1: Tuskegee [University, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yes, they always wanted me to go to Tuskegee [University], and I think that's--I tried to do it, but I, I just couldn't make it.
Story_ID: 75638
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Went to Wilson Junior College.  It's now something else, I believe.
Speaker 1: Kennedy-King [College, Chicago]--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Didn't like that.  On 47th street there used to be Peter Cortez [Cortez Peters Typing School] or something.  It was a typing school, didn't like that.  I went downtown to a commercial law, and I liked that, but then by that time I had gotten involved with this young man and, and I just went on and got married and got pregnant.
Speaker 1: Who was this young man and where did you meet him?
Speaker 2: I met him at the house where I lived.  His mother--he and his mother and all the siblings lived downstairs and I lived upstairs.  My brother was in the Service with him, and that's how I met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1940 what?
Speaker 2: No,
Speaker 1: It's in the '50's [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We--before that, you know, I went from high school, even though I was trying out these different colleges trying to see where I wanted to be and what I wanted to be.  I--you know I went to, went to all the other things--I had a cousin that worked for both Joe Louis and Sammy Davis, Jr., and they used to come to Chicago [Illinois] to the Regal Theater and  of course by this time now, you know, I've caught on and I, I'm about to know who I am, you know, what I wanna do and, you know, I got these friends we all working together and we're doing just fine.
Story_ID: 75639
Speaker 1: But I went to work for a company, Harvest-
Speaker 2: International Harvester.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It used to be out on Cermak Road [Chicago, Illinois] or something over that way.  And this, you know, I knew nothing about communists and you know it was people out there passing out, out literature and all of that and of course I took some and some other folks took some.  I found out later years they were communists 'cause, you know, somewhere along the lines somebody asked me "were you a communist?"  What, you know, one of those things.  But, anyway, you know, you try different things.  You, you, you do things.  I worked for it was Chicago Mail Order before it was what Aldens [Inc.] or whatever.  It, it was Chicago Mail Order.  I worked for them.  I worked for-
Speaker 2: Not Spiegel was it or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I worked for Spiegel's too, but now the big--who makes Time [Magazine]?  It used to be on Cermak Road.  It's, it's a big printing company and it was on, it was down there on Cermak Road, but it was east, I believe.
Speaker 2: Bankers--(unclear)-
Speaker 1: Nope.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Nope, it was, it was a big company.
Speaker 2: Oh-
Speaker 1: Did all the catalogs.  They, they put all-
Speaker 2: Donnelley, RR.
Speaker 1: Yes, RR Donnelley.  I worked for them for a good while and you know just did a lot of things, worked and went to school before I met him.  Went clubbing, you know.  There used to be a group called top and bottom, bottom and top, top and bottom.  I guess they danced.  They used to--see I lived on 41st street, 41st Street between Vincennes and South Parkway [Chicago, Illinois].  You know once you move all these streets and things they get to sounding a like, but anyway I lived on 41st street between Vincennes and South Parkway, [Martin Luther] King Drive I guess it is now, and Oakwood Boulevard right on the corner there was a hotel and down on the first floor there's a club and we used to go there.  We used to go to Club DeLisa.  We used to go there was another out there on--what's on 55th street?  What was that club?  On 55th street, I can't think of it--let me see Club DeLisa.
Story_ID: 75650
Speaker 1: Okay we were talking about the neighborhood over there and you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --no, you were talking about [Reverend] Joseph Jackson, just go ahead and give me your opinion, if you want to?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--the National Baptist Con, Convention was right there in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Well, you see when I was a youngster--well he was on 31st and South Parkway [Chicago, Illinois] and then [HM] John H. Johnson, John, John Johnson, you know the--
Speaker 1: Of Ebony [magazine] and Jet magazine].
Speaker 2: --right, he opened up his thing down there on Michigan [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] and then there was another man that, excuse me, used to do in, incense, and I think his place was on Indiana and they all would give us you know like Mr. [HM John H.] Johnson would let us come in there and do the pages, you know.  They didn't pay you nothing but a quarter an hour, something like that.  And then, anyhow, Reverend, this man down at Jackson they used every year the parishioners would change his whole wardrobe.  They, they would buy him new clothes, you know.  That was before I knew anything about them celebrating the preachers day or something like that.  There was all kinds of ugly rumors that used to go out about him and then you know when they had that National Baptist Convention in Kansas City [Missouri, 1961] and, and it was terrible and then knocked one of the preachers off he died and that's when they, you know, broke it up.  But, this man was so cruel, and, and my pastor was just the opposite, Reverend Daniels.  And I understand now that, I don't know where Reverend Daniels is, I don't know if he is dead or alive, but the church has a whole lot of property and stuff.  There used to be right--
Speaker 1: This is in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], right?  Is this the Reverend Daniels in Englewood?
Speaker 2: Right, it used to be right on the corner of 61st and Indiana or 62nd and Indiana, somewhere over there.  What was the name of the church?
Speaker 1: Antioch.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's who it was.
Speaker 1: I don't know about that, Antioch Baptist Church [Englewood, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Now, when he first started out he was a young minister with his wife and family, and those women used to be terrible.  The man couldn't even go out the front door.  He had to go out the back door, and they knew he had a wife, you know, but I, you know, later on in later years I, I was here when I used to read about them buying property and that kind of stuff and I was hoping that he was doing like [Reverend Joseph] Jackson, you know, pocketing the money and stuff.  And I guess he didn't because it looks like they profited.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's, he's built some housing developments in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois] now--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh Englewood.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, but then it was just right there around 61st and Indiana, you know, and that was the church I used to belong after I left 41st Street Baptist Church [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church] where the Reverend [Elijah] Thurston was the pastor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was the old Thurston.
Speaker 1: Stephen Thurston?  Was it Stephen Thurston?
Speaker 2: Stephen Thurston is his grandson isn't it?
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It was, it was old man [Elijah] Thurston and then there was John, [Reverend] John Thurston, and then John, John's son I guess is who it is now.  It has to be because I don't even know Stephen, but I did know John and I did know the Reverend, other John, I guess, Thurston and it was called 41st Street Baptist Church [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church].  Well, then when I moved over to the west side over to is it Englewood, is that what they call it?  No, I wasn't in Englewood.
Speaker 1: --West of the Dan Ryan or on the--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, I, I was, I was 60, 61st, 62nd and Elizabeth, back over there.
Speaker 1: That's Englewood.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  So, I went to the Antioch, and I, I moved my membership to Antioch.  But, I can remember things happening like there was a young lady named Orlee (ph.) Jones [Ruth Hall Thurston] that was crazy about John Thurston and they finally got married because she got pregnant and I guess that's where Stephen [Thurston] come from; I'm not sure.  I don't even know what their children were named 'cause I left before that, but there--
Story_ID: 75651
Speaker 1: --used to be like the Roberta Martin Singers, you know.  There was Delois [Barrett Campbell] and Eugene [Smith] and what was that name that was so ugly [Norsalus McKissick].  I can't think of his name, but he could really sing.  I shouldn't have said that.  Eugene [Smith], Delois [Barrett Campbell].  In fact, Delores married the preacher, Campbell, so she became Delois Barrett Campbell.  Then there was Romance and all of--oh, Albertina.  I knew Albertina.
Speaker 2: Albertina Walker?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, knew her, her brother George and they daddy.  I saw her on TV the other day.  Ozella Weber and I used to work for a man named Al Benson besides--his name wasn't Jack Benny, what was his name.  The first black man was named something else and then Al Benson came up and I got a chance to meet Ms. Mahalia Jackson through Al Benson.  Anyhow.
Speaker 2: You were very active in the Baptist church.  You knew all the names of the Baptist church I guess--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, my church was the 41st Street Baptist Church and it broadcast, but then like in Chicago you know you visit plus you know like Romance and his sister grew up, we all grew up together right there which--and, and Orlee and, and Ozella Weber they was in 41st Street Church is how I knew them and, but we'd go play whist after the concerts, so you know that's how you got a chance to know folk, you know.  We weren't running buddies.  I just knew 'em.  In fact, you know, I, I, I guess I'm kind of peculiar.  It's nice sitting here talking to you, but like you know I got a chance to meet Bill Cosby once and he, he's a nice guy, but in fact I've met him two or three times because of some things that I was doing, but you know I, I didn't get excited.  So, I mean, you know I, I--we did some things and I some people, but, you know, I, I didn't get excited.  I, I don't get excited.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I, I remember Albertina [Walker] from way back, you know.
Speaker 2: Is she still singing, do you know?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I know how old I am, so I know how old she is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's pretty young isn't she?
Speaker 1: I just celebrated my 75th birthday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she's a few steps ahead of me.
Story_ID: 75652
Speaker 1: So, so how did you--when did you--well you were married and living in Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: I got married in, psst it's been so long know.  I guess it was like December of '54' [1954] because the baby was born January of '55' [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I always promised that I would never get married, but you know after you become pregnant that's one of the better things to do.  So, that's why I got married, okay.  And after that I started rolling 'em out like it was an assembly line.  I had four children before you could snap your finger, and I thought I would never had any because I was twenty-five, twenty-seven or something like that when I had my first child.  I never thought I was gonna have any children.  In fact, I never thought that I ever wanted to be a mother, but then after I got into it and started learning the ropes, you know, I started enjoying it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One thing about is, is that you need a husband that's going to be a part of that marriage, not one that's gonna, you know, take the bottle and get lost in it.  But, anyway we have managed.  We've, we've done pretty good.
Speaker 1: Did you husband [James Clinton] leave or did you leave him or did you--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: We left him.  We had to leave him.  He was an alcoholic.  He died eight years ago.  My son [Jimmy Clinton] got killed eight years ago in September, and he died six, eight weeks later.  He died December 2nd or 3rd.  He just didn't want to live anymore.  And they were both named James, Jimmy, and one is right on top of the other.  I buried them both.  He didn't have anybody else to bury him.  You know we didn't get along because he was an alcoholic.  He used to be the cook that used to bring the midnight flyer from Chicago [Illinois] to LA [Los Angeles, California] and there was another train, look like it started with and S.  I can't remember now.  Both of them, he used to be the head cook.  He was a very talented young man.  He could clean up this house in an hour and it would just be shining.  Of course, you would lose a few things in the process, you know.  He'd throw it out if it didn't look right, but he was, he was a talented young man.  Could repair anything or fix it, you know.  He could cook.  He could clean and he could take care of the kids, but the bottle just got the best of him and so happened my son he didn't go on the bottle he went to drugs.  And according to statistics if there's one parent in the family that's an alcoholic or whatever you can rest assured somebody else is going to be.  The daughter that just left out also had a drug habit, and I've had to take care of her children.  We'll get to that though I guess down the line.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well when did you move to California?
Speaker 2: I moved to California in September of 1959.  I had--
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your husband move with you or were you still married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had--that's when I left.  But, he came out in December of '59' [1959] and I had one of these old fashioned aunts that said, you know that's the father of your children give him another chance.  We gonna start off, it's gonna be new out here.  Well it was new, but you still had same liquor store, only you had more of them out here on the corners than you did back there.  And the hours was more liberal out here than they were back there.  So, he transferred to the Chrysler Company that he was working for in Chicago [Illinois] out here and it just happened to have been in Cudahy [California] or somewhere over there close to Watts [California].  So, we found a house up there.  You know I didn't know Watts from Adam's house cat, and we moved up there.  Well, we moved on 95th and Banderas and right on the corner of 92nd and Banderas where he got off the bus were Tunica stores, one on one corner, one on the other; he passed them both.  So, eventually, and see Charles [Clinton] was born in 1962, I left just before Charles was born, and I didn't look back after that.  But, he insisted on staying here and of course his children love him.  They loved their father, and they loved him and you know I never tried to talk against him.  You know, if they loved him, they loved him.  I remember my second daughter saying to me, "One day, when I get married my daddy [James Clinton] is gonna walk me down the aisle," and I told her not to invite me.  You know, but, anyway he did die.  He died the same year that Jimmy [Clinton] died, eight years ago, eight years ago this year.   So, we buried them both and--
Speaker 1: In '92' [1992]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess that's when it was 'cause Anthony [Clinton] was a year old.  He made nine years-
Speaker 1: Ninety-four, that's when it would be, yeah it'd be '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: He made nine years last week.
Story_ID: 75654
Speaker 1: You know, it's been me and the children.  I promised the good Lord that if I got out of that one he would never have to worry about me in another one, marriage that is.  I, I just, I, I didn't want the abuse.  I didn't like fighting.  I didn't like fussing all night.  I didn't like cussing all night.  You know he had me so I could cuss like a sailor.  I could cuss better than he could, you know, and we shouldn't have to live like that.  And, and you know we say in the name of love we gonna stay.  I think it's more harmful to children to stay in a marriage or in a relationship like that than it is for the children to have one parent and this one parent do the best that she or he can do to raise those children and you know have some normalcy in their lives because well I had children to stammer.  I had one who used to sit up and rock herself to sleep, you know my second daughter.  One, two of them used to suck their thumb and it's all because all of this racket was going on around them, you know, and I'm sitting there nervous on Friday not knowing whether he was gonna come in drunk, sober, or indifferent, you know.  And, and I would tell any mother it's not it's not in the name of love it's in the name of you trying to stick it out, you know, because you're trying to prove a point, you know, and there's really no point to prove.  Get on with your life.  You know I find that--and I'm not fanatical when it comes to church, but I, I, I love church.  I, I love praying, I love the singing, and I love being a part of church.  I took my children to church.  I didn't send them I took them to church.  I have two daughters now that's evangelists.  One has been ordained as an evangelist.  The other won't.  She just, she just wants to be who she is.  And you know I, I, I think that's nice.  I, I really do.  I think you have to have something to hold on to, and I love Christianity, you know, and it got me through, it got me through.
Story_ID: 75655
Speaker 1: Now what occupation did you pursue here?
Speaker 2: Okay, in the beginning the first job I had was as a maid at the Lafayette Hotel [Long Beach, California].  It was no longer than Lafayette Hotel.  And the lady that gave me the job just passed a few weeks ago.  But, she gave both Sonny and I, that's my husband, his name was James Richard Clinton, we used to call him Sonny, and I learned how to make beds.  I didn't know how to make beds, but learned how to make beds in two days.  And I went and took the Lafayette [Hotel] and after the Lafayette I went to Los Angeles [California] and worked at Packard Bell [Hewlett Packard].  I was with Packard Bell when it was trying to come up with the computer and the TV.  No, it had the TV, it was trying to come up with the computer, I guess, and some of the other things that they now produce.  I was down on whatever that street is in Washington they had a plant out there in Los Angeles [California] and I worked there until I worked--started in '59' [1959] and I guess or the first of '60' [1960] and I left the last of '61' [1961] 'cause I was pregnant with Charles.  It was my last child.  And that's when I left Los Angeles [California], came back down here [Long Beach, California] and lived and never looked back.
Speaker 1: How did you get to Long Beach [California]?  I mean when did, did you come out?
Speaker 2: They have a red car that used to run back and forth like the train that they have now and, but then by that time, you know, my cousin used to come and he and his wife would come and pick me up and bring me down and take me back.  They finally came and moved me on back down here and I was glad, you know.  Long Beach [California] is a much better place to raise a family.  Los Angeles [California] reminds me of Chicago [Illinois] quite a bit, and I'm so thankful that I live in Long Beach [California].  I'm so thankful that my kids didn't have to grow up in Los Angeles [California]; I really am.
Story_ID: 75656
Speaker 1: You've been involved in, you know, quite a number of civic activities here apparently-
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --judging by that box of-
Speaker 2: Well, I started out in the, as far as activity--you know in Chicago [Illinois] the vote means a lot, getting out the vote, and I used to--there was Congressman Dawkins [sic] was it-
Speaker 1: Dawson.
Speaker 2: Da-
Speaker 1: [Congressman] William [L.] Dawson, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I used to be a youth, whatever they called it at that time, used to help get out the vote.  Whenever anybody died I was the one that used to go and beg 'em, you know, get the money so we could bury 'em and, and that whole bit.
Story_ID: 75657
Speaker 1: And it took a little while out here, but then they came along in 1960 something they had "No on 15" or something and somebody recruited me to work with that and then we had a couple of black people was trying to get into politics here.  So, I worked with that and after that was over and I couldn't find baby-sitters for my kids, so I went and got on welfare.  Didn't know what welfare was about, but somebody--I asked and somebody told me how to get there, okay.  And the poverty program came along.  That was in like June of 1965 or something like that, maybe April of 1965.  My children attended Roosevelt Elementary School [Long Beach, California] and I had been involved in PTA [parent teacher association] and some other things over there, so the principal knew me and he--one day he didn't exactly know how to approach me, but he finally said you know, "Ms. Clinton we would like for you to represent us on a committee.  It's a program that the government has and, and we need somebody of your caliber," and I couldn't understand what he meant of my caliber 'cause see I was on welfare you know with five babies.  Anyway, I went to this meeting and all of these nice folks surrounding me with maybe one or two people that looked like me, no women and some men came in that looked like me.  So, these women was all saying they belonged to the PTA and the AOW and ICE and all the rest of the, you know, whatever.  So, finally they said to me and what do you belong to?  Well, I was on welfare and it was called AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children], so I said "well I'm on AFDC," and these men they literally hit the floor, laughing so hard.  They laughed so hard at me.  They laughed so hard; they became my best friend.  But, they laughed so hard.  I'm dressed down in this cute little yellow dress, the best one I had, you know, think I'm looking cute in this yellow and white, hair combed, and they said well who do you belong to and I said AFDC and when I said that--(unclear)-- Joe White, Joe Brooks, Richard Harris, and Joe Wilson just hit the floor.  They laughed so hard.  I didn't know no better, okay, you know and sometimes there is goodness in innocence.
Story_ID: 75658
Speaker 1: But, anyhow after that was over and we all talked about this Head Start program, and I didn't know what Head Start was about, but anyway that was what I was there for and I--after it was over they said "we need to talk to you" and I said why, you know.  They said "anybody that's brave enough to say that they belong to AFDC belongs in this program."  So, they told me about the programs, and I told them I was not gonna work no more.  I was gonna raise my kids.  I was gonna stay home and be on AFDC like everybody else 'cause I wanted to raise my kids.  So, they kept bothering me and I kept running from them.  Finally, one day somebody from the city came and said "we really need you in this program."  So, I went down to the community improvement league and met with the people and became a part of NAPP.  It was the Neighborhood Participation Program, Neighborhood Adult Participation Program.  Head Start was the number one program and then for children and then this was the program for the adults and you know what that was all about.  It was getting people, you know, to start thinking work and start thinking education and all the rest of this stuff.
Speaker 2: An unfortunate acronym isn't it, NAPP.
Speaker 1: Yeah, neighborhood adult participation program.
Speaker 2: It sounds like we're going to go to sleep-
Speaker 1: (Laughing) But that's what it was.  And from there I just took off.
Story_ID: 75659
Speaker 1: I just--in fact in September or something like that of 1965 I was so involved in the program, and they was talking about cutting it out and all of that in 1966 I sat down and wrote a 32-page letter to [President Lyndon B.] Johnson, the president.  It wasn't long after that that my daddy [Benny A. Head] called me from Chicago [Illinois] and said, "What the hell have you done?"  And I said, "What do you mean?"  He says, "I got somebody came to see me today from the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] asking about you."  And I said, "Why?"  And he said, "I don't know what did you do?"  I said, "I wrote a letter to the president [Lyndon B. Johnson]."  "What hell you do that for?"  I said, "Because I felt like I had some information that he needed to know."  And, you know, that was my fifteen minutes of fame and I went on from there.
Speaker 2: Was it publicized?  Did it-
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I have it.  It's over there somewhere, you can see it.
Speaker 2: What happened, did they talk about it in the news or?
Speaker 1: They put it in the Congressional Record.  They put it in all, most of the major newspapers across this country.  They put it in the Stars and Stripes overseas.  That's what they did.  So, I guess you don't write to the president [Lyndon B. Johnson].
Speaker 2: Was it an impressive letter?
Speaker 1: I guess it was.
Speaker 2: Anything that's-
Speaker 1: I guess it was because I heard from a lot of congress people and senators.
Speaker 2: And the core of it was that he shouldn't discontinue those programs, right?
Speaker 1: Right, right and after that Head Start along with some other programs it was given like millions of dollars across this country.
Speaker 2: Increased instead of decreased.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yes it did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Brought on another work type program and the whole bit.  I guess it did what it was supposed to do.  I was sitting on the beach in San Pedro [California] and I was just thinking, you know, we can't do without these programs.  We were only making $333 a month.  That was all we was making.  But, you know, that was $333 more than I was making, you know, 'cause I was sitting home before that.  And what they did was that's--it wasn't welfare to work, but that's when they incorporated a part of, you know, you can go to work as a welfare mother and they would do thirty-three and a third percent or something like that.  They balanced it out some kind of way and they gave you some help.  So, that, that was pretty nice, you know.  And from there--plus I was on the, the board.  By, by that time we--they had brought in down here it was called the CAP [CAA], the Community Action Agency and I was one of the members that was on the board and--.
Story_ID: 75594
Speaker 1: Now your activities accelerated here, your volunteer activities apparently so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well what happened once NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program] and the CAP [CAA Community Action Agency] board there was a group from UCLA [University of California Los Angeles] that had a company that they was training trainers to, to be able and go train plus you could get a certificate that was equivalent to like a four-year college.  So, I had no idea about it, but the city itself turned in my name and thing and asked me to go.  In the meantime, I had gone to city college, I was trying to get my AA [associate's degree], you know, I'm trying to fit somewhere here.  So, I went and I was interviewed and they were so impressed they took me right in.  Well, I didn't know that you were supposed to have had a Master's Degree to be a part of this.  So, they said to me after I was accepted and interviewed and all of that and already to go they said "where did you get your Master's?"  I said "I don't even have my AA."  They said "well how did you get in this program?"  "Well, I don't know other than God put me here and opened up the doors."  And they said "well we're glad to have you" and God, just come on in, and I thanked them.  I think I was the only person that didn't have a Master's, didn't have a Bachelor's.  But, anyway I went on to--I completed course and that was--the letter was a part of it.  They took the letter as, as a thesis and--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: You were talking about, your civic activities--
Speaker 1: Here.
Speaker 2: --in Long Beach and we were--you were talking about this program that you, you got involved where you needed a Master's, but you didn't have one--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but you, but yeah--
Speaker 1: But they accepted me anyway and I went on to become a trainer and I worked with them.  In fact, some of them, once that program was over, some of them continued to work and they helped to integrate some schools like Pasadena [California] and Altadena [California] and up in there, Azusa, all up in there and I used to go--you know what's funny they didn't want it to happen and so I used to have slip up at night and work with them and come on back down here.  But, it was fun.  I have not seen--one of the men I think is up in Oakland [California].  He ran, I, I guess he ran against [Governor] Jerry Brown not too long ago, maybe a couple of years ago, for mayor of, of, of Oakland [California].  And there's a young lady out there that's an adopted daughter of mine that works for [Governor] Jerry Brown, and she saw him and told him that, where I was and the whole bit.  But, I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 75595
Speaker 1: I was with that group when [Senator] Robert Kennedy got killed.  We were in Reno [Nevada] and we had gone to eat because we had to be at the University of Reno [Nevada] the next morning for our first training session and somebody else that there heard us talking about being from California, and he said "well how is Robert Kennedy?"  And we said when we left he was doing fine and he was.  Fifty-five minutes, an hour and fifty-five minutes we had just left California he was doing fine.  In fact, he was ahead and they said no he got shot.  And I tell you it was like, it was an echo way down somewhere, you know, shot and we all kind of rose up together and somebody had to the foresight to go pay, and we went on back to the university and sat up practically all night listening to the news and what have you.  And the next morning we just went and said a prayer and rescheduled.  Tried to get back here and we had to go through--we had to go across the Sac, San Francisco [California] and then come down.  We couldn't even go across the Sacramento and come down.  We had to go across the San Francisco from Reno and come down.  The traffic in the area was just terrible.  It was worse than it was on the street and you know I, I for one was glad to get back home because you know it had been so much.  There was [President] John F. Kennedy, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, and then [Senator] Robert Kennedy.  It was just a little much to bear.  You know, you would never think that this kind of thing would happen in the United States of America and now it's even worse.  You know, we got more than this going on now.
Story_ID: 75596
Speaker 1: What about the urban unrest in 1965 and--
Speaker 2: We was right there in the middle of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We haven't--the staff of NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program] we went to the meeting and I can remember this lady kept hollering about we want the mayor, Mayor [Sam] Yorty, bring Mayor Yorty and the chief of police, not knowing that this lady [Rena Price] was going to be a lady that she and her son was gonna start the [Watts] riot.  But, anyway that night or the next night it did happen and being a staff member of NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program] there was a lot of things that we had to do.  In fact, we did some things down here and then we had to go up and work in Los Angeles [California] because so many people were displaced and so much was going on, and that's what the neighborhood adult participation project was all about was to be able to be helpful, you know, to people, and that's what we did.  But, it, it was, it was trying time.  It really was.  I can remember, you know, I lived at that particular time right off Pacific Coast Highway and Myrtle Avenue.  And I can remember the police coming through telling me to get in the house.  But, you know, if you was white or anybody else you didn't have to get in the house.  It was just black folks that they wanted to, to get in the house, you know.  They was afraid that some black folks was gonna start--they, they think that every time something start in LA you know it's start down there and that's not necessarily so.  It has though.  In the past, we've had a couple of occasions like that, some stuff starting in LA [Los Angeles, California] and then they try to burn up Long Beach [California].  It happened a few years ago.  They just burned up Long Beach, tried to.  But, anyway they didn't burn it too much.  But, that has been, that's my calling I guess.  I've always been able to be on the street to help out.  You know when you're working in human service, community relations, that's what it's all about and that's, that's who I am, that's what I was.  And for the City of Long Beach, for NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program] they, they just called you a NAPP aide, but you did the same thing, you know, got paid less, but you did it.  And you, you just go out and you help folks.  We started the welfare rights under NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program].  We started credit union under NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program].  You know, we helped the housing, you know, helped them to cause the housing to, the housing authority and that kind of stuff to develop.  So, we, we, we done a few things, you know, we've been involved with a few social things, you know.
Story_ID: 75597
Speaker 1: Okay, and after all these awards and activities what, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community now?
Speaker 2: You know a long time ago we threw out the baby and the water.  We need to go pick the baby up and let the water stay out there.  You know it, it may sound old fashion, but young people have no respect for themselves or anybody else.  They need to learn respect.  When you got respect, you know, you, you can march on.  You see, I respect you and I demand and command that you respect me.  We don't do that anymore.  Children don't respect themselves--well they don't respect their parents and, and sometimes, you know, all of that is not necessarily children.  You know, the parents have got to do some things too.  You've got to demand some things from your children when they are growing up.  You've got to teach 'em.  You see even though I was a one-parent household, I was not gonna let my boys or girls run over me.  They didn't work.  They didn't bring a dime in that house.  They didn't pay a bill, but they ate every day, they wore the best of clothes, and they ate the best of food.  We went most places that everybody else was going.  We enjoyed all of the holidays regardless to how it was done, it was done.  So, if you ain't paying nothing, you ain't got nothing coming, you know, but respect.  Oh, and, and I don't mean to get on the soapbox, but that's the way I feel.  I feel like children need to be taught, but then I feel like we may have to go back and teach the parents.  But, we have to do something.  We are losing the war on children.  We're losing it.  We're losing children.  You know, I'm sitting on my porch and because you don't like the way I look or because it's your initiation of something else you can pull out your 45, 22, or whatever you got and shoot me.  You know and, and you're seventeen or eighteen years old.  That don't make sense to me.  It does not make sense to me that adults are afraid of youngsters.  You know and, and even though I'm seventy-five years old, you know, some of the same rules should exist today that existed seventy-five years ago as Aretha [Franklin] says RESPECT, you know.  That's what we need and I, I get, I get awfully wound up when you talk about children and parents and the way things are going today.  Children can't even enjoy being children anymore, do you know that?  You can't even have a house party in your backyard for your children anymore or in your house because if you do some uninvited guest can come to your door and knock on it, you open the door, and they can blow everybody in there away.  And what do they do, they go to jail for a few days, they get a good lawyer, and they do some bargaining, and they're out on the street and you and your child and everybody else is dead.  There is something wrong with that picture.  I don't like it.  You know, I think church plays a big part and, and that does not mean that you have to be fanatical.  It just means that this is another source whereby you can learn some stuff.  You know like when you play on a football team you learn team work, you know.  When you go to church, you learn team work.  You learn to respect each other.  You learn to love each other.  You know, I don't know maybe I've gotten to old, but it bothers me when I see youngsters in the store telling their parent how to act and what to do and what they gonna do and what they not gonna do or what they gonna eat and what they not gonna eat.  My children ate what I put on the table.  If you didn't like it, didn't want that, you know it wasn't nothing else I could do no way, so you went to bed hungry if you didn't eat it.  There was nothing else I could do.  But, I found out that when you're hungry, you know, even though you don't like it or that's not exactly what you want, you will eat it to fill that void, so you don't have to go to bed hungry.  And you teach youngsters, you teach 'em to, to eat what's on the plate, don't waste, don't throw it away.  It's too many hungry folks in the world, you know, and they're not all coming across the borders, either from north, east, south, and west.  You know, it just a lot of things.  It's, it's just, I don't know.  What else you wanna know?
Story_ID: 75598
Speaker 1: What do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I would hope that out of the five children that I've had, the ten, eleven grandchildren, four or five great grandchildren that I have that somewhere along the line that somebody will decide that they too wanna get out here and help somebody.  You know, maybe follow in my footsteps.  It's not that I've been so great.  No, it's not me.  No, I, I, I pray a lot and the Lord and I talk about this.  This is his job, you know, you--I'm your servant.  You sent me out on your job, and I'm doing the best I can with your help.  And, and so I take no credit.  You know, this is what he wanted me to do 'cause I never would have done this.  You know, going to folks houses and you know listening to all of the stuff that they have to say and then try to find a solution.  Not me, no, like I said I didn't never want to get married and I never wanted to have children.  I wanted to be free, twenty-one, and whatever I wanted to do.  That was what I was about, yeah, but that was not what the Lord wanted me to do.  So, I ended up with five children.  I think I have about ten or twelve grandchildren and four or five great grandchildren, yep.
Story_ID: 75599
Speaker 1: Now, one of the--one legacy you leave behind is that letter that you wrote and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you--I think we were changing tape, I think, when you gave me the details of it.  Can, can you--
Speaker 2: The letter?
Speaker 1: Yeah, can you talk about--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I was working for a poverty program, and they had talked about dismantling, wasn't gonna put any more money into head start and to the, what was the working programs called.  I've forgotten what they were called, but they was called something.
Speaker 1: --Model Cities--
Speaker 2: This was just, this was just work.  This was--
Speaker 1: CEDA [Community and Economic Development Association].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's probably what it was.  And I thought they can't do this.  I mean, right now, you know, you, you, if your husband is out, out of work you can't just go to the welfare office and say, you know, my husband and my family and I we need your help, and I think now you can, but you couldn't then.  What you had to do was pretend to separate.  He went one way and you stayed where you were so you could get the check and he had to slip in through the windows at night and didn't know who was watching.  And so I wrote, that's why I wrote the letter.  I sat down and I told them all about the welfare program and all about how families have to, you know, bootleg to be together and that I thought it was unfair they were gonna cut off, you know, the funds, just a whole bunch of things.  I do hope that you will take the letter and read it, but then a congressman got a hold to it and--
Speaker 1: This was [Congressman] Augustus [F. Hawkins]--
Speaker 2: Hawkins.
Speaker 1: --Hawkins.
Speaker 2: From Los Angeles, and he was a fan of the director of NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program].  He was a friend of Opal Jones who was the director of NAPP [Neighborhood Adult Participation Program] at the time, and he took the letter and had it put in the Congressional Record and it took off from there.  He took it to Mr. [Lyndon B.] President.  They was having a session, a meeting, and he addressed the president and then I guess the president told Mr. [Sargent] Shriver, asked him to look into it and he did and from there head start got more money, so did CEDA [Community and Economic Development Association], and so did some of the other programs.  Plus, the letter just, it went--Jack Jones of the [Los Angeles] Times wrote something.  It was in one of the religious papers.  It was in the paper here in Long Beach [California] several times.  So, it, it just kind of took off, you know.  A lot of people read it.  I got a lot of mail about it.
Speaker 1: People wanted to know who wrote it and?
Speaker 2: Yeah and wanted to know me--
Speaker 1: Know who you were.
Story_ID: 75600
Speaker 1: Some people that wrote it thought that I was exceptional because I had five babies and no husband and we're getting $333 a month and still making it, you know.  So, with God all things are possible, all things.  And when I tell you that I prayed a lot, I prayed a lot here, all the time.  And I believe that prayer changes things, and I'm not just saying that, that's my motto.  But, I wanna get back to the children to what you asked me.  You know I know that we have heroes.  You know we talk about George Washington, and we talk about him being the first president.  We talk about [Dr.] George Washington Carver who took the peanut and did so much with it and all in between, but we have some George Washington's and some George Washington Carver's out there now.  All they need is a little help.  We got some Lena Horne's and you know we got some Sammy Davis Jr's and we got some [President] John F. Kennedy's and some other folk.  You know and they just need a little help.  And you know with all this talk about war and all the stuff that we've been through, I would think that we would want to take our children closer to us and be more loving and more kind.  I mean, you look on TV, you, you see all that stuff.  You know, our youngsters, you talking about terrorists, our youngsters have been living in that for years.  I mean, you know, drive-by shootings, folks on drugs.  They said that this era, these years there have been more grandparents taking care of children than ever in the history of the world because of drugs, prostitution, death, all the rest of that stuff, you know, and I, I know what because I, you know, I have two.  Well, one is home now, but I've had two.  Had that little girl since she was two days old and I've had Anthony since he was about a year old.
Speaker 2: How old are they now?
Speaker 1: Anthony is nine, and she will be three in June of next year.
Speaker 2: You're helping raising grandchildren?
Speaker 1: Yes I am.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes I am.  I go pick up great grandchildren, you know, from school.
Speaker 2: You have great grandchildren now too?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From school, the whole bit.  And it's, it's all right.  That's what family is all about.  I'm okay with that.  As long as I can get in that little red car, you know, push the pedal and do this and, and be legal about it I'm okay.
Story_ID: 75601
Speaker 1: Like last year, year before last, they wanted me to run for the school board.  I'm not running for the school board, you know.  In politics I'll help you if you wanna run and I like you and if you're fair, you know, I'll help you, but I don't wanna be a politician.  That's not me.  And I've helped a lot of people to become what is that they wanted to become here in Long Beach.  I've worked very hard for some folk to win an election, but I don't wanna run, you know.  And I have all kind of friends over at the school board.  You know, I love Ed Even (ph.).  He was a principal at one time, then he ran for school board and won.  You know, and he really wanted me to win, to run.
Speaker 2: Why don't, why don't you wanna be a politician?
Speaker 1: Just don't.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't wanna go through that hassle.  I don't--you see with my mouth I know that someone will say something and I'm gonna answer them and it's not gonna be the correct answer, you know, and then I'm gonna be out there for the rest of my life.  Somebody will always remember that.  When you're in that position, you know, there a certain amount of responsibility you have to take for that position.
Speaker 2: So you see yourself as more of an agitator--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --than a negotiator?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, because what comes up, comes out.  And if I feel like you're in that position you're not doing anything with it, I'll say that.  You know, and that may be right or may be wrong, but I would say that.
Story_ID: 75602
Speaker 1: Tell, tell me this, did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: No.  My daddy [Benny A. Head] knew a little bit about it, but he wasn't certain.  My stepmother knows--when she came out to my son's funeral she said I've never seen so many people in one place, what did you do, you know.  They've, they've never--I don't think they understand.  You know, my children, my children are in kind of awe.  They know I'm their mother and they know what I do, but they don't quite know how I do it, you know.  How, how, who do you, how do you do this?  How, how, do you go out at night and do this?  How do you go in the daytime and find--I, I used to find clothes for folk.  I, I still will if somebody have to have it.  You have doctors, you know hospitals, I don't care, place for folks to live, but the city gave me that leverage.  They allowed me, and that's one thing I wanna tell you.  The city allowed me any leverage that I felt that I needed to do my job in community and human relations, okay.  You know, I could walk through any door and the city back me up.  When there was problems in the city, I drove the city car.  And, and I'm not bragging about no car, but I'm just saying I drove the city car and I represented the city in whatever it was that I did.  You know, they knew that I was not gonna take advantage of the fact that I worked for the city, that whatever it was that I did I was gonna be truthful and I wasn't gonna get the city in trouble.  You know, and I, I, you know, I had no problems.  I--my supervisor--we at one particular had the task of training the police department and whatever, minority business, you know, understanding I should say.  And, you know, the police is different.  You know, the police is the police they, they feel like they know and in certain ways maybe they do, you know, but there was still some things that could be said that would be helpful to them and, and we did that.  Only one time, one, one person got real nasty and I got nastier.  I won't tell you what I said to him, but I got nastier, you know so--
Speaker 1: Was he on the police department?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, the police is, is in a different world.  And, and they have to be by virtue of stuff that they come in contact with you know out there.  But, you know, you should take it one at a time.  Everybody is not a thief, a crook, you know, a liar.  So, anyway, that's what we were trying to instill in them, you know.  I'm, I'm not sure whether we got there or not.
Story_ID: 75603
Speaker 1: Ma'am can, can you tell me how--this is different from legacy, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As the lady with the smile.  That's how I'd like to be remembered.  I think that we don't smile enough.  You now, when you feel bad sometimes and somebody come along and smile at you that's all you need that day.  A smile is like a hug.  I'd like to be remembered as a lady with a smile.  A lady who tried to be helpful, who tried to be wise in her decisions, who tried to be a loving mother, a loving sister, and a loving friend, you know.  I, I try not to be negative.  I'm, I'm sure that there are times when I am, but I try to bring a little, a little sweetness, you know, into folks lives because I like a little sweetness in my life. You see I have been so strong--see what, what most people don't understand is that all along the way I needed somebody too.  But, because of my strength or the strength that they thought that I had, you know, I didn't get that.
Story_ID: 75604
Speaker 1: You know, I had five kids that I had to raise and there were times when I would have appreciated a buddy, you know, just saying some things that I needed to hear.  There were times when I, I didn't have money, you know, I really didn't.  I still don't, but I didn't then and people always thought that I had.  I didn't have.  The lord would--if somebody was hungry he'd make a way for me to go feed 'em.  You know and, and after I fed them I probably didn't have a nickel left, but I did it, okay.  So, you know, I think that sometimes even though you may project you know being superwoman or somebody, people should look beneath that and you know I would hope that they would.  You know, even now there's still, you know--and, and the reason why I think even though I said that I'd never get married anymore there were several suitors that was out there, but I think with my strength that they that I was a stronger woman and they just didn't want to be bothered, you know.  And I think that as a man, you know, you don't be afraid of a woman.  She, she wants to be loved.  She wants to be held, you know.  She wants to be whispered to.  You know just because you project that it does not mean that that's who you are or what you are.  That may be what you have to be to get that 12.48 an hour, you know, or something like that.  But when you get home and kick off your shoes and take the girdle off and the bra, you know, you, you wanna be held, you wanna be talked to.  You know, you don't wanna be lied to, you just wanna be loved.  And that was the one thing that--I mean even now, you know, at seventy-five do you know my children don't believe that there's a bad day.  My friends don't believe there's a bad day, but there are bad days and there are days when, you know, I, I wish somebody would just say come on, come on let's, let's go to a movie or let's just go, hang out.  You know every now and then somebody say come on catch the bus with me we gonna stay overnight in Las Vegas, well Las Vegas is not necessarily the place that I wanna stay overnight all the time, you know.  There are other places, you know.  You know what I like, I like going down to the ocean and listening to the roar of the water and looking at the water and daydreaming.  I used to do that when I got a chance to.
Story_ID: 75605
Speaker 1: But, there is so much that needs to be done even now.  You know with my own family, like I've got young grandchildren that have children that's on these two cent jobs that--and, and they can't juggle right now their time, so I go and pick one up at 11:30 and, and there's another one and he walks home now.  He might get out at 1:30 and he may get out at 2:15, but with all the stuff that's out there in the street, you know, every now and then we, we go pick him up-or watch him--or something.  You know, there's another one that, the great grandchild, that's in junior high school that gets out at 3:30 or 3:15.  Well, you know, by the time you do all that you can't even put a load of wash in there and get it out on time.  You know, so there's a lot of things that has to be done now.  I appreciate the fact though that my grandchildren and my children love their children.  You know, that we don't have no mistreating around here.  We, we can't have that.  As long as I live, none of them will go hungry, none of them will go raggedy, and none of them will go outdoors.  I thank God for this little piece of land.  You know, there's plenty of floor space, plenty beds, but it's four bedrooms in this house.  I, I don't have a den, and I don't have a den because my oldest, one of my older grandsons live in the back room that I wanna put a den in, and as long as he is back there I will not have a den.  It doesn't make any difference I'll go outside.  I'll sit on my front porch.  As long as they need me to go pick up somebody, as long as I can get there I will.  Young people mismanage their money, and they always need before their next pay day a couple of dollars to go get a taco or some milk or bread or something.  As long as I've got one, they will get it, you know, and, and, and, and maybe you might say well, you know, they're grown and they ought to be able to find their own way, but I had help along the way in many areas okay, and I intend to see to it that they have help too.
Speaker 2: Are any of them following in your footsteps?
Speaker 1: The one that's up there in the studio is trying to make a go of it with this studio, and he reads a lot.  He wants to have a political mind.  He also one day wants to open up a restaurant, and I told him I'm too old to cook.  I, you know, I cook a lot, but he wants me to cook.  He loves my cooking.  But, I don't whether he will do it or not.  But, now I've got a daughter that works with the ADD kids.  Is that what--I think that's what they are.
Speaker 2: ADC.
Speaker 1: No, not ADC.  They, their-
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  Attention deficit disorder.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Attention deficit disorder.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she's getting to be feisty now.  When somebody bothers her, she's learning how to go to the school board or to her councilperson if something is going wrong, so and, and this is one that's the evangelist or want to be called the evangelist--(unclear)--.  But, I think she's learning some of that.  And, and it is a learned behavior because I learned it, but a long time ago.  I started out maybe because of a need in Chicago [Illinois], I don't know.  I was in a young group, and that's what we used to do, but I think it's good, and I think you start out maybe being a good politician by being helpful.
Story_ID: 75606
Speaker 1: I think I would have made a good politician.  I would have also made a good attorney had I pursued it, but I just didn't.  I didn't really know what I wanted to do, you know, and if, if your sign has anything to do with it I'm a Gemini (laughter).  So, I don't know if that's had something to do with it or not.  But, all in all I enjoy living.  I've had some tough times, I mean some tough times.  When a policeman knock on your door and ask if anybody's home with you, you know you've got a problem.  When they came to the door on that Saturday afternoon and asked was there anybody home and one of my grandson's happen to be here, and he asked me again and when I brought him up and that's when he told me that my son had been killed.  When you lose a child, it's tough.  It's tough to lose your mama or your daddy, but it's even tougher to lose a child.  It's tough.  He was my oldest son.  But, you know I'm thankful that I did everything that I could, you know.  I, I couldn't make him a man 'cause I'm not a man and I didn't know how to be a man, but as a mother and a woman I did the best I could and hopefully some of that rubbed off on him and, and hopefully wherever he is now he's at peace.  But, that rock cocaine is something else.  Now I tell you what I would do if I had a chance.  If I was twenty-five years younger, I would become a policeman, and I would get rid of rock cocaine.  It would be no ifs, ands, or buts about it.  I believe that you can get rid of rock cocaine.  I believe it makes a lot of money for a lot of people in high places, and I believe that that's why we still have it.  But, it has killed and maimed and messed up so many folk and families.  As long as there's a demand for it, we're gonna have it, but I think that you can stop the demand and I think you can stop the flow of cocaine.  I really do.  This is the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, not only the free world, but in the world.  There is none that's any better, and I think that if we wanna get rid of cocaine like TB [tuberculosis] and meningitis, and all the rest of it then we can work at it and get rid of it.  I just don't think we wanna get rid of it.  And I don't think that the right person, even to the daughter of the governor of Florida, she's not the right person yet.  One of these days, the right person is gonna be caught or die from cocaine and then we'll get rid of it.  I don't know who that's gonna be, but the right person has not been caught yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The question was how would you like to be remembered, but I think you're saying that you'd like to be appreciated for--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: I'd like to be appre--yeah.
Speaker 2: You'd even like some help right now doing the things you're still doing.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not gonna be doing them too long, but I'd like for some--I'd like to be, be able to train--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --someone.
Speaker 2: To, to get other people to do the same thing.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And, and I think with that if it's just one at a time I, I think that we could be a cure all to some of the many things that's going on in all of our lives today.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you very much.  It was a pleasure talking to you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Story_ID: 75607
Speaker 1: Briefly describe who's in the photo and when and what, what are the circumstances.
Speaker 2: To my right is my son who has just made captain of the fire department for the City of Los Angeles [California], and that's his supervisor right there.  That is chief of the fire department to his right.
Speaker 1: That's my cousin Bertha who I came to live with in Chicago [Illinois] when I went there to live in Chicago when I left in 1942, when I left Tupelo [Kansas].
Speaker 2: Next. [Off camera discussion]
Speaker 1: That's my youngest son, Charles, who is now the captain of the LA [Los Angeles] Fire Department.
Speaker 2: Next.
Speaker 1: Do we have any baby pictures of you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Now that's a family photo.  That's a, a family picture with me.  At the bottom is to my left is Debra.  To my right is Charles, my youngest son.  Above him is my son, Jimmy.  Above, next to Jimmy, is Latrice, my oldest daughter.  Next to Latrice is Darlene, my second oldest daughter.
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  When was this taken?  Best guess.
Speaker 1: Charles was born in '62' [1962].  That was taken about 1967.
Speaker 2: Oh that's me, Dale Clinton.  I had just begun working, I believe, at the City of Long Beach, and I was with the Recreation Department at--
Speaker 1: (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's my brother Alvin, my oldest brother.  He had just come home from the Service.  He had been overseas.  He was on Pork Chop Hill, and he's at some, some club there in Chicago.  That is way, way back.  I don't even remember when.
Speaker 1: This is the letter that I wrote to the president of the United States, which was [Lyndon B.] Johnson in 1966, '67' [1967].
Speaker 2: Copy of the letter and it's in the community action digest which was put out by CAP, community action agency.  The date is on it, isn't it?
Speaker 1: January 1968.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me and some young man.  We were up in the hills at one of the training sessions up above Los Angeles.  I don't really remember where, but it was during the time that I was with the, the, the whole group of people that taught me how to be a trainer.
Speaker 1: [Off camera discussion]
Speaker 2: That's me and a young lady named Marilyn whose husband is now the president of a college in Poughkeepsie, New York.
Speaker 1: [Off camera discussion]
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  Did we get a year for that last one, approximate year?
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: That's the first black councilperson, Joe Wilson. The other lady is Terry Mosby (ph.) who was the chairperson, director of welfare rights here and me, and that's the, the--(unclear)--for the central area facility center which is now over there.  It's a multi-purpose center over at King's Park.
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  When was this taken or roughly decade if you can't remember the year.
Speaker 2: It was probably about 1970 or '71 [1971].  Is it on the back?
Speaker 1: That's Congressman Glenn Anderson, a friend of mine, Gloria Riggins (ph.) and me, and I was a representative of the congressman of the state democratic central committee.
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  Do you remember a year for this?  I know we're pressing you to remember.
Speaker 1: No I don't.  It had to be in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Seventy-six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen-seventy six, it says it at the top.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Twenty-second of February '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: [Off camera discussion]
Speaker 2: This is a night--this is Jim Wilson's--this, this was the last night for the election for Jim Wilson.  This is his second time running, and he had to run citywide.  They don't have to do that now.  At the lower left hand corner is the mayor and his wife.  To the other side in the lower right hand corner me and some other folk who was out there working for him.  And at the top is some of the same group to re-elect Jim Wilson to city councilperson.
Speaker 1: Next please.
Speaker 2: This is the Art Linkletter Show and my son happened to be one of the ones that was called up and asked a question.  That's Jimmy to my right, and Jimmy is about eight or nine years old there.  Jimmy is my son that was murdered in, eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, next. We should get a Xerox of that.
Speaker 2: This is my grandmother, Melinda Head, who's my father's mother.  She passed away June 10, 1936.
Speaker 1: [Off camera discussion] Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is the original letter that was written to the president, and the reason why it's significant is because my son burnt the bottom of it.  It was the first letter that came off the press, and they sent it to me.  It says my name is Dale Clinton, and I have a dream.
(VIDEOGRAPHER):  Can you tell us about the illustration?  You had a cover on it.  This was the cover for this?
Speaker 2: This is the cover, and he burnt it.  He twisted it, and he--(unclear)--to turn on one of the eyes on the stove where we kept it because we thought that that was significant.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is me and my granddaughter, Kristin, and my grandson, Anthony.  They are sister and brother.  This was taken-Anthony was about a year old, year and a half there in 19, about 1996 maybe.
Speaker 1: That's my brother John who passed away about five or six years ago.  He lived in Chicago.  His name was John Head.
Speaker 2: That's you?  That's you with him?
Speaker 1: No, that's a friend of his.
Speaker 2: [Off camera discussion]
Speaker 1: The lady in black is my stepmother Melissa.  The lady sitting to her left is my Aunt Rosa.  That's me by my aunt Rosa.  The first person that's leaning between the ladies is my oldest brother, Alvin, and the second person is my oldest brother's, one of my oldest brother's son.  And the lady that you can't hardly see is my old, is my brother's wife, Marguerite.
