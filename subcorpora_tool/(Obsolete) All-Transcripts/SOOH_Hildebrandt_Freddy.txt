 Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Today is Friday, May 16, 2014. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn also  with me is Jason Higgins. We   re with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at the OSU Library and today we   re in Broken  Arrow, Oklahoma, interviewing Freddy Hildebrandt. We   re going to talk  a little bit about his military and OSU experiences today. Freddy, thank  you so much for joining us.  You   re very welcome, very welcome.  Let   s begin and learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell me the  year you born and where you were born?  I was born June 5, 1931 in Enid, Oklahoma, General Hospital in Enid,  Oklahoma.  And tell me a little bit about your parents.  Well my dad, he was orphaned when he was about fourteen, fifteen  years old. His parents came here from Germany, I believe, Hamburg,  Germany. He was born, I believe, near Lucien, Oklahoma. I don   t know  if it   s still a town or not. My mother, she was born one of twelve  children on a farm southwest of Enid. It was homesteaded by my  grandfather during the Cherokee Strip, and they lost the farm.  My grandfather had mortgaged the farm to buy farms for his three sons  in Oklahoma. During the Depression and the Dust Bowl, they couldn   t  make it. They lost their farms and eventually, my grandparents lost  theirs. I believe, in 1943, my grandfather had died and my grandmother  had to move away. And that was a farm down by Imo, Oklahoma. It was  a big loss to the family, but coming out of the Depression nobody   the  kids didn   t have money to buy the farm. That   s just the way it was in  that time.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  How did your parents get to Enid?  Well, like I say, my grandparents homesteaded southwest of Enid, and  that   s where my mother grew up. My dad, when he became an orphan,  he first got a job on the railroad even though he was about fifteen or  sixteen. He said the only way he got it   he made I believe a dollar and a  half a day. The supervisor said he got a dollar, and the supervisor took  fifty cents is the only way he   d hire him, and that   s the way he worked  until he got a job out at my grandfather   s farm. They more or less  adopted him. My grandmother, she had the three sons and he almost  became another son at that time. He said that when she would buy them  clothes, why she   d buy him clothes too.  So, my parents grew up together and at that time on and eventually when  Dad came back from service, World War I, they were married. I believe,  1921, I   m pretty sure it was. So, that   s the way they got together. During  the after years, my dad did construction work all over northwest  Oklahoma. They followed that for a couple years and finally, he got a  job with, I believe it was the Roose Poultry Company in Enid. They  bought a home. Of course when the Depression hit, they were unable to  make payments on the house, and they lost it, so that was a big blow to  them, of course.  And my older brother Jack was born in 1927. He was born in that house  before they lost it and it was hard times. My grandfather had bought a  house at 518 West Oklahoma in Enid, so his kids could go to high  school, once they started getting out of grade school. They had a little  country school, a one room country school they called Turkey Creek  School and that   s where all their kids went to school until, I think, the  eighth grade. So, he bought a house in Enid and when the kids got old  enough to go to high school they all moved in there one at a time, or two  at a time, and graduated from Enid High. So that   s their history of high  school. We have most of the journals. They   re called, not journals, but  like the red book     The yearbook.     yearbooks, yes. Several of the kids that graduated from there, I   ve  kept them. In fact, I   ve kept about everything I ever had, ever owned and  my garage is full of it. It   s a shame I guess, but anyhow I don   t know  what   ll happen to all those things once Jack, David, and I are gone, but  anyhow we have that as history of our families.  Well, tell me a little bit about your experiences growing up. What was it  like for you?  6  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Well, it was great like my brothers have said. My mother stayed home.  My dad worked. There wasn   t any   no handouts or anything and  whatever he could work at, he did. It didn   t make any difference. Some  of the jobs didn   t last very long, but it kept us   we eventually, my  mother   s brothers and sisters all graduated from high school. They still  had the house in Enid and Dad and Mom bought the house at 518 West  Oklahoma, from my grandparents. When they lost the other house, they  moved in there. It was painted pink. It was one of the only pink houses  in Enid I think, but it was a good house.  Describe the house for me.  Well, it was three bedrooms, but the bedrooms were small, like eight by  tens, something like that. Really, there was no plumbing. Eventually,  they put a stool out for a bathroom, out on by the back porch, which we  didn   t have that plumbing. Other than that, we just had a water pipe  came into the kitchen with a faucet on it, and there was cups hanging  there. Everybody just turned the faucet on and that   s what we had. Mom  didn   t have a hot water tank for hot water and we didn   t have bathtubs.  When we were kids, we had a round bathtub or just a round tub that  mom used, the ones just like it to wash with, but that   s what we took our  baths in. Usually, David got to take the first bath and Mom would add a  tea-kettle of hot water and I   d take mine and then, she   d add more hot  water and Jack would finish up with his. Then one day, Dad came home  with the elongated tub and boy we thought we were really moving up  you know. Eventually, Dad put a hot water tank in and finished the bath  out and put a tub in and we were modern. So, it wasn   t the best, but it  was good enough and we got by. That was a good part of the house.  Did you share a room?  Oh yes, all three of us had one room. My cousins that lived out on farms  around Enid, if they didn   t have school, they came in and spent time at  our house and finished up. So we three boys all had one room, and  cousins had one, and my parents had one. That   s the way that went. My  parents were very, well they appreciated what they had. They shared  with everybody else. That   s just the way they were, so it was   we had a  great life and even though it was crowded.  Mom had a schedule. She washed every Monday. We boys got our tubs  up out of the basement and put them on the back porch and filled them  with water for her. She had an old ringer-type washing machine. I think  David   s still got it maybe, or he had it, moved it over to Stillwater.  Anyhow, she did that on Monday. On Tuesday, we had clotheslines. She  7  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  didn   t have a dryer and hung the clothes out on the clotheslines. Then  Tuesday, she did her ironing. She ironed everything by hand, of course.  And we knew every Monday, we were going to have beans because  that   s what she put on when she got up to start the washing. Then on  Saturday   s we helped her do the dusting in the house to clean it up. Just,  it was a family. That   s really what it was then was a family, and we all  worked together.  Well, what was your early schooling like?  Well we all, myself and my two brothers, we all went to Jefferson grade  school. Jack didn   t start there, but when we moved from, after my folks  lost their house, I think he started up at the other school and moved  down to Jefferson at the second grade. But I started there, first grade.  My first grade teacher was Lehoma Stall, and I was surprised about a  year ago to see she passed away. She was very elderly now, but I think  David my brother, younger brother had her. I still know the name of all  my teachers down there. They were wonderful. They were all women  but they cared about the kids, the pupils, and it was great.  We didn   t have air-conditioning and all the kids walked to school. We  didn   t have buses, but it was great times and we did the things that kids  don   t do now. At recess, we all went out and played. We didn   t have  phones, or the electronics like they have now. Course this sounds weird,  but we didn   t have television, you know, so when we got out of school,  we went home and we put on our old clothes and we went out and  played. That   s what we did.  And Jack worked pretty young and we had a little neighborhood grocery  store, J. B. Weaver   s, and that   s what it was, the neighborhood store.  During the Depression, he had helped a lot of people to keep them to eat,  you know. Things he just put everything on the book, so they stayed  with him after the Depression and they   d order things, and Mr. Weaver  would pay me. I had a little basket and I was only about ten or twelve  years old. I got a nickel for every delivery I made. I always had a few  coins jingling in my pocket back when I was, you know eleven or twelve  years old. We worked and eventually, Mr. Weaver had me help him in  the store, and he was very supportive. Some of the people didn   t want a  kid figuring up their grocery bills because we did it all on paper, and we  went wrote down how much everything was, but he supported me. He  got pretty angry at one woman when she didn   t want me to do her bill. I  can remember that just like it was yesterday because it meant a lot to be  supported, you know.  Another time, I delivered groceries, and the woman give me a nickel.  When I got back to grocery store, Mr. Weaver give me my nickel, and I  8  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  didn   t know whether to take it or not, but I did. So that night I asked Dad  if that was wrong, and he said,    Well, you better tell Mr. Weaver what  you did.    So I did, and he patted me on the back and said,    Yeah, you   re  a good delivery boy. You deserved it.    That   s just little things, but when  you   re a kid, you remember those things like that, so had a great, great  time growing up.  So, after Jefferson, you went to Enid High?  Well no, after Jefferson, went to Emerson Junior High.  Oh, Okay.  And after the sixth grade, we went up there to Emerson for the seventh,  eighth, and ninth grade. The year after my sixth grade, I was supposed to  go up there, but that   s the Enid High burnt down. And Enid High was a  big school. Enid only has one high school.  Can you tell me about the fire?  Well, it happened one evening and I don   t think they ever figured out  what started it, but it was a big fire and it was a big building. Been there  so long and it just gutted the whole thing and took it all. So, we had to  go back to grade school. All the grade schools had to take   the fire was  massive and people all over town, course came to see it. All the kids  were put back one year, into the grade schools again. Jack and the  people that was in high school, had to return to junior highs, so it was  tough for the kids, but it was war time you know. That   s the way that  happened.  Well, it was war time, what was your impression of everything going on  from your perspective?  Well, for me, we worried about Dad having to go back into the service  you know. That was most people   s worries. Everybody, not everybody,  but the majority of people were very patriotic. They instilled that in us  kids. We picked up metal and we bought saving stamps, ten, twenty-five  cent saving stamps. We did everything. We formed neighborhood  armies. We would go through garages and things that had copper  especially, that   s what the government needed. Just do things like that  for weeks on-end and the kids were all into it. They were willing to do  those things. We made model airplanes and donated them at certain  times, like the bombers and pursuit planes   and donated them to the  government, so they could use them in instructions at their classes. Like  I say, we bought savings stamps and saved our money. Every class had a  goal of what they wanted to do for the service.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  So everybody is involved in the services and it was quite a time to be  able to see what was going on in the world. I think it enlightened the  kids in that era to geography, where countries were located and things  such as that. It was quite an educational period of our life to see what  countries was fighting what other countries. We had news reels at the  movies and that   s, like I say, we didn   t have television, so we didn   t  really know what was going on. We did have radio, but it was a different  time. It was really a different time.  My brothers and I have really seen a change in everything. The  electronics is unbelievable, what it   s developed into now. I can   t even  understand things that I   m using. I didn   t want what all we have now,  but my kids, they buy it for me. At one time they came out with  microwave ovens. I said,    Man, I don   t want one of those things to have  to worry with.    It   s something new and, but we got one. Boy, I don   t  know how people used to live without them now. It   s the same way with  our telephones now. Just everything, it   s quite an experience to live from  one development into the next.  Well, in high school, what were you thinking was going to be your next  step? What did you want to be when you grew up?  I really wanted to do something outdoors. I   ve always been an outdoor  person and I think when I filled out things in high school, development  and this and that, I would have liked to have been a farmer, but had no  money to buy a farm, so that went out of the way. I didn   t have money  to go to college on anyhow. My Dad and Mom was wonderful parents.  They were wonderful. I guess for me, the best parents a person could  have, but we didn   t have money and they lived on a very limited income  and I knew they couldn   t help me with finances. And I wasn   t smart  enough to get scholarships or athletic enough. I did try to play baseball  at Stillwater under Toby Green, but I wasn   t good enough to make the  baseball team, so that didn   t work out.  Well, how did you get to Stillwater? Why did you choose A M?  Well, all my family went over there and my brother was going over  there, and he was on the GI Bill. He said,    We can make it,    and my dad  wanted all of us to go to college. He didn   t have the chance to and he  wanted us to. So, we talked it over, and I said,    Well, I need to work a  year to get pocket-money at least.    I decided, with Jack   s help and by  working, that I could maybe make it. So I worked a year after high  school and I worked for twenty-five dollars a week, six days a week at  the same distributorship that my dad worked at. He made fifty bucks a  week. I made twenty-five. That was six days a week and more than eight  10  hours a day. I ended up making about  300 that whole summer, but it  was enough to start on the next year.  And you probably   the Aggiette Wave Shop was at 122 South Duck in  Stillwater and it was the Duprees. She owned it and her two daughters,  Dorothy and I can   t think of Dorothy   s sister   s name, they were beauty  operators there. So she had closed up the little walkway between two of  the bedrooms up and it was like four feet wide and ten feet long, there  was a window in the end, and she put plywood up and cut a whole in  that for a door, and that was my room. It was twelve dollars a month.  Jack had a room up with a roommate. They paid fifteen dollars and she  had two other rooms up that some of the guys from Enid stayed at. So, I  had a great bunch of guys up there, really was. Miss DuPree was a  wonderful lady. She let me do yard work and I did the floors at the  beauty shop after the first year.  The first year, it was tough because the GIs were still, a lot of them still  there. Classes, a lot of them were at night and on Saturdays, and that   s  where I ended up. I decided to get a degree or try to get a degree as a  wildlife biologist in wildlife management, so that   s what I chose. Of  course, all those classes had labs with them. So the first year it was  really tough, but then Jack and Mary moved over there, their last  semester. I walked over to where they stayed. They had a little  apartment on the third floor of a house that had slanted walls in it or  ceilings in it. It wasn   t that bad. I made it and then, I got jobs from the  employment office there at the school, fifty cents an hour, and by golly,  we made it.  Jack, I heard him say that, how we made it, but there was a lady, her  name was Miss Conners down on Sixth Street and Duck. She had     many of the boys roomed there. She also had a lady, a big Swedish lady  that did the cooking. We could go down there and eat, sixty-five cents  for an evening meal, so Jack and I found if we had a cup of coffee and a  spudnut   you   ve probably never heard of a spudnuts, but there used to a  spudnut shop over on Knoblock. We could have spudnut and coffee for a  dime, and I think they called that the Chilibowl. We could get a bowl of  Chili for a quarter, and go down there for sixty-five cents, and eat all we  could hold in the evening. We got by on a dollar a day.  And so it was   with the cheap rooms and eating that, and we didn   t  have cars. There was no expense, so wherever we went, we just, we  walked. Study in our rooms at night, you know, and I learned to smoke a  pipe, which I didn   t buy cigarettes, and we didn   t buy clothes. We didn   t  have to pay for upkeep on a car or anything. When we went home on the  weekends, we hitchhiked, so it wasn   t a real lavish style of living, but  we enjoyed it. It was a great time for us. Of course, he graduated and  11  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  then we had other guys. Some of my younger brother   s friends moved  up there and so it was a great place. I think they   re tearing down the or  remodeling the Aggiette Wave Shop at 122 South Duck now, but it  was   we had a great experience at Stillwater. We really did.  Well, did you take ROTC?  Oh yes, did that and that was another thing that helped me because we  got a little check from the government. I can   t remember much how  much it was   it wasn   t very much, but it was enough. At least we could  keep out uniforms cleaned, and we did that every Tuesday afternoon.  We had parade over there and went to classes during the week. In 19   I  guess the summer of 1953, had to go to Fort Benning, Georgia for  training down there, and we trained as just a regular Army   as just  regular privates down there. Then I was supposed to graduate in May of     54, but there was a class I needed to take to get my degree, and I had to  back to the fall.  Then, I was supposed to go into the service and report back to Fort  Benning, Georgia in   I believe it was January of    55. I was ready to do  that because I was getting out of school, and then, they changed my  orders to   I believe   March the eleventh. I didn   t know why, but the  government was changing the GI Bill in February. So, instead of getting  the GI Bill, where I could come back and go back to school, I got  nothing now. I guess it saved the taxpayers money, but we didn   t get any  benefits out of our service, but that   s the way it was.  So I went into service, I believe on March 11, 1955, and we did our  training. I believe July the twenty-third, we got out of Fort Benning,  Georgia, got our orders and all the other classes had been going to  Germany and by golly, I ended up going to Korea.  Lucky you   So I said,    Well, wow     And didn   t know for sure, one thing, the war  was just over. So that was great for me, but anyhow, it ended up being a  very lucky thing for me because I met Heasuk there. I got to take thirty-day  leave after I got out Fort Benning, Georgia, and I went home. I got  to spend those thirty days with my family, my dad especially. He was a  big fisherman and he and I went fishing all the time. He was still trying  to work, and he had heart trouble, but I got to do that, and then I reported  to Fort Lewis, Washington, and did some other things, getting ready to  go on over.  Well, let   s back up a little bit and talk about your training at Fort  Benning.  12  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Okay.  What was going on? How were they trying to prepare you? What were  you learning?  Well we were learning tactics because they was still not sure what was  going to happen over there and we were in the field. We did a lot of  training, and well, about all of it. Of course, we did our calisthenics  every day to get us in shape, to be able to do that and we had classes like  map reading or military maps, and how to handle men, what to do for  different duties and you could be assigned a company and have many  extra duties, which that was the case later on because there wasn   t  anybody over in Korea, as far as junior officers. So all of that was really,  really good training down there. We had night patrols, and well, how to  handle men or how they thought we should handle men and, things to  look for, things to expect, things that happen that you can   t imagine, and  so that was the training down there.  So what was your military occupation?  Well I was a 1582, which was infantry platoon leader, basically what it  was   a junior officer. I think that was the number. That   s what it was. I  wore the blue ribbon around my shoulder, which indicated infantry.  They tried to teach us to expect things that we was going to have to do,  out in the field. We weren   t going to be sitting behind an office desk  much and different warfare that the communists, especially the Chinese,  had used in Korea in the areas that they had occupied and if things  happened, how to handle the things.  Being assigned infantry, knowing that   s what you was going to do, it  made it easier to try to understand what to expect. So it wasn   t the best  assignment in the world, but it was good because when we went over  there, we went up on the line and even though we weren   t right on the  DMZ  Demilitarized Zone , I ended up north of the 38th Parallel, that  was supposed to be the dividing, but the DMZ variated between the  north and south of that.  Our camp   and you know I can   t remember that camp   s name   it was  really a tent-camp is what it was. It was second battalion. We had     everybody slept in tents, and we were lucky because there was six  officers to a tent and there was eight guys to a tent, so we had a little  more room than the enlisted men had, but that was a great experience  that some of them really couldn   t handle, but I was lucky because I had  been hunting and fishing with my dad all my life. I was outdoors. I had  worked all my life. I was in pretty good shape. Sleeping in a tent in the  13  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  wintertime, it was cold. And sleeping in a tent in the summertime, it was  hot and bugs and things, but     You went from Fort Benning to Washington.  Right.  Tell me about travelling to Korea.  All right, in those days, everything was prop-driven airplanes, so we  went from Fort Lewis   we were only there, I think, three weeks   and  we went right down and had a little backlog in Hawaii. We flew from  L.A.  Los Angeles  to Hawaii, and they said,    Oh, you better be  prepared to spend some time because there   s a big backlog.    Well,  everybody said,    Wow  That   d be great  We   re going to spend maybe  two weeks in Hawaii.    Well, that was wonderful, but my luck, there was  a plane available in Hawaii that they leased, that the government leased.  We there over night, got right back on that plane, and took off for Wake  Island. That was the next stop and then from Wake, we went to Tokyo.  Then from Tokyo, we boarded a ship, and went around the southern part  of Japan to Inson, Korea, and debarked there and went into Korea and  processed there for a day or two and then went on up to our assignments,  to the different posts.  Well before we get into your experiences in Korea, tell me a little bit     something about your fellow soldiers.  Well even though we all got through Fort Benning, I was lucky because  they took Hamilton, Hinshelwood, Hildebrandt, couple others, right out  of my platoon at Fort Benning, assigned us to the same unit in Korea,  and three of us was in the same tent up on the line, which was great  because we knew each other. Well one problem, with a guy at the camp  up there   they issued us, or they issued each of us, I think, five sets of  fatigues and name-plates, and they said go down to the tailor shop here.  He was a Korean and he had an old, old sewing machine, and he would  sew our names on those tags to put on our fatigues. So Hinshelwood,  Hildebrandt, and  Huffstetler , we went down there and give the guy the  fatigues and the name plates or tags, and told him our names. He saw all  that Hinshelwood and Hildebrandt. He just threw his hands up in the air  and he walked out of the tent because that was pretty tough to do that, all  those names on an old that was tough, but he came back in and we  finally got our fatigues.  We all got along great. We really did. We helped each other and it was  an experience. I wasn   t there the full length of time because I got some  other, a couple of other jobs. One other that I had to leave the line,  14  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  which was good for me because I was assigned as the officer in charge  of the courier station down at Seoul, on an air base, in a Quonset hut.  And even though we didn   t have a bathroom in there, we had a little ice-thing  out the side that we could keep cold beer in with ice that they  supplied. We had electricity.  Up on the line, of course, we had no plumbing, and I say on the line, we  were just back of the line in a support position, but we had no electricity,  and no   the water, we got in five gallon cans and we had to save enough  water that we could put into a fifty-five gallon drum that we had put  up   somebody had put up   behind the tent, so we could have   take a  shower, but it takes some time to collect enough water. I think we got  two five gallon cans a week if I remember right.  That   s a big switch from infantry to mail.  Oh, yes. You mean from going up on the line down to Seoul?  Yes.  Oh, it   s like moving into Taj Mahal.  You won the lottery.  I did.  Yes.  And that was because, I think, when I first got up there, in about a week,  my captain, Captain Scoggins   I better not say too many names here.  They may still be alive. He had been trying to go on R R, and he had  one other officer in the company, and that officer had got transferred and  got a better job, up at headquarters. He finally got his R R, so he put  out temporary orders that I would be acting company commander. I was  the only officer and boy, I really got thrown into something, coming  right out of Fort Benning, Georgia. These guys, most of them, a lot of  them, had come through the Second World War.  The first thing I did, I went to our class eight store and I got two bottles  of whiskey, went back to the company, called a meeting of all my  sergeants, and we settled in there with some glasses and some cans,  rusty cans, of Coca-Cola, and fixed a drink. I give my little speech. I  said,    I   m not fooling anybody. Y   all are old-timers, here. You   ve been  in the service for years. I   m going to ask for your help, and I   ll be  responsible, and I   ll take the blame for anything that happens, but I want  to ask you to help me run this company.    I said,    You know that I don   t  15  Nykolaiszyn  Higgins  Hildebrandt  know everything about this. You   ve been in service...    Some of them  had been in service for twenty-five years, and you know, from that day  on, that was the greatest bunch of guys you ever saw and they did it.  They run it for me and I still remember their names.  If I knew any of them was alive, I   d get in contact with them today and  thank them, but we had a great journey. I got good reports because of  their help for me. I went from there up to assistant to Battalion Three,  and the company commander that came in after Scoggins, he had bad  kidneys. I don   t know from what reason. He had to go about another  year to get his retirement, and he really couldn   t do much. While I was  there, I did everything for him. I led the company out. I was always     that   s one thing I did, I never rode a vehicle to the field. I always walked  out with my company. I got good reports on that too and that   s how I  think I got my job at the courier station at Seoul was because helping  those people out like that and what they had done for me. We become  really good friends, not just as officers or non-commissioned officers     but we all become good friends. I appreciated what they did for me. I  surely did.  Jason, questions?  Yes of course, so you met your wife in Korea, correct?  Yes, she had   Bank of America had opened a little branch there, and  my wife spoke good English. They opened that branch so that the  soldiers could have some way to send money home or do some kind of  banking. She worked there, and the only problem there, she was, to me,  a very beautiful young girl. I mean she really was. I was very attracted to  her, but they couldn   t date GIs. The bank would not let them. So even  though I got to know her, couldn   t really do much. I met her parents and  her brothers. One of them liked movies as well as she did, so by getting  Shinyok to go with us to the movies, we could go to the base movie  theaters every night if we wanted to because they didn   t know if she was  going in with him or with me.  That   s kind of how we dated, and I had my own Jeep, and at the airbase  a K-16. After several months, I found out I was really in love with her.  She was so much fun to be around and she was young and funny. Then  came the time I had to come home. I didn   t know what to do. At that  time, the chaplains over there wouldn   t really recommend marrying the  girls. They had some bad experiences during the Second World War. I  told her,    You wait for me. I   ll be back.    I had to get on the plane and  leave. I knew I was going to be miserable, and I was.  I came home and I put in for a passport and a visa and worked. I got a  16  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  job at Stillwater, Gene Smeltzer. I better quit telling names here. He had,  well he had a big, what   s the name of that restaurant he had? Yeah, I got  a job running Louie   s Club Forty, if you   ve ever heard of it. It was there  on North Main, up around the curve. Boy, that was an experience  because all the football players like to come up there, and I could   ve  been, I guess, killed or in a bad fight every night if I wanted to be.  Anyhow, I was going to work hard, make him some money, and then I  was going to get a better deal out of the job, and I did. I was there every  day. Then came time for a better deal, and it didn   t work out, so I quit  that.  All right, picking back up.  I guess I mentioned Louie   s Club Forty, and that didn   t work out, so I  went back to Enid and got a job out at Vance Air Base working  construction. I made, I think, a  1.36 an hour out there. Saved enough  money, I thought   well, I knew I didn   t but I borrowed the rest of the  money from my two brothers, that I needed for a plane ticket over to  Korea, when I got my passport and the visa. I went back in October of  1957, and Heasuk and her brother met me at the airport. They had a  friend, a doctor that had a big house that he used to put patients in  rooms, and it was just a residence really, but it had a lot of rooms in it. I  stayed there until October the eighth. We got all out paperwork worked  out and went to the mayor   s office in Seoul, Korea, and his two  assistants came in, and we were married in his office.  The U.S. government, they recognized the marriage. We were able to  make plans to come back to the United States. We had a big meal.  That   s all that was at our wedding, just four people. It wasn   t very  elaborate, but it was what we could afford. She had gotten me this ring,  and she wanted to know if it was all right. I said,    Yes, it   s fine with  me.    She wanted to know if I would like to have a diamond put in it, and  money she had been making   she had bought gold with it over there.  She sold some of the gold she had put away, put a diamond in there, put  it on my finger   I   ve never taken it off, not once. I   ve never been   I   ve  never regretted it.  We   ve had a wonderful life together. She   s been homesick many times.  There was things we used to do to try to alleviate that. She had friends in  California who had come over, so we   d try to go to California once a  year, and we did. Sometimes we had to borrow my brothers    cars, but  we did and they were very   I was really lucky because my brothers and  my parents, and my relatives all of them, they accepted Heasuk. They  loved her as much as I did. It   s just been a wonderful life for me. I  couldn   t wish for anything more.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Higgins  Hildebrandt  Higgins  Hildebrandt  You probably didn   t expect your trip to Korea would result in this type  of love story.  No, no. I had no idea. In fact, I had one of my parent   s friends   one of  the last things she said,    Now, don   t bring one of those Chinamen home  with you.    Because of the experiences some of the GIs had had during  their trips to Europe, Italy, over in there. So there was some of them that  was really surprised, that I brought   or had to go back and get her. I had  no idea that I would. But, as my other brother has said, in college, we  didn   t date. We didn   t have any money. We didn   t have a car. We didn   t  have clothes, really, and we didn   t go places. I didn   t date. I really fell in  love with my wife, my future wife, and I   ve never been sorry.  So you fell in love while you were in Korea     Yes.  It seems that it was the greatest experience while you were in Korea,  could you describe what was, perhaps, most difficult thing in Korea?  Well, the living conditions up on the line, but I look back at those  experiences, sleeping in tents, and not having   not being able to take  showers. You come in after being out in the field all day, dusty, dirty,  insect bites and boy, a shower would be good. There just wasn   t any way  to do it. You just didn   t have it and, but there was other things. I still  remember, it   s really stuck in my mind, one night, we were up on a  mountain, and my company commander said,    Fred, we   ve got an order  to get the guys out and get them up and ready. We   ve got to pull back  down.    It had been raining. It turned all cold, and it was freezing. I had  to go. We had fixed our position, and like if there had been an attack,  we   d be where we should be for that type of situation. It wasn   t anything  that they expected, but it was training.  So I got them up. Everybody was really unhappy, probably about, I  think, about 178 of us up there, what was in our company. We were  weighed down. Got them up and started down off the mountain. They  were slipping and falling, equipment was sliding, and I had my field first  sergeant, Johnny C. Fry   I   ll never forget him. He was a big black man,  been in the service for a long time, and he and I had been good friends  and we were coming down. We had the men all coming down behind us  in columns. I was really unhappy. I was griping. I said,    I don   t know  what in the hell, something like this has to come up     He said,    Sir,        he put his hand on my shoulder   he says,    Sir, there   s nobody shooting  at us.    He was right, you know.  The people who had been there a year or two before, gone through the  18  Higgins  Hildebrandt  Higgins  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  war, they had to do those things and people were trying to kill them, you  know, shooting at them and here I was complaining, and it wasn   t  anybody shooting at us. All we had to do was walk down the mountain,  and I never forgot that, and I didn   t complain anymore about any of the  training up there at that time. That set in with me that he was right.  Nobody was shooting at us. We lucked out, so I didn   t complain  anymore, but that   s one of the things that I remember most. I mean it   s  really stuck in my mind, that I was complaining about something, and I  shouldn   t have been.  Were the effects of the war, from a year before that, still prevalent,  where you could see?  Oh yes. We got in a mine field one time that had been burnt off, and  there wasn   t any indication that there was mines there, but we found ten  plaques later on that indicated that that   s what it was. I took the men  right in through it. I had to stop everybody, and they had to get some  people up there to clear it, to be sure that we could get out of it. Yes,  there was all kinds of stuff like that going on, so you had to be careful.  They were still finding weapons that had been lost or stolen. Some of  them had been stolen. Things like that, you could see. Of course, we  were just a little ways up to the DMZ, so you never knew what was  going to happen, but we didn   t have any problem with that, really.  Did you notice the effects on the civilian populations?  Yes. That was still   there were a lot of orphans left up through the  countryside, you know. You see little kids, like seven or eight years old,  with little feet that long, wearing big old army boots, size eleven and  twelves because that   s all they had. It was just   it was too bad that war  had torn everything up there. Of course, you had casualties that had not  been taken care of   civilian casualties, that there was no facilities for  them. They had been shot or maimed in some way and would lay along  the road, begging for something.  There was an orphanage, not far from where our camp was and even  though there wasn   t any city or town around us anywhere, when guys  would go on R R, everybody   d bring back toys or something to take  down there. GIs are pretty wonderful people really. They really are. So  anyhow, the experience of that part of it up there, you really appreciate  little things like electricity and plumbing.  Have you kept in touch with any of your fellow soldiers?  Yes. Yes, Jack Bartingale was just through Oklahoma City three weeks  ago. He and I served together as couriers there at the courier station. I  19  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  was the officer in charge, and I had a clerk and three other courier  officers and Jack was one of them. We, of course, bond. He sends me a  Christmas card every Christmas, he and Carol, and they have pictures of  their kids   ever since their kids, and now their grandkids. He and Carol  came through about three weeks ago and we spent the night. We went  out for a meal. Several of the others, of course, a lot of them have passed  on.  I   m surprised I   m still here, but I   m real lucky and I   ve still got my two  brothers, I   ve still got my three sister-in-laws or two sister-in-laws, and  my wife. We   re really a lucky family. We   ve all got along well. Good  marriages. Good kids. Grandkids. I get emotional because I   m so lucky,  I think. I really am. Some things, that when I think about them, tears  come to my eyes. I can   t help it, but it   s because of all the good things  that   s happened to me.  I think back to Stillwater and I only failed one class in Stillwater and  he   s the one scholarship I send money to, that   s the Bryan P. Glass. He  was a teacher of comparative anatomy. He was a great teacher and I  guess I was just so dumb that I had to have the course and I took it, had  to, and I failed it. He failed me, and he told me,    Fred, I hate to do it,     but he said,    You know, you   ve got all these pre-med and pre-vet  students in here, and they fight for every point, and you   re just at the  bottom of the class, and he said I have no other choice.    And, he failed  me, and I said,    Well, I realize that I   ll have to take it over.    He said,     Yeah, you   ll have to take it over because you   ve got to have it.    So, I  did, but he died here, about, oh, it   s been about two years ago. The  money I send up to school, I have them apply that to his scholarship  program. I was in the same class that my older brother was,  and   sometimes we   d have classes outside. And, I   d remember that guy   s  name, that professor, rode the bike, and I can   t recall his name right  now, but he was   it   s surprising how you remember some of your  instructors for what they do, you know.  Well, when you were in   was Seoul your last stop overseas, before  coming home?  Yes.  And at what point did you know that your time in the service had come  to an end? Did you receive your orders?  Yes and that   s one reason I was going to be discharged, I think in   well,  they had them kind of messed up because they changed me when  I   went in, I wouldn   t get the GI Bill to save some money. So anyhow, then  when at Christmas time, I got orders that I was going to leave, I believe,  20  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  on December the ninth because of early release. They didn   t want to  reassign me just for a couple of months. I actually thought about going  AWOL  Absent Without Official Leave  because I didn   t want to go off  and leave her, but I did, left her and got on the plane at Seoul at Inchon  there. Kimpo really, I guess that   s the official. When we taxied off of the  runway, I knew, I just had such a sunken feeling that I couldn   t hardly  stand it. If I could re-up   d to stay over there, I would   ve, but I couldn   t.  I got on the plane, and we landed in L.A. I had a couple others on there  that I served all the time with over at Korea. Huffstetler, that   s the other  guy that I was trying to tell you that little Korea seamstress, he was one  of the others that went down there, but anyhow, he and I, and Hamilton,  and a couple of others, we landed in L.A., and had the meeting where  they told everybody what we was going to get, and our travels and all  right there. Then, I flew from there to Enid, Oklahoma, and I met my  parents there.  Tell me about the transition back to civilian life.  To me, well, everything was not a big deal because all I could think  about was getting back to Korea and marrying my wife. I really did.  That   s about all I could think about. So, as soon as I could get a job, I  did. I   d never owned a car, so my older brother let me use his car around  Stillwater. One of the guys that came out to the club was named Ward. I  don   t know if Ward still has the automobile dealership in Stillwater, or  not, but anyhow, he came out, and we were talking. He said,    Listen if  you want a car, I got these old people that brought in a Buick, and said  it   s in great shape, and I could let you have that for  225.    I said,    Well,  Mike, I don   t have  225, but I   ll pay it, pay you off, and I   ll sign a note  on it.    So, he brought me out this old    48 Buick, and it was a good ol     car. In fact, I ended up   a guy hit it in the front and dented it all up and I  ended up selling it to my younger brother. He used it to go back and  forth to work or something for a while. That   s the transportation I got at  Stillwater, first from my brother, use of his car. Then I bought that one.  I   ve already forgotten now, what you asked about.  Oh, your transition back to civilian life.  Well, I think my wife is listening in. She thinks I   m pretty funny. I had  two or three things I was really good at. One was drinking, I could really  hold my liquor, which isn   t anything to tell a lot of people about, but  that   s one of things out of service that people did. In Korea, to start with  up on the line, that   s all you had to do at night because there wasn   t any  electricity, and you didn   t have any lights on at night, or radios, or  anything, so I came back to about the same way I left. It wasn   t that big  of a deal for me except I couldn   t think much except for going back to  21  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Korea.  Then, after we came back and we were married, that was kind of a  problem because there wasn   t any Koreans living in Enid, Oklahoma. So  there wasn   t much of anything for her to do, anybody to call to talk with  or anything. She had some rough times and here again I was lucky that  my relatives and my mom and dad   so what was I going to do? She had  liked to move to Los Angeles is what she   d liked to do.  Of course, I didn   t want to do that. I had been told by Dr. Baumgartner  in Stillwater when I came back to come over, and he   d help me get a  fellowship, so I could go into being a biologist in wildlife, which I  wanted to do. I wanted to be a water fowl biologist and he said he would  help me.  Well, of course I thought I was going to get the GI Bill again, which I  didn   t, but with the fellowship I could   ve gone back. Then I got to  thinking she   s not going to be happy if I   m out in the field in a little  cabin, doing work. What   s she going to be doing? So I tried to find  something in Enid for a while, so she   d be with my relatives, and they  could help her, which they did. They were just wonderful. Finally, I did  some odd jobs for a while, just to make money. My mom had a friend  who was the postmaster in Enid. He said,    Well, Freddy has worked  here during Christmas in college. Tell him to come up, and we   ll get him  on here,    which I did.  I went to work at the post office. I worked there for several years, and  then, the kids came along. I wanted to try to have some preparation for  them to go to college, and to take care of them. So I eventually  transferred over to the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF),  and we moved to Houston. There was more Korean people down there  and lots of things to do. We had a great time at Houston. My relatives  could come down and visit us then down there. She was happy, so that  was great. I had a chance to transfer back to Oklahoma City with the  bureau. So I did that and we came back home, and we lived there at  Yukon ever since.  How many children do you have?  We have two. We have a boy and a girl. The girl is married and lives in  New Jersey. She   s got two grandkids for us. My son is in partnership  with a man at Carlton Construction down at Dallas, and they live now at  Pilot Point, Texas. I don   t know how familiar either one of you are from  Texas or not, but anyhow that   s where he lives.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  My son got the outstanding Asian award, proprietor, I think, for Dallas  which was quite an honor. He got presented as his credentials, by Rick  Perry, the governor down there. They   ve just bought another place, and  he   s built a tremendous barn. In one end, he   s put a big apartment in it  for the wife and I to move down there when we need to and they   re  building a house right next to it, so they   ll be there. I   m not sure when  that time is coming, but anyhow, it   s available. We   ve got wonderful  kids. Wonderful grandkids. Like I say, I kind of wish someone would  make a movie of my life. (Laughs) I think it   d sell a few tickets.  But anyhow, I   m a very, very lucky person, and I appreciate life. I  believe in being good. I   d like to tell some young people some things I  think would help the modern day kids.  Like what? What would you tell the young people?  Well, I   d tell them to put some of that electronics away and get outside  and do some things that they need to be doing. I think it would be good  for them. I   d tell them to think about marriage. I think it   s really  important. I think it   s between a man and a woman. I   ll get criticized,  maybe get my house blown up for saying that, but I think it is. I think  the main thing about marriage is fidelity. That   s the greatest thing.  Everything else in a marriage, money problems, or things like that, can  all be worked out, and can all be forgiven and forgotten, but infidelity  can   t be. I think that living a decent life and helping other people is a big  part of life. It should be recognized. I don   t care how much money I had  when I died, if people would say,    Well, he was good old boy,    would  be all I   d really care about. If nothing else, that would be good enough. I  realize modern day thinking is a lot different than what I believe in, but I  think it   s worked for me. I   ve been happy with it.  You were born in Oklahoma and you   ve been away from the state, and  you came back   what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well course, I have grounds from my grandparents    homesteading. That  means a lot, and they were hard working people. Today   s generation  couldn   t live like they did. My grandmother, raising all those kids  without a bathroom or running water or electricity. I don   t know how  she did it and my granddad, you know he came in plowing all day,  putting the horses up, and milking the cows. He didn   t go in take a  shower, sit down, and watch TV, because they didn   t have anything like  that. It was a different way of life and they worked hard. I appreciate all  they   ve done for me.  I appreciate what my folks did for me, and I   ve tried   I don   t know if I  can say it   but I   ve always tried to live with one thought since I was a  23  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Higgins  Hildebrandt  kid, and since I   ve got married, and had a wife and kids, and not only  my parents, and my brothers and sister-in-laws   I   ve tried to never do  anything that they   d be ashamed of if they knew about it. Now I have  driven home after working in a brewery all day, and maybe had a few  too many free beers, but that   s nothing really bad. I didn   t have any  wrecks and hurt anybody, but other than that, I   m not really ashamed of  anything I   ve done, and I   m happy that I haven   t had to worry about  doing anything like that. So it   s a different way of life and we   re all, the  six of us   we   re really fortunate to still be alive. My brother says a  prayer every time we sit down to a meal. If he doesn   t, I do, about all the  blessings we   ve had, and he still lets us all be together like this. I   ve got  a problem that I can   t cure, but we get along and we   re happy, and that   s  the main thing.  Well, looking back on your life, and your career, and your family, how  would you like to be remembered?  Well that   s like the same way, that he was a good guy. I   ve always tried  to be. I really have. I   ve helped a lot of people that I   ve never said  anything about. I   ve tried to contribute to organizations that I think  really do well, for mankind. We don   t have any money, really, but we  have provided, my wife has provided. She   s helped out in every way, so  we have a decent life now. That   s kind of the bad part now. She can   t  enjoy everything that we had planned, but we have been a lot of places,  done a lot of things. I really have no regrets.  What was, perhaps, the greatest change that you   ve witnessed  throughout your life?  Boy, there   s been so many of them in my life, seventy-eighty years. The  greatest change, I guess probably the electronics. One reason is because  I don   t understand it all, can   t understand it all, never would be able to.  It   s just changed everything in the world. We used to go to the movies  on weekends and we used to see the Movietone news, and they   d tell  you what all happened during the week. That would be because there  was no television to do that.  We went through the Depression and the Dust Bowl. We had no  television to keep us inside, and up at Enid, there   d be big clouds of dust  move in, and we were kids. We weren   t going to sit inside all day doing  nothing, so Mom took an old bed sheet and she cut up large squares like  handkerchiefs, things that she could tie around our heads, so we could  go outside and play. We   d play all day out in the dust. At noon, we   d  have to change those. There   d be a round area of dust around our nose  and mouth where we   d been breathing all day. It was because we were  outside playing. We didn   t want to sit inside coloring books or  24  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  Hildebrandt  Nykolaiszyn  something. We had to do something.  Nowadays, kids don   t have to do that. That   s been one of the biggest  changes too is just the electronics, what it has brought to families, and it  helps control things like that. You think back to those days and we  didn   t even know that there was anything really wrong.  Just a different time.  It was a different time. Yes.  Well, is there anything else that you would like to add that we haven   t  spoken about today?  No, I don   t know of anything. I think we   ve covered a lot. I   ve tried to  stay away from politics. My brother almost got into it, but that   s     politics is here. It   s always going to be here, so I   m not going to say  anything about those. Our health is something that   I think that older  people have had the benefit of modern health information. We live a  long time now. I don   t know how long people are going to live.  Sometimes, I think,    Well, I   m about ready to see that big land we   re all  going to someday.    But, then I think,    Well, I   ve still got part of a box  of cigars out there. I think I   ll smoke them first.    (Laughs) So we don   t  get together as much as we should as a family, but with six of us we still  doing pretty good. My older brother can   t hear too well, but we still have  a good time and like I say, I thank the Lord for all He   s given us. I   m a  happy guy.  I think that   s a great way to end. Thank you so much, Freddy, for  sharing your stories with us.  -------  -------
