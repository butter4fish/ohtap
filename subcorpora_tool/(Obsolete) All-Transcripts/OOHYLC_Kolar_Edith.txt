 Finchum  Kolar  Today is September 16, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and we   re working  on a project called Oklahoma 100 Year Life. We   re in Tulsa, Oklahoma  to speak with Edith Kolar. Thank you for having us today. Let   s start  with having you tell us when and where you were born.  I was born in Nebraska   Fillmore County, known as Fillmore County.  August 8, 1911.  What did your parents do for a living?  They were farmers.  So you had chores?  Oh, yes. I had chores.  What were a few of them?  Well, I had to get up and help my dad milk the cows every morning. I  was an outdoor person. My sister was always inside. I did a lot of things  around outside. In the fall, I would help him. They raised wheat. I would  go out and help him shock wheat. I don   t know if you know what that  means or not. You stack your wheat so the bundles of wheat will dry  out. We used to take a gallon jug, this glass jug, and wrap burlap around  it to keep it cool while we were working. The same way, in the fall, I  would go with my dad to shock wheat   not wheat, but corn. In other  words, we   d take the wagon and mules and so on, and we   d snap corn  and throw it in the wagon. That was one of the things that I  did , but I  was always doing something outside. I wasn   t an indoor person.  5  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Did you go to a one-room schoolhouse?  Oh, yes. I don   t remember how many were in there, but it was from first  to eighth grade. I didn   t do too good. I didn   t like the teachers. In fact,  I   m lucky I even got out of that school. But anyway   I really didn   t  learn a lot. The teachers were just coming out of school, and they didn   t  teach us much of anything. I   m not kidding.  What was the name of the school, do you remember?  District 94. It was a one-room school.  How would you get there?  Walk. I lived half a mile from the school. I walked whether it was rain,  snow or sleet, whatever, every day. I didn   t miss a day of school. One  time, I was coming back from school and I saw this object up on the side  of the bank, there. I thought,    Well, I   ll go kick it. See what it is.     Turned out to be a big bull snake so I left it alone and went on.  If you want to get into a little bit about the school   every year, they  would have what they called a social to raise money for the school. Most  everybody would just use shoeboxes. We   d decorate them all up. That  evening, the girls would bring the boxes and the men or boys would bid  on them. Another thing that my dad did   he was the treasurer. One time,  I decided that we needed some money so I just signed all the checks he  had. (Laughter) He could have killed me. Anyway.  Every summer, they would take up the desks and hold dances. That was  a dancing bunch, there. Get their fiddles out and square dance and do  whatever you could do, there. Until the holes got so big, they couldn   t  put the desks back, so they had to quit. Then we went into individual  homes or into a barn   what they used to call a barn dance. Have you  ever heard of that?  Tell us about it.  After the hay was put up, there was always extra room in there for  square dancing. They were great on square dances. So that   s what they  did, there. From there, I went to high school. I drove a horse and buggy  every day to school. It was four and a half miles. Other kids, they had to  drive horse and buggies, too, so we had stalls for each one. Finally, I  decided I was going to do a short route, so I rode the railroad tracks.  When my dad found out I was riding the railroad tracks that was the end  of me. They decided I was going to have to stay in town and work for  somebody. In those days, you could go into a home and get food and  6  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  whatever and sleep there, but you   d have to do laundry or whatever was  required to help keep the house up.  Then of course, after I graduated from high school, there was only two  choices for people. That was either teacher or nurse. I decided I didn   t  want to be a teacher so I got enrolled in nursing school. That lasted  about six months, and I didn   t like that. So there was a new doctor that  came into this town and opened up an office and wanted to know if I   d  like to work for him. So I worked for him for about a year. Do you want  to hear all this?  Sure  Keep going, you   re doing good   (Laughs) About a year later I decided I wanted to go to Texas. So  anyway, I go back to the girls. There was nine of us that was in that one  nursing class. I told them, I said,    You know, I want to go to Texas.  Anybody here want to go to Texas?       Oh, yeah,    this gal Canon, she  said,    I   ll go. You get somebody to take us, I   ll go with you.    So I got  out and scouted around in Lincoln. Finally, Jim Fuller had a car and he  said,    As long as you put the gas in, I   ll take you.    Well, we got as far as  Wichita, Kansas. They were having a  dance -a-thon there. A  dance -a-thon  is where you dance and never stop. They pay you so much an hour.  I forget how much it was   the longer you stay, the more money you  made. That went on for about a week until the police department decided  that wasn   t ethical and they closed us down. Her name was Canon   so  Canon and I decided that we would go on our own from there so we  hitchhiked to Dallas.  The first thing when we got to the Texas line was, I saw this big sign  that said,    Pork     rather     Pig.    In Texas, they were great for   they  called them pig sandwiches, pork sandwiches. Boy, they were good.  From there, I went into Houston. Both of us did. I said,    Let   s go to  Corpus Christi.       Okay.    She was ready any time I was so we  hitchhiked to Corpus Christi. That was when there was about 36,000  people in that town. Of course, I don   t know if you know   there is a  million now, or something. Anyway, we both got a job and we stayed  there. That   s where I met my husband, was in Corpus. I don   t remember  what year we got married, but anyway. We stayed there. He wanted to  go back to Houston. He had two brothers in Houston. He didn   t like  Corpus so we went back and spent a year in Houston. That   s where my  oldest daughter, that   s here, was born, in Houston. Finally, I talked him  into going back to Corpus. That   s where we spent about sixteen to  eighteen years, in Corpus. We opened up several gift shops and so on.  We were on what is known as   have you ever been to Corpus?  I have not.  7  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  Finchum  Kolar  Have you?  No.  Do you know where Salina is?  Oklahoma?  Yes. Have you ever decided where Salina is?  I still don   t know where it is at.  There is a Salina, Kansas.  No, Salina, Oklahoma. Anyway, we went back to Corpus and bought  a  business . That was during World War II, we spent a lot of time when  they were building the naval base, there. Business was good. We owned  several pieces of property. Then I got a divorce. My oldest girl was ten, I  think. The other girl was about eight. So I still had the gift shop. I got  acquainted with a young man. He was driving through and taking people  from Iowa down to the Rio Grande Valley to sell fruit trees to. He   d  always bring his people by and let them see what they wanted. They   d  buy stuff and go on down to the Valley. So finally, after about five or six  trips, he said,    I   ve got a deal for you.    He said,    I   ve got some people  in Muskogee, Oklahoma that has a motel, a tourist   s court and a  restaurant. They want to trade it for some property down here.    He said,     Would you go and manage it?    I said,    Well, I   ve got this gift shop.     He said,    Well, we   ll sell the gift shop.     So we sold the gift shop and I came to Muskogee. That is when I learned  about Muskogee. I thought,    I want to see something about it before I  move here.    So I talked to the banker there. He was a drunk. He said,    If  you come in here with any money, you   re sure not going to leave with  anything.    I said,    That is what you think.    He was president of the  bank, there. Plus, he owned the concrete place. I learned right quick that  that was strictly a union town. It is strictly union. You don   t dare do  anything   even myself, an individual. I couldn   t do anything if I didn   t  hire a union guy. So we went ahead and fixed up this motel. It was a  trailer court, service station, restaurant and cabins. If you don   t think that  wasn   t something    Anyway, we put it together and sold it in two years.  Then I bought a home in Muskogee. I thought,    There   s not any money  here.    So I just moved on and said,    I   m going to go to Tulsa.    And  that   s the way I landed in Tulsa. I had a Texas real estate license and I  got an Oklahoma real estate license and went to selling real estate. From  8  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  there, I went into interior decorating and so on. Then I got married and  of course, you probably wonder about the Kolar, but I took my maiden  name back. It was Kolar Ellis, actually, is what it should be. I   ve always  just put it as Kolar. Anyway, that   s the reason I   m in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  What was the name of the hotel in Muskogee that you ran?  Tomahawk.  And about what time period was that?  In the    60s, late    50s. I   d say it was the early    60s.  Was it hard hitchhiking as a female back in those early days? You  weren   t scared?  Well, there were the two of us. No, it didn   t bother us.  Let   s back up and tell how your parents came to be in Nebraska.  My parents were born in Nebraska. Their parents   my mother   s parents  came from England. My father   s parents came from Prague, which is  Czechoslovakia. I don   t know too very much about my mother   s people.  We had very little connection with them. It seemed like I had all my  connection with my father   s father and my grandparents and so on.  Were they farmers, as well?  They started out to be farmers. I think when my dad got married they  bought a home in this little town. That   s where they lived from then on.  What happened to Canon?  She went back. She got tired of it and went back. Back to Lincoln.  Did she hitchhike back?  I don   t remember whether she did or not. One day, we were in Corpus  Christi and she didn   t like it. She didn   t like the water and all that. I said,     Well, see you later, then.     And you were there during World War II?  Oh, yes. I was there before World War II. I was there in    36, 1936.  Around Depression time.  9  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Right. The highway went right up next to the water, the Gulf of Mexico.  I was there while they built T-heads out into the ocean, and I saw them  build up the new naval base. I had several businesses going there. I  opened one gift shop at nine o   clock in the morning and I closed at six  o   clock. I had another one downtown where this man had leased an old  dry goods store. He put jukeboxes in there. That was a big thing, then,  jukeboxes. So he had a space and he asked if I   d like to run it. I said yes.  All I sold to those boys   those poor boys had come in there and they  were sailors. Their uniforms, I   ll never forget. Some of them were so  long, they were still hanging over here, or they were too short. Those  poor kids. Anyway, all I sold was pillows and a scarf of some kind. I  forget what it was, now. We used to buy those things by the gross. These  boys would come in and fill out the envelope    To Mother,       To Sister    or  To Girlfriend,    you know. All night long, that   s all I did   sell these  pillows to these guys. Finally, I gave that up because I had gotten my  divorce by then. That was still back in Corpus Christi. Anyway, that   s  the way I got to Oklahoma.  Did you ever experience the Dust Bowl?  Yeah, I told you. Didn   t I tell you? In Blackwell?  When was that?  That was when we were hitchhiking. So it had to be in the    30s.  Tell us about it for the record.  Yeah, you know, I said we were walking. I saw this black cloud. I mean,  it was black. Rolling in   about that time a man, I think he had a pickup,  asked us if we didn   t want a ride so we wouldn   t be caught in this storm.  Of course, we did. That   s when he took us to his home. We spent the  night, there, in fact the matter was. They were real nice people. That is  when that dust rolled in, but it was raining, also. It was just mud balls  falling. I never will forget that.  That was when you were hitchhiking from Wichita down to Dallas.  Yeah, from Wichita, right   to Dallas. I don   t know why we got to  Blackwell. I don   t know that. That wasn   t the direct route, I can tell you  that. Anyway, as I said people are puzzled,    You lived in Nebraska and  wound up in Oklahoma?    Well, I went the long way around. I didn   t go  right to Oklahoma.  I guess the better question is,    What kept you here?     10  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Well, I   ve been in the real estate business, here. I came from Muskogee  selling real estate there. I started selling it here. I could make some  money in Tulsa. I couldn   t make anything in Muskogee. That is a  bootleg town. If you   re not bootlegging, you   re not making any money.  So did the veteran tell you anything about that? Did the veteran ever say  anything to you about the bootleggers?  No. Did you ever meet any?  Oh, yeah. One time, one of their daughters came in and bought a leather  jacket from me. I used to have a lot of Western clothes for square dances  and so on. Come in and bought this fifty dollar leather jacket. Of course,  the check was hot, came back. Well, I knew that her dad was  bootlegging right down the road, here. I called and he said,    Just bring it  here and I   ll pay you right now.    But it was all over town. I was selling  real estate with this   his name was Hayworth, Bill Hayworth. He  married one of the Vandever girls, here. Vandever dry store   ready-wear  store. He was a conniver. When I worked, his brother John, we  used to sell real estate together. But Bill was in with the bootleggers. He  was going to go around some of them. They were big time guys. They  weren   t just some little bootleggers. He thought he   d go around them.  He bought this house and he was going to bootleg out of that house.  Within a week, that house blew up.  Like I told you, this lady bought a restaurant on the lake   Fort Gibson  Lake   going to Western Hills. She sold it for some reason or another.  These guys bought it. I remember one name   it was Payne. Slim Payne,  but I don   t remember what the others were. They opened up a gambling  place in the back of this restaurant. I don   t know what happened, but the  next week, we heard this guy had a concrete block tied around his neck  and was thrown into Tenkiller Ferry.  Sallisaw and Muskogee were the worst. Sallisaw, shot a deputy right  outside the courthouse. Never done anything about it. That was the kind  of western town, I guess. But you didn   t mess around there. Like if I  wanted to do something and I didn   t want to hire a union person, some  of those construction guys knew me. So they said,    Okay       talking  about the bank, the drunk,    He   s out of town, tonight. What do you need  done?    So we strung up lights outside so we could see to do whatever  we were doing, whatever construction work we were doing. You can  talk to some of the old timers on that. They   d tell you the same thing.  Tulsa has always been real quiet.  Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  11  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  I rode in one of the first ones, Braniff. I went from Corpus Christi to  Brownsville picking up some Mexican merchandise. There wasn   t any     Well, there wasn   t any air compression or whatever it is. What is it they  have inside that? Compressed air?  I think so.  You guys aren   t any help. (Laughter) Whatever it was, I flew from  Corpus Christi to Brownsville in the first flight. That was Braniff.  Scary or not?  I wasn   t scared. I   m not a person to be scared.  Sounds like you were an adventurous soul.  I have always been.  What about your first car?  Oh, that was a joke. I didn   t buy a car until I got to Corpus. I paid a  hundred dollars for it. I was opening up another shop. Follow me, I   m  always doing something. I was opening another gift shop. In Corpus  Christi, we have got what you call a bascule bridge. It is a big bridge that  the incoming ships come in down the channel. I was about a block this  side of it. I think of this because of this fellow, I don   t remember if he  was young or old or what. Anyway, I said,    You want to go with me  over to the other gift shop?    We got in the car and he said,    You   ve  never driven a car, have you?    I said,    No.    That   s all he said until we  got over to the other place. We got over, crossed the bridge. But that was  quite a challenge to get across that bridge. That was my first car.  I had one car stolen during the war. It wound up in New Mexico, on the  border of New Mexico and Texas. It was stripped down. They brought it  back to Corpus and put it all back together. Anyway. I have had an  adventurous life. I can say that.  Sounds like it. What about travelling out of the country?  I   ve always traveled in the United States. When I was in Muskogee, we  had what we called the Business Professional Women   s Organization,  there. I joined that. When I came to Tulsa, they insisted that I belong to  that. Have you ever heard of it?  I have.  12  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  You have?  Yes.  Okay. Of course, you know they   re no longer in existence. Anyway,  after being in it for several years, again, I decided I was going to travel.  So what I did was I rented a Trailways bus and took these people     Well, first trip was to Las Vegas. We had a convention in Las Vegas. So  I charged them about what I thought it was going to cost to hire a driver  and the bus and everything. Anyway, the first trip we took was to Las  Vegas. We got enough BPW (Business Professional Women) members  and went there. That was the first one. Of course, I was the boss of the  deal. We went to the Hoover Dam and the Painted Desert and the  Petrified  Forest . So I always planned something for everybody to make  a nice trip. Then we went to Hartford, Connecticut. We went to  Washington, DC. I also went with a tour guide, here. Her name was  Francis Jennerman. We went into Mexico. We traveled through Mexico  City and all the way through there for about two weeks, Santa Fe and  Albuquerque. I mean, I   ve been     Like Johnny Cash   you   ve been everywhere.  I   m like Johnny Cash. I   ve been everywhere. Right. I haven   t been  everywhere. My goal when I was younger was to do the coastline. I got  as far as New York and that was as far as I got. I   ve always been curious  and traveled a lot. I   ve been a lot of places.  So in the    60s, you were in Muskogee?  In the    60s, I was in Corpus. No   during World War II, there. In the     60s, I was in Muskogee. I stayed in Muskogee for sixteen years and in     72, I came to Tulsa.  So you would have been in Muskogee when they were doing Civil Rights  and segregation and all that?  I didn   t get involved in any of that.  Do you remember voting for the first time?  That was interesting. In Muskogee, you had to sign up to be    If you  wanted to vote in the school projects or school districts, you had to sign  up to be a democrat. If you were signed up republican, you only had the  right to vote the national. So to this day, I   m still a democrat, but I   m a  republican. That was my experience in voting. That town is something  else, I   ll tell you. (Laughter)  13  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  I know they had a pretty library back in those days, a Carnegie Library,  in Muskogee.  Library? Are you talking about Five Civilized Tribes?  No, it was a public library.  I don   t remember any library, there.  You were too busy   I was too busy, but they had the Five Civilized Tribes, there. Bacone  College   that   s when I got to be acquainted with some of the Indian  people, the artists. I   ve always been fascinated by the Indian artists and  people and so on. I   ve got an original in the living room by Bert  Seabourn. I just got through talking to my daughter. She has a book that  he had autographed for me of all his different paintings that he had done.  She   s going to send it to me. We were talking about the Indians. I   ve  been acquainted with Acee Blue Eagle and Willard Stone. Are you  familiar with anybody in Tulsa?  I   m not, no.  Where are you from? Tennessee?  Yes.  Tennessee Williams. Right?  Yeah, and Johnny Cash. (Laughter)  Anyway. I had the experience of being acquainted with all these  different Indian people. Acee Blue Eagle   Willard Stone lived in Locust  Grove, but he was a famous woodcarver. In fact, we used to attend the  art   when they had a festival over at Tahlequah. He would be carving  over there. I remember one time I tried to buy a carving he was doing     one of flying geese. He wouldn   t give me a price on it because it wasn   t  finished. Well it landed in Oklahoma City in   which one is that in  Oklahoma City? That has so much artwork, anyway. It is not too far off  of the Expressway. Anyway, they bought it. Later, I found out when I  went over there and I was asking about it, they said somebody had taken  it off the wall and dropped it and broke it. He was famous all over  Oklahoma for his hand carving. I   ve got a print of some of the work he   s  done and so on.  14  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Then there was Acee Blue Eagle. He was a famous artist who used to  come into my gift shop wanting to sell me his art for five dollars. Of  course, I didn   t have five dollars in those days. They liked their whiskey.  Every one of them did. They   d sell their art cheap just to get some.  Anyway, my daughter went to school with Jerome Tiger. You   re  probably not familiar with any of these names     I recognize that name, Jerome Tiger.  Jerome Tiger. My daughter went to the same school as he did. He sat  there in school and sketched drawings all the time. That   s all he ever did,  she said. He   d throw them in the wastebasket and she picked up one  drawing. It was in the dance form, with feathers and so on. He signed it.  I had it framed for her. I don   t have any idea what it is worth, but it was  original.  Anyway, then there was Bacone College. That is where most of the  Indian artists would go to study. There was a lady just a block from me.  Her name was Nettie Wheeler. She was Cherokee. Her brother lived just  down the street from me. He was an attorney. She financed all these  different Oklahoma artists. Seabourn, I don   t think he was   he was  Okmulgee, but I think most of his work comes out of New Mexico. I had  an opportunity to meet all these Indian people and work with them. It  has always been very interesting. Of course, when I had my gift shop,  which was an Indian gift shop, here   not here, but Muskogee   I had  Navajo rugs, all kinds of Navajo rugs. I even met some of the Indians  when I went back to New Mexico and Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Met  some of the Indians there that were weaving rugs.  Another time, I had an experience when I was on a trip to Mexico City.  We stayed at Oaxaca. While at Oaxaca, we got up in the morning and  went to Mitla, a town that was on the Pacific Coast. Coming back from  Mitla, this lady who was running the tour, said,    Is there any place you   d  like to go?    I said,    Yeah, there is a road right there. Let   s take that  road.    So she did. We went a couple miles and looked over to our right  and there was this village filled with looms, two artists with looms,  weaving these rugs. It was something to see. Of course, I bought two or  three of them and so on. I   m just saying, I guess I could go on but  there   s a stopping point someplace.  Did you ever think you   d live to be 100?  I didn   t even think about it   not any more than I think about being 105  or 110. I feel good. I guess I can think pretty good.  Describe a typical day for you these days.  15  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  A typical day for me? First thing I do is go to my computer and see what  is going on. I   ve got books   I   ve got a lot of books. My travelling   if I  had to stay over an hour or so for my next flight, I   d buy me two or three  cookbooks just to read. I   ve got cookbooks that you wouldn   t believe. In  fact, I   m selling them on Amazon and eBay. So that   s the first thing I do.  I don   t know, just whatever comes up. I get my mail and go through it  and see what   s going on. Whatever else comes up, why, I handle it.  How early do you get up each morning?  About seven thirty.  And go to bed about   ?  About seven o   clock. I have a radio and I listen to see what the politics  are doing.  So you were in Oklahoma when Bellmon won. When the first republican  was elected.  Yeah, right.  Since you were registered democrat, did you get to vote?  Yeah. I could vote. I never bothered to change over.  I shouldn   t ask how you voted.  Well, I voted   usually it depends on the individual. As I said, that town  had its own rules. You couldn   t vote on any of the school issues and city  issues and anything. It all had to be federal or whatever came up.  I   m curious   you said you enjoy looking at cookbooks. Do you have a  favorite recipe?  Not really. I   ll tell you what   I have a therapist that has been coming on  my birthday. He made this Coca-Cola cake and brought it to me. That  was the best cake I   ve ever tasted. Chocolate cake. Do you know what I  mean?  My son requested it for his birthday. I   d never made one, but they are  really good.  Oh, yeah, this was delicious. No, I   ve got a Czech book and I use it a lot  and my German ones, because I still like German dishes. But as far as     16  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  I haven   t done much cooking in the last year, though. It is kind of hard  for me to see the measurements when I   m cooking.  What were holidays like when you were growing up? Christmas or  Fourth of July?  Well, Christmas, we would go   when I was growing up   we   d go out  and cut a cedar branch somewhere. We had a lot of cedar trees around.  We   d decorate them. We   d make popcorn and string it up, string the  popcorn and such as that. We had a little miniature candle. You   ve  probably seen them. I noticed them on the market last year. They have a  little clip on the bottom. We used to put those on. As far as Christmas, it  was not a lot of money spent on Christmas, as far as gifts were  concerned. I remember I always wanted a ukulele   don   t ask me why.  They bought me a ukulele for Christmas. I remember that one. And I  have been to Hawaii, too.  Did you learn how to play that ukulele?  I never did learn how to play that thing. I have always had a fantasy  about Hawaii and I always wanted to go. Of course, we had our  convention over there one year. That gave us an opportunity so I put a  group together. The agency that was doing the tour thought I was the  agent so I got through free. (Laughter) But the rest of them    Anyway,  that   s it. We spent some nice time over there in Hawaii. Hawaiian  Islands   Oahu and so on.  So what is your secret to longevity?  Busy. Keeping busy. Keeping active. Keeping your mind busy. I fell  here in January. I busted my head wide open here. Anyway, I was  bleeding and when I lock up, I lock up. Nobody can get to me. I   ve got  this alert thing on. Anyway, I took it off that night because I was tired of  it. I got up in the morning and I was dizzy, real dizzy, and I fell. I  couldn   t stop the bleeding. I must have laid there an hour or so trying to  stop that bleeding. I thought,    Oh, Lord, what am I going to do, now?    I  reached down around my ankle, and this is almost impossible to believe,  and that was wrapped around my ankle, that alert thing was. That was  what saved me. When I turned the alert on, of course, they called. We  had the police out here. The neighbors were running up and down the  street trying to find my daughter   s telephone number. Of course, my  daughter has got hearing aids. She takes them out at night and they  couldn   t wake her up. The ambulance was out here, the police was out  here, the fire trucks were out here. Finally, the fireman broke this  window here to get inside to me.  17  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  They, of course, put me in the hospital right away. Then I went to the  rehab center. That was an experience. Seeing those people   some of  them in their 70s and a lot of them in their 80s and 90s   just sitting  there, watching the TV or something like that, not doing anything. They  knew when it is time to eat, and then they put them back over there to  watch that TV. I couldn   t believe it. I had never even thought about  something like that. But that was an interesting experience, to see those  people. They were just in body. They don   t have any idea what is going  on. You   re talking about age   I don   t know this, but I imagine   of  course, some of them were probably in business or something. A lot of  them were probably supported by their husbands and didn   t have to do  anything. Maybe they had a little social life and that was it. That   s left  them. It is pitiful.  Do you have a philosophy you live by, or motto?  No. Get up in the morning and get busy. (Laughter)  Check that eBay.  Not really   I don   t. I don   t sit around just to sit and watch TV or  something like that. I   ve got my reader over here. I don   t know if you  noticed it or not. They gave me that. I use it a lot. I still read a lot about  the Indian people. The fact of the matter is, I was just going through the  drawer there when you walked up. I   ve got a lot of Indian literature in  there that I haven   t read. I   m going to read it. I didn   t pay any attention  to that particular area there. But I am still interested. Like when I had my  gift shop, I was selling the Indian baskets or whatever. That   s what I was  telling him, we used to drive over to Salina. I tried to find my Oklahoma  map and couldn   t find one. It is just east of Pryor. You don   t know  where Pryor is     I do.  Do you? Good. It is on the 69-Highway. Anyway, go east of Pryor and  you cross over the   I don   t think there   s a stream there or bridge, I don   t  remember what, into what they call Kenwood. There   s a little Indian  grocery store. I used to go back in the woods back there. There wasn   t  any roads. You could just see the tracks on the leaves, the tire tracks on  the leaves. I   d find them that way. They got where they would wait for  me   they were making baskets for me. I met this one lady one time     that   s the one I was trying to get the picture to show you. This one lady  was walking down the dirt road there close to the grocery store. She had  a bundle of brush on her arm. It was buck brush. Her name was Nelly  Running Water. When I saw her, I happened to have a box camera and I  took her picture.  18  Finchum  Kolar  Of course, she wanted to know what that was because she   d never seen a  camera. I took her picture. In fact, I got two pictures of her, and one of  them is where she is putting her cob pipe in her pocket so I wouldn   t see  it. But she   d go out and gather the buck brush for these people and there  was a family there that had huge washtubs. They   d fill that with water  and soak this buck brush and scrape it. Then they   d make their baskets.  They made gorgeous baskets. They did what was known as a double  weave. You don   t see any of that anymore. I haven   t seen any of that in  a long time. It wasn   t just a plain woven basket, you know. These all  were a double weave. I used to go back in there about once a month and  gather up all these baskets. They   d dye them different colors and  designs. They were really into doing it, you know.  They gathered up some wild strawberry plants for me. I planted them out  here and I never have gotten rid of them. Those wild strawberry plants  go everywhere and no strawberries. One time, though, they wanted to  know if I wanted a deer. There was a lot of deer out there. His name was  Ben Smith, and I don   t know what her first name was. Anyway, the  neighbors would all get together and make these baskets. Anyway, he  said to me one time I was out there, he said,    Would you like to have a  deer?    I said,    Yeah, if you skin it for me.    He said,    Okay, I   ll take care  of that.    So one night he called me and it was dark. He said,    I   ve got  your  deer  ready for you.    I said,    Okay, I   ll be over.     That   s when I had to go to Salina and all the Indians down there in the  woods. I took my two girl daughters with me. I had some old tires. I was  driving a station wagon and I had some old tires. I put the old tires in the  station wagon and got a blanket. Here I am down here with this deer  ready to cut up and put it in the station wagon, hoping nobody stops me  because it was illegal then because it was out-of-season. Anyway, I got  back to Muskogee and a friend of mine knocked on the door about  midnight. He had just come into town. He couldn   t imagine what I was  doing. I had it stretched out on the kitchen floor, this deer, cutting it up  into pieces.  Did you know how to cut it up?  I just did it. Didn   t have any idea how to cut it up, but it was the whole  thing. He skinned it, ready for me to cut it up so we had deer meat for a  while. I guess there   s not anything   when I was selling houses in  Muskogee, every once in a while, I   d run across a car and I   d fix it up  and trade it in for their equity. One time I got a hold of a car, the rear  end was going out. The mechanic told me, said,    Just stuff that with  oatmeal.    So I jacked it up and had my kids help me. We stuffed that  thing with oatmeal and got rid of it.  19  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  You were a problem solver.  I was a problem solver. I was a problem   what do you call them? My  parents thought I was a problem-maker.  What is your biggest challenge today?  Not anything. What I really would like to do, if I could keep my eyesight  like it is right now, I   d still like to get back into weaving, weaving  Indian rugs. I love the Indian rugs. That   s what I would like to do. I had  a loom over here about six or seven years ago that I was weaving on and  it was all computerized. That was interesting. I sold it to a man over in  Oklahoma City. That is really what I would like to do. I   ve got all my  information and everything. I still study on different things. So I   m  thinking by maybe next year, purchasing another loom.  When you finish your first rug, I   ll come see it.  Okay. That   s fine.  How important has religion or spirituality been in your life?  Religion hasn   t been very important to me, and it   s a shame to say. I  joined the Methodist church over in Muskogee, St. Paul Methodist  Church. When I was a kid, growing up, I was always in church doing  something. When I got grown, I did join the St. Paul Methodist Church  in Muskogee, but that   s about as far as it has gotten. Been thinking about  it, I think I need to spend a little more time than what I   ve been  spending.  I figured your family, when you were a child, you probably went every  Sunday, I would assume.  Oh, yes. Every Sunday, right. Like I said, my dad would drive us over to  the church. I don   t recall my mother ever going with me. I can remember  one time I had school   they had a group called Girl Reserve. They were  having a dinner that night and the mothers were invited. I thought I had  the most beautiful mother in the world. I was so proud of her, and I  wanted her to go with me, but she wouldn   t go. She never did go with  me on anything. I looked back over that and thought it was a shame we  couldn   t have been closer than what we were. I think that is probably  what put me outside working with my dad so much as I did.  When history is written about you, what do you want it to say?  20  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Bishop  Kolar  Finchum  Kolar  Finchum  Boy, she lived a life.  What was that?  I said, boy, she lived a life  (Laughter)  From where we   re sitting, you really have.  Yeah, people say something about that. I   ve never been overseas. Going  over the water to Hawaii is the closest I   ve ever been. Like I told my  daughter   there is some guy in Henryetta that has these tours every  year. They go overseas. I said,    There is so many interesting places in  the United States, why don   t you think about going and touring some of  the places in the United States?    Because there is. There is so many  interesting places. If I could see, I would be traveling yet.  Just not hitchhiking.  No. (Laughter) No way.  If you had a place you could visit, where would you go? In the United  States.  Really, I don   t know because there is so many   I love Tulsa, you know,  Oklahoma. I love the history in Oklahoma. I love Texas. I lived down in  the Rio Grande Valley for several years. There is so much history  between the two states that it would be a toss-up to where.  I thought maybe you were going to say you would go back to Hawaii  and take that ukulele.  (Laughter) That guy, what was his name? That took that ukulele and  learned how to play it. Can you imagine a kid like six years old wanting  a ukulele?  Well, we thank you for sharing your history with us today.  It is just a little bit of it, you know.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
