Story_ID: 22099
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight warm-up questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is:  Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is it?
Speaker 2: It's fish.  I love fish, and I like it fixed just about any way, but probably the healthiest way to fix it is to bake it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I do.  It's green.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.  Everything is fresh and blooming.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Any place there's a golf course and a beach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I guess if I was to look at one I would say:  "To him or her that's given much, much is expected."
Story_ID: 22100
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately; then we'll put them together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arline Julia Kess Johnson.  And Arlene is spelled, A-R-L-I-N-E, J-U-L-I-A, K-E-S-S, and J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, I got to look that up.  Her place of birth is Annapolis, Maryland.
Speaker 1: And you have an approximate year?
Speaker 2: Oh, 80 years ago, probably, yeah.  I do have it--I have it in the form I filled out for you, the interview form.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I looked that up.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.
Speaker 2: So that's going to be true of all my relatives, probably that, on the date of births.  So I'll tell you that up front.  I can you place of birth, but not date.
Speaker 1: So you think about 1930 or so?
Speaker 2: Yes, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, I can at least trace them back--trace them back five generations.  In fact, the house we're in sits on a lot that was owned by my grandmother's--my mother's mother's grandfather.  So this would be my maternal great-great-great-grandfather.  And his name was James Colbert and he was a farmer.  And, basically, over the years he was able to acquire a lot of property, and he subdivided property up among his children who passed it on to their children.  But of all that property, this is the only piece of property that's still in the family.  So, James Colbert is--we can go back five generations to my grandmother's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, what era is he living--this is the nineteenth century, no doubt, but about when?
Speaker 2: The nineteenth century, yes.  It's probably early nineteenth century--he'd be in early--I think he died early, 1911 or something like that.  I'd have to go back and look.
Speaker 1: So, it would be the late-nineteenth century he was alive.  So this--now he wasn't in slavery or anything, was he?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So he came after--he was born after?
Speaker 2: He was--he acquired his property after slavery.  He may have been in slavery at one point, but I don't know that.  But he got his wealth which was the property by being a farmer and saving his money and being able to buy a little piece at a time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is James Colbert.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, in--on this very land that we're sitting on here, he, you know, out of five generations of your mother's family, lived.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The last three generations have been--this house occupied the site. Prior to that it was a previous house.  So this home we're in now was the home of my maternal mother's and father.  And my wife and I acquired it not too long ago.  We--as a family, we used to rent it out, but that wasn't the best thing to do, so we decided to acquire it and to kind of preserve it and keep it for the family.
Story_ID: 22101
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, any stories from your mother's side of the family about living in Annapolis?  What was Annapolis like, you know (unclear)(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I grew up--in fact, there's a book called "The Other Side of Annapolis" (sic) written by a guy by the name of Mr. Phillip Brown, who just died about three years ago at a hundred years old.  But he really talks about Annapolis as I grew up.  It was, for the most part, a segregated city, and African-Americans owned a lot of the land on the water, and that was because, at that time, when I was growing up in the beginning years of my life, they didn't have wastewater treatment, and so, the rivers always smelled.  It wasn't until we got wastewater treatment systems that the rivers began to get cleaned up and became scenic and a place for--that people want to live.  And, believe or not, most of the property owned by African-Americans had been acquired or lost because of either taxes or the family decided to sell it because they could make some money.  So to me, I grew up Annapolis for the most part of my life where I went to--from K through 12, a black high school.  Also, we had a different to go to.  And so, there were a lot of things that were different.  But in the city of Annapolis proper where I grew up, but there was a thriving African-American economy also.  So, you lose and you win as a result of things.  We had our own hotel and we had places where big stars that--people who became big stars later on would come and perform, there were grocery stores, there were restaurants all owned by African-Americans.  And so, I grew up in a place where people were very proud of their heritage, also a place where they understood economic development.  And they also understood family helping each other.  So I guess some of my--I think about two of my favorite times would be when family would come to this house at another location, Fourth of July, Memorial Day and had picnics, and they would come from all over, and we'd get a chance to play with our cousins and grow up.  I guess the other piece, the other thing that I remember is, when we lived in the city of Annapolis, being able to walk across the street to what was then the public--what is still now, public housing.  And that's where most of my friends grew up.  And, of course, there are always choices; you can play with your friends and not do your homework and find the quick and easy way to do things; or you could, you know, work hard in school and earn things that have a lasting value.  Now, I think that because of my parents, and particularly my mother, I chose that route.  So I say one of the things that I remember growing up is my mother's influence on the choices I made and the role model that she had for me.
Story_ID: 22102
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about growing up a little later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I want to get your mother's ancestors down here first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And get a--but that's--you gave us a synopsis of what Annapolis was about.  But what were your mother's ancestors doing in Annapolis?  What kind of jobs did they do and (unclear)(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother worked at the United States Naval Academy, and she worked there all her life, and it's been a source of employment for a lot of people.  My mother's father was a fireman, was the first African-American in the county, but he worked for a--the Naval Research Laboratory, which was located in Annapolis.  So they both had, as one would say, "good government jobs," up until their retirement.  My mother's grandmother or my mother's--my grandmother's mother, actually died at an early age, and I didn't know much about her at all.  I didn't know much about my grandmother's father either.  So in terms in people I connected, that's about as far back as I can go.  I know stories about James Colbert because it was passed orally by my grandmother, and she had talked about the property and things like that, but never--now he was a farmer, but, so I understood that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But--all right.  So there weren't a lot of stories passed down.  Were your other relatives on that side farmers?  Who--were they engaged in farming or--?
Speaker 2: No.  Most of the other relatives were--farming was a hobby for them.  We had--I had great-uncles who lived in this area when I was growing up, and all of them basically had jobs either working for the federal government or working for private industry, and they all had gardens, but that was a side thing for them that they did.  And one great-uncle, Uncle Bruce (sic), whose name was James Colbert, also, Junior, he was known for his garden and his horse, Kidd.  And as he would use Kidd to plow the field, he allowed the kids to ride on the horse's back.  So that was always something exciting.  And my--one of my cousins and I, we used to always go and steal his tomatoes.  I'd take them right off the vine and wash them off and eat them, and they were some of the best tomatoes you could ever get.  You talk about vine ripe, that's what they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22103
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother talk about what she wanted to do growing up?  Did she--after she finished school, did she have an ambition or a similar story?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't recall my mother talking about her dreams growing up.  She--my father was a little older than she was, and I think that she got amoured at a young age and got married.  And--but, I think that her career professionally developed after she got married.  She graduated from high school, but after getting married and having a family, she then pursued a practical nurse's license.  And so, she was able to get that and got employment at the local Navy hospital, which was located on the grounds of the Naval Academy.  And she worked there until it closed.   And at that time, she then had to go to Washington because she worked at the Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.  And so, she--she's always been in the, I guess, in the healthcare area during all my days that I can remember as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, and she graduated from Bates High School too?
Speaker 2: She graduated from Bates High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: That's, B-A-S-E?
Speaker 2: B-A-T-E-S.
Speaker 1: B, okay.  Wait a minute.  B-A-T--?
Speaker 2: T-E-S.  It's Wiley H. Bates High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And who was Liley H. Bates?
Speaker 2: Wiley H. Bates was--
Speaker 1: Wiley.  Oh, Wiley.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Wiley, yes.
Speaker 1: W-A-L-L-Y.
Speaker 2: W--no.  W-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: W--oh, Wiley?
Speaker 2: No, no.  W-I-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Wiley H. Bates High--Wiley H. Bates was a local African-American entrepreneur who gave $500 to start the black high school.  And so, it was named after him.  The building still stands, it's now Heritage Center, and now called the Wiley H. Bates Heritage Center; and it has residents for senior citizens, it has--also houses the Boys and Girls Club and a couple of other things.  So it's fully utilized now after staying vacant for 20 years after it closed up, because it was a--it had a lot of asbestos in it, so the job of cleaning up was very expensive.  But it got done.
Story_ID: 22104
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Henry Johnson, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S, H-E-N-R-Y, J-O-H-N-S-O-N, S-R, period.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth
Speaker 2: Oh, we're going to have to look that one up too.  But he was eight years older than my mother [Arline Julia Kess Johnson] so.  But I do have those on a--
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: --on the piece of form I sent you.  But I have them.  But anyway.
Speaker 1: So about 1922, you think?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: Annapolis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was actually born in, yeah, in Annapolis, Maryland, and lived in a section of Annapolis called Eastport Annapolis, which is a--Annapolis became the sum of several smaller areas, and one of the smaller areas was called Eastport.  It annexed to the city at some point, but that's where his family grew up.  But on my father's side, the family arrived to Annapolis two generations before Kunta Kinte got here.  So there's a long history there, which my sister can tell you.  (But they will see what I know?).
Speaker 1: So, they were in here in the eighteenth century?
Speaker 2: In the eighteenth century, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories about, you know, any stories passed down about where they were from?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  Not that I--any I ever heard.  And that was--it's some history that my--one of my uncles had discovered and kind of looking at the family tree and following it, and he was able to determine when we first came to--my family first came to America.  But my family on my father's side has always been somewhat splintered, you know, my--in the sense that my father has several siblings, and his oldest sibling, his name was Wilbert Sylvester Johnson, actually was born to my grandmother when she was 16.  She was raped by a white man, and he never knew his father.  But they eventually found who his father was because my grandmother told him.  But I never knew my father's father.  I don't think he ever knew him either.  So, but--but my grandmother--my father's mother lived with us most of all my life, as a matter of fact.  And so--so I think in a lot of the history that she knew, she didn't talk about because I think she was bitter about a lot of things that had happened in her life.  So, but, and that bitterness came up in a lot of different ways.  She was a domestic worker.  And for most of the part when I was growing up, the people she worked with, they were very kind and nice to her and things like that, but I think that she had injuries that occurred when she was a child and growing up; emotional and mental--and psychological injuries that kept her very withdrawn about what had happened to her and the whys and the whats.  And she raised all her boys, all her four boys, by herself, along with the help of a sister, who had lived around the corner from us.
Speaker 1: So, are there any stories from her about what she might have gone through?
Speaker 2: No.  She--I think she kept those things to herself because they were painful.
Speaker 1: So, what indication did you have that she was harboring some grievances?
Speaker 2: Oh, just by her actions.  I think that when a person is, you know, holding things back because of pain, and then they come out in waves, and they come out in bolts.  So you kind of--you kind of get a reaction to something that--that because it's touched something inside of her that was painful, and you're very innocent about it.  But something may have happened that was painful to her.  So I think it--and then I also think that it was--we didn't see her smile much.  And when she was around people who were having fun and things, I don't remember my grandmother--we used to call her Mama Jo; her name was Josephine Gray.  I don't remember Mama Jo being among the laughter.  She'd be around you and you might get a little smile from her, but that was it.  But everybody else may be laughing because things were (good?).  But, so, I think that she harbored a lot of pain and anger, and she'd done the best with her boys that she could do.  All of them--all of them were in the service.  I think that was their escape.  My father went in the Army, all the rest of them went in the Navy.  And so, so I think that, that when she got them there she was happy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father--what did your father aspire to do when he was growing up?  Did he have a--?
Speaker 2: I think my father really had an aspiration. First of all, my father was very, very witty and smart.  But my father, I think, always wanted to be a mortician, open his own business.  And he did for a while, but he got his GED.  After getting his GED, what he did is he went to embalming school and became an embalmer and then became a licensed mortician.  He worked with one of the local morticians on a part-time basis while he worked at the Naval Academy.  That was, you know, a main place of work for many people in Annapolis.  And near him getting close to retirement, he opened up a business, and I worked with him a little bit there, and not doing any embalming, but assisting with funerals, and my mother would assist.  So that business lasted for a couple of years.  But it was, as I say, I think that was his real, real aspiration, is to be a successful funeral director.  And the person he worked with for even part-time, they were the best of buddies.  Even when they became competitive, they still were the best of buddies and doing a lot of things, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your father ...
Story_ID: 22105
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, we were talking about the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.  Anything else?
Speaker 2: I guess, there's probably another moment someplace in there that--and I know there were a couple of moments in my life where there was a--something that made things special.  And I guess it's the sounds--well, let me go back.  I remember going away to college and coming back home and being at my home in Annapolis, Annapolis proper with my parents, and going down to the corner where everybody would be all the time.  I never did when I was in high school, but going down to the corner, and I guess that the--what I remember, there was people encouraging me to keep going to school because so many people had gone there.  So, that was the people on the block kind of doing that.  And when my mother died and we were getting ready to have the funeral, I actually went to them and said, "Keep the block clean," because there was a lot of drugs and stuff going on.  It's much better now, but--and I talked to one guy who I actually grew up with, and I--they used to call him the unofficial mayor of that area.  So I said--his name was Michael (Church?).  I said, "Michael, my mother's funeral is today."  I said, "Keep everything quiet and keep the block clean."  And you would think that was a pristine area, at least for a day it was; nobody was on the corner and everything was cleaned up.  So, I guess the other piece would be going to the block and being embraced by the people that I grew up with who have taken paths than the path that I'd taken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, we were--because of the field you're in, I thought this would be a good question, because it seems to plague every black community, especially one that's segregated over a pocket or behind some tracks or across the river, somewhere.  Now what did, was your area town, like, used as a dump or anything by the city of Annapolis or--?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  We weren't used as a dump.  In fact, the area of town I was in was very close to the water.  Here, again, there were across the street from me and adjacent to it was a public housing.  But one of them was right on the water, and the body of water was called College Creek, because it also was where St. John's College [Annapolis, Maryland] was, and it also was part of where the Naval Academy was.  So it was called College Creek.  But it was--and there--and here, again, there was that and the public housing was there because we didn't always sewage treatments plants, and so, when they built the public housing, one of the pieces of public housing was built in 1947.  And they just recently tore it down, but in its early years, there was probably a stench coming from the water.  So, in a sense that it wasn't a dump, but it was a place where it was unwanted land at one time, and that's where they put the Negroes and public housing, someplace they could go.  But, as people know, now the waterfront is very expensive, and although they've rebuilt--they've rebuilt one of the pieces of--one of the public housing projects is still right on the water and they're building a second now.  So, but--so, I think that we weren't a dumping place, but we were located in the place where people at that time didn't want to go because the water was polluted.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I thought there was something you alluded to earlier about that.  There's, you know, a lot of studies about that.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: We're dumped someplace and that sort of thing, incinerators and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We had, actually, you know, it wasn't--not a trash dump, not an incinerator; just polluted water.
Speaker 1: Just polluted water.
Speaker 2: But, you know, it's a big environmental justice issue today in terms of the disproportionate disposal of waste materials in places where people who are not empowered live, and typically that's the African--people of color and people of low-income levels.  They don't have--didn't always have the voice to say no, and were soon advised in ways that were--had immediate gratification, but no long-term gratification.  You know, "We're going to put this dump next to you, and we're going to give you twenty-five bucks," and people looking at that twenty-five bucks at that time would be very happy, but not understand the long-term impact of--on their health and the health of their kids and future generations.  So, a little bit of that, but not to the greatest extent that it happened in (Annapolis at all?).  Our dumps were located outside of the city and we took it to the county.
Story_ID: 22106
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about school.  Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Well, I started school right--I could walk to them, all my schools.  I went to Staten High School--I'm sorry, Staten Elementary School, which was located two blocks from where I lived.  And so, it was a community elementary school.  It was all black, and one of the characteristics of all my schooling from first grade all through the twelfth is that I had very caring teachers, many of whom went to my church or knew my family and, therefore, you know, it was a case where I think I got a lot of nurturing that perhaps others may not have gotten.  And I think part of it was because I was--I could catch on to things quickly, and I think the teachers liked that and wanted to encourage me in going into an area where math was important and science was important because I'm an engineer.  I think they also wanted me to--wanted to see me go down that road, and if I needed some help, provided the help.  So, but I think it was the local schools, local teachers, teachers who cared about you both as a student and as an individual, that was very instrumental in my life, and something that I still do and have done all through my years at Howard [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbus] and even where I am now with the EPA [Environmental Protectin Agency].   High school was the--.
Speaker 1: Now, before we get to the high school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I have some questions to ask about your grade school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  What did you--who were your teachers?  Were there any special teachers there that really mentored you and guided you?   And what were your favorite subjects?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I've always had a problem about a favorite subject.  I think that--my favorite subjects had to be science and math.  Not so much history.  As you tell, I couldn't tell you birth dates; so I'm not that good on history.  But I think my first-grade teacher, Ms. Cecilia B. Greene, was one of my favorite.  And she also went to my church and was very active in the Sunday School.  So I got to see her six days a week, which was always interesting.  Another favorite teacher was Ms. Rachel Brown, who actually was my teacher in the sixth grade.  And she was a very--she also was a cousin, and also went to my church.  So I guess there was--there's some commonality there they became my favorites because maybe I was one of their favorites, because they knew my family and also was associated with me in church.  So I guess it was both of those were kind of some of my favorites.
Story_ID: 22107
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have any talents or hobbies when you were growing up in grade school?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  Just a little, you know, sandlot ball (if there was sand?), whether it be--mostly football or basketball.  Not great on hardball.  That ball was coming a little too fast for me, for myself.  So I was careful about that, but no.  The only other hobbies, I was a Boy Scout.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Also, I worked with friends.  I had neighbors who were in the Boy Scouts; and so, soon as I was eligible to get in the Boy Scouts, I did do that.  But other than that, no other real hobbies that I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you started at Stans--now, did you go to kindergarten and just regular (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember going to kindergarten.  I think my grandmother, my paternal grandmother, took care of us along with my mother, so no kindergarten.  I--so--but just elementary school right to middle school, as they call it, then junior high school and into high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started grade school in '53 [1953], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.  That would be about right.
Speaker 1: And then by--so, now, did you go to--.  What was the name of your middle school?
Speaker 2: Actually, middle school was Wiley H. Bates Jr. High School.  The junior high school and high school were located in the same place, so I started there, you know.  So once I took that walk, I continued to take that walk for six more years; that is, for the middle school or junior school, junior high school and high school were located at the same place, about twenty blocks from where I lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about middle school?  Now, did you--anything change in middle school in terms of your focus or activities?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  You know, I still had an interest in sports, and I tried out for the, you know, the junior varsity team and stuff like that, but didn't make either of those.  But my interest was still basically the same, but fairly--fairly evenhanded in terms of my courses, my grades were all about the same.  So nothing stood out in the way others struggled with math and science.  I did well in those.  You know, I guess it was in middle school I met a person who became one of my best friends in life, and he and I have been friends since the seventh grade, on and even up until--even today, we're still best of friends, although he lives in Delaware.  So, that was probably something that was a landmark-type of event that took place in my--in middle school.
Speaker 1: Who is he?
Speaker 2: His name was Kirson Herbert, K-I-R-S-O-N, H-E-R-B-E-T.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: H-E-R-B-E-R-T.  H-E-R-B-E-R-T.  Herbert.  And, I guess when we first saw each other we didn't get along, but I guess that lasted all about two days after we had our first fight.  Then we became best of friends after that to the point that when we could really get around and drive and do things, he spent a lot of time in my house, and I spent a lot of time at his house.  And so, that was all through college, although he went to Morgan State College [Baltimore, Maryland] and I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, District of Columbia], we still remained best of friends and spent a lot of time on weekend.  And it was through him and through his father that I learned about golf, okay.  And I guess I should go back a little bit too, because, you asked me a question, and now--and something that triggered in my mind.  When I was growing up, I guess it was around the same time I was in middle school, that one of my neighbors asked me if I'd be interested in trying to earn some money being a caddy at a golf course, local golf course.  And so, he took me down and let me follow him so I could learn what to do.  And so, I became a caddy at the golf course.  And because all the caddies also played golf, I also had an interest in playing golf.  And it was also that with my best buddy's--Kirson's father who played golf, and he also had another brother that I began to play golf more often, and his father would look to help to teach us and do things like that.  I didn't caddy long, but I started playing golf at an early age, and so, I would say around 14 or so, and still play golf up until today, which makes it about 51 years I've been playing golf.  And you think after playing golf a long time you'd be good, but it's not always so; it's the journey that makes it fun.
Speaker 1: Now, you were a Boy Scout up until you said--when you were a Boy Scout, you were in middle school?
Speaker 2: I started as a--in middle school and then actually up until the tenth grade.  And when my friends graduated from high school, I kind of stopped going and then kind of missed the boat on that one [because I was just?] two merit badges away from being an Eagle Scout, which is the highest you could get.  And I guess it was two merit badges in my project what that will be--what they would be, so.  And I was just--it was a very positive influence on me, and I really didn't recognize where they had led me until I could continue the journey on my own.  I should have, but I didn't.  But that's kind of a story I always tell people, that sometimes you got to be self-motivated and continue the journey on your own and not just be a follower and do things because you're associated with other people.

Speaker 1: Now, did you think about civil engineer at all when you were a kid and in middle school?  Did you know what it was or did you think about like how the solar system was constructed or how utilities were--or any of that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: No, I really didn't think about that in middle school.  I think it was when I was in--when I got to high school.  I began to think about next steps, and you know, next steps to mean a lot of things, so I knew something where I use probably some math and science.  And so, the split was between physics and also it was in civil engineering.  And the choice got made when I visited the Naval Research Laboratory which was here in Annapolis [Maryland] and I had a chance to talk to some people about what they were doing.  And I talked to one of the physicists.  And one of the classes I had was Spanish, and I got a D in Spanish because my best buddy Kirson and I were singing songs instead of practicing our Spanish, and the teacher, she could listen to us.  And so, she punished us that week--but anyway, so--that grading period.  So when I talked to the person who was a physicist at the Taylor Naval Research Laboratory, he was actually reading a book in Russian, and he was telling me the importance of foreign languages because not every--not all the important scientific things were in English and sometimes you have to go out and read other things.  So at that point I decided that the physics wasn't going to be for me, because it'll probably a language requirement.  If I had a weakness, it probably would be that.  And so, I chose civil engineering and haven't looked back.  And even all through my studies, language was never a requirement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's in college.  Now, wait.  Well, okay.  I was thinking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the --
Speaker 1: (unclear) wondered about, like, where, you know, where is, you know, when you flush the toilet, what happens--what happens when you turn on the water?
Speaker 2: No-not.  No, I didn't think about that from that standpoint.  I may have thought about roads and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But not--and why bridges stand.  So that's one of the things that attracted me to civil engineering.  Understanding how this bridge could stand and how people could do things like that, and tall buildings.  Now why didn't that building fall down?  You think about things like that.  So I had that interest.  And my interest, when I was in high school, was really about civil engineering from the standpoint of structural engineering, and not from the standpoint of environmental engineering.
Story_ID: 22109
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were in high school.  You graduated in, what?
Speaker 2: '65 (1965).
Speaker 1: 1965.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So you were in high school when Dr. King was--well no.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  That was (unclear) in high school.
Speaker 1: Ya'll paths was--you were there when JFK was assassinated.
Speaker 2: When JFK was killed, right.
Speaker 1: And when the March on Washington took place.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you were here in--well, you were near Washington, you weren't in, you know.
Speaker 2: I was near Washington.
Speaker 1: But did you--was your family, did they keep up with the Civil Rights Struggle?
Speaker 2: They did but, and I'm reflective of my family.  We were not integrally involved.  Even within the city of Annapolis [Maryland] when they were trying to desegregate restaurants and things, a lot of my--a lot of my friends, especially my Boy Scout friends, were, like I say, older than I, but they were quite involved in the sit-ins and things like that.  But my family wasn't and I wasn't.  I've never been outwardly proactive that way.  I guess I've always been a person to look to break barriers from the inside out rather than from the outside in.  And even today I--kind of explains some of the things I do today; a little strategy that people may have.
Story_ID: 22110
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, in high school, now, you're at Bates High School.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Here in Annapolis [Maryland], what was--you know, did you have good teachers here?
Speaker 2: Good teachers.  You know, I think, for the most part they're good teachers; good English teachers, good social science teachers.  I think some of my science teachers were not as strong as they could be.  My chemistry teacher was also my--was the assistant football coach.  And so, I think his interest was more in football.  My physics teacher was very good, and my math teacher was very good.  So I think that, for the most part, we had good teachers.  And in cases where we didn't have good teachers, we got to college, we had to make up for it.  But that was okay.  We were encouraged to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, did you run for a class office when you--.
Speaker 2: Never ran for a class office.  I always feel--I never have had that kind of ambition to be a class officer.  But--and like I said, I probably did my part as a part of a committee, but never out front doing things.  So there's some other people who like that and I let them do that.  It was fine with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How were your grades in high school?
Speaker 2: Grades, I was a B-plus student.  And so, I was, you know, in--but I don't remember studying.  I never studied at all in school.  From first grade to twelfth grade, I don't remember doing any real hard studying the way I did it in college.  It was if I read something, I could remember enough to pass an exam and get a good grade.  I really didn't struggle with concepts at all.  If I had struggles, it was like, maybe, as I was saying, memorizing Spanish or history, but never in times of the science and the math, because it was always a clear story about what was being said when I would do those things, and so, they came fairly easily.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So when it came down to graduating from high school, you were really a little bit above average student?
Speaker 2: I'm above average student.  I was in the top five in my high school.  And so, it was a--you know, I think we had about a hundred--
Speaker 1: Well, you had better grades than just B's then if you were in the top five.
Speaker 2: I said the B plus.  B plus.  B plus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So you were in the top five out of how many graduates?
Speaker 2: Oh, about out of a hundred.
Speaker 1: Hundred?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  So, had you--did you receive good counseling?
Speaker 2: I did.  In fact, I think it's through counseling that I got to college more so than not on the end of my--looking at what my family could afford and things like that.  I think when I was asked probably in the ninth or tenth grade what I want to do, I probably said go in the Army, because I knew I could do that.  And I think about how much it was going to cost to go to college.  But as I progressed through high school, it was always the teachers saying, "You're going to college," not "You should."  "You're going to college and we'll help you find a way."  And so, I got good counseling there, and they were very helpful in making sure if there was money out there I got it, and that I got my applications in, and they would look over things.  And I applied to two places, very limited things; Morgan and--Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland] and Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  And if I had gone to Morgan, it would have been physics because they didn't have engineering at that time; and I applied the engineering at Howard and got accepted, so that was good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's another question I had here.  (Got a question to ask you before we leave it?).  Well, okay.  Well, okay.  So, you started school--did you work over the summer or did you--?
Speaker 2: I worked over the summer.  I did work over the summer.  I worked at--I worked every summer.  And so, I worked every summer and even when I was in high school, I worked in the evenings.  I worked at the Naval Academy.  When I was in high school, they had a little canteen there, the Naval Academy.  There's one big dormitory with 3,000 male (militia men?) at that time.  And one of the interesting things that happened when I was working there, Roger Staubach was the quarterback and was the attending Naval Academy there.  So I had the opportunity to kind of--to see him on a couple of occasions as he would come and get a hamburger or cheeseburger or whatever.  But, I did--I worked every summer, either moving at a moving storage company or else moving and storage.  And it was, I guess, even after high school, when I graduated from high school, I worked there because I could make enough money moving furniture to pay my tuition for a semester.  And that--it wasn't--and actually, I could pay my tuition for two semesters.  The guy who owned the company, I did a good job and he let me make a lot of hours, and every year he gave me a nice raise.  So, and--so that was a good place to be for me, was to be moving furniture.  And I wasn't--I'm not a big guy, but you learn as a big guy--I mean, as a person of my stature, that you want the job with the pencil.  And I knew how to spell vacuum, and most people taking in inventory didn't know how to spell vacuum (laughs).  So because I could spell words that they couldn't spell, he said, "You take the inventory and they will move the boxes," and stuff like that.  So there were some advantages to having a little few smarts anyway.
Story_ID: 22111
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--okay.  At Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia], 19--it's fall of '65 (1965).  Now there was a speech that Lyndon Johnson made at Howard.  I don't know if he made it when you were there, but you heard about it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I heard out it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you--did you have any reactions to that?  I mean, how did it affect you at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, two things.  First of all, to go to Howard University and to have the President of the United States come and speak, it made it a very special place, because it could attract people of that stature.  I think in terms of his speech, it kind of help to open my eyes in terms of opportunities that were in front of me, and of places that I could go if I was able to work very hard, and to do the right things in terms of being successful and as I work.  So, I guess, to me the biggest thing was, "Gee, this is a special place, and if you do good here, you could probably do good any place."  And so, it was a place that was encouraging to hear him at.  At that time, you know, being a freshman or so, you don't really listen to things as attentively.  You're seeing at the 30,000 foot level, and so, that was-- (unclear), but I had a chance, as we'll talk later on, to actually be in a role that some of my professors were when other dignitaries came to Howard, and so, I think that was important too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--yeah, because he made some--I think he even called for reparations at one point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was something very--real (striding?) that people were surprised that the President was at, you know, (striding?) about Civil Rights.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He went places where the civil black leaders didn't go.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in that one speech at Howard.  So--now the--okay.  Now--all right.  Well, what was the--you decided to major in--not physics, right?
Speaker 2: Civil engineering.
Speaker 1: Civil engineering?
Speaker 2: I majored in civil engineering.
Story_ID: 22112
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, well, tell us, now, what is civil engineering?  Now, maybe people who'll watch this later on don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: Well, civil engineering is a profession where we provide services to the public in general.  And when you think about anything that's--whether it be water, water treatment or waste water treatment, whether it be bridges, whether it be the structural integrity of buildings, whether it be roads, whether it be railroad systems, when you talk about things moving, things in mass, civil engineering is involved.  I am--in particular, I'm an environmental engineer, so what I do is to look to protect the environment and human health through the kind of projects I work on, whether it be projects where we're collecting waste water and treating it before we discharge it to rivers and streams or whether we're treating the water before you drink it so that you don't have to worry about catching diseases from it, because a lot of pathogenic and noviral diseases are passed through water.  There's also--we also try to get involved in building buildings such that they are environmentally sound or healthy buildings.  We're heard of sick buildings, for example.  And so, engineers--civil engineers get involved in trying to do that.  So civil engineers provide the services to the public that affect people in a large way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, engineers are often lumped with scientists.  And I know one of our interviewees this week said, "Oh, no.  Scientists and engineers are different.
Speaker 2: They are different.  I think that--I would say that, one of the differences is that engineers are translational in what they do; meaning that, they take the science and do something with it, okay.  So, I think that what we do is, we take science and use it to produce goods; and the goods may be a road, the goods may be a grid for an electrical system, the goods may also be a computer, okay.  So engineers get involved in taking the science and translating it into things that are useful to people.  And so, I think that's how you make--they all make a difference.
Story_ID: 22113
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So who were some of your teachers and mentors at Howard [Howard University]?
Speaker 2: Well, I have to say I had a lot of--I had a lot of mentors.  But let me talk about at least three of them.  One was a guy by the name of Walter T. Daniels.  He was--Dr. Daniels was a structural engineer, first African-American to get a Ph.D.  He got it from Iowa State University.  Dr. Daniels, when he was working on his Ph.D. and all through his schooling while he was--he went to Prairieview undergraduate, but when he went to graduate school, and he had laboratories, he had to do his labs by himself because there were segregated--it was a segregated--he basically was segregated.  But he was able to do all that and do it well, and he understood the importance of education.  And when we would complain about how hard it was on us at Howard, he would tell us what it was really like to be hard.  So he was a role model because he had--he got his Ph.D., he was a scholar, he had a good understanding of all of the course material, and he also was a caring person, and he nurtured a lot of young people to go on to graduate school and do things.  The second one was the person who got me into environmental engineering, and his name was Man Mohan Varma.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?  Now what is it?
Speaker 2: Man, M-A-N, M-O-H-A-N, and the last name is Varma, V-A-R-M-A.  Dr. Varma was a (sic) environmental engineer, and he was the one that got me interested in environmental engineering and invited me to his laboratory to work when I was a junior; said, "Why don't you come down to my lab and work and I can you some of the things we do?"  So he was--he had an influence on me in terms of going into environmental engineering which, at that time, was called sanitary engineering.  And I worked in his lab.  He also helped me to select a graduate school.  And so, that was very good because he sent me to help me go to a school where he knew that it would be a caring and a welcoming environment.  So, and I actually had a chance to come back, when I came back to Howard, to work with him for many years, and he still was very helpful mentoring me; made sure I did the right things, took the right professional--made right professional choices about memberships and professional societies; being active.  He and I coauthored a couple of papers together and actually hosted a couple of conferences together.  So he was very influential in my career in the environmental area.  The third person was a guy by the name of Raymond Jones.  Ray Jones was a Howard graduate who had gone to the University of Michigan and had gotten his master's degree in sanitary engineering, and came back to Howard to teach.  What was unique about Ray was that he was also a practicing engineer, and I had times that I worked on a couple of projects with him and--but he also was a good mentor, because he had a nice balance about his life.  He was one of the faculty, he did--he was a practitioner, so he brought that practice to the classroom so e could see really how we could take the information we were using, learning in the classroom, and how we could take and translate it into a project.  So, Ray Jones was a person who helped me see the bigger picture about life, and I think that was a--he was--he also, I think, took a special interest in me because I had a chance to work with him too.  Oh, and the interesting thing that--that was that I had--I had a chance to be on the faculty with all of them after leaving Howard and coming back to the faculty.  So I had a chance to know them from two perspectives.
Speaker 1: Okay.  As a student and a faculty member?
Speaker 2: As a student and a faculty member.
Speaker 1: Now, what other activities were you engaged in at Howard?  Were you part of the--
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a studier.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just studied.  (Again?) a continuation of what I did in high school, but studying in a different way.  I actually, I really did study here.  And I remember being in my first classes in math and science, and I was in there with students who had come from technical high schools, and so, they'd had one year of calculus already.  So what they saw in calculus they already knew, and to me it was Greek.  And so, it required me to really study and go back and brush up on my algebra and trigonometry, and learn those things and relearn those things as I was doing the calculus classes.  So, I remember that it was at Howard that I had to have good study habits, and I didn't have time to do other things.  And I actually had a detailed schedule of everything I did, and my time for relaxation was Friday evening and, also, it would be a little bit on Saturday evening.  But all the other time, except for church time on Sunday, I was studying.
Speaker 1: That's a tremendous work ethic.  I mean, who do you cite as a source of the inspiration for that?  Or did you internally (unclear)
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't internally.  But a couple of my buddies who were in the Boy Scouts with me, at least one of them that lived right around the corner from me, also was--went to Howard and he was in electrical engineering.  But he stayed one year and actually flunked out.  And I always knew that they were much smarter than I was because they were two years older.  So there were new things I never knew.  So my inspiration was that, our high school was a good high school, and I wasn't going to do what he did and I didn't care what price I had to pay, I was going to study enough so I could make it.  (So that's what I did?)
Story_ID: 22114
Speaker 1: So did you join a fraternity at Howard [Howard University]?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I'm a member of an academic fraternity called "Tau Beta Pi," but they're not known as a social fraternity.  Here, again, studies were important.  You know, one of the things about going to college, I did--I graduated in four years.  I took one course in summer school.  But because I wasn't quite sure about which of the sub-disciplines of civil engineering I wanted to be in, I graduated with 165 credit hours.  And so, I took all the courses, elective courses in structural engineering.  I took all the elective courses in sanitary and environmental engineering, and-- because I wasn't sure.  I enjoyed both of them, so it didn't--and really, that was not--it was not onerous on me because I enjoyed what I was doing.  And at the same time I worked in the laboratory.  So I think that school was a--I don't know if it was a refuge for me or what, but it was--it was fun, and I enjoyed it and had good relationships with my professors, who helped me to move along in terms of my career .
Speaker 1: It's certainly good to have that kind of attitude about school if you're going to be there.  But so many people do so many diverse things in school other than study.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you seem to be an anomaly in that sense that you--.
Speaker 2: Well, I am, but I also tell my students nowadays, and I still have a couple of students who are moving on, that they needed to look at the full spectrum of things at the university and that you need to grow in other ways besides just academically.  You need to grow personally, you need to grow in--look at broadening your interests and meeting other people.  And so, I try to give them a lesson for something that I learned later on and probably did later on in life as I began to grow outside of the classroom.  I did that after--my undergraduate years.
Speaker 1: So, you have some regrets about not being involved in other activities and--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have any regrets.  I think I put my energy where I had to put my energy.  And I always say--and I go back to when I tell some of the young people, even that grew up on my block, I say, "Look at those guys down there.  They all are excellent basketball players, excellent football players, excellent baseball players; and some of them went to college and some didn't, but look at them; they can't walk, and the jobs that they have are probably are not the top jobs.  So I took a pathway through my studies that led me to what I think was--had been a very good, and continues to be, a very good career with a lot of rewards.  So it was a case where I could catch up on some things and have the resources to be able to do that.  So I think--I don't regret that I grew how I needed to grow, and that was academically, building a strong academic foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you graduated in 1969, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the president of the school--now was James Cheek the president when you graduated?
Speaker 2: James Cheek was the president when I graduated, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came in when I was an undergraduate.
Story_ID: 22115
Speaker 1: Okay.  So had you decided--I supposed you decided to go on to graduate school at this point?  You knew where?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew I was going to graduate school because I'd been, like I said, Dr. Varma had been very helpful to me as a mentor and had pointed me to the University of Illinois as a school that I should be thinking about attending.  We just started the graduate program in environmental engineering, and one of the professors from Illinois was on the advisory council, a guy by the name of Richard Englebrecht.  And so, he knew that if I went there, that Dr. Englebrecht and others would follow--would make sure I was well-taken care of.  Actually, when I went to Illinois, they had a master's program [Sanitary Engineering].  There was--I took the non-thesis option.  It was designed to be a one-year program.  I left in 364 days with my degree in my hands.  So, it was two of us that did that, another young man and I.  But we both went there, we were on a mission to get in and get out.  At that time, I wasn't thinking about a Ph.D., but I was thinking, now a master degree would be a good--would be a credential I needed to do some things that I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: So you were thinking that you would work as a civil engineer and that would be the--.
Speaker 2: I thought I'd work as a civil engineer and that would be the end of it.  Actually, the young man that--he and I got out at the same time, we both went to work for the same company.  His name was James-- Jim Manwaring (ph. splg.).  He had went to undergraduate at Illinois, and he and I became good buddies.  He played golf and so that was another thing that was--what was--that attracted me to him, and we took all--basically all the same classes together, and went to the same company to work.
Speaker 1: Now, before you're leaving though, your advisor was Vernon Snoeyink?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Vern Snoeyink was my advisor.  One of the things that's interesting, after my senior year at Howard after I graduated, I worked for the United States EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] as a summer intern.  And my supervisor there was a guy by the name of Norb Jaworski (ph. splg.).  Norb Jaworski had just gotten his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.  And Norb Jaworski said to me, "When you get to Illinois, I want you to look up one of my classmates."  He told me the name.  I didn't remember the name, but my advisor was Vernon Snoeyink, and after I got my first advising, I said, "Do you know a guy named Norb Jaworski?"  He made me sit down because he and Norb Jaworski were classmates at the University of Michigan.  So as it turns out, that was a nice connection.  Vern Snoeyink was not only--he was my academic advisor, but also was my--we had to do a special project--special project advisor.  And so, he worked in the area of activated carbon.  And one of the new things that we used activated carbon for was to use it to dechlorinate water.  The issue there was, when we're putting chlorine into it, we would have a wastewater treatment plant, we'd treat the water--treat the wastewater, and then we would disinfect it with chlorine before discharging it to the river.  And it was felt there would be some deleterious effects of the chlorine going into the river, because it could harm the native fish and other things.  And so, we were looking at ways of removing the chlorine and activated carbon was the method for doing that.  And so, my master's project was looking at using activating carbon to dechlorinate water and also measuring the changes in the chemical structure of the activated carbon as a result of that, trying to see if it still maintained its absorptive capacity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, you joined the American Water Works Association, I believe, around this time, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, you know they--one of the things that was happening is that, as a part of that journey of going to graduate school, we were encourage to join professional organizations; American Water Works Association, the Water Environment Federation, were two of the key ones that people would join, and this was how you would keep up with what's going on, and professionally you'd meet other people who were doing similar things through those organizations.
Story_ID: 22116
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now, 1970, I guess, is when you and your schoolmate there joined the Engineering Science (unclear)(simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In 1970, we went to a company called Engineering Science.  Engineering Science office (sic) were located in the Watergate.  And the Watergate--it was--this was a famous time for the Watergate.  This was the time that the Republican (sic) had broken into the Democratic National Headquarters and were accused of stealing some documents, and we all know the story that--in terms of what happened to President Nixon as a result.  But we were in that same building.
Speaker 1: So were you working there then?
Speaker 2: I was working--I was working in there then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because, this, yeah, the break-in is, I guess, was in '72 (1972)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I think.  I think it was around the (unclear)(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You think it was fall of '72 (1972), before the election?
Speaker 2: Right.  So that was just--we were just--we were there, and that's about the same time I was coming back to Howard [Howard University], too, was around that same time, too, because I worked there.
Speaker 1: Nixon as elected in '68 (1968)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then he had stood for reelection in '62 (1962)--.
Speaker 2: In '72 (1972), right.
Speaker 1: '72 (1972).  That's when the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, it was probably a year before that that the [break?) (unclear).
Speaker 1: It was in the fall of '62 (1962).  I mean of '72 (1972).
Speaker 2: Yeah, '72 (1972) right.  Yeah.  So that was the same building that we were in.  So I was--it's probably when I was on the way out (unclear) as the break-in was taking--but that always a nice story to tell people that were there.  So we were--but the office was still there.  Me, personally, was probably--had probably moved--I had moved to Howard at that time.  I stayed with Engineering Science for about a year before moving to Howard.
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Frank, who was the guard, security guard there?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't know him. (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: I can't think of his last name.  But he was the one that put the tape over the door.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, he took the tape off the door, and that's how they got locked in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, no.  I didn't know any people there, but there was a--I didn't know any people except for the people in my office, really.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Probably because the Democratic National Headquarters was there with the--which probably was not a big thing to me either (laughs) until something happened.
Speaker 1: Well, I thought that, you know, I know how black people are in a workplace.  If you're--other black folks talk to each other whether they work, you know (unclear)(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I know I--I didn't know him.  Maybe I may have spoken to him, but never knew him by name.
Speaker 1: I can't think of his last name.  His first name was Frank, and he (unclear)--he's passed away now.  I don't think he lived long, maybe ten years after that.  But, yeah, he--.
Speaker 2: They probably put something in his water (laughs).
Speaker 1: Yeah, he suffered.  He seemed to have suffered, it could be because he--of his--you know, his actions, rather than benefitted (unclear).  But, so, you're in the Watergate building and, well, how was the job?  How did you like the job?
Speaker 2: Well, I liked the job.  I mean, it was--the Engineering Science, which is still in business, was a company where they used to hire people at the master's and Ph.D. level.  We did process engineering for environmental things; studies type of things, which was a great extension of what I did at the (master's?) level.  So the job was very interesting.  We had--it was a good crew of people that I worked with.  Like I said, one of my colleagues from the University of Illinois went there with me, and it was another young man there who also got his master's degree from Illinois.  So we had a little University of Illinois-type of group that we actually--actually all worked together.  So that made the transition easy.  Made the transition easy, so that was good.
Story_ID: 22117
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now in '73 (1973), you published your first academic paper entitled, 'Active Carbon: Dechlorinization (sic) and the Adsorption of Organic Compounds.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's what you were alluding to before.
Speaker 2: That's what I alluded to.  That's my--that was my master's project, and Vernon Snoeyink, and he had a little more of work done with it and it actually became a chapter in a book on the chemistry of activated carbon, so that got published there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, so does carbon actually replace the use of chlorine--
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't replace chlorine.  What happens, chlorine is used for disinfection.  It's just like bleach.  But it stay--it has a residual that stays, and the idea was to take the residual chlorine out so that it wouldn't impact the ecosystem--wouldn't impact the environment when it was discharged to the water, because chlorine could be--could kill fish and other type of things that live in the water.
Speaker 1: So, now, waste is treated with chlorine and then it's filtered through the carbon or was that--
Speaker 2: It's--so when you have wastewater treatment, you first try to remove all the stuff that can settle out, and then the dissolved organics which comes from our waste, we use microorganisms to kind of consume it, and then we separate--we separate the microorganisms.  And then what we take from that, that clear effluent, what we do with it is that we--sometimes we'll--we will chlorinate it to kill any pathogens that's left after that.  But after we have chlorinated it, we then would remove the chlorine before discharging it to the river or to the watercourse.  And so this process I was working on for my master's project was looking at dechlorination using activated carbon.
Story_ID: 22118
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, so, you worked for Engineering Science for how many years?
Speaker 2: About a year or two.
Speaker 1: Year or two.  Okay.  So--and then did you--
Speaker 2: So after Engineering and Science, I got a call from Howard [Howard University]--well, I was working at Engineering and Science, I got a call from Dr. Daniels, one of my mentors at Howard.  He was a department chairman there, and they were growing their environmental area.  He knew I was in the environmental area, and he called me and asked if I ever thought about teaching.  I said, not really, but I think it'll be something I enjoy--I would enjoy.  And so, I got recruited to come over to Howard with a master's degree.  And the deal was I would come to teach, teach undergraduate courses.  And if I liked teaching, that I would go back after a couple of years and get my Ph.D.  So I taught for three years and then I enrolled at the University of Delaware to get my Ph.D.  And I worked with a professor there by the name of Richard Dick (ph. splg.).  I chose the University of Delaware for a couple of reasons.  Rich Dick was also at the University of Illinois when I was at Illinois.  And so, he was there, and so, I had a familiar face when I went there.  But also, the University of Delaware had a strong program in chemical engineering.  And so, I wanted to do a Ph.D. in environmental engineering that had a chemical engineering foundation.  So that was a nice marriage to me, plus it was close to home.  I was married at that time and had bought a home, and so, it was someplace that I could go--go up on Monday mornings and come back on Fridays and spend weekends at home.  So, that was another advantage of going to the University of Delaware.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That--clearly the hookup of Professor Dick meeting from the University of Illinois--
Speaker 2: The hookup from the--yeah.  The familiar--Dr.--Professor Dick from the University of Illinois, the program, and the closeness all made it--it was a good combination for me.  And so, with their support and Howard allowed me to teach one course on Fridays, and so, I would actually come home Thursday nights or early Friday morning, and teach a course, 'Introduction to Engineering.'  I was able to kind of maintain my house.  And my wife at that time stayed here because she had a job--stayed in the area because she had a job.  And I finished my coursework, my experimental work and went back to Howard full time while I finished the completion of writing my dissertation.
Story_ID: 22119
Speaker 1: So what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: So, back again, the wastewater treatment plants.  So I mentioned that in a wastewater treatment plant, the first step is to remove things that naturally would fall off--that's in the sewer.  The second step would be to take the dissolved organics and have microorganisms to consume it, but in consuming it, they would grow in body mass.  And the next step then would be to separate this--these microorganisms from the liquid part.  And that's the solid liquids separation process.  But it would never happen very efficiently.  You wouldn't get everything to settle out.  So my project was to either understand why certain things would settle out on the--out of the waste stream, and why certain things would not.  So, what we did is try to characterize by looking at the distribution of the particles that would settle and not settle.  We'd also look at the density of materials that settle and not settle and see if we could come up with a theory about why we would get ineffective separation of the solids in this step.  And, really the result was that, when we looked at our tanks where the sedimentation was taking place, not everything--although we had an undercurrent to pull things under the--not everything was being pulled out with the same velocity, and we actually had eddies being formed in the tank.  So, as a matter of the flow patterns in the tank was the reason we didn't get the separation we were looking for.  So it was a solid liquid separation study that I did.
Story_ID: 22120
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you were--you earned your Ph.D. in '82 (1982)?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1982.  All right.  And so, you were offered that same the year the position of faculty chair, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was--I worked while I was getting my--doing my writing, which took a longer than it probably should have, [for what it's worth?], because I was working full time.  But one of the things that happened there was that I was--I was--while I was there I was also mentoring--being mentored as the department chair.  One of the faculty members by the name of Taff Broom (ph. splg.) had taken the position only if I could serve as his assistant to the chair.  And so, I was learning the job as I was doing my writing.  And so, at that time, I got my Ph.D., and I applied for the promotion to associate professor.  I got that, and I was able to--in tenure--and I was able to get the position of being the department chair.  And I was doing other things as I was writing, and I actually had a couple of other--taking up other forms of responsibility at the university, even though I was still just writing my dissertation.  And I should say a little story about why I got invited back to Howard [Howard University] to teach.  What Howard had to learn, especially in the Department of Civil Engineering, is that there were not many African-Americans getting Ph.D.'s.  And Howard was still, at that time, and still is, a place where role models are important.  You put in front of students people that look like them, have--they had backgrounds like them--like them, and they will--could be inspired to go to places that they never thought they could go because they could see that you did it.  And so, when I was invited to come back to teach, I think it was the idea that--that being an African-American, having done well--or I did well at my undergraduate, that if I were to go on to get a Ph.D., I would be a--also be a good role model for all the students.  And so, I think that was an important thing.  And the civil engineering, even today, there are--about half the faculty are undergraduates who graduated from--their undergraduate degree was at Howard University. They went other places and they got their Ph.D. in--in many cases they have worked some other place before coming back to Howard.  But that's been one of the--I think one of the things that Howard did, especially in civil engineering, just to bring their undergraduate alums back and offer them faculty positions.  And I think that was--been--been helpful to students who've gone through to be able to look at, "You were a student here too?"  And they say, "Well, how did you get to where you were?"  And that tells them that path is open for them and then many of them pursue that.
Speaker 1: I think I've heard that before, also in other departments, (unclear) the physics department.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, they go back to Thorpe, to Grant, I mean they had a lineage basically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you all have the same sort of--.
Speaker 2: And again, there weren't that many of them out there.  And for those that went on to get a Ph.D., coming back home was, I think, was as pleasing as getting the Ph.D., because they know that they could have an impact on people's lives just as faculty had had an impact on their lives.  I think that's an important piece.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's interesting when you hear people.  As I say, you know, at Morgan State, they always talk about Dr. McVey taught them, and then who taught him.  It's a good thing.  So, all right.  So, as chair of the department, you have a sense of what the department ought to be and a history of the place.  And so, what was your vision when you took--when you became the chair, what to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I guess, one of the things was to make it a strong department.  We had areas of environmental engineering, structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering.  And I thought that--we had just started a graduate program--and I thought we could kind of build on our graduate program.  And we did do a good job there because we have an environmental engineering area, we've been able to put together a group of five people, I'm sorry, a group of four people in the environmental engineering, which was a strong group at--at most of any institutions.  So, besides Dr. Varma, there was a faculty person by the name of William Taylor, it's myself, and a person that you mentioned earlier, by the--Lillian Abram Robinson or Lillian Abram, who also was a part of the faculty.  So, we got a strong core of environmental group; same thing, instructor's group.  So we had a strong master's program going.  So we wanted to build that and have support for all of our graduate students.  So I think that in the eight years I was chair, that we were able to do that.  The university's environment was healthy economically, so they were able to make investments in us, and I think that was something that was important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There also was a time when opportunities for African-Americans was broadening.  When I went to Howard, of course, it was a time when there were not many places that I would be welcomed as an undergraduate.  But, at this time, around the mid-eighties, everybody was looking for the best African-American students they could get.  And these best students would always come to Howard, because that was known as the premier place to go to.  And Howard was one of the very few of the historical black colleges and universities that had an engineering program.  In fact, we just celebrated a hundred years of engineering at Howard University; engineering and architect, in fact.  So, it was also a time when the strength of our classes was beginning to change, because other people were going to the same high schools we were going to and recruiting our students--and recruiting students we would typically get, and bringing them to their institutions, which was good for all, but also mean that Howard was not the only place of choice for students.  And so, one of the challenges we faced was how do we keep our enrollment up at the time when everybody was looking for the same student we were looking for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So at Howard, from what I've gathered, like, until recently, teaching is the main focus of being a professor at Howard?
Speaker 2: No, no.  It's actually--we had graduate programs and engineering back in the, actually, in the seventies.  And we've always had Ph.D.'s and chemistry and physics and places like that, and biology.  So, as in engineering--in particular, we got graduate programs in the seventies, we had a Ph.D.--electrical and the mechanical engineering in the seventies.  But just moving to Ph.D.'s and chemistry and civil--I'm sorry--chemical engineering and civil engineering now.  So, there was a change in focus around 1970.  And it was when we got a dean in by the name of Percy Pierre (ph. splg.).  Percy Pierre came in--
Speaker 1: In nineteen--
Speaker 2: I think Percy must have come in around '71 (1971) or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when he came in, one of the things he wanted to do was to take the engineering programs to another level.  That other level was, introduce graduate programs.  And so, there was a change from teaching to graduate education at that particular point.  And that was consistent with where the university wanted to go.  And so, we've had graduate programs for quite a while now, but the--still in some cases, I think that they've been gaining their real identify.  When they first started, they really were booming, large classes.  And, here again, we had good students, and everybody finds out where the good students are, and they start recruiting the good students too, so.  So, and it was around when I was finishing Howard that the shift was taking place from instructional emphasis to instruction plus education and graduate education--I mean, instructional plus research, plus graduate education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So undergraduate instruction.  So we began to hire faculty of different types.  And that's why it was important that if I was going to come to Howard and teach, that I go back and get a Ph.D.  I would not be able to survive on the faculty with just a master's degree.  Ph.D. became key because of the vision to go to graduate education and to do sponsored research.
Speaker 1: So, people coming in to this civil engineering department, I mean, how much of their time would be spent teaching and how much doing research typically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I would say that the typical model is that you would spend, oh, maybe 40 percent of your time teaching, 40 percent of your time doing research, and another 20 percent doing professional development things; working within the professional societies.  You mention the American Water Works Association; working with them, doing other things on committees, working with the national academies on a committee, working for the Environmental Protection Agency on a committee.  So, there were a lot of things that you might be doing professionally.  And, even some of that--20 percent of that professional development could be around doing some consulting, based upon your area of expertise, but it's through the consulting that you also will help to develop your skill set and bring things to the classroom.  So there's some connectivity there too.
Story_ID: 22121
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So what are some of the, I guess, it's probably but--I'm looking at the outline here, but I think the best thing to do is probably just ask you.  What were some of the highlights of your time at Howard?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--there are a couple.  I think that one of the highlights was being selected as dean.  I always had a vision about what it would be like to be dean.  I thought there were some things that I could do to help the university move forward.  So I think that one of the highlights was, they did a national search for dean, I was interim dean for a while.  Dr. Lucius Walker was the dean, he had taken a leave.  And so, while he was gone, I was actually acting dean.  And when he got back, he decided he didn't want to be dean anymore.  We had a new president, Patrick Swygert was in, and he said that we're going to do a national search.  I was a little disappointed.  I thought the job was mine because I'd done a good job as acting.  And we did a national search, and I applied for the job and I got the job.  I think one of the highlights there was that, that I understood the vision that President Swygert had, and I was able to connect to it and move the college of--School of Engineering, at that time, forward.  One of the things that happened was that the engineering programs and architectural programs were merged.  And when they were merged, I think another--I think a highlight would be making that merger such that it was a smooth merger of two different cultures, but we were able to come to a place where you could have some common things and understood our commonalities, and were able to grow and max and leverage them.  Also, I understood there were some best practices that we both had and were able to identify those.  And in some cases, the engineering faculty adopted things the architects were doing, and architects adopted some things that the engineers were doing.  I think another highlight was that we were part of a (sic) EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] Hazardous Substance Research Center for 11 years.  And our partners were the University of Michigan, Michigan State [Michigan State University]; and we served EPA Regions 3 and 5.  I think that we were the only--we were the only HBCU that was a full partner in the five centers.  There were five centers.  While working in the--with that center, I was in charge of the program at Howard and the associate director of the center, of the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic center.  One of the key things about that was the leaders of those centers, the participants of those centers, were some of the giants in the environmental engineering area.  I had the chance to work with them shoulder to shoulder.  I helped them to do the--helped to develop visions for things that we were doing.  And so, the leader of our center was Walter Weber.  Walt Weber had been a leader in the environmental engineering area for years, and still is very active.  Other people who were involved were Perry McCardy (ph. splg.), Herb Ward.  And so, these were people, when you go back and look at textbooks, you see their names all over the places.  In fact, as it turned out, Vern Snoeyink was a student of Walt Weber.  Also, Nordre Worski was a student of Walt Weber.  So, two of the people I worked with, one as a summer intern after I got my degree at Howard, and the second one was my master's advisor, were both students of Walt Weber.  And I had a chance to work with Walt shoulder to shoulder as we were working in the center.  So I thought that was--I consider that to be a highlight.  Also thought that another highlight would be that we led a DOE Center.  I led center that was looking at the--it had to involve 17 institutions, including Howard.  And so, we led that for five years, funded at about $3 million a year.  And so, that was--I think that was a highlight because, first of all, to put together a proposal to get it--together to get it; but, secondly, to bring it together in a way that we could see transformations taking place in the things we were doing.  That group had been funded previously, and that funding was really about development of facilities and capabilities within individuals.  When we put the proposal in, we funded it, we looked about--we looked at now taking those developmental things and building upon it, to go out and get and do research.  And so, we [constructed?] it such that where individual research projects had--interdisciplinary research projects--interdisciplinary research projects were across universities and across disciplines.  When we turned the final report in, we found that the money that DOE had given us, we had leveraged by more than 15 in terms of getting external funding during that same period that we had it there.  So the story line was that, the developmental work had--dollars we got had worked; we had invested in research programs; they had taken the results from those research projects and gone out and gotten external monies from other places.  And so, it was a good investment for DOE, and it was something I think they were very proud of.  And once we'd done that, we decided we didn't want to--we did not apply for any additional funding because the participants were getting funding from multiple places, and it was a good time to say that's the end of that effort.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And DOE is the Department of?
Speaker 2: Energy.  DOE is the Department of Energy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Good.
Story_ID: 22122
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: So, I think, while I was at Howard and while I was dean, I had an opportunity to do some other things.  President Swygert and I had a good relationship, and so, I think that we were able to work with him very closely as he was developing or carrying out the vision he had for the university, and one of which was to increase the advancement component; that is, the development component, the fund-raising component.  And so, we worked very closely with him in trying to do that in the areas of engineering and architecture.  So, a couple of things I think that were very important.  We were able to get from one of our donors a million dollar gift.  And part of that gift was used to provide funds for a gallery for the architecture department, also for rotating a professorship.  And so, that was--I think that was kind of--that was important because it's understanding how development works that made it successful; that is, understand that you find what people want to do, and you give them a chance to do it with you.  So, it was an alum by name of James Silcock (ph. splg.), he had already said he was going to give to the university; in fact, had us in his will, the university in his will.  And when I said to him, "Well, you know, Jim, wouldn't it be good if what you wanted to do later you could do now and could see it?"  And he had never thought about that.  And we talked about a couple of ideas, and within a very short period of time, we were able to come to a place where he was comfortable about making a significant gift to the university, and continues to make gifts to the university.  But, I thought that was a good lesson just understanding how it works, and having somebody who want (sic) to do something, and we were able to give them the opportunity to do what he wanted to do.  And he was--he is and continues to be very pleased about that.  There were other times too where we were able to do things.  I had a chance to meet with David Packard before he died.  One of my colleagues, a former electrical engineer by the name of Gary Harris, had gone to school with David Packard's granddaughter.  And he was instrumental in helping us to have an appointment with him.  So, Gary Harris, President Swygert and I had a chance to do go to David Packard's house--.
Speaker 1: Now, this is the Packard of Hewlett Packard?
Speaker 2: This is the Packard of Hewlett Packard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And to talk to him about things we were doing, and the one--one face-to-face conversation, we got invited to submit a proposal.  And so, we submitted a proposal for a named professorship, and because President Swygert was very much connected to that.  And what we did is, the university put up some matching things, and we were able to get a gift from the Packard Foundation for named professorship.  In fact, the dean of the College of Engineering, Architecture and Computer Science today is the--is that Packard--it sits in that Packard chair.  So I think that was a significant thing:  Number one, to be able to meet him; and second, to be able to get a gift from him.  So, some other highlights--
Speaker 1: What year was that when he was the Packard chair?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee.  You've now asked me something hard.  This was probably--I would say probably fourteen years ago.
Speaker 1: 1995 or something?
Speaker 2: Around 1995, right.  We could go back and look for the exact date.  (clears throat).  Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Was Swygert the president in '96 (1996)?
Speaker 2: Swygert was--probably came in--.
Speaker 1: He became president in '95 (1995).
Speaker 2: '95 (1995).
Speaker 1: So, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, [he was there?] so it's probably--probably early times in this era, so 1995.  So--
Speaker 1: So '95 (1995),'96 (1996), it was called the Packard chair, is established here (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  There you go, so you got it there.  So, the other thing I think it was that I did is, President Swygert came in and the mantra of the university became "Leadership for America and the Global Community."  And so, I took that at heart.  So, what we did is, we established a leadership institute.  We were able to find a partner (clears throat).  Excuse me.  We were able to find a partner and a company by the name of Black and Veatch.  They're an environmental engineering consulting firm.  One of the senior vice presidents had come to Howard, and after he gave lecture as a part of a professional organization that sponsors [lecturers?], and when he came in, he and I began to talk about the things we were doing at where we worked, at Howard and at Black and Veatch.  He talked about what he was doing.  And one of the things that we realized was that, there was a commonality that leadership was important to both organizations.  And he asked the question, "Well, how could we work with you in leadership?"  And I answered--I suggested to him that I wanted [for the?] the institute to help our students to understand the principles of leadership, and I really want to get the students when they first came in the door, our freshmen.  And he went back and thought about it.  And so, he asked him to send him a proposal, we did.
Story_ID: 22123
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to--I'll repeat a little bit of what I said for continuity.  I think one of the things I'm very happy about that I did while I was dean is to try to find a way to follow-through on our--the mantra of the university.  When President Swygert came in, the mantra became "Leadership for America and the Global Community."  So we were able to find a partner in Black and Veatch that was interested in helping us to provide a leadership institute for our students.  And this was a (sic) extracurricular activity for students.  What we tried to do was to have a guest speaker to come on a Friday afternoon, have a lecture on leadership that'll be open to the university community, and then have that following Saturday, the following day, full of workshops on leaderships.  And we were able to do that for 15 years.  So, the--our partner, Black and Veatch, stuck with us for all 15 years, and they provided us with a small grant of about 25,000.  But the important thing they did is, they gave us a lot of their people to help us to prepare the material.  And so, they put a lot of time and effort in beyond the dollars and cents.  So, highlights.  So, we had guest speakers, like, to kick off, like Bill Gates.  Bill Gates came to campus.  He was on a tour, and he was trying to convince--on this tour, he was doing six schools a given week, and we got selected to be done (on it too?).  We were selected for his visit on Friday afternoon, and so we scheduled--we scheduled our Leadership Institute to be that weekend and here's Bill Gates to kick it off.  So our students got a chance to see Bill Gates.  We also had a Four-Star General to come, General Lester Lyles.  He actually came in the same year of 9-11.  So that was kind of iffy as to whether he would be able he'd be able to come, but I should be able to tell you he came and he was well protected.  The last institute we had, our plenary speaker was General Colin Powell.  So he came and talked about leadership from his perspective, followed by a workshop.  We also had the administrator of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, to come and talk.  So we had a lot of good people who were in leadership positions to come and to talk to our students about leadership, and we followed up with students within our college with the workshops on Saturday.  So I think that, to me that was a way that we bought into the vision for the university and the mantra, and we were able to carry through.  And I felt as (though?) as that was a contribution that had an impact upon a lot of our students.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did that start in '95 (1995) and run through 2010?
Speaker 1: It ran 'til 2010, right; '95 (1995) to 2010.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Was the last one.
Speaker 2: All right.  So, you said fifteen years.  That pretty much locks you in (laughs).
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, what else?  Anything else?
Speaker 1: You know, actually, I can make a list of students, because a lot of what we did was with students.  I can talk about the, I think, maybe some special moments I had with students, whether it would be a teaching moment or a mentoring moment, and then look at the students three or four years down the road.  But I guess I would say I always had a gang of students that I worked with, even after stepping down as dean and going into the--America's ranks and having my research projects at Howard, I still have four or five students that were, not necessary--I didn't have classes then, but they weren't in my classes, but students who came to me and kind of found me to be a person they could confide in or a person they could talk and- talk to, and we'd find ways to move them forward and help them to grow.  So there were many, many, many students throughout the years that we had relationships with, in and outside the classroom that I think were very special to me, because I could see the students grow and go to the next places in their lives as a result.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 1999, you were given the "Man of Courage Award" by the--by a group called "A Tribute to Women of Color" of Anne Arundel County.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The "Women of Color" would get together--they're a subgroup of the YWCA, and what they would do each year is, they would have a banquet to raise money for students to get scholarships.  And a couple of things, I knew a lot of the ladies there, but one of the things that we did at Howard, kind of as a locals--my giving back to my local community, we had promised them that we would provide them with a scholarship for one young lady who's interested in coming to Howard in engineering.  And so, we were able to do that, and they would [often gave us very good candidates?] every year.  And we would provide them with a scholarship based upon, you know, a worthy student in terms of academically.  And so that they thought that was a fairly bold move.  And I guess in many cases they would call upon me to be a speaker at one of their functions as a--which would give me an opportunity to talk to young people.
Story_ID: 22125
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, it says here in 2001 you became the principal investigator of the project, quote, Molecular Modeling of Hydrophobic Organic Containments--Contaminants Uptake and Sequestering--and Sequestration by Soil Organic Matter, unquote.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, here, the idea is, over the years, I went from solid-liquids separation processes to one where we're really looking at treating hazardous waste in one way or another.  So in this particular project, what we were doing was, by design, designing compounds that basically had a (sic) affinity for waste, okay.  And what the idea was, an application may be radiological waste, for example.  Or an application can be hazardous waste, where we have some components that are radiological and some components that are hazardous, they're mixed together.  So there were design compounds that would selectively pick up the radiological components at one site and hazardous components at another site.  And the key was that we could release now the radiological components selectively and treat them separate, and release the hazardous waste separately and treat them separately.  Treating them separately was a much easier and much cheaper process to do than when they're combined.  So it was a way of designing compounds that allow us to selectively remove waste at given sites, and release those specific types of waste by changing the pH or changing the other parts of the compound.  So that's what that project was about.  The end result was it's a good theory, it works very well, works in a lab, having to produce the kind of compounds we had was very expensive and one of my colleagues that worked  for me on this, actually going to another generation of compounds that would do very much of the same things (sic).  These were dendromer type of compounds.  So he's gone to another--taken us to another--another stage now, and has actually has been doing some pilot work with it.  He's now associated with Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California]--(unclear) is now associated with Cal-Tech.
Story_ID: 22126
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were also an Environmental Health and Safety Consultant to the University of California in the office of the president?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The--one of my--one of the people who had come to Howard as a visiting professor, was also, Los Alamos National Laboratory, his name was Pete-- Warren Pete Miller.  And each of the national labs are different.  The Department of Engineer--National Labs have a (sic) Environmental and Safety Health committee that kind of looks over the safety aspects of what goes on.  And Pete had recommended me to serve on this Environmental Safety and Health panel.  And so--so I was selected to be on it.  The national labs at that time, several of them were under the University of California, so the actual engagement was with the University of California, and the advice the committee provided was to the president of the University of California.  Actually, we had to work--work, not only at Los Alamos, but Lawrence Livermore, and also had a chance to work at Lawrence Berkeley.  Interesting enough, my consultant work with them at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories gave me the opportunity to meet Steven Chu, who was a Nobel Prize Winner and a member of the National Academy of Engineering, and currently the Secretary of Energy.  So I had a chance to have lunch with him on a couple of occasions as I visited the laboratory, and that was a great opportunity to have (sat around?) and talked to him about how he got to where he is, and actually, a very inspirational story that he probably doesn't share enough, but maybe one day we'll get him to share it.
Story_ID: 22127
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--okay.  Okay.  Before you left Howard [Howard University], you were named the Samuel P. Massie Professor of Civil Engineering.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--for about, oh, I guess it's been probably close to seventeen  years now, we've had funds from the Department of Energy for the Samuel P. Massie Professorship.  We had recruited someone and they had served there as a Samuel P. Massie professor, and when he retired I actually became the Samuel P. Massie Professor of Environmental Engineering.  And that's a group of about, I guess, about twelve people that had that distinction across the country.  This is--it's not an endowed position, but it's just a professorship that has been funded on a yearly basis by the Department of Energy.  So I consider that to be an honor and great prestige, especially, you know, Professor Massie actually taught chemistry here at the Naval Academy, and actually was a pioneer in a lot of ways in terms of things that he had done.  So to be able to serve in the professorship with his name was quite--was an honor.
Speaker 1: Now, he was the first black head of the National Science Foundation, too, right?
Speaker 2: He was also too, yeah.  No, no.  I don't he was.  That's John Slaughter.
Speaker 1: John Slaughter?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Well, now, you were also awarded that same year, 2005, by the National Society of Black Engineers with the Lifetime Achievement Award.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, there are a couple of awards I think that I'm kind of pleased of, and there're two of them.  One is, you mentioned, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Society of Black Engineers, Lifetime Achievement Award.  You know, Lifetime Achievement awards are kind of interesting.  One of my colleagues once said, "When you start getting awards like that, that means you're getting old."  But it probably says that you probably helped to raise the tide in a significant way and had impact upon multiple people.  I think that that was, indeed, was the case.  I remember in my acceptance speech at the conference in Boston, I thanked a lot of people for what they'd done and there were a couple of people that I haven't talked about today, including one of my faculty members and friends by the name of Delon Hampton (ph. splg.), who actually was on the faculty at Howard when I was there, and probably became more influential to me with--were more influential with me (sic) after I returned to Howard as a faculty member, and later on after he left Howard and worked on his consulting firm.  But that, the National Society of Black Engineers Award was significant because I think it was of confirmation that there were some people who appreciated what I had done.  Nothing was a big spike, but all things were, as I say, raising the tide for a lot of young people, and hopefully (staying of?) being a role model for people too.  So I was real pleased with that.  The other one was an award from the Water Environment Federation.  And that was the Gordon Maskew Fair Award.  It's for education.  And I thought that was significant because it was an award that given by one of the mainline professional societies; it was a national award, and some of the people who are now getting that award were role models for me.  One of the recent recipients is Perry McCarty.  I'd mentioned Perry McCarty's name earlier as being one of the giants in the field.  So to share in the world with some of the people who are giants, I thought was very, very--I was very proud of that.  And so, that was certainly--that was a good award.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that was in 2008?
Speaker 2: That was 2008.  That followed the other one, right.
Story_ID: 22128
Speaker 1: In 2009, you were named Professor Emeritus of Civil Engineering at Howard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  After being dean for actually 14 years, and thinking about what I want to do next, I decided I was going to step down from dean--as being dean.  But, actually, I actually retired from the university.  I went to Professor Emeritus status.  So a retirement from faculty is little different from going to Professor Emeritus status.  I still had all the--all the rights of a professor, but didn't have all of the responsibilities.  So I was able to run research projects and do other things.  So it gave me an opportunity to maintain--I had three sponsored projects and when one finished, I stopped it.  But I ended up with two that I carried on.  One project which was very, very important, it was dealing with biofuels.  I mentioned over and over again that I'm an environmental engineer.  I deal in waste.  And it was always my thought that, that when we have--when we treated waste and the solid residue that was left over, which is called a sludge, and nowadays they call them biosolids, had value.  And the question is, how can we get value out of it.  Some of the things it's used for, now it's used as a compost material; it's used as a fill material; people have used it as a material for bricks; other people have used it for--to incinerate it to get the heat value out of it.  But I figured earlier there were some other things we--I figured there were some other things we could do with it.  So what we looked at is, how can we use the cellulosic content in sludge as a source of a biofuel, particularly, ethanol.  So the project we did was to--and my first master's student has finished that--is that, looked at cellulose in the biosolids, convert it to glucose, and from glucose to ethanol is a very easy process.  And so, one of my projects was to recover--to convert biosolids to ethanol, and we have shown that it can be done.  But the next step is the other components in sludge can be converted too.  About 30 percent, 40 percent of the sludge is protein, protenacious material.  Our next step, next we will be converting that also to a biofuel project like ethanol.  The other parts are oils and greases.  And we can't convert those easily to ethanol, but we can convert it to a biodiesel.  You hear a lot about biodiesel.  So my big vision about my research was to take the components and biosolids or sludge, and convert it to biofuels.  So why do that?  So, first of all, it's a--it's a good use of the material; and second of all, when you look at other materials that are used to do biofuels, people have to pay for it.  So you talk about corn, you talk about soybeans.  So when you use corn, what do you do?  You got to--somebody has to grow it. You have to buy it, and you still have to go through a conversion process.  So there's a cost that you have to pay for your raw materials.  With biosolids, wastewater treatment plants pay people to take it.  So I have a positive cash flow to start with.  So when we worked out the economics in terms of the conversion of the biosolids to ethanol and compared it to other sources, we were able to do it about two dollars cheaper per gallon of ethanol, which makes it very, very competitive with gasoline as a price.  So we think that when we get all the components converted, that we'll probably have something that can be very useable, and it would be a good end use for the biosolids, we won't have to worry about putting in a landfill or using it for other things, we can now convert it.  We'll have a small residue to dispose of it, but it won't be a large residue, and we think that can be an environmentally friendly process.  Other project we worked on was one, I worked with a consortium of Vanderbilt University called, "CRESP,"  "Consortium for Risk Evaluation and Stakeholder Participation."  That project is a Department of Energy project, and what happens there, we're looking at ways that would--doing basic, so I applied research to help to solve some of the problems related to the inventory of the World War II activities.  My project in particular was looking at taking waste out of tanks at the Hanford site.  They had taken the waste out of the--this is some very--got some nasty stuff; there's a lot of radiological materials in it, and they'd take the material out, they want to take the water out of it, and they want to vitrify it and put it in a glass form which is stable.  But when they were trying to take the materials and pump it, the pumpability of it was very poor.  So my project was looking at improving the pumpability of materials out of those tanks so they can de-water it and to vitrify it.  So that's what that project was about.  So we were just beginning that before I decided to do some other things.  But one of my colleagues is continuing that project at Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you left Howard in 2010?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  After 2009 I retired and continued to do research and work as a Professor Emeritus up until April of 2012.  Just recently, I was offered a position at the United States Environmental Protection Agency.  And that position was to run one of their research centers.  The particular center is called--it's a national center for environmental research.  It is the center responsible for the extramural friendly activities of the EPA.  So in a lot of ways, it fit what I had been doing all my life as a professor, as a department chair and as a dean; working with managing people who were managing research projects.  So I started that, and I tell people I took that--I said yes to that opportunity because I'd been working for--working with the EPA for twenty one years.  I worked with the EPA as a part of the Environmental Engineering Committee for the Science Advisory Board; I'd worked as a part of their Board Scientific Counselors, I actually was there for six years and served as chair for three; I'd worked as a part of the Science Advisory Board itself; I'd worked as a part of the Board of Scientific Counselors, and I'd also worked as a chair of the National Advisory Counselor for Environmental Policy and Technology.  So in some ways for the last twenty-plus years, I've been a Monday-morning quarterback giving advice to the agency.  So it gave me a chance to play the game and be a part of the teams, and it was something that I was--I'd thought I would enjoy doing.  For the last three months or so, I have enjoyed doing that, and I think we're making some positive contributions by being a person who has been on the advising side; being a person who's been a recipient of grants; and now being a person who's kind of looking at both pieces together.  So I find that's very interesting, and we'll see.  We'll do that for a couple of more years and kind of maybe make another decision about doing things.  But it's been very, very beneficial to me and satisfying to me for what we're doing.
Story_ID: 22129
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you look back over everything you've done to this point, and you're still busy, what, today, would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that there are a couple of things that would be my legacy.  Number one is:  The relationship I've had with my students that--it's been one that I've been, yeah, a faculty person in front of the class, but also close to the students.  The department chairman, but close to a lot of students.  Even as a dean I was close to the students helping them with their development.  So I think that number one is the relationship I have with my students.  I think that every one of my students would tell you that enjoyed the interactions we had and that we learned from each, and that was important.  The second thing is being a (sic) atypical engineer.  Engineers are a very quiet, reserved people.  And so, what I've been is, I've been a little more outspoken, and I've gone some routes others have not gone; for example, I've--for the last six years, I've been on the board of trustees of a community college.  I've served for the chair of that other board for three years, and I've been just reappointed for another six years.
Speaker 1: Which one is that?
Speaker 2: This is Anne Arundel Community College.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is, the city of Annapolis [Maryland] is in Anne Arundel County, and city--it was the county I grew up in, the county I've lived in all my adult life, and having been given the opportunity to serve to the board was something I had to say yes to.  So, here again, touching young people, helping to development their--and providing an environment for their development.  Community colleges are doing something that HBCU's used to do--is they're doing a lot of the development work.  H.B. Howard--prior to probably 1970, was doing--bringing students in, putting them with the remedial courses, and now taking them to the next level.  Howard doesn't do that anymore.  HBCU's now are looking at the graduate education and looking at research.  That's being done by community colleges.  That's one of the things that community colleges do, developmental work.  Community Colleges also do work and training--worker training, to help students--people to develop skills so that they can go get jobs.  And the third thing they do, they provide a route to the four-year institutions by providing the first two years of a college education.  So, it's kind of like a three-legged stool that it does, and I think that's a very important thing; and I think being a part of that, we have a chance to touch a lot of young people's lives in making it happen.  The other thing is, I on a bank board, which is kind of unusual.  It's a community bank.  Let's say in some ways I got a chance to be on a bank board because, at the time that I was the chairman of the board for the community college, the president of the bank was the chairman of the foundation for all the community colleges.  And I asked him--he and I were having dinner one day, and I asked him if they were looking for directors, and he said they are--they were.  And he said--he got back to me, and that's how that story began.  So I'm now a member of the bank board, and I'm also a member of the holding company.  And the key thing there, it's a community bank.  And it's a way to make sure that they're reaching out to the entire community that they serve.  And so, I thought that was a good opportunity to do that.  So it's--
Speaker 1: What's the name of the bank now?
Speaker 2: The name--it's Severn Savings Bank.
Speaker 1: Severen.
Speaker 2: And it's also an environmental friendly bank.
Speaker 1: S-A?
Speaker 2: S-E-V-E-R-N.
Speaker 1: S-E-V-E--
Speaker 2: Savings Bank.  As I said, it's a community bank, it's an environmental friendly bank; and so, the people I work with there are very good at what they do.  And so, I think there's opportunity for me to have some input there to impact the entire community.  Okay.  And so, I think that's the case.  So, I think that, when I look back at a couple of things, my relationship with my students, my service on the board for the community, my service on the board of the community college.  I think those are ways that people see me in a broader way in the community than just being a person who spent his life at Howard.  And I was--still continue to be well-respected as spending thirty eight years at Howard [Howard University] and there're still people that, even today, people--somebody came to me about something about Howard.  They see me as that connection--I still have that connection, and I'm very proud of that.  So, I think that all those things are important to me.
Story_ID: 22130
Speaker 1: So how did your parents feel about your career?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think that my parents and grandparents were all very proud of me and did everything they could to help me to move forward, because, number one: I think I was a--they believed I was a good person, I was sincere in what I was doing, I wasn't selfish, and I was being helpful with people as I moved forward.  And my older sister went to college for one year, but I was the first one in my family to graduate from college; and so, and they were proud of that.  And then we've had others to kind of follow me now, and they kind of even look to me for advice, which I find is odd, but I can understand why.  So I think they were very proud of what I did, and they continue to be proud of the things I am doing, because in a lot of ways people say I'm acting unselfishly.  I'm really looking out for others beyond myself and try and pave a way for them.  And I guess they know when you, as I start to say, I think my wife is probably very happy with the things that I do, and it compromises sometimes the things that we're able to do because I'm committed to doing other things.  And even when I was just in Professor Emeritus status at Howard, I was on several boards and committees, many of which I've stepped off now since I've gone back to work.  But she appreciated that and could see the impact of that.  I think one of the greatest stories I could tell is about a week ago, we had a little family reunion here at the house.  My family was up from South Carolina and the local family came over and kids and--so my nieces, nephews, great-nieces and nephews; and I guess I have but two--great-great niece, (sic)--and one great-great niece and one great-great nephew now.  But the thing that made it interesting, one of my nieces from South Carolina wanted to tell me a story and the story was this:  She said she's part of a book club, and she had chosen this book to talk about.  And so, as a sidebar when she was talking about the book, she was making an analogy to her uncle, which was me, and how my life somewhat paralleled what had happened in the book. Well, it wasn't that that was interesting; it was the fact that somebody in the club that she was with knew exactly who I was.  And the two had never talked about it before.  And everything my niece was saying, this person affirmed and was very excited about it.  And she was saying that her husband, that I was one of her husband's favorite people, and he was one of my students from many years ago.  So that kind of says the impact you can have and how people--and that's the kind of impact I'm hoping I have and that I'll be a role model for people; and that's why I think that my wife, a lot of times, allows me to do things that takes away from things that we could be doing.  So, I think that my parents would be very pleased.
Story_ID: 22131
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, you did mention your brother.  Now, your brother is--he's still--is he still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My brother--all my siblings are still living.  My brother, who's my--one of my best buddies, is still living.  He actually works as a supervisor for the Department of Motor Vehicles in the state of Maryland in the IT area.  And so, we kind of feed off of each.  His--a lot of his strengths kind of compensate for my weaknesses, and vice-versa.  So we are our go-to people about certain things.  And we--usually it's not a--or I ask, it's usually a "Will you or when can you do it, or something like that."  So, we work together very nicely.  And our families get along very nice, which makes it nice too.  So, I have a good--excellent relationship with him, and I always know he's somebody I can depend upon.  And even when I travel I had a--when I was doing my emeritus status with Howard [Howard University], I had a chance to do two projects for the (USA Idea?).  I was in Indonesia for two weeks--I'm sorry.  Indonesia for three weeks and Liberia for two weeks, and my wife was here by herself, kind of in the country by herself, so he was able to make sure that she felt comforted because she knew he was close by in case she ever needed anything.  So that's the extent that our relationship is, is that we can depend upon each other.
Story_ID: 22132
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you think that the country is going to find the (verve?) of what it takes to really makes some significant steps to save the environment before it's too late to do it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think that the--I think we're moving in the direction to save the environment.  And I'll give it to you in one word:  the word is "sustainability."  Sustainability is a way to--that we look to do things without harming the resources for future generations.  And it has three legs to it:  One is an environmental leg, one is an economic leg, and one is a social leg; and the social includes the health part too.  So it's a way that we've tried to bring those three things together in harmony.  And so, it really says that, you can have economic development and environmental preservation--environmental conservation.  You can have social well-being, and you can do it in a way that's economically feasible, and you can do it in a way that's in harmony with the environment.  So, a lot of companies now are adopting the theme of sustainability.  And they're looking at things being green from the products they use as raw materials to their (input up to what ?) happens to their--I'm sorry.  They're starting materials being, being environmentally friendly materials, to their products being environmental friendly.  So they're thinking about how do I dispose of something after--how is something disposed of after we--after we use it as consumers.  So sustainability is becoming very key.  I think you will see something like that getting bigger and bigger into--in the federal government as being in the EPA where we're working with sustainability as a backbone of what we do in the section of the EPA I work with--work in, which is Office of Research and Development.  So I think that, yes, that we will do a better job.  Another thing that they realize is that we talk about climate change.  We talk about the Earth, air--the air, the Earth getting warmer; and we talk about some of the impacts that going to happen as a result.  So impacts (sic) you're going to see is that the extremes are going to be more extreme and more severe.  So we're talking about higher temperatures, we're talking about--and longer periods of higher temperature, we're talking about more severe rainstorms happening, and those types of storms happening more severely; we're talking about more floods.  And as a result of the rainstorms, we're talking about droughts, and the droughts happening more over longer periods of time.  So these extreme events are going to happen more and more as a result of climate change.  And so, I think the way--we're going to be forced to do that just as a matter of survival.  So I think that over a long period, that environmental we're going to get--be better than we are now.  The rate at which the air's temperature is rising is going to start leveling off because we have to, because it'll be very detrimental to us if it does.  We often hear about the ice caps melting.  That's the consequence of it, and the sea rising as a result of that.  And these are not desirable things for us.  So, yes, I think that we'll do a better job with the environment by managing--we'll do a better job of impacting the environment as we learn more and more, and people become more receptive that man is making a difference in terms of climate change.
Story_ID: 22133
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, again, now, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: No, because I, you know, I thought about that a couple of times, and it just, you know.  I'm in my second marriage, and I kind of thought if I was married to the same lady would I be different.  But I wouldn't be the same person I am now.  And I'm very happy with where I am.  The collection of experiences, the successes and the failures and the defeats and the frustrations; I've had all that have come to make me to who I am.  And I can say that every night I go to bed, and in the evening when I reflect upon things, I'm very happy about that; very happy to be able to contribute on multiple levels and multiple perspectives.  And I think that's--I have a good feeling about that.  And I think that the Lord sent me on this pathway so I could get to where I am today, and I'm thankful for that.
Story_ID: 22134
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  Nothing comes to mind.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered as the person who cared about other people and gave more of myself than ever to other people than I ever received.
Story_ID: 22135
Speaker 1: PHOTOS OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  You want to tell me about this one (unclear)  Go ahead, tell us.
Speaker 2: So this is a picture of my brother and I, taken in 1959.  At that time, I was eight years old.  It's one of my--it's one of my favorite pictures because it's probably the last time in life I was taller than he is (laughs). OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  All right.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my great-great-great- great grandfather named James Colbert.  He was my grandmother's grandfather, and was very instrumental in also raising her because her mother died at a relatively young age. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my grandmother's mother.  And her name was Nan Colbert. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the house we're currently in.  It was built 60 years ago.  This house was at another location then and was built by my maternal grandparents. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the same house in it's current location before we, my wife and I renovated it, and it's on the site that was the homesite of James Colbert.  He owned many acres of land and subdivided them among his kids, and this was where he lived and his son James Colbert, Jr. lived. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the original house on this site, and it was a wood-shingled house.  You have a picture there of two of my great aunts; great-great aunts, I should say. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, what I did for 14 years as dean, as I always say at the time that the president of Howard would ask me to present the candidates for graduation, I'd say, "Mr. President, based upon the recommendation of the faculty of the College of Engineering, Architecture and Computer Science, I present these students to receive the degrees, bachelors of X, Y and Z."  And so, this is me making that presentation of the candidates for graduation. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my family at a social affair.  In the back is my--going from left to right, is my sister-in-law--former sister-in-law, my brother, myself; and at the table in the plaid is my father, my mother, my sister, my sister's husband, and my wife Rachita (ph. splg.) OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, one of the unusual things I do is, I serve on a board of trustees for a community college, and this is a picture of me being sworn in six years ago.  I'm a member of the board of trustees of Anne Arundel Community College, and I served three years as chairman of the that, and I'm entering my second six-year term.  So this is the Clerk of the Court and he's swearing me in. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: The high school I attended was Wiley H. Bates High School.  It was an all-black high school, and in about 1970--I'm sorry--1966, it was closed.  And some-20 or -30 years later, it was renovated and changed into a heritage center.  And now you can see the entrance up to the Wiley H. Bates High School.  You can see the flagpole there.  As a Boy Scout, one of my duties was to raise and lower the flag on a daily basis. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things I did while at Howard was, I was a social director of a hazardous substance research center, and here you see colleagues of--who also ran hazardous substance research centers across the country.  There of five them, each of them serving two of the EPA Region (fives?).  So you can see, for example, the person with the glasses on far left was Walt Weber, who was a director of the center that I was a (sic) associate of. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: And we do have a little fun.  This is a couple of years ago, my wife and I along with two of our friends played in a golf tournament that was sponsored by a foundation of the community college.  The person in the middle is Marty Smith.  She's the president of the community college, and she's ending her 18th year and will be stepping down July 31st.  That's probably more than you needed to know. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  That's okay.
Speaker 2: So one of the things that was very developmental in my life was being a part of the Boy Scouts.  And you can see, this was my Boy Scout Troop, and we--I was there, and it was two merit badges and my special project away from getting a--becoming a (sic) Eagle Scout.  All the other colleagues in that picture were at least two years older than I was, and when they left the Boy Scouts to go to college or the service or whatever, because they graduated from school, I left the Boy Scouts.  So I guess it was the story of unfinished business on my part. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  So this is--
Speaker 1: That's me. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  That's you.
Speaker 2: Right there. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Right there.  Okay.  I want to make sure.
Speaker 1: Yep. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my siblings and I that we took. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Can you name them from left to right?
Speaker 1: Left to right is Clifton Johnson, Wanda Wood, Marilyn Sills, and then myself. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my maternal grandparents; Nancy Kess and Alfred Kess.  And they're the ones who, sixty years or so ago, built this house that my wife and I now live in.  Nancy Kess was--is a retired--was retired from the federal government, and Alfred Kess was a fireman for the David Taylor Research Laboratory. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.  We're here in Annapolis.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it. OFF-CAMERA VOICE:  Thank you very much.
