When we first went to Negro League, we went up to Winnipeg, Canada to the play the [Chicago] White Sox [baseball team] and the 'Black Sox' [moniker for the Chicago White Sox baseball scandal of 1919] had throwed the World Series.  And when we got there, the people were all out in front of the stands selling tickets. And they had bet on the white team.  But they didn't know Satchel and I were with this white team.  But I stopped and talked to the white man and got Red Haley from Memphis [Red Sox, baseball team], Quincy Trouppe from Kansas City [Monarchs, baseball team], [Arthur] Art Hancock and we got here.
Speaker 1: Oh can you start again?
Speaker 2: I said we got all those players.
Story_ID: 12026
Speaker 1: Can you just talk about your favorite game?
Speaker 2: Well we were playing the big leaguers.  They had throwed the World Series in Cincinnati [Ohio] in 1919--the [Chicago] White Sox [baseball team].  And they barred them out of baseball and they went up to Winnipeg, Canada, where they make that whiskey.  And when they booked us to play them with Bismarck, North Dakota.  So the man hired me and [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige].  And I carried Hilton Smith and three other colored ballplayers with me.  And we took them--took the name of them.  We played them five games like this week and we beat them five days.  And the next month they brought us back for eight games.  And we beat them the first three and then they cancelled the rest. They said they couldn't beat us, so they cancelled the rest and paid us off.  And the man in North Dakota when they bought us out the league in 1936 after four years, we hadn't lost a game. The man gave me a Ford car and gave Satchel a Cadillac and gave us five hundred dollars apiece gas money to go to California.  And he went--he sold everything he had and he moved to, moved to 'Frisco [San Francisco, California], where he could be close to me and Satchel, he loved us.  He was the president.  He was the mayor of the town and he ran it.  When we said we wanted a girl, he'd get her for us.  That's the truth, because we was up there.  Some of the people that wanted to object to us fooling with white women, but he would get them for us anyway.  When we'd come, he'd have them in the bed waiting for us.  I'd say, "God bless America" (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay  (laughs) Double Duty, now we gotta--(laughs).
Speaker 2: That's the truth.
Story_ID: 12027
Speaker 1: Double Duty, now what other, what other memorable game did you have?  What about Ty, what about Ty Cobb?  What about--
Speaker 2: When I played against [Tyrus] Ty Cobb when he went to Cuba in '25 [1925], and I was playing down there. He came down there.  And he tried to steal second, I throwed him out both times.  He quit.  He said, "I ain't gonna play against no nigger.  Ain't no nigger gonna throw me out."  I said, "Well you ain't gonna run no more.  And I won't have a chance to throw you out."  I said, "Every time you run I'm gonna throw your ass out."
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what--?
Speaker 2: I played against Mickey Mantle.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what did you wear--let's still talk about Ty Cobb.  What did you wear on your chest protector?
Speaker 2: He was a hatred.  He didn't like coloreds.  He was a racist.  And I was gonna throw his ass out if he ran.  I dare go throw him out.  I got--I said, "Give me the ball Satchel."  And [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige] give it to me.  And I handed it to the man at second (laughs).  And threw him out every time.  But that was a good game.  Because we had some people to see the game.  I never had a man to give me a hundred dollars a game before in my life.  And I was happy.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1925 you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Cuba.  How did you get to Cuba?
Speaker 2: The man [Alejandro Pompez] seen me play that had the Cuban Stars [baseball team].  And I beat him every time I pitched against him.  Satchel beat him.  And he hired us to come down there and play ball.  And when [Ty] Cobb come down there, they put--he put all colored on the team.  And we tore their butt up.  We was all colored but one man, the right--left fielder [Roberto] Estalella.  All the rest of them was colored.  Danny (unclear) on third, (unclear) was at short, [Samuel] Sammy T. Hughes on second, [Walter] 'Buck' Leonard on first.  We took them.  We took names.  And Satchel was throwing aspirin tablets (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you.  Okay.  You said, "Thou shalt not steal," on your chest protector, she says.  That's what Claire [Hellstern] was saying. You had--.
Speaker 2: I did.  They used to put it on my breast protector. "Thou shalt not steal.  Double Duty is catching," (laughing).
Story_ID: 12028
Speaker 1: That boy [William] 'Bobby' Robinson was a good ballplayer.
Speaker 2: He was.  Tell us about him.
Speaker 1: He played with me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell us about him.
Speaker 1: Oh he could play.
Speaker 2: Tell us about some games with him.
Speaker 1: Well he played with St. Louis [Stars, baseball team].  He played with Mem-, he played against us when I went to St. Louis from Detroit [Stars, baseball team].  And he got hit up side the head.  He got knocked out.  He couldn't play for two months.  And he fell at my feet.  Boss throwing such a good curveball.  He was looking for a curveball (laughs).  Fastball hit him in the head.  It knocked him out.  But he's a good friend of mine.  I carried him to Cuba with me and everywhere.  I look out for him now, 'cause he's a good friend.  He's a nice friend of mine.  I did a lot of help for ballplayers.  Because I had more guts.  And of course I'd ask the white folks for their eye teeth.  They didn't pay me, I'd quit.  When I say something, I mean it.  I made a good name for myself, I'll admit that.  I'll admit because I pitched and caught.  I was the only man that could pitch and catch.  I could hit.
Speaker 2: Why do you think you could, you know, you could pitch and catch?  How--I mean why were you good at both do you think?
Speaker 1: I had such a good arm and I was a catcher in Mobile [Black Bears, baseball team].  And then I started to pitching.  And I could strike them out so much.  Everywhere I went they wanted me to pitch and catch, so they paid me more money.  So I did it.  I get money for pitching, getting money for catching.  Let me see that ball.  World Series.  Raw-, this is a good ball, Rawlings [sport equipment manufacturer].  See this ball--I could take this ball and take my finger and scratch that.  I could take my finger and scratch it and make it sail like (unclear), hell yeah.  Here you go partner, here.  I used to make it--I used to make that ball sail.
Speaker 2: You could?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.  Couldn't hit it.
Speaker 2: Was there a certain way that you held the ball?
Speaker 1: I'd take my finger and right at the seam and make it duck.  Nobody never know how to do it.
Story_ID: 12029
Speaker 1: Now talk about playing against [George Herman] 'Babe' Ruth.
Speaker 2: Babe Ruth wasn't nothing.  We didn't play but two or three games, 'cause he quit.  [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige] struck him out twice.  I didn't see him no more (laughs).  Satchel could throw that ball.
Speaker 1: So how long did, you and Satchel play? I mean you met him over--?
Speaker 2: I played--I caught Satchel twenty-eight years.  Satchel was a great pitcher.  He was a nice man too.  But he was ignorant.  You had to talk to him because he didn't like white folks.  He'd fight in a minute.  But he could pitch.
Speaker 1: Now let me go back over some just dates with you.  You were--you played for the Illinois Giants [baseball team] from 1919 to what?
Speaker 2: Illinois Giants?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I played for them up until '24 [1924].
Speaker 1: From 1919 to 1924?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then 1924 you joined the Negro Baseball--the League--?
Speaker 2: I went into the league to Detroit [Stars, baseball team].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were--and that was the Detroit Star--?
Speaker 2: I stayed there--.
Speaker 1: Detroit--?
Speaker 2: I stayed there until '30 [1930].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then they traded me to St. Louis [Stars, baseball team], because they wouldn't give me enough money.  I wanted four hundred [dollars].  They only gave me--they traded me for three men to St. Louis.  And I went to St. Louis.  I stayed one year and went to the Homestead Grays [baseball team].  I stayed with Homestead Grays two years.  And the Pittsburgh Crawfords [baseball team], [William Augustus] 'Gus' Greenlee got together and took over the team, and me and Satchel went together to the Crawfords.
Story_ID: 12030
Speaker 1: So you and [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige] then joined back up again.  You weren't with him during the time when you joined again with the [Pittsburgh] Crawfords [baseball team] in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: When I went with Pittsburgh, Satchel went with Baltimore [Black Sox, baseball team].  And when we were together, we were together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you played--what years did you play with the Pittsburgh Crawfords?
Speaker 2: I played with the Pittsburgh Crawfords from 19--1932--'32 [1932], '34 [1934].  '33 [1933], '34 [1934], '35 [1935].  Me and Satchel left the Negro League and went to Bismarck, North Dakota.  We stayed up there until they bought us out.  But we had to--we had made such a name for ourselves.  We could demand what we wanted.  And Satchel went to the Kansas City Monarchs [baseball team].  They give him a thousand dollars a month and they give him 10 percent of the gate receipts.
Speaker 1: Did they ever give you a percentage of the gate receipts?
Speaker 2: But I got a good salary.  I got a thousand dollars a month.  That was tops.  I went to the Black Yankees [baseball team] in New York [New York] and they gave me a thousand dollars.  I stayed there three years.  Then I went to--I went down to Cuba.  I stayed down there for a year for twenty-five hundred [dollars] a month.  And then when I got where I got--I was in a position to get what I wanted, I didn't care where I played.  And so they gave me some money.
Speaker 1: Now did--which of the teams did you like playing the best with?  Did you, did you--?
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you my best [baseball] team was the Homestead Grays.  I played with Detroit Stars.  I played with St. Louis Stars.  I managed Memphis [Red Sox] five years.  I managed at Birmingham [Black Barons] four years.  Everywhere I'd go they wanted me to manage 'cause I was a drawing card.  Then I went to Cuba [to play for the Cuban Stars baseball team] and stayed there up to eight years.  I made a good living.
Story_ID: 12031
Speaker 1: Why did you like the Homestead [Grays, baseball team] Pitts--Pitts--well no.  The Homestead, they were in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?  No.  Right. That's right.  Homestead.  I know I'm from that area.  So what--that's where I was originally born around, Pittsburgh.  But what--why did you like that team the best?
Speaker 2: Well I left that team to go to Bismarck, North Dakota.  [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige] left--(pause).
Speaker 1: Satchel went to Baltimore [Black Sox, baseball team].
Speaker 2: --Birmin-, he was pitch-, Satchel was pitching in--.
Speaker 1: Baltimore, right?
Speaker 2: Birmingham Black Barons [baseball team].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He left Birmingham and me and him got together. And they gave Satchel--it was a hell of a lot of money than a thousand dollars a month.  And they gave me--and they gave me quite as much as they give Satchel.  But eight hundred [dollars] was a hell of a lot of money in 1932.  We went to Bismarck and stayed four years.  And then when I left Birmingham I just told Satchel, "Go where you'll get the best contract because I'm going where I--."  He went to Kansas City [Monarchs, baseball team].
Speaker 1: Now was there--you broke your hand several times.  Didn't you?  Fingers.
Speaker 2: I had my fingers broke.  My--.
Speaker 1: Hold up your fingers so we can see them.  Look at those.  Those are baseball hands, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  All these fingers been broke twelve times.  Satchel would throw so hard they couldn't hit it.  But I--I'm still here looking at you, ain't I?
Speaker 1: Yes, you still are looking at me.  That's right.  Okay.  Now, now what--Claire [Hellstern] said to ask you about sports medicine.  What is that?  The sports medicine and how they took care of the team.
Speaker 2: No I never heard of no medicine.
Speaker 1: No, no, okay. Doctors--the doctors.  How did they take care of the teams?
Speaker 2: Well when you go in the city, you get any doctor--we had no special doctor.  Like the white people had special.  You get any doctor was available.  You going there and you find out a doctor--white or black, we didn't care.  Somebody give you first aid, and we got it.
Story_ID: 12032
Speaker 1: Now when did you start--when--I'm--when did you start managing?  You know, when did you--?
Speaker 2: I started to managing when I went up to North--in North Dakota.
Speaker 1: So you were managing and playing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how many people are--?
Speaker 2: That was in, 1931.  I started managing and they give me four hundred dollars extra for managing.  And we won every game we played.
Speaker 1: So what did you do as a manager?
Speaker 2: Nothing no more than what I always did.  Played and hit the ball.
Speaker 1: But were you responsible for the team and practicing with them and doing--?
Speaker 2: Oh I was responsible for everything.  But when I said something, I meant it because they knew I'd let them go.  When I speak, I don't speak but once.  I tell them what I want. I got to have it.  If the owners don't back me, I'd leave the team.  If I'm--you're boss and you put me in to manage a team.  If your--I say something, I've got the last word.  And when I say something, if you don't back me up, I don't fool with you.
Story_ID: 12033
Speaker 1: Now, Double Duty, was there any time that you were really hurt?  Or it was a big disappointment for you during your career?
Speaker 2: Well I had some disappointments about money.
Speaker 1: Tell us about them.
Speaker 2: No. I ain't gonna tell you about that, because it's bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't talk about that. But I had some disappointment with a colored team once.
Speaker 1: Well you don't wanna talk about that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I won't talk about sad notes.  I don't talk about sad things.
Speaker 1: Well what happened?  They didn't pay you the money that was owed you?
Speaker 2: The man just left town and went to Cuba somewhere.  We didn't see him no more with the money.  He left owing me seven hundred dollars and owed some other players five hundred [dollars].  But we made it up.  We got with Kansas City [Monarchs] the next month and we played Kansas City all through Arizona.  We made money.
Speaker 1: And the owners of the Negro Leagues, they were also white. Weren't they? Were they white too?  The owners?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, they were black.
Speaker 2: All black.
Speaker 1: All black.
Speaker 2: All--we had eight teams in the East and eight teams in the West.  And we had the East-West game in Chicago [Illinois] every year.  And we had from sixty-five to seventy-five thousand people.
Speaker 1: You would have how many people at a game?
Speaker 2: That game, that game they had--that was in--big sell-out crowd.  That was seventy-four thousand.  I hit the home run that day and won the game.  And they gave me that money.  I hit home runs in five different games.  I was a good hitter.  God was good to me.  Looks like he give prime for those games.
Story_ID: 12034
Speaker 1: You know, Double Duty, it's hard a lot of times now that, you know, that the--after the Negro--the league got integrated.
Speaker 2: Do you got my picture there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This one.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's alright.
Speaker 1: Right.  Do you remember when you--when this picture was taken?
Speaker 2: That picture was taken--ain't that day up there on the top?  Ain't that day on the cap?  What's that R?
Speaker 1: It says, "Company."
Speaker 2: Well that was taken in Atlanta, Georgia in 1942.  We played the All-Star game there.  And we won--I hit a home run.  We won the game four to two.  And they took that picture.  I've had that picture every since.
Speaker 1: Now--oh sorry.  You know, it's hard a lot of times--I remember seeing--ok.  I remember--.
Speaker 2: [Off-camera discussion]
Speaker 1: I remember, you know, seeing stadi-, you know, Wrigley Field [Chicago, Illinois] filled with black people.  And it's hard to even think of that now because you never see a ballpark filled with all black people.  You know.
Speaker 2: Black people come in all ways.  They take everything easy--look now Jackie [Robinson] wasn't the best ball boy but we gotta (unclear) he the best baseball player.  We had some ballplayers better than Jackie.  I caused Jackie playing ball.  Because Jackie was getting ready to go up to--was getting ready to go into medical school. But I got him to play.
Story_ID: 12035
Speaker 1: Jackie [Robinson] was a good ballplayer though.
Speaker 2: So he was getting ready to go to medical school.  And how did you meet him?
Speaker 1: I met him in--when we were playing the [American] All-Stars [baseball team].  And when [William] Willie Wells our shortstop broke his leg, I called him and made him the shortstop, and he played.  And the next year he came to Kansas City [Monarchs, baseball team] with me, kept him with me.  He didn't know how to act.  He was scared (laughs).  I carried him out with me one night and he met a girl, a pretty little girl.  And I had her sister in one room and I had to get the police to get him off her (laughs).  I had to get the police to stop him.  He had a (unclear).  He's a good man (laughs).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So Double Duty, let me ask (laughing)--see you always go off point!  You've got the women on your mind.
Speaker 1: Listen, how you gonna live with--you can't live without women.
Speaker 2: Right.  You can't.
Speaker 1: You can't live without a woman.  A woman can't live without a man.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Can't live without--.
Speaker 1: A man don't love women something wrong with him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But this (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: They claimed that I was exceptional.
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: They claimed that I had more women than anybody.  But I didn't have them. I'd just tell them--I just put my cards on the table.  You understand.  And tell them what I wanted.  I got it.  Ain't that right partner?
Speaker 2: But you know (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Laughing) Now see I can't--.
Speaker 2: You know one thing, I had a man and wife to follow me from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] all the way to Hot Springs [Arkansas].  He wanted to kill me.  Of course he come down there.  I didn't tell her to come.  She come followed us.
Speaker 1: Now--but one thing.
Speaker 2: But I took her (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But no!
Speaker 2: (Laughs).
Speaker 1: Come on Double Duty!  Double Duty!  Now I'm going to ask about Jackie Robinson.  And you were roommates with him. Right?  For a while?
Speaker 2: I roomed with him.
Speaker 1: And what was he like as a roommate?
Speaker 2: He was as nice a fellow God ever put breath in.  He was a nice man.  He was a gentleman.  But he always wanted me to get him wom--he didn't have enough nerve.  He didn't have nerve like me.  I said, "Come here--."  I'd called her one--I called her a bitch in a minute.  I'd say, "Come here bitch."  And she'd come.  And she come there and come there.  I said, "I want you to get this other girl and wait downstairs."  She'd be waiting when I come there.  And I'd take them on to the hotel (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs) (Unclear)--.
Speaker 2: You know what Jackie--you know what Jackie say?  Jackie say, "You got more nerve than anybody ever I seen."  I said, "You got to have nerves now."  But you know one thing.  One thing I didn't--he'd tell you I didn't pull women I disliked. You know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't pull nobody that didn't wanna be something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know, can I ask you when--you were there when Jackie Robinson was scouted by the big league.  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: About what?
Speaker 1: You know, when he was scouted--being scouted by--Jackie Robinson when he was--.
Speaker 2: I was there when they signed him.  I was at the meeting when [Wesley] 'Branch' Rickey, George Sisler and Clyde Sukeforth over New Jersey when we were playing the New Jersey team--Newark, New Jersey.  We beat them fourteen to nothing.  They pitched [Donald] Don Newcombe that night.  I hit two home runs off him.  We beat them fourteen to nothing, but they hired Jackie.  Jackie hit a homerun, a single and a double.  And we--the next year he went to Montreal [Canada] for the [Brooklyn] Dodgers [baseball team]. Jackie was a good ballplayer and he was a gentleman. But he loved women, but he didn't have no nerves.  He always wanted me to get them.
Story_ID: 12036
Speaker 1: The question was, you know, when you started dealing with the white teams and you were managing the team, you know.  And you were also--.
Speaker 2: Well listen.  In 1945 when they hired Jackie [Robinson], they wasn't taking no ballplayers over 25.  I was over 25.  I was 48 years old when Jackie went in.  And they wanted [Joshua] Josh Gibson, but the man wouldn't give him.  He just made an agreement not to take no ballplayer unless they agreed to it.  Then they started to buying the ballplayers.  And then they got him, because the ballplayers gonna take them to court, 'cause they were gonna break up our league.  Taking the ballplayers and that.  But they started to paying from fifteen [hundred dollars] to thirty-five hundred [dollars] a piece for them.  Now [Samuel] Bankhead got more money for--but Memphis [Red Sox, baseball team] got thirty-five hundred [dollars] for Bankhead, but he drank so much they had let him go. You remember when he went up, don't you?  But the--[William] Willie Brown and [Henry] Thompson went from Kansas City [Monarchs, baseball team] (unclear), you remember that?  They played (unclear), but now it's all set.  They pay the same thing from white as they do the blacks. They give everybody--they pay from twenty-five hundred [dollars] up.
Story_ID: 12037
Speaker 1: Were you sad when the Negro Baseball League, you know, just kept losing players and losing, because that--?
Speaker 2: No, I was glad to see them go up.  Of course I knew it was gonna come a time when the Negro League was gonna have to disband.  After they started taking the first two coloreds.  You know, you could see when Jackie [Robinson] first started to--we'd be playing on Sunday, wouldn't have but five or six hundred, because they would have twenty-five or thirty hundred.  You know, everybody wanted to see Jackie--wanted to see a colored, and Jackie burnt the league up.  And he wasn't the best ballplayer.  (Unclear) and all of them went up there.  [Roy] Campanella and all them went up in stars, didn't they?  [Donald] Newcombe, [Joseph] Joe Black--Joe Black couldn't get nobody out in the Negro League, but he went up there and starred.  It didn't bother me because I was through in 1950.  I was through playing in the Negro League.  I went to Winnipeg [Canada] and managed eight years.  And I had such a good deal--but I quit in '50 [1950].  And I started to scouting.
Speaker 1: You started scouting.  So let's talk about some of the people you scouted beside--you said you scouted Jackie Robinson.  Right?  But who else did you scout?
Speaker 2: Well they came to me and talked to me about him.  I told them but they got to give me some money though because I don't talk for nothing.  I'm talking now for nothing.  But I'm just doing that for you because it's colored.  You understand?
Speaker 1: Did you, scout Ernie Banks?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well who--?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't of scouted him.  No, because he didn't do enough for coloreds. See he only worked for white folks.  He was born in Texas and he showed he was a southern Negro.  But all of the rest of the ballplayer cooperated.  But Banks never cooperated.  Even though he's a good friend of mine. But he stayed his distance and I stayed mine. And, you know, if they don't do right, I don't want them. If you can't help your people, you can't help nobody. Can you?  If you don't help your people--now any colored organization I donate my time to for them now.  But I ain't gonna donate none for no white man, because he then made enough money without doing that.

Speaker 1: ...And we [Ted Radcliffe and Alberta Radcliffe] stayed together sixty-four years.
Speaker 2: That's wonderful.

Speaker 2: So you're saying she was white. She was not black.
Speaker 1: You catch me with a black woman, call the police because I can't stand it.  I mean I like to--I like light brown-skinned women like you.
Speaker 2: Oh I'm too brown-skinned for you then (laughs).
Speaker 1: You're the right color.
Speaker 2: I'm too dark, Double Duty.
Speaker 1: But I don't care nothing about the color.  I like the class.
Speaker 2: You like the class.  Okay.
Speaker 1: I like people that carry themselves (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  That's fair enough.
Speaker 1: I like class.
Speaker 2: That's fair enough.
Speaker 1: But I don't care how black they are.  If they got class it's alright.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: But some of them--some of them white and black, is so low you don't want them.
Speaker 2: Right.  That's right. No, that absolutely true.

Speaker 1: Okay (laughing).  Willie Mays.
Speaker 2: Willie Mays.  Willie Mays was born right there in Birmingham [Alabama].  But I know he was gonna make it because he was a good ballplayer.
Speaker 1: So who were some of the people you scouted?  You never talked about the people you scouted.
Speaker 2: I scouted a lot of players, for Cleveland [Indians, baseball team] and  New York.  But I don't talk about it because they made names for them self. And I--the [Chicago] Cubs [baseball team] asked me about Ernie Banks because I played against him for a year.  I told them the truth. He was a good ballplayer. But he never did nothing for his people.  That's the only thing that hurt me.  He never did nothing for his people.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what about Hank Aaron?
Speaker 2: Hank Aaron was a nice man.  You know, when he come up with--he come up with the team down in Indianapolis [Clowns, baseball team].  He always talked to Billy Williams [baseball player]. He always talked to me because they knew I had the good backing.  And I had made a name for myself.  But I never knocked none of them. Because you--people can tell good players when they see them.
Speaker 1: Now I--let me ask--why do you think you had such a love of baseball?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Well I started out as a pitcher and a catcher.  I'm the only man that could pitch and catch.  And I looked after so many players.  (Unclear) from Alabama (unclear).  If they could do something, I'd recommend them.  And everybody wanted me to scout after I quit playing but I couldn't go everywhere.  Of course, I made a good name for myself.  They're still worrying me now.
Speaker 1: Now was there--when you were a catcher, was there a psychology you used against?
Speaker 2: (laughs) Sure.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: You had to know the hitters.  You used to know what they--you study a hitter when you're playing pitching and catching.  And you know what they like best.  High or low or--if they like high baseball, you come inside on them or outside with a curve ball. You know.  You use some psychology on them.  And they that say I was the smartest catcher that ever lived.  And I thank them for it because I used to talk to them and make them feel good and then throw somethin' at them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you would talk nice to them?  Or you would just use psychology?
Speaker 2: I'd say, "I know you're a good ballplayer and a good hitter.  I know you want the fastball.  But I'm gonna throw the curve ball."  But I'd throw them a fastball.  And they called me all kind of dirty son-of-a-bitches (laughs).
Speaker 1: Now what about pitching?  Did you use a strategy with pitching?
Speaker 2: Well I pitched high and low, inside and outside, according to what kind of hitter they were.  I used some psychology on them.  I'd make them hit my pitch.  You know, I pitched a long time.  I played forty-eight years.  Ain't nobody ever played that long.  And they asked me, "Double Duty, how'd you stay in there?"  But I said, "I don't know.  But I stay up."
Story_ID: 12041
Speaker 1: But you still love the game.  Don't you?
Speaker 2: I go to most of the games, the [Chicago] White Sox [baseball team].  I got four box seats out there for me and my guests.  I'm gonna take you one day.  They got box seats out there.  If I don't wanna go downstairs, I call them up and they'll give me (unclear) and (unclear) sell me everything I want.
Speaker 1: Now Double Duty, do you--when you see the game now, do you see things about it that you don't like?  Or that have changed?
Speaker 2: I see things that never happened when I pitched.  Some ballplayers can't--don't give all out.  Some of them don't hustle.  When a ball gets by they walk at it almost.  When a ball got by a ballplayer in my day, they hustled more than they did before it got to them.  But it's different now--it's money now.  If you ain't giving them money, you don't get nothing.
Speaker 1: Are there players now that you really like?
Speaker 2: There's a few.
Speaker 1: So who are they?
Speaker 2: When you take a player like the ballplayer with New York--shortstop.  Few players like him--Ted Williams.  You take--Stan Musial when he--I played against Stan Musial when he was in grade school in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I played against all of them--against all the ballplayers.  Mickey Mantle when he was in Texas.  I played against all of them.  But some of them don't hustle like they used to.  If they get to make a name for themself now--they get some money, they don't care.  They give some ballplayers--ain't no ballplayer worth no million dollars a year!  Ain't no ballplayer--I wouldn't give a son-of-bitch over a hundred thousand [dollars], I don't care who he was.  If you can't live off a hundred thousand [dollars], you couldn't live.  You used to live off five thousand [dollars], didn't you?  They just making things go up more.  A ballplayer ain't worth that kind of money.
Speaker 1: Now who do you like of the [Chicago] White Sox [baseball team]?  Do you have a favorite player on the White Sox team?
Speaker 2: The boy playing second base [Ray] Durham.  He's a good ballplayer.  And then the boy playing center field is a good ballplayer.  And Frank Thomas, you know, is a grand ballplayer.  [James] Baldwin pitcher.  They got some good players.  They had to dance by my music though if I'm the boss.
Speaker 1: So did you--does Frank Thomas remind you of anyone that you knew of before?
Speaker 2: Used to be a boy who used to play first base.  Musial--not Musial.  Stanley--Stanley Isaac (ph.) used to play with--just like Frank Thomas, and could hit.  Frank Thomas is a good ballplayer, and the White Sox miss him too.

Speaker 1: What are you most proud of when you look back over your career?
Speaker 2: My career.  Well when the first East-West [All-Star] game [in Chicago, Illinois, in 1933], I came in to pitch.  And they had two men on base and nobody out.  And they had [Joshua] Josh Gibson and all of them coming up.  And I got them out without scoring.  They didn't score and we beat them.  And the next year I pitched and I beat them.  I've been happy about that.  Because I beat the best. Some of the best Negro players that ever lived.  But I throwed that thing at them.  Dance by my music or don't dance at all.  Ain't that right (laughs)?
Speaker 1: Now that's what your slogan--.
Speaker 2: You had to have guts to play ball.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Well what your slogan should be.  Dance by my--.
Speaker 2: Well I'll tell you, when I was throwing a pitch, I'd forget about everything and concentrate on the hitter.  And I made him hit my pitch, inside, outside or low.  When I found out he'd chase the ball, I'd throw it further outside (laughs).  Make him rake at it.  You got to use some psychology.
Story_ID: 12043
Speaker 1: You visited [U.S. Presidents] [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt, [Bill] Clinton and [Jimmy] Carter in the White House [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You visited three presidents in the White House.
Speaker 2: I visited more than three.
Speaker 1: You did?  How many presidents did you visit?
Speaker 2: I visited [U.S. President Richard Milhous] Nixon, [Franklin Delano] Roosevelt, and the guy out in California.  What's his name?
Speaker 1: [U.S. President Ronald] Reagan.
Speaker 2: Reagan. I visited five presidents all together.
Speaker 1: And Clinton.  And Clinton.  Right?
Speaker 2: And Clinton too.  Yes.  Clinton's my man.  Clinton's a good man.
Speaker 1: Why did you like Clinton?
Speaker 2: Because he liked women.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs).  (Unclear) Did I tell the truth?
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: Didn't I tell the truth?
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Yes.
Speaker 2: Ask him about--
Speaker 1: But you know one thing.  I met Clinton twice--when I went there.  He is a nice man, him and his wife.  And she stuck with him.  because most of them would have left him.  And she's still with them.  He's a good man.  But he loves his women.  He wanted some outside.  He wanted to test the field (laughs).
Story_ID: 12044
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?  What do you want people to say about Double Duty?
Speaker 2: Ain't nothing they can say but, "He was a good ballplayer.  And he was a gentleman,"  because I sure carried myself in that way.  Everybody likes me today.  Everywhere I go they want me back.  So I made a name for myself and I'm proud of it.  But that don't keep me from liking the women.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you--why do you think baseball is such a great game?
Speaker 2: Because it made it good for me.  It made a name for me and I'm proud of it.  I made a good living all of my life.  And I'm well respected today.  Some people forget about players. But they don't forget about players like me.  They still think about me, because I could do something.
Speaker 1: And do you think God looked down on you when you were young and said, "I'm gonna make him a great ballplayer."
Speaker 2: He had to.  Yeah.  Because I would have been without his help.  I don't believe I could have did it without God's help.  Because I've been in situations pitching and catching all over the world, where I come out ahead.  So it must be good to me.  God has been good to me, and I thank him.  I thank God for being good to me.

Speaker 1: Now the other thing, Double Duty, your parents.  What did--they saw some of your success.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well my mother--my brother [Alexander Radcliffe] and I went down and my oldest brother [Ernest Radcliffe] come here in 1913.  Out the war--out the First World War.  I didn't come here until 1917.  In 1918 we went--he bought a Dodge car.  You could get a car for four hundred dollars new then.  He bought a Dodge car.  We went and got my mother [Mary Louise Radcliffe], and my brother and my sister and brought them here.  And we've been here ever since.  See I took care of my parents.  My daddy [James Radcliffe] had never--didn't have to work any more.  And my dad and mother and (unclear).  My brother and I took care of them.
Speaker 1: Did they see--they saw you play ball though.  Right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And they were proud.
Speaker 2: When we--I'll never forget when I was playing with Detroit Stars [baseball team].  We come and beat in Chicago [Illinois] in a double-header.  My daddy and momma were right there in the box seat.  I put them right back of first base.  I'd take them when we started to play at [Chicago] White Sox [Comiskey] Park [baseball stadium], I'd take her to the game every day.  Drive my dad in my car and take them home.  Because there's nobody like good parents.  And my parents were good to me when I was young.  And I wasn't gonna let them down.  I took care of my mother.  Me and my brother took care of my mother until she died.  My father died in '31 [1931] and my mother died in '49 [1949].  Took care of both of them.  If my wife--if my mother didn't like a woman and I'd fool with them sometimes, she'd be right.  Most of the time she was right.  I didn't fool with them.  And when she'd put her hand down, she'd say, "That's a good woman there."  I'd take her word and I'd barbecue (laughs).

Speaker 1: You've been glad to be a black person haven't you?  You feel proud to be black.
Speaker 2: Now listen, if God had wanted me to be white, I'd been white.  He put me here as I am and I appreciate it.  And I played teams in South America and everywhere.  Wasn't no colored there at all.  But they took care of me because I could do (unclear). When I went to South America, me and [Leroy] 'Satchel' [Paige]--wasn't nobody there but me.  But (unclear) they loved me--and the white gal used to bring it to me. Here's another (unclear).  That's life ain't it?  Huh?  Anywhere you live and be happy you're living good.  Ain't that right?  Ain't that right?

Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: What kind of pitch you gettin' ready to throw?
