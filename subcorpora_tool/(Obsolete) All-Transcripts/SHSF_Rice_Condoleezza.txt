Brest: This is Iris Brest with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History Program.
Today is January 26, 2017. I’m here with Dr. Condoleezza Rice, currently
Denning Professor in Global Business and the Economy at the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior
Fellow on Public Policy at the Hoover Institution, a professor of political
science, and a past provost of the university--and the past Secretary of State
of the United States, among other roles and titles she holds and has held.
We’re conducting this interview at Dr. Rice’s office in the Herbert Hoover
Memorial Building on campus as part of the Stanford Faculty and Stanford
Pioneering Women Oral History Project.
I’d like to begin by asking you to tell us something about your early
life, reminding listeners that a far fuller account can be found in your lovely
memoir: Extraordinary, Ordinary People.
Rice: [00:01:07] I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and I’m an only child. My
parents were educators. From the very beginning, education was core to us as

13

a family and to me as a person. I had all kinds of opportunities despite the
fact that I grew up in segregated Birmingham, Alabama. I’ve always said that
my parents believed I couldn’t have a hamburger at the Woolworth’s lunch
counter but I could be president of the United States if I wanted to be, and
they had me convinced of that.
We moved to Denver when I was twelve. I went to high school at St.
Mary’s Academy, a college prep school, and then enrolled at the University
of Denver as a music major, a piano major, which I pursued for two years
until the end of my sophomore year in college when I realized that I was
pretty good but not great and I should find something else to do.
Fortunately, I wandered into a class in international politics, taught by a man
named Josef Korbel who was Madeleine Albright’s father. He was a Soviet
specialist and I had found what I wanted to do. I did my undergraduate
degree in political science and economics. Went to Notre Dame, did my
master’s degree. Went back to Denver and eventually came back into a PhD
program quite by chance. I had thought I would get a job but decided that
since there were no really good jobs in Denver, I would go back to graduate
school instead.
I did my PhD at the Graduate School of International Studies, now
called the Korbel School after my longtime mentor. I did it there and
finished in 1981. My Stanford career actually started before I finished my
PhD because the Ford Foundation was looking to train young Soviet
specialists in international security policy. You could go to one of five places.
You could go to UCLA Rand, but I’d been in Southern California the

14

summer before--didn’t like it. You could go to MIT. My best friend from
Denver also had the same fellowship, and she was dating an MIT professor.
We decided she should go to MIT. Columbia was another possibility, but my
father was afraid of New York for his daughter. It was not a really good time
in New York in those days and Columbia was in a rough neighborhood. It
came down to Stanford and Harvard. Harvard didn’t answer my letter.
[00:03:45] They claim now that they did but in fact it was Stanford, in
a very welcoming fashion. Chip Blacker [Coit D. Blacker] who was the
assistant director at the Control Center, John Lewis who was the co-director
of the center, and Alexander George, who I had met in Moscow when I was
studying language there and he was there for a meeting. They were my
advocates and I got the fellowship, and I came to Stanford and finished my
dissertation while I was at the Arms Control Center. About halfway through
that year, I got a call from the Political Science Department. They wanted me
to give a job talk.
I said, “Well, what’s the job?”
They said, “The job is in international economic policy.”
I said, “I don’t do international economic policy.”
They said, “Well, give the job talk anyway.”
So I did. They came back and they said, “We loved your talk, but we need
somebody in international economics.”
I said, “Well, I told you I don’t do international economics.”
Brest: What was your talk?

15

Rice: [00:04:49] My talk was on my dissertation, which is the only thing you can
actually do when you’re a graduate student. It was on civil-military relations
in the Soviet Bloc and it was a particular case study of the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia. I was a student of how militaries operated in political
contexts. Couple weeks later, I got a call from Political Science again saying,
“Well, would you be interested in a term appointment--three years?” I
thought well, maybe. I had always thought I was going to go back and
probably work in the defense industry or something. I really didn’t have any
great desire to be an academic. About three weeks later, before I could accept
that job, they said, “Well, we’re prepared to put you on a tenure track.”
Then I had a conversation with Heinz Eulau, who was the chair of
the department at the time. Heinz said, “Now we can put you on a tenure
track but you do understand that at time of tenure, there are no special deals
because you’ve come into this unusually.” I had no idea what was going on.
Finally I realized what was going on, but I didn’t really fully understand it
until I became provost. Stanford had identified a young, black, female Soviet
specialist. They already had three Soviet specialists in the department so they
didn’t need a new one. But, in the effort to diversify the faculty they had put
together an affirmative action appointment and that’s how I came to
Stanford.
I’ve always told people that one reason that I’m a big defender of
affirmative action in hiring is that if you look outside your normal channels-Stanford didn’t generally find its faculty from the University of Denver but I

16

was here, they knew me--you can diversify the faculty. It happened that it
worked out well for me and it worked out well for Stanford.
Brest: We were lucky. How was it at the Political Science Department at the time?
Rice: [00:06:55] There were only two women in the Political Science Department
when I started--Judy Goldstein [Judith L. Goldstein] and me--and we were
both first year assistant professors. Nan Keohane had been a senior
professor but she had left to go back east with Bob [Robert Keohane,
husband to Nan] to Duke. It was very funny--Heinz Eulau was a really
wonderful man, but he would start the faculty meetings by saying, “All right
gentlemen.” About six months in, Judy said, “Heinz, Heinz, what about
Condi and me?” I remember thinking just don’t ruffle feathers. Just let it be
Judy. Let it be. But she spoke up and so after that, he didn’t call us gentlemen
anymore.
The first year teaching is just hard because the truth of the matter is
you really are chosen principally for your research capacity and really all
you’ve been doing is research. Maybe if you’re lucky, you’ve been a TA in
somebody’s class.
Brest: Had you?
Rice: [00:08:04] Dr. Korbel got sick about a year into my graduate program and so
I actually had taught his course. I’d had a little bit more teaching experience
than most people. I took over his course when he was ill. But no, that was
the only teaching experience I had. Learning to teach, and I was 26 and my
students were 21 and 22--it was pretty scary those first years teaching. I was
also trying to finish. I had finished my dissertation and submitted it to

17

presses and Princeton University Press had accepted it, but I was trying to
finish the book and learn how to teach and learn how to be a faculty
member. Those first years are always kind of hard.
Brest: Did you have mentors here?
Rice: [00:08:54] I had wonderful mentors. I think Alexander George was an
important mentor to me. John Lewis was a very important mentor for me.
And in his own way, Heinz Eulau was. When I was asked by Stanford,
“What are you going to teach?” I was going to teach Civil Military Relations.
That’s what my dissertation was about. I thought, well, I could probably
teach Soviet policy in what we used to call the Third World because I knew a
little bit about that and I had no earthly idea what else I could teach. Heinz
said to me, “Can you teach Political Elites?,” which is a particular part of
study for political scientists--how elites are formed, what pools do they come
from, how do people move from, for instance, in the United States, usually
from being senator or congressperson or governor into higher ranks. That’s
what the field is about.
When he said “Can you teach Political Elites?,” I had no idea what he
was talking about. I said, “Sure, I can teach Political Elites,” [laughter]
figuring I would then go to the library. In those days, we went to the library
to try to figure out what it was about. In an act of tremendous kindness, he
said, “Why don’t we co-teach it?” So I co-taught Political Elites with Heinz
Eulau. I had wonderful mentors.
Brest: Were you still affiliated with the arms control group?

18

Rice: [00:10:28] I remained at the arms control [group]. It became the Center for
International Security in Arms Control--had been the Arms Control and
Disarmament Program. For the first three years, I was actually its associate
director, in addition to my Political Science appointment. After my three year
renewal, I dropped the administrative role. I was there all the time. I was a
fellow. That was really, in many ways, my home too, which is why John
Lewis was such an important mentor.
Brest: I hadn’t realized that you had an administrative role.
Rice: [00:11:04] Yes, yes. Chip moved up to associate director. I became assistant
director. When Chip went to Washington for a year to the Council on
Foreign Relations Fellowship (he worked for Gary Hart), I stood in for him
as associate director.
Brest: That’s interesting because in all of the talk about your becoming provost
without any administrative-Rice: [00:11:34] Right. People never realized that I did that. I had to manage
budget and had to help with appointments and all that sort of thing. It was
actually good training ground.
Brest: Coming back to your childhood in Birmingham, what was the expectation in
your community about women, career, marriage?
Rice: [00:12:00] It is really interesting because I’ve never understood when people
say there were expectations that women wouldn’t have careers. Every woman
in my community worked, they were all teachers, because in black, middle
class families, both parents worked. Now, to be fair, it was somewhat easier
because the teachers were on the same schedule as the kids. I remember that

19

my father would drop me off at school and my mother would carpool with
two other teachers in the community to her job, which was a little bit outside
of Birmingham in Ensley. So our role models were two-career couples. Our
mothers all worked. There was only one woman in the community who
didn’t work, and people used to say that was because she didn’t have a
college degree so she couldn’t work.
I’ll tell you an interesting story about my dad in that regard. My
parents met when they were teaching at Fairfield Industrial High School. My
dad was the athletic director and my mother taught English. One of her
students was Willie Mays so she had this very famous student. My mother
had been there first. Birmingham had nepotism rules. When my parents
married, they couldn’t teach in the same school. It was my father who left.
Many years later, now being aware that maybe this was a little odd, I asked
my father, “Why did you leave?” And he said, “Well, because your mother
was there first.” I think in the professional, black community, these role
identification issues were not there.
Brest: I believe that your aunts all-Rice: [00:13:55] All of my aunts taught school except one who was a professor. My
Aunt Teresa Love [Angela Theresa Rice Love], my father’s sister, was a PhD
in Victorian literature from the University of Wisconsin. She wrote books on
Dickens. She had had trouble getting a job early on because there were
prejudices against women going into university work. Her first job was at
Southern University, the historically black college in Louisiana. Then she got

20

a job at Norfolk State. Eventually she ended up at the University of Southern
Illinois teaching Victorian literature.
Brest: This is characteristic of your entire circle?
Rice: [00:14:47] It was totally characteristic of my entire community, which was a
little black enclave, you know, segregated communities in Birmingham of
middle class, called Titusville. Like I said, everybody taught school. I think
there was one nurse in the community, but basically everybody taught school.
Brest: All of the children were expecting to go to college?
Rice: [00:15:11] Everybody expected to go to college. My dad had a youth fellowship
at his church. He was a high school guidance counselor and he was a minister
as well, a Presbyterian minister. He’d taken over the church his father had
founded after his father died. He had this youth fellowship for kids in the
community. They came from all over, not just his church. In fact, he used to
say he had an advantage because he was Presbyterian--they could have
dances and the Baptists couldn’t have dances. [laughter]
I looked up to the kids because these were high school kids. Amelia
Rutledge, who would become Alabama’s first National Merit Scholar, was in
that group. My friend, Mary Bush, who I still see, who became the first black
woman governor of the IMF [International Monetary Fund] in the Reagan
Administration. Freeman Hrabowski who my father used to call “his little
math genius,” who’s now the president of the University of Maryland,
Baltimore County. We just had lots and lots of these kids who were role
models to us all. There was never any question of would you go to college. It
was where would you go to college.

21

We would drive--after my parents started going to Denver to do their
graduate work because University of Alabama was still segregated so you
couldn’t go to the University of Alabama. Denver had a program in Student
Personnel Administration, which is what my father wanted to do. We would
pack up the family car as soon as school was over and drive to Denver. My
parents would drive us--we once drove a hundred miles out of the way to see
Ohio State--because we toured college campuses like most people toured
national parks. There was always an expectation that you would go to college.
All my mother’s brothers and sisters did. My father’s one sister, of course,
became a PhD.
Brest: And your cousins all-Rice: [00:17:21] My cousins are all college educated as well. As a matter of fact, all
of them are advance-degreed.
Brest: I was going to ask you about the sense you had of your options in life, and
they range from president maybe on down but not eater at Woolworth.
Rice: [00:17:42] No, no. When the Civil Rights legislation was passed, I remember
two days after the so-called Public Accommodations Act passed, my father
said, “Let’s go out to dinner.” We went to dinner at this restaurant in a hotel.
People kind of looked up and then they kind of realized, okay I think it’s
legal now, and they went back to eating. It was okay. But a little later, several
months later, there was like a drive-through hamburger place and we drove
through and it was nighttime. We got the hamburger and I said to my father
because it was dark, I said, “This hamburger tastes funny.” It was just onions.
So, attitudes weren’t changing quite as quickly.

22

Brest: As the law. You were always raised as Presbyterian?
Rice: [00:18:39] I was. My grandfather on my father’s side wanted to get a college
degree, wanted to get book-learning--he was a sharecropper’s son in Eutaw,
Alabama. He asked how he could get a college degree, where did they train
colored men, he said. They said Stillman College was thirty miles away. He
saved up his cotton and he went off to Stillman. He finished his first year and
then they said, how are you going to pay for your second year? And he didn’t
have any more cotton.
They said, “Well you’ll have to leave.”
He said, “So how those boys going to college?”
They said, “Well they have what’s called a scholarship. And if you
wanted to be a Presbyterian minister, you could have a scholarship, too.”
He said, “That’s exactly what I had in mind.”
He ended up getting his college degree and going to seminary. My father
eventually went to seminary too. I tell people I’m not even the first PhD in
my family, and I’m third-generation college educated because my grandfather
made that choice.
Brest: Tell me about the role of religion in your life?
Rice: [00:19:49] Very deep adherence to religion. In fact, in that community in
Birmingham, it was faith, family, and education--the three kind of went
together. A lot centered around the church, in part because my father was the
minister. He had his deacons meetings on Wednesday and my mother was
the choir master so we had choir practice on Thursday. Saturday, we usually
spent time down at the church doing the bulletins and everything; and then

23

you had youth fellowship on Sunday after church. So the church was kind of
the center.
My father also used the church for social responsibilities. He would
bring tutors from the school to teach French, and tutor in algebra and
chemistry on Tuesday nights. He would, because there wasn’t much of a
place to socialize in segregated Birmingham. So the church became kind of a
place that people could do that. He would bring a dentist every couple weeks
to do dental care because behind his church--our community was, you know,
not well-to-do, but it was professional class, but behind his church there was
a government project called Loveman’s Village, what would now be known
as Section 8 Housing. My father would have those kids come to the tutoring.
He would have them come to the dentistry, even though most of them didn’t
belong to his church. Caused a little bit of a ruckus with his elders who
thought that his social ministry was out of control. Because there was a little
bit of social stratification, and the idea that these kids would come over and
he’d have Christmas parties and do gift baskets for the families--his
congregation didn’t like it that much. To show you how women sometimes
played a different role, he then organized his Presbyterian women because
they supported his mission. And people like Mrs. Florence Rice, who was his
cousin, and Mrs. Evelyn Glover--they supported his mission and they would
raise money for his mission. He even tried to get them made into elders but
women weren’t allowed to be elders just yet.
Brest: Did you ever consider a religious vocation?

24

Rice: [00:22:35] Not really. I was always deeply religious. I still go to church on
Sunday. I’m still very active in my church. There have been times when I
thought, boy, it would be great to do a degree in theology, but it’s always
been for the fun of it, not as a vocation. So no, I’ve never really considered
going into the ministry.
Brest: What was the salience of race in your childhood?
Rice: [00:23:09] I’ve said that race was everything, so it sort of was nothing.
Birmingham was so segregated that you didn’t socialize with white people,
you didn’t go to school with white people and so all of the mores and values
and expectations were within the black community. And I’m sometimes
puzzled when people say--I’ve heard kids say--“that’s acting white,”
sometimes, [for] speaking well. For us, that was acting black because those
were the only people with us. Teachers had extremely high expectations and
were pretty tough on low performance. In that sense, the segregated
community was able to develop its own expectations, its own mores, and its
own values, and it was a kind of closed loop. You would encounter racism
when you went outside of that loop.
For instance, I remember going to visit Santa Claus when I was five.
Santa Claus was taking all the little white kids and putting them on his knee,
and all the little black kids and holding them out to the side. My father said to
my mother, “Angelina, if he does that to Condoleezza, I’m going to take all
that stuff off him and expose him to be the cracker that he is.” [laughter]
You’re five. It’s like, oh goodness, Santa Claus and Daddy are about to fight.
I don’t know, Santa Claus must have read my father’s body language, and my

25

dad was 6’3” and former football player. And when I got there he said,
“Little girl,” put me on his knee, “What would you like for Christmas?” You
know, you encountered it that way.
You knew you had to get all the way to Washington, DC before you
could stay in a hotel. You knew that my parents never let me ride a bus--and,
by the way, my mother’s parents never let her ride a bus--because they didn’t
want them to have to sit in the back of the bus. My Aunt Gee says that when
they would be out and they had to go to the bathroom, my grandfather
would say, “Just wait until you get home” because he didn’t want them to
encounter colored only restrooms. You knew those things were there but it
really wasn’t until 1963 when Birmingham became so violent, with the police
dogs in Kelly Ingram Park and then the bombing of the 16 th Street Baptist
Church. One of my kindergarten classmates, Denise McNair, was killed in
that bombing. Bombings in neighborhoods--the men would organize
themselves, take their guns and go to the head of the community and scare
off white riders at night.
It’s one reason that I have a somewhat unusual view. [00:26:09] The
reason that I have an unusual view of the Second Amendment--because had
there been gun registration, Bull Connor would have rounded them all up. I
always said, you know, the Constitution says the right to bear arms in a wellregulated militia and I think my father and his friends put together a militia to
protect the community. That was when race became more salient and the
bombings became more salient.

26

Then the Civil Rights Act passed and we moved to Tuscaloosa. My
dad became dean of students at Stillman. For the first time, I remember
going to a football game at the University of Alabama, and going over to see
Bobby Kennedy speak at the University of Alabama. And Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley spoke at the University of Alabama. I was young enough that
maybe it seemed more seamless to go from segregated to not segregated any
longer.
Brest: You were eight, nine?
Rice: [00:27:20] I was eight when the Civil Rights Act passed. And I’ll tell you one
other story and then we’ll pack it up. The only time we actually encountered
housing discrimination was in Denver. We moved to Denver and the first
couple of years we lived in this housing that was there for new faculty. It was
a long strip of housing for new faculty. You were only allowed to stay there
two years and then you had to find other housing. My parents still owned
property in Birmingham and so they were going to rent in Denver. We went
to look for property and my father’s colleague told him about this one house
that seemed perfect. We went there and the woman was acting kind of
strange. My mother said something like the piano would go beautifully right
there.
She said, “Oh you have a piano?” She said, “Well, I can’t rent to you
if you have a piano.” She said, “The noise would be a problem for the
community.”
My mother and my father looked at each other and my father said,
“Anybody in this community have a stereo?”

27

She said, “Well I suppose so.”
He said, “So that could be loud too.” He said, “You know what I’m
going to do? I’m going to go up and down this street.” He said, “If I find one
piano, I am taking you to court because I think you don’t want to rent to us
because we’re black.”
At that point, she said, “Oh no, no, no. I was just worried about the
piano but I’m sure you don’t play it at strange times of the night.”
My father said, “We don’t want this house.”
It’s the only time that I remember encountering housing
discrimination in Denver and that would have been about 1971.

PART:

2 OF 3

Brest: This is Iris Brest with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History Program.
Today is February 16th and I’m here with Dr. Condoleezza Rice, and we’re
resuming the interview that we began last month.
I’d like to talk about your provostship chiefly but I have a couple of
little, short questions. Maybe short and a little bit irrelevant. Did you ever
know Angela Davis?
Rice: [00:00:32] Angela Davis grew up in Birmingham also, but she was quite a bit
older than I was. My parents knew her and knew her family, but I didn’t
personally know her.
Brest: Because her parents were also teachers.
Rice: [00:00:43] Her parents were also teachers and it was a really small community
and everybody’s parents knew everybody’s parents. She would have been
probably ten years--as much as ten years older, so I didn’t really know her
personally.
Brest: Such different paths.

29

Rice: [00:00:58] Very different paths.
Brest: You all wound up at universities.
Rice: [00:01:01] That’s right, all ended up in universities. Education was just such a
powerful value in that community. It was never any question of are you going
to college. It’s where are you going to college. She grew up in that same
environment. Funny. I did meet her sister many years later here at Stanford.
She was visiting. She also was an academic and a professor. I had lunch with
her sister and we talked about that little community.
Brest: Another thing. Connie Rice [civil rights attorney] is your cousin.
Rice: [00:01:37] Connie Rice is my cousin on my father’s side.
Brest: She’s the daughter of your father’s first cousin?
Rice: [00:01:47] That’s correct.
Brest: But she was born in Washington. Is there another branch of the family that
we didn’t mention that was in the North?
Rice: [00:01:53] What happened is that on my mother’s side, my grandfather’s
brothers and sisters were all in New Jersey. They moved to New Jersey but
he stayed in the South because he had run away from home when they all
went to New Jersey. He ran away from home because of this incident with a
woman--that this man dated his sister and tried to beat up his sister. My
grandfather tried to beat up this white man and so he decided he’d better get
out of there. He ended up being raised by a white family because my
grandfather was very fair, probably half white--raised by a family in
Birmingham.

30

His family went to New Jersey and he didn’t reconnect with his
family until he was in the hospital when he was a young miner. He was
probably in his thirties. He was talking to a nurse who knew his family and
that reconnected him to his family in New Jersey. The Rice family--there
were three brothers. My grandfather remained in the South but his brother
moved also north. So Connie was raised in the North.
Brest: Other question I wanted to interpose. One thing I’ve always admired is the
extreme diversity of your friends, and especially with respect to political
affiliation. Just tell me about that a little, can you?
Rice: [00:03:40] It’s never mattered to me what people’s political views were. First
of all, because my own political views are probably more eclectic than people
might realize. I’m conservative in some matters, not conservative in others.
One of my closest friends, I always jokingly say, is to the left of Lenin, my
friend Randy, Randy Bean; we would never end up in the same political
space. I don’t think there’s a political issue on which we agree but I’ve never
found it an impediment to being really, really great friends. I don’t think I’ve
ever thought of my friends as being conservative or liberal. They’re just my
friends.
Brest: Did you ever influence a friend’s political opinions or did a friend ever
influence yours--I mean, change them at all?
Rice: [00:04:31] That’s interesting. I don’t think so. It’s not that I’m fixed in my
political opinions by any means, but my friends and I--except for my friends
who do political science as a profession--we don’t talk that much about
politics. We tend to talk about sports, and music, and family. Many of my

31

friends are religious so we talk about faith. The other thing to realize is I’m a
political scientist so, in many ways, politics is my profession, not my
avocation. Most of the people I talk to about politics are people who are also
in the profession. I tend to talk a lot about politics to my good friend Chip
Blacker because we’re both in the profession.
Brest: And, again, not of single mind.
Rice: [00:03:45] No, not of single mind, although Chip and I laugh that I’m
probably a moderate conservative and he’s probably a conservative
democrat, so we’re probably some place closer to each other than we might
be to the extremes.
Brest: Let’s talk about your provostship. I don’t mean this to sound rude, but do
you know why Gerhard chose you?
Rice: [00:05:52] The story goes all the way back to the Presidential Search
Committee. I had just come back from government and Don, Don Kennedy,
had decided to step down. Jim Gaither [then president of the Board of
Trustees] called me and said, “We’re putting together a Presidential Search
Committee and we would like you to serve as one of the faculty members,”
along with Steve Chu [Professor of Physics and Molecular & Cellular
Physiology] and a couple of other people who served. I said, “Yes, I’d be
willing to serve.” As we went through all of the meetings--and Saul
Rosenberg [Professor of Medicine--Oncology] was another member and
there were several faculty members who became really good friends because
it was such an intense process together, once we had identified a few

32

candidates, we would actually go to visit them to keep it quiet as to who we
were talking about.
I was on the little team that went to visit with Gerhard in Chicago.
We were sitting there in his apartment, and he said, “So tell me about your
experience in government and how you think about decision making.” It was
a question like that.
I said, “Well, look, what I really studied was militaries and military
institutions and I can tell you with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the answer to
every question is a third of a tank, a third of a ship, and a third of an aircraft
because it’s completely distributed decision making and that’s the way
universities operate too. They never start over and say, well maybe we
shouldn’t be doing that. They just keep carving up the pie.”
He told me later that it was that statement that he started thinking,
hmm; maybe this person would be a good provost. But I was completely
floored when he asked me. As a matter of fact, I was in my office over at the
Center for International Security and my secretary came in and said that
President Casper wanted to see me. Now he’d been here a year and they were
now conducting the search for provost and Jerry Lieberman [Gerald J.
Lieberman] was acting as provost. I said, “Sure.” Chip Blacker was down the
hall from me, and I said, “Gee, Gerhard Casper wants to have lunch with
me. They must be getting close to who they want to think about as provost
and he must want to ask my opinion since I know him so well.” That’s what
I thought. I showed up in his office. After some small talk, he said, “I’d like
you to become provost of the university.” I said, “You’re kidding, right?”

33

[laughter] Not the most gracious way to handle that. Because I’d never been
a department chair, let alone a dean or provost.
He said, “I’ve decided that it’s time for a generational shift.” He said,
“I think you should do this.”
I said, “Let me think about it.”
He said, “Okay.”
[00:09:13] I was walking back across the campus and it’s very
resonant for me, because the first time I was on campus was when I’d been
invited to be a fellow here and I was out checking things out and I was
walking from the Faculty Club over to Galvez House where the Center was.
I remember walking through those archways along History Corner and
thinking, wow, I could spend a year at Stanford. Wouldn’t that be special?
When I left Gerhard’s office, I was walking along that same colonnade and it
occurred to me I could be the provost of Stanford. [laughter] It was this sort
of moment when you almost flash back to what that was like to be a 25-yearold coming here and now you might end up doing this.
So I walked back to Galvez House and I told Chip. I said, “Chip,
President Casper wants me to become the provost.”
Chip said, “You’re kidding.” [laughter]
So anyway, that’s how it happened. I think it was because, as you
remember, the university was going through very difficult times. It had the
indirect cost recovery crisis. We’d already had a year of budget cutting that
Jim Rosse [provost from 1984 to 1992] had led and led very well with all the
committees and the like. We still had a lot of work to do. We were running a

34

two percent persistent gap between income and expense. We had 157 million
dollars of unfunded earthquake damage on the campus. The Quad corners
were down. Lot of deferred maintenance because of problems that we were
having economically or financially. I think Gerhard thought that it was time
for a different look and that’s, I think, why he decided to make a change.
Brest: The budget was a very big item?
Rice: [00:11:15] It was the biggest item.
Brest: You told me last time we spoke that you had had some experience with the
CISAC [Center for International Security and Cooperation] budget but this is
orders of magnitude-Rice: [00:11:24] Yes, orders of magnitude. CISAC budget was a couple million
dollars. [laughter] So it was orders of magnitude. Well, I started by just
thinking about what a budget really is. A budget is simply a statement of
priorities. That’s what a budget is. You have to have the budget reflect
priorities. I thought that the way to do this was to recognize that there were
certain things that we simply had to do. We had to rebuild the campus. We
couldn’t leave the four Quad corners down anymore. We had to get to a
place where we were no longer in hiring freeze on faculty. Working with
Gerhard and others, I thought about a kind of set of guiding principles that
you would use to make budget decisions. The most important was, if it
doesn’t contribute to research or teaching in some way, it’s expendable.
That’s how I thought about it.
Brest: Did you consider increasing the payout?

35

Rice: [00:12:40] I went to the trustees to increase the payout by one quarter
percent to finance the rebuilding of the campus but I did not think, and still
don’t think, that you should increase payout to cover budget deficits except
in extreme circumstances. I mean, 2008 was an extreme circumstance and I
can understand that. But my deal actually with the trustees--and it was Brad
Freeman, who was, at the time, chairman of the Finance Committee, who
really helped me and worked this through the committee--the deal was, I
would deliver a budget in the black in my first year. No more two percent
gap between expenses and revenue, and they would allow a quarter percent
payout increase to finance the rebuilding of the campus. I think my first
budget was in the black by something like 179 dollars. [laughter] But it was in
the black.
Brest: Gerhard had been provost at Chicago, but I don’t know if the provost there
is the chief financial officer or if Stanford is unusual.
Rice: [00:13:56] No, the Stanford provost, I mean, for an historical project it is
really worth understanding how really central the provost’s role is at Stanford
and how powerful it is. I’m told the lore among provosts is that it goes back
to when Fred Terman was asked to be provost.
He said, “Why should I be provost? I’m dean of Engineering.”
They said, “We want you to do for the university what you’ve done
for Engineering.”
He said, “I’ll only do it if I have three things: all faculty
appointments, the budget, and all space.”

36

From that, then, the provost has become the chief operating officer
of the university. At most universities, the provost doesn’t have budget. At
most universities, the deans don’t report to the provost. So I think it’s really
quite an unusual model at Stanford.
Brest: How did you and Gerhard work and how was your decision making-Rice: [00:15:03] We knew that we had to be on the same page all the time. I
probably walked down to Gerhard’s office five, six times a day, in addition to
the formal meetings that we set up, just to bounce things off of him and to
tell him where I was going. But he really was willing to delegate to me the
kind of day-to-day budget decisions--decisions about how we were going to
use the space that was available on the campus. He loves the academy so he
read the faculty files, but he knew that as dean of the faculty, that’s really in
the center of the provost’s responsibilities. I think it freed him to do some
bigger things. I liked making the trains run on time.
He could then do things like the Presidential Scholars Program which
changed the way that Stanford thought about merit aid to attract people. He
could work on things like alumni participation rates which were incredibly
low at Stanford. He could think big about the physical campus. We are going
through a tremendous building boom right now, but Gerhard Casper is really
the father of a lot of the remaking of this campus, including the creation of
an Engineering Quad. I think it allowed him to work on big issues, although
we worked on this a lot together like the reform of undergraduate education
and the creation of freshman seminars and sophomore seminars--to really
strategically lead and direct the university so that he wasn’t worrying every

37

day about cost overruns in the museum project, which I was perfectly willing
to do, not to mention not to have to worry too much about athletics, which
also then I took athletics [laughter].
Brest: Yes, that was not his major interest. What were the reactions around campus
here?
Rice: [00:17:24] Gerhard said that, and I think he got it right, he said, “People
aren’t going to be worried that you’re young.” He said, “They’re going to be
worried that you’re Republican.” [laughter] For some people, I think that was
an issue but it quickly was not an issue because it was obvious that my
political views had very little--nothing--to do with how I was going to try to
manage the university. Early on, I’m sure that there were people who were
disappointed that they weren’t provost. I tried to be sensitive to those people
and people who might have thought that they were next in line. I think the
reaction at first wasn’t as dramatic as the reaction later on, because when I
went to the Faculty Senate and said, “I don’t do committees,” I’m not sure
people really thought I meant it. [laughter]
Brest: What do you exactly mean by “don’t do committees”?
Rice: [00:18:24] We had had a really elaborate process to deal with the initial
impact of the lowering of the indirect cost recovery. I mean, there were
committees for everything, you know, to look at every blade of grass
practically, with faculty and students and staff on every committee and then a
big thing reporting in to some central budget group. And that’s fine because
I think it brought a lot of people into the process, but we were past the
point, I thought, where we were going to be able to make decisions that way

38

because we were no longer dealing with anything that could even remotely be
called low hanging fruit. That was all gone. I actually did have a committee.
We called it the Ungroup because we didn’t want it to be known as a group.
We had a couple faculty members who served on that for me.
Gail Mahood [Professor of Geological Sciences], for instance, served
on that committee and then Mariann Byerwalter [CFO and Vice President
for Business Affairs], before that, Peter [Peter Van Etten, predecessor to
Mariann Byerwalter], who were the CFOs, and then Jeff Cox [Vice Provost
for Institutional Planning] who did institutional planning, and then Tim
Warner [Vice Provost for Budget and Auxiliaries Management], who really
became my absolutely critical person for helping to manage the university.
He’s just an extraordinary manager. When there was troubleshooting to be
done, the remaking of Housing and Dining Services or whatever, he was
really the point person for that. But what I meant by “I don’t do
committees” is somebody’s got to make decisions and not every decision can
be up for consensus.
Brest: It does seem that all the same there were an awful lot of committees.
Rice: [00:20:02] There were committees, but the Budget Committee was small and
made the decisions. Any time you have a Committee on Committees, you
know you have a lot of committees.
Brest: Yes, but things seemed to have [inaudible]-Rice: [00:20:22] Yes, people still created committees. There’s nothing wrong with
that, but I just meant in terms of the kind of central management of a
university.

39

Brest: Tell me, looking back, what were some of the highlights and lowlights.
Rice: [00:20:41] I was really pretty brash. I was 38 and I was in a hurry to get things
done. My dad had been a university administrator. I would consult him with
some problem and he would say, “You know, you can slow down a little bit.”
Because I had to learn how to manage in a couple ways. First of all, I had to
learn how to delegate. If something wasn’t done immediately, it was my
tendency to want to go do it. You learn pretty soon that good people aren’t
going to work for you if you do that. And I learned how to facilitate others
getting their jobs done. I can be very sharp tongued and I learned to control
that a bit. I remember in one budget meeting, a particular senior associate
dean made his presentation and I said, “I’m sorry, I didn’t understand.”
He said, “Well, you just don’t understand this budget.”
I said, “Well, let’s be very clear. I speak three languages. That wasn’t
in any of them. Would you like to start over?”
At the end of the meeting a senior faculty member--friend of mine-said, “That was effective.” He said, “But probably not very smart. You just
embarrassed him in front of his boss and you’re really his boss.”
It occurred to me, you know, it’s something I would never do to a
student in a classroom, right, because you freeze everybody else. But if you
do it to people over whom you have authority, you’ll also freeze them. I had
to learn things like that. I was pretty tough on the students at the beginning.
You might remember that we had the hunger strike because I had had to let
go of Cecilia Burciaga [Associate Dean and Development Officer for Student
Resources] who I had a lot of respect for. But we had budget problems, I

40

didn’t have money for everything. I went to the Faculty Senate and there
were four or so Latino students [who] held a hunger strike and they were out
on the Quad.
I went to Faculty Senate and somebody said, “Doesn’t it make you
feel terrible that our children are sleeping on the Quad and not eating?”
I said, “I’m eating and sleeping just fine, thank you very much. Not
going to change anything.”
I was young. But I learned over time that they’re students. My father
once said, “You know, they’re not the Soviet Union.” [laughter] That first year
I was pretty brash and pretty hard on people and determined to get things
done very quickly. And we did. We got a lot done very quickly. What I wanted
to be able to say to people is, we’ve got to do this really hard work and then
we’re going to be able to flourish again and we’re not going to have any more
faculty freezes and we’re not going to be freezing salaries. In a couple of years,
we were able to deliver that and get the place back on its feet.
Brest: Did you have a sense that the faculty and students appreciated that change
and were pleased with you for having helped bring it about?
Rice: [00:24:00] Yes, by the end, not only was the faculty feeling pretty good about
where we were but no-I’d worked hard on things like trying to bring minority faculty. I said
to the black faculty, give me names. We’ll find the resources. Give me names.
I spent a lot of time trying to make sure that we were developing a coterie of
minority graduate students because I worried a lot about pipeline issues. I
remember telling a group of students once, “You know, I can’t create

41

assistant professors out of whole cloth so if none of you are going to go to
graduate school and get a PhD, I can’t do anything about it.” I think some of
those things were appreciated. The very last editorial that the students did
was very appreciative that way. It was nice that they’d come full circle.
Brest: What were the other issues? The student protests--were there others besides
that with Burciaga?
Rice: [00:25:08] Yes. Well there were student protests around the ethnic centers
because I zero based everybody.1 I told them if I’m going to zero base the
Physics Department, I’m going to zero base the ethnic centers, and you
know, we got through it. I asked the ethnic centers to be more integrated
into the academic life of the university, you know, providing opportunities
for students to have tutoring if they needed it or to get to know graduate
students who could help mentor them and the like. I think they actually
eventually took that on, [took] that direction very well. I think now the ethnic
centers are much more involved in the academic life, not just the social life,
of the university.
We had a lot of issues around how to think about undergraduate
education, particularly the humanities requirement, which every few years
seems to be up for debate in the university. We had a two-year committee-only in the university would you have a two-year committee, but we did--to
create a sort of different introduction to the humanities.
Brest: What was it? Western Civ at the time?

Note from Condoleezza Rice: This meant that we took a completely new look at expenses and revenue with
no reference to what the prior year’s budget had been.
1

42

Rice: [00:26:39] It had gone from Western Civ to Cultures, Values, and something
[Editor: Cultures, Ideas, & Values (CIV)]. This now was Introduction to the
Humanities [IHUM]. That was a constant issue. I think it makes no sense to
have an International Introduction to Humanities that doesn’t have diversity
of experience and thought. But it also is awfully important to recognize that
some events in history have to be understood if you’re going to understand
what happened subsequently. What happened with peasants in some part of
the world actually didn’t have the effects on human history; it’s what
happened with the kings and queens of Europe. That’s not a normative
statement. That’s a fact. We had to get to the place that we could understand
things like that.
Brest: If it were now, would there be things you’d do otherwise?
Rice: [00:28:00] You mean if I were provost now?
Brest: Yes, or not even if you were provost now. What do you think should be
happening now in light of the current situation?
Rice: [00:28:10] I’ll tell you a couple things that concern me about the university
now, not Stanford, all the universities. I remember when Gerhard and I
talked about maybe the three-year degree, and you would have thought we
had sent a nuclear weapon off on the Quad because people were saying,
“No, it takes four years and they need to--.”
With the advent of online learning and the ability of technology to be
the delivery vehicle for learning, it’s not clear to me that everybody’s going to
continue to pay for four years, at the prices that we all charge, just to feel that
they’ve had a social experience. It may not be right for everybody. And so I

43

think we have to start to look at differentiated packages of education. Maybe
somebody wants to spend two years doing online work in the big classes and
basic classes and then take advantage of what we do for the two years which
only we can do--small classes and labs and things like that. I think we’re
whistling past the graveyard on what the effect is going to be of online
learning on universities. There are great things like Coursera and so forth, but
I’m not sure that, on the basics of what it’s going to do to how we deliver a
college education, that we are ready for it, because I study institutions as a
political scientist and why they don’t react to big, environmental stimuli out
there that are saying things have to change. You could see that universities
could deal themselves out of the central role in education over an extended
period of time. I think we have to think hard about that.
I worry some about what people are calling the smoke-like problem,
you know, the safe spaces and micro aggression and I am very clear with my
students about this. I tell them, “Probably the reason I don’t recognize micro
aggression is I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. That was a macro
aggression.” And I think we infantilize our students. They have to be willing
and able to confront ideas that they don’t like, delivered by people that they
don’t like, in ways that offend them, because the last time that I looked, there
actually isn’t a constitutional guarantee that you will not be offended. I’m
quite concerned about that. I’m concerned that I’ve had students come to me
and say, “I don’t feel that I can say what I think because there is an
orthodoxy in the university and if I say anything outside that orthodoxy,

44

maybe I’m religious, maybe I’m conservative, maybe…then I’m ostracized.
So I just keep my thoughts to myself.”
Brest: Really?
Rice: [00:31:39] Yes. That’s really awful. And it happens in the classroom apparently.
If it happens in a dorm or in a social setting, then everybody can handle
themselves. But when it happens in a classroom, that’s the height of an
unequal relationship and it shouldn’t be allowed.
Brest: Do you have also theories about how to prevent it?
Rice: [00:32:13] You know, faculty govern themselves. I would hope that if the
issue is raised, that faculty will begin to think about what they say in the
classroom and how they say it and whether what they’re saying is excluding
some portion of their students from the discourse and not to become so selfcentered that they’re determined to have their orthodoxies dominate their
classroom.
Brest: Do you think that that’s what the source is--the faculty rather than the
student?
Rice: [00:32:49] I think the source is some faculty. Yes.
Brest: Going back to when you assumed the provostship, who was the provost?
Rice: [00:32:58] Jerry Lieberman was acting. He was ill as you remember and I was
supposed to take over in September, and I did in July because Jerry wasn’t
able to continue. He was a tremendous counselor to me. He helped me
immensely. He’d done it before and he was great.
Brest: I loved him.
Rice: [00:33:19] Yes, me too.

45

Brest: What we skipped over is your first public service tour.
Rice: [00:33:30] Yes, yes, yes.
Brest: Come back to that.
Rice: [00:33:33] When I went to work for George H. W. Bush?
Brest: Yes.
Rice: [00:33:36] I had met Brent Scowcroft when he came out here to give a talk. I
was thought to be one of the better young Soviet specialists in the country
and I asked him a question. He came up to me afterwards and he said, “I’d
like to keep in touch.” And he started taking me to something called the
Aspen Strategy Group where a lot of the foreign policy elites sort of gather
in the summer. And then when he was asked to be National Security Advisor
by George H. W. Bush, he called me and he said, “This fellow Gorbachev,
he’s doing some really amazing things and interesting things. The President
needs somebody to help him sort it out. Would you come be the White
House Soviet Specialist?”
I was offered two other jobs with the administration but I thought,
well, it’s the White House and I know Brent. Just to show you how different
things were then: when I said, “Yes, Brent, I’d love to do that,” I went and I
met Bob Gates who was the deputy and a couple other people. I said, “Yes,
I’d love to do this.” He said, “Great.” Then he said, “Are you a Republican?”
I said, “Yes,” but he didn’t even know. That just shows how different things
were not that long ago. He was just trying to find a bright, young Soviet
specialist and he didn’t really care about the politics. I showed up in January
of 1989 and within weeks, it was obvious that the world that we knew was

46

coming unstuck. It had started in Poland with Solidarity making a deal with
the government and soon Communist regimes were just kind of falling all
over Eastern Europe. For me, probably the highlight was that by the summer
of 1989, everybody thought maybe Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia would
get out of the Soviet Bloc because it was clear Gorbachev wasn’t prepared to
use force to keep them in, but would the Soviet Union really allow Germany
to unify?
As it was clear that East Germany could no longer sustain itself. I
remember a cartoon in the newspaper and it said “the unification of
Germany.” It had West Germany, East Germany; it had all the people in
West Germany and one little person staying in East Germany because people
were just fleeing East Germany. We thought we better put some kind of
process around it. Jim Baker and others created something called the TwoPlus-Four meaning the two Germanys plus the four powers--France, the
United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain who had been the occupying
powers--to return Germany to sovereignty.
Brent called me over to his office and he said, “I want you to be the
White House representative on the delegation, the political directors’
delegation that will actually write the document.”
I said, “Brent, I’m a Soviet Specialist--I’m your Soviet Specialist.”
He said, “For us, German unification is a Soviet problem.”
He said, “President Bush already knows that he wants Germany
unified. He’s not at all fearful. It’s not an issue for us. But how we bring the

47

Soviets along, that’s going to be the big issue, so that we don’t have an
explosion in the middle of Europe.”
That, for me, was the most exciting thing that I did in government-was to be on that political directors’ delegation to write the document on the
unification of Germany.
Brest: Were you tempted to stay in government?
Rice: [00:37:20] No. We get the unification done and it’s pretty clear now that the
Soviet Union itself is in trouble because the Baltic States are practically
declaring independence and it was April, March--earlier. I went to Brent and
I said, “Brent, we’ve liberated Eastern Europe, unified Germany, the Soviet
Union’s about to fall apart, and I don’t have the energy for it. It’s time for me
to go home.” I felt that I couldn’t, as an academic, you know, two years was
about right at that stage in my career. I left in April and came back and the
Soviet Union collapsed in August, well actually December, but, I mean, the
coup against Gorbachev was in August so I was not there for any of that, but
I felt I’d done what I needed to do and I’m an academic at heart. When I left
the last time, people kept saying, “Well, what are you going to do?” I’m going
to go back to Stanford. It never occurred to me to do anything else.
Brest: Did it ever occur to you to go to another university?
Rice: [00:38:31] Only once. I learned something important that helped me as
provost with this. I came to Stanford. I was on a one-year fellowship. About
halfway through my fellowship, the Political Science Department said, you
know, give a job talk. I said, “Fine.” They said, “Our job is in international
economics.” I said, “I don’t do international economics.” I think I told you

48

this story, right? I am offered the job. I realize they’re trying to diversify the
faculty and that’s all fine and I get tenure. Now every university in the
country comes after you because now you’re certifiably good. In particular,
Harvard and MIT and a few others courted me. I really liked MIT. I like the
department there and everything but, in the final analysis, I didn’t like Boston
that much. I had decided I would stay at Stanford; but that was probably the
closest that I came to leaving--was to go to MIT. That would have been 1988
I guess--1987 or 1988.
I’ve always thought I was fortunate and blessed to kind of find a
university that fits me like a glove in so many ways, from what I do
academically to the colleagues, to the valley, which is such an exciting place
to be around, all the way to the sports, you know, to the intercollegiate
athletics. It’s perfect.
Brest: I never really thought about the place being perfect but-Rice: [00:40:28] It’s a perfect fit, yes.
Brest: I’m skipping again, but what’s your relationship with the Hoover at this
point?
Rice: [00:40:43] I am a Hoover Senior Fellow. And Hoover Senior Fellows, there
are two kinds. There are people who are fulltime Hoover Senior Fellows, so
they’re recruited just to Hoover. Then there are joint appointments. I’ve been
a joint appointment my entire time. When I left as provost, I was jointly
appointed to Hoover. I had an appointment at Hoover and then I went to
government. When you’re provost, you can’t be a part of a department so, in
effect, my billet was being held in the university.

49

When I came back, I felt that I really wanted to go to a professional
school. Because of some of the things I’d worked on and was interested in, I
thought the Business School was a good place. But it’s an interesting story
from the academic point of view because you don’t just pick up and move to
another school. I was in H&S [School of Humanities and Sciences]. You don’t
just pick up and move to another school. They go through a whole process of,
you know, faculty looking at what you do and voting and all of that. I
remember telling Garth [Garth Saloner, John H. Scully Professor of
Leadership, Management and International Business and at that time Dean of
the Graduate School of Business], “Look, I want this to be like you would do
it for anyone else.” And so they did, and I was then appointed to the Business
School as my faculty appointment and my half-time appointment at Hoover.
Brest: So leaving H&S?
Rice: [00:42:04] Yes.
Brest: Do you now teach only at the Business School?
Rice: [00:42:09] No, I teach a course for Political Science as well.
Brest: You didn’t entirely leave.
Rice: [00:42:14] Yes, I teach advanced undergraduates in a course for Political
Science, but I don’t have an appointment there. I have a courtesy
appointment.
Brest: Thanks so much.
Rice: [00:42:34] It’s wonderful.

DATE OF INTERVIEW:

APRIL 12, 2017

PART:

3 OF 3

Brest: This is Iris Brest with the Stanford Historical Society’s Oral History Program.
Today is April 12, 2017. I’m here again with Dr. Condoleezza Rice for the
third segment of this interview. We were talking about your provostship last
time and I had meant to ask you about music, both personally and
professionally.
Rice: [00:00:33] Well, music has figured so strongly in my life since the time I was
three years old. My mother was a music teacher, a musician; my grandmother
was a music teacher, and my great grandmother also taught music. So it went
a long way back in my family. And, as I’ve said, I tried to major in music, left
it. And so by the time I came to Stanford, I had not really played the piano in
years seriously. I would play kind of Christmas carols at Christmas and mess
around on the piano. I didn’t even have a piano here with me, initially. But
when I came back from government the second time, I brought the piano
here to Stanford. And so the Brest family figures very prominently both in
my personal music development and in the university.

51

So when I became provost, I was meeting with a certain dean of the
Law School and he said, “You play the piano, right?”
And I said, “Yes.”
And he said that he had this little string quartet and they wanted to
try some of the piano literature and would I play with them.
And I said, “Oh Paul, I haven’t played serious music in years.”
And he said, “No, no, you should come.” So, at that time, it was
Karen Lindblom and Paul [Paul Brest, husband of interviewer Iris Brest], and
Walter Hewlett. And so we played some Mozart and the like and then he
brought a second violinist in and we started to play some quintets and I was
starting to really love it. And that summer, we went to the Muir String
Quartet’s festival, which, at that time, was in Snowbird, Utah. I played some
with them and I played some with the quartet and I was starting to really love
it. And I decided I was going to come back and take piano lessons. So I went
to George Barth who was the head of the Piano Department, and I said I
wanted to take piano lessons.
And George has said that he thought it was some kind of Trojan
horse, that I was actually there to kind of scope out what was really going on
[laughter] with the Music Department. I’ll return to that in a minute. But he
said, “You were really serious.” And the kind of impetus for being really
serious was I had agreed to play with the Muir at the home of Paul and Iris
Brest in November, as a matter of fact, on November 14th of 1994. And so I
was learning the Brahms Piano Quintet and it’s a monster of a piece, and I
was working on it with George and we worked very hard. And, sure enough,

52

November 14th, I performed that piece with the Muir. But one of the really
funny moments was that it started out with unison passage with the piano,
violin, and cello. And we got about three notes in and there was this horrible
dissonance and I thought how could we be off, we just started? They were
playing Happy Birthday and didn’t tell me. So that was one of those great
moments. But that’s how I got back into playing and I’ve been taking lessons
ever since and concertizing ever since.
[00:03:50] And so Paul is really responsible for getting me back to my
music. But upon becoming provost, I also realized that the Stanford Music
Department had really kind of deteriorated. It was basically just giving a few
lessons. It didn’t really have a program per se. John Etchemendy was the
senior associate dean for the humanities. And we were not very strong really
in any of the arts. I said to John, “I want you to put the Music faculty in a
room and don’t let them come out until they have a plan for the Music
Department.” And John did exactly that. He led a review of the Music
Department. We had certain strengths. Computer music was very strong.
And Walter Hewlett had spearheaded a lot of that, CCRMA it was called
[Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics]. Then we had some
good composers but of the more modern variety who also related to the kind
of computer music side of it.
We had some very good professors who were teachers of piano and
strings and so forth, but we didn’t even have a category for people who were
performers to be on the professoriate. So it was clear that we were not, you
know, we weren’t Juilliard, we weren’t a conservatory; we probably weren’t

53

going to ever compete with the USC or the Big Ten schools like Michigan
and Indiana that were the big factories for turning out performers. But we
needed to find a niche where we could really be great. We decided that we
had some good musicologists, we had great computer music, and if we could
create a performance program that was not for people who necessarily
wanted to be concert musicians but the great, new biology student who, like
me, was a very good amateur, or the computer science major who had
studied piano from the age of three. And so we set about doing that and in
order to anchor that, we decided we needed a really first class quartet to
anchor it because they could anchor chamber music. They could anchor
performances and the like.
We had a good quartet, but we didn’t have a world class quartet. And
so the university supported auditions and we had, I think, probably eighty
quartets from around the world that applied to come here. Paul Brest led that
effort. Paul and I sat through the auditions of the last five. And that is how
the St. Lawrence Quartet came to Stanford. And they were at that time a very
young quartet from Canada--kind of up and coming but nobody really knew
who they were, and now they are one of the best quartets in the world. It
turned out to be great. Then also I went to the Faculty Senate to create a
category of Professor-Performance and we were able to create the category
so that we would anchor each of the major piano and voice and strings and
the like. And so we did that. The Music Department has flourished. And so
one of my greatest joys is that we were able to turn around the Music
Department at Stanford.

54

Brest: The St. Lawrence has done nothing but got better all the time.
Rice: [00:07:40] Yes, they got better and better, and they love students and they
work with students and they’re perfect for a university, just perfect.
Brest: Apart from that major search, during your provostship, there were dean
searches.
Rice: [00:07:59] So I oversaw several dean searches: search for the dean of the
Medical School after David Korn stepped down and we hired Eugene Bauer
[Eugene A. Bauer]; search for the dean of the Law School because Paul
retired and we brought Kathleen Sullivan [Kathleen M. Sullivan]; search for
the dean of Earth Sciences took place during my time; search for the dean of
the Business School because Mike Spence [A. Michael Spence] stepped down
and Bob Joss [Robert L. Joss] was brought on; Education. So we had a
number of deans turn over while I was here. Mostly they were long serving
deans who retired or had decided to move on to other things.
Brest: Oh, Earth Science.
Rice: [00:08:54] Earth Science is [Lynn Orr]. Right, right.
Brest: How about Athletics?
Rice: [00:09:03] Well, so Gerhard Casper had been an undergraduate in Hamburg.
He had been a Yale law professor. He had been provost of Chicago, which
abandoned football in 1945, I think. He was not exactly cut out to oversee
intercollegiate athletics of the seriousness of the Stanford program. [laughter]
And at Stanford, since the provost is really the chief operating officer and
oversees budget and facilities and all that, it was a kind of natural thing for
Athletics to report to the provost for those matters. And I said to Gerhard,

55

“I’ll be happy to oversee Athletics on a day-to-day basis, although obviously
you have to be involved because it’s the presidents that are held
accountable.” And he was perfectly happy to have me do it. So Ted Leland
was the athletic director. I loved the program, and I still do, because Stanford
has an unusual mix of athletics and academics.
The overlap of people who can play in the PAC-12 and get into
Stanford is not very great. And so Stanford has to recruit nationally. Stanford
keeps its standards high for student athletes. You won’t find any majors in
recreation among the student athletes at Stanford, and they belong here. I
always thought that it was absolutely great that there was a place like Stanford
where if you were good in the classroom and good in athletics, you could find
the place to be. And that’s who they are. And I think it’s the best athletics
program in the country. It also plays thirty-six sports and has very strong
women’s sports so Title IX, you know, at Stanford, is not considered
anathema. It’s considered a real strength and the women’s teams are very,
very strong here and have been for a really, really long time. I see a lot of
universities trying to rush to build women’s teams to be in compliance with
Title IX but Stanford has always had excellent women’s teams, going back a
long, long way.
Brest: What do you think about football, especially now that we’ve got a president
who’s a neuroscientist?
Rice: [00:11:27] Yes, yes. Well, football’s got its challenges, because something is
going on with the sport and brain injury. I think the process of learning
exactly what it is and how to deal with it, how to protect it--it’s a violent

56

sport so you’re only going to be able to protect so much. But they’re making
a lot of progress in thinking about how to minimize head-to-head contact.
But they’re making progress in minimizing the amount of days that you can
actually work in pads as opposed to just walking through. They’re making a
lot of progress in understanding concussions. It used to be when somebody
got hit in the head in football, you know, they’d put one finger in front of
their eye and go like this and if they were able to follow the finger even
moderately, they were right back in.
Now there are concussion protocols that you have to go through.
Nobody goes right back in after a suspected concussion any longer. So I
think they’re making progress. The truth of the matter is concussions happen
in a lot of sports. I had two myself as a figure skater because I hit my head
on the ice and ice isn’t soft. So the reason I say that they’ve got more work to
do is that one of the problems with diagnosing or knowing what the
relationship is to CTE, the head trauma disease, is that the sample is completely
of people who had CTE. So you have a sample that has selection bias in it.
So you can’t cut open the brain of somebody who’s-Brest: Is still using it.
Rice: [00:13:09] --still functioning. I know some of the best neuroscientists in the
world are working on it. I have a very good friend--actually [pianist and
composer] Michele Levin’s husband, Tom, is on a panel for the NFL on
head trauma and he’s one of the very best neurosurgeons in the country. I
think they’re doing what they can, but I worry about it for football because I

57

don’t want football to become like boxing where the only people who do it
are people who have no other options.
Brest: I didn’t know that about boxing.
Rice: [00:13:42] Yes, yes.
Brest: I have something written here that I don’t remember what it means:
“Partners in Academic Excellence.”
Rice: [00:13:52] Yes. So Partners in Academic Excellence was a program that
Gerhard and I started. And I’ll explain the origins of it and then how it
evolved. The provost does the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony each year. And so
as provost I was doing the Phi Beta Kappa ceremony, and I noticed that
there were almost no African-American kids. I think that year there was
maybe one, maybe two. And I thought, “What’s going on here? Because
obviously they are hyper qualified when they come here and something’s
going on.” I’ve always suspected that there is a tendency--what President
Bush called “the soft bigotry of low expectations”--not to challenge minority
students quite as hard because you don’t want to be called racist, or you want
to make excuses for them, or whatever.
And so we started something called Partners in Academic Excellence
where freshmen would be paired with--so five freshmen--with a black
graduate student and a black faculty member. A black faculty member would
maybe have twenty kids. The graduate student would have five. And the
graduate students would read their papers in the Humanities core and give
them suggestions. And the black graduate students were saying, “This isn’t an
A paper. You’ve been given an A. This isn’t an A paper.” And then, they

58

would get to the next level, sophomore or junior year, and all of a sudden
they weren’t really well prepared because we weren’t preparing them early on.
And so I think this bias is real. And somebody asked me was I trying to recreate my segregated schools because I had really good teachers in our
segregated schools, and since race wasn’t an issue, people could be very
demanding. And I said, well maybe. But of course, we soon realized that we
would be in violation of law if we made it only for black students, and so we
started to create other affiliations or other affiliated groups. We started doing
it for Hispanic students. We did it for athletes--again, sometimes people will
underestimate their capacity because they are athletes. And so it was really
almost a little bit of an experiment, to see if we were really serving these kids
well with the high expectations that we ought to have.
Brest: What happened?
Rice: [00:16:32] Well it became a very popular program and then we started getting
all kinds of different Partners in Academic Excellence. And eventually when
we went to more of a college system for freshmen, it wasn’t needed as much.
Remember early on our freshmen were sort of disbursed into all kinds of
dorms and there weren’t really special programs for freshmen. Once they
were more in a freshman college environment, it wasn’t as much of a
problem.
Brest: During the early days when the graduate students would diagnose this
student is being-Rice: [00:17:08] Coddled.
Brest: Yes. Was there anything to do about that?

59

Rice: [00:17:13] Well, you know, actually the faculty within sort of helped by
talking to colleagues, not saying, “Professor A, you’re doing this or Professor
B, you’re doing this,” but just socializing in among colleagues and bringing
up in faculty circles and in their departments and saying, “Let’s be sure that
we’re not falling prey to this.” I think it really started to make faculty more
aware. I had had one experience with a colleague in one of the science
departments. It was really early in the quarter and he said, “Oh, I’m doing so
much teaching this quarter,” he said, “and I have all my sections.” He said,
“But I’m doing the one for minority students. I’m doing it myself.” And I
said, “Well, why is that?” And I thought, “You’re two weeks into the quarter,
how could you possibly know their capacity?” Right? So I think it happens,
and it’s the best of intentions. Comes from the right place in the heart but it
really is not a good thing. I think by actually getting faculty to talk about it in
a more open way, we were able to deal with it better.
Brest: I think that’s similar to a thing that happened at the Law School before your
time.
Rice: [00:18:27] Really?
Brest: A program that they dismantled when it proved to be falling into that same-Rice: [00:18:36] Yes, because you know, I’m a big supporter of affirmative action
and I’ve defended affirmative action. And I, myself, wouldn’t probably have
been at Stanford without the effort to diversify the faculty. Stanford didn’t
need another Soviet specialist but they found this young, black, woman
Soviet specialist who was here on a one-year fellowship and thought, oh she’s

60

pretty good, maybe we’ll get that half billet. 2 So I’m a big believer in
affirmative action. But I think we have to be honest that the downside of it is
that people very easily come to the conclusion that well they must have
lowered the standards, when you see somebody of color or even if you see in
some fields women. We have to fight that bias all the time.
Brest: Back to the athletic part of it. You have so often been in male dominated
contexts. Is it helpful to be so athletically literate? [laughter]
Rice: [00:19:43] Yes, yes. It really is. Sometimes if you’re in a context with people
who are not like you, you have to find ways to bridge. And so my first
experience with--first real experience in the workplace with this--was that I
was a fellow of the Council on Formulations and my fellowship was with the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. And I worked [in the Nuclear and Chemical Division]
for Strategic Nuclear Planning which was the guys who do the single
integrated plan for the employment of nuclear weapons. And so it was pretty
male dominated. It was affectionately called the NUCEM division. And here
I was, I was female, I was black, and I was a civilian--three strikes.
The first days, they said, “The rookie makes the coffee.” And I said
fine. So I made the coffee. I made coffee so strong nobody could drink it,
you know, so I wasn’t asked to do that again. But then there was a football
pool, and I won it. And from then on, we had something to talk about. Every
Monday morning we’d come in and talk about the football games and who
was looking good and who wasn’t. It was a way to bridge. And I sometimes
think that when you are the odd one--today the tendency is to think that they
In those days, the university gave a department one half of a position (a billet) as an incentive to hire minority
faculty members.
2

61

have to make you comfortable--I think it’s not a bad thing to help make them
comfortable too. You can find ways to do that.
Brest: I’d like to talk about your second round of public service so maybe we
should do it a little bit chronological because I was about to ask about when
you came back. When you were there, what was your relevant work
experience for that?
Rice: [00:21:46] For that job, yes. Well I’d actually been Special Assistant for Soviet
Affairs in the George H. W. Bush National Security Council. It wasn’t that
big a step to become National Security Advisor, because I had been on the
NSC staff in a senior role and during the most extraordinary times, the end
of the Cold War, and I’d managed the most important account. And I also
had managed George W. Bush’s foreign policy during the campaign. So I
knew him well. So that was fine. Having been National Security Advisor, it
was not that big a leap actually to Secretary of State. My government
experience sort of added up properly for those jobs. But probably the hardest
part about it was that when I became National Security Advisor, it was a little
bit like being provost.
When I was provost, I remember that the Physics Department
wanted to buy a $17 million telescope. I remember then, when they sent the
three Nobel Laureates to sell me on the idea, thinking, okay, I’m obviously
not going to debate the physics with them but I’m the one who has to make
the decision. I had to learn to ask the right questions and I had to learn what
arguments I trusted and which ones I didn’t in order to make the decision.
When you’re National Security Advisor, you don’t have deep knowledge

62

about every area of the world but you have to learn how to ask the right
questions, whose arguments you can trust, and ultimately you have to make a
decision. That’s hard for an academic because we pride ourselves on knowing
one thing in greater depth than anybody else. I once knew more about the
Soviet General Staff than they knew about themselves. I know that because I
met the former Chief of the Soviet General Staff and I said to him, “How
many people work on the Soviet General Staff?” He said, “I don’t know, five
thousand or so.” I said, “Yes, I think that’s about right.”
I had stood in Moscow and counted the windows in the Defense
Ministry and figured out well if it was that much square footage per how
many people--so you have to have this hunger to know something in great
depth to be a great academic. When you’re in a position of leadership like
that, you aren’t going to possibly know everything in depth and so you have
to get out of your comfort zone with it and learn how to trust your instincts,
how to gather information, how to make decisions. That was, for me, the
hardest part.
Brest: What do you think of as the most difficult and what are you proudest of
among your accomplishments?
Rice: [00:24:36] 9/11 was the hardest. Yes, 9/11 was the hardest. Because if you’re
in a position of authority on 9/11, every day after seemed like--you know,
like September 12--and the thing about it is that I believe we did everything
we knew to do. We didn’t have warnings. The intelligence was not there. But
when you see three thousand people die on your watch, you feel responsible.
By definition, you didn’t do enough. From that day on, it’s “never let it

63

happen again.” I’m really grateful that it didn’t. It wasn’t for lack of trying.
There were all kinds of thought lines. There were all kinds of terrorist
attempts. President Bush was determined that the American people needed
to go back to a normal life. And so I think, in many ways, the American
people never knew really how fraught those days were after 9/11 until we
finally captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed who was the operational planner
for 9/11 and for North America. I’ve always said that was like having
Rommel [Marshal Erwin Rommel] under lock and key, right?
Before that, plot lines were just coming out of everywhere, you know,
a radiological threat against Washington, DC, a smallpox threat--we had the
anthrax attack which we thought was foreign turned out to be probably
domestically sourced. Day after day after day. The intelligence community
missed the cues on 9/11. And so the day after, the president’s threat report
looked like a phonebook. You know, every crazy person who called in from
Chicago saying he was going to blow up something was in the president’s
threat report because they weren’t going to miss it again, so they just threw
everything at him. It was very hard. Very hard.
Brest: Then you came back.
Rice: [00:26:46] Yes. Yes.
Brest: What’s it like?
Rice: [00:26:49] Oh, I should say, you know, Iraq was hard too because we did
what we thought we had to do because we thought he had usable weapons of
mass destruction as opposed to just the infrastructure. We didn’t get it right
for a long time. We finally kind of got it right in 2007, 2008 with the surge

64

and Iraq was stable by the time we left in 2009. But there were some grim
days in 2006 and 2007. You know, you’re losing American soldiers,
bombings in Iraq. It’s tough to live through that because, again, you feel
responsible. And so issues of war and peace are always the hardest. But I
think the thing that I’m most proud of is that we stood for the belief that
people can govern themselves, that democracy is not just for us, that even in
the Middle East they’re capable of democracy, and I still believe that.
Brest: Not a lot of new evidence to support it.
Rice: [00:27:49] Well but you know, you are having places, even in Iraq--when
Maliki was forced out, he didn’t take his army and go to the streets. He
stepped down. Something’s happening. I think democracy takes a really long
time. We forget how long it took in the United States. My father couldn’t
register to vote in 1952, so it took a while.
Brest: Not that we have reached any state of perfection.
Rice: [00:28:26] No. As a matter of fact, that’s a very good point. Democracy’s
never perfect. But what it is it’s the only system that has shock absorbers of
people being able to change their circumstances peacefully. That’s what it has
going for it, because if you’re in an authoritarian system you have no way to
do it except for revolution.
Brest: When you came back, you had talked about leaving H&S for a combination
of Hoover and the GSB. What’s it like at Hoover compared to a school or a
department?
Rice: [00:29:08] Well, Hoover doesn’t have students. Of course, that’s the first big
difference, although I have lots of students around here. And I’m really

65

happy that my end of the office always has students and we have student
assistants, because there are not enough students around Hoover. We need
to have more and we talk a lot about that. People are here to do research and
we actually now are acting more as a kind of fellowship of people trying to
chart the future course for Hoover--what should we be working on, who
should we be recruiting. But departments and schools have regular ways of
charting their future--by the people they’re hiring, by the tenure decisions
they’re making, by the curriculum they’re offering. Hoover doesn’t have that.
And I’m glad I’m also in the Business School because I would miss that part
of the academic enterprise, even chairing committees. I’m willing to do it.
Brest: Who do you interact with at Hoover? Who’s your cohort?
Rice: [00:30:16] Well the people who study international issues and national
security, people like Niall Ferguson and Steve Krasner and Larry Diamond,
and Michael McFaul is also a Hoover Fellow. Amy Zegart is one of my
closest collaborators and colleagues. And then I know a lot of the
economists because several of them were in government with me: Eddie
Lazear and John Taylor and Mike Boskin were all in government with me at
one time or another. So they tend to be good colleagues. Dave Brady who
was in Political Science with me. So it’s a great group and we have from time
to time--you know, we get dinner and just talk about things. John Cogan is
one of my golfing buddies as well as one of my colleagues.
Brest: What do you think about the status of the Hoover, the relationship with the
[university]?

66

Rice: [00:31:12] I think it’s good. It’s really good now. It wasn’t very good early on.
You know, several years ago, it was really terrible. There had been a bit of a
falling out about the Reagan Library not coming to the campus. I think there
was a sense that Hoover was overly ideological and the relationship wasn’t
very good. It got better, thanks--John Raisian should go down as the Hoover
director who regularized relations between the university and Hoover. He
really did, in terms of the hiring processes, the quality of fellows that he
brought. And then Tom [Thomas Gilligan] has sort of picked up that mantle
and moved forward with it. But I don’t think relations could be better than
they are now.
I mean, you have a high number of faculty who are joint--Hoover
and from Business School, Political Science, Law. So that helps a lot I think.
But I think the university recognizes the quality of people here and you have
a lot of interaction. Hoover has a lot of interaction with FSI, the Freeman
Spogli Institute. Lot of joint appointments there too. I think the
relationship’s really good between Hoover and the university now.
Brest: I actually was wondering what you thought about the formal structure.
Rice: [00:32:45] It’s okay. It’s a little quirky, right? But it works. I think everybody
understands that the Stanford Board of Trustees also oversees the Hoover
[Institution as a unit of the University – for instance to make sure that
Hoover policies are in line with those of the University]; but the [Hoover]
overseers are really important in their support for Hoover and they really
oversee, I would say, the more operational side with Tom and before that
John. And, as I said, I think the one thing Hoover is lacking is students but

67

we’re talking about maybe getting some more interns in Hoover and being
able to have them access Hoover more. I very often do student things over
in the other Hoover building and, at first, they’ll kind of come over here like
“Am I allowed in here?” I say, “Yes, yes, you are.” [laughter]
Brest: Who are your other important colleagues besides these?
Rice: [00:33:42] Well, I’ve been at Stanford a long time. I have friends and
colleagues who are very close. Paul [Brest] is a long-time friend and colleague
and we have so many interests in common. I have lots of colleagues, of
course, in the Business School with whom I have worked, but I still have
many colleagues in Political Science. Judy Goldstein and I came here together
as first year assistant professors. We were the only women in the department.
And Heinz Eulau was a wonderful man but very traditional, used to start the
department meetings by saying, “Gentlemen.” Finally after about three or
four months of this, Judy said, “Heinz, Heinz, what about Condi and me?” I
wanted to say, “Judy, just don’t rock the boat, okay? We both need to get
tenured. Just leave him alone.” [laughter] Judy and I have [been friends for a]
long time but Steve Krasner’s probably one of my closest colleagues and
friends.
Brest: Somebody, can’t remember who, mentioned a lunch group that includes
Lucy Shapiro?
Rice: [00:34:47] Well, there used to be. We haven’t done it in years. Lucy’s a great
friend and colleague. Sid Drell was the one who would convene it. I’m sorry,
no. George Shultz was the one who would convene it and George, by the
way, is my mentor/colleague/friend, probably the most important person to

68

me in a lot of ways. But it was George and Lucy and Sid Drell, and then later
on we invited Gerhard, and me. We would have lunch when Chantilly was
down in downtown Palo Alto. My favorite line was, George would say to the
waiter, Gus, “Now Gus, I’m going to order the sea bass and you’re going to
bring me the lamb chops, but because I’m such a polite person, I would
never send them back.” [laughter] We haven’t done it in years and now, of
course, we’ve lost Sid, which was very sad.
Brest: When we were talking some time about your general approach to teaching, I
meant to ask, are there some courses which are most memorable to you or
the most important?
Rice: [00:36:02] Well I think that I’ve evolved in my teaching too. We all do. I
teach a lot by simulation and I always have. So the students take on roles and
they try to solve the Syria crisis or Ukraine or whatever because then they
really get into it and they’ll do a lot of research on their own and it’s always
very engaging. But I really feel that I’ve gotten the pedagogy right for the
course that I’m teaching now, which is Challenges and Dilemmas in U.S.
Foreign Policy. They write a five-page paper every week. I read every paper. I
give them a page of comments on it because they’ve done all the reading,
which is sometimes as much as four or five hundred pages in a week.
Brest: These are GSB students?
Rice: [00:36:45] These are undergraduate students. Undergraduates and graduate
students. There can be GSB students in it. And then because they’ve read the
work and written the paper, the class discussion is so good, because
everybody knows what they’re talking about. And I have so many students

69

who say, “People bring their A game to this class. They’ve really done all the
reading.” I’m glad, but I wish it were the case everywhere. I had one very
funny thing happen though. You know, I’ve been teaching it for six years. Six
years. And I handwrite the notes. I had a couple students say they couldn’t
understand my writing, and I thought well my writing’s very legible. They
can’t read cursive.
Brest: Oh my lord.
Rice: [00:37:34] Yes. So I actually started typing out the notes.
Brest: Oh that’s so interesting.
Rice: [00:37:40] Isn’t it interesting?
Brest: Yes.
Rice: [00:37:41] They can’t read cursive. They’re not teaching it in a lot of schools.
Brest: You had said that your only experience with housing discrimination was in
Denver.
Rice: [00:38:07] Denver, right.
Brest: What about other discrimination?
Rice: [00:38:14] No. Not myself so much but you run into it from time to time. I
remember when my mom--I think I told you the story about buying the
sweaters. Did I tell you that story?
Brest: No.
Rice: [00:38:27] My mother had a very sharp tongue. And it was also in Denver,
interestingly. The thing about the South is discrimination was obvious and it
was expected, and so you knew how to deal with it up front. You get to a
place like Denver and there are only 90,000 blacks and you think what it

70

could be like. And so we were in the store and my mother asked to see some
nicer sweaters that were natural materials as opposed to acrylic. The woman
kept showing her the same sweaters, and my mother finally said, “No, I really
want to see like cashmere or something.” I think she thought the woman
didn’t understand. And the woman said, “Well, those are very expensive.”
And my mother said, “Well, let’s get this straight. If you could afford
anything in here, you wouldn’t be working here.” And so that’s kind of how
my parents dealt with [it]--they never took it on themselves.
My father said to me once, “It’s fine if somebody doesn’t want to sit
next to you because you’re black, as long as they move.” So I’m not one who
is particularly knocked off balance by it if I ever see it. I, first of all, try to
give people the benefit of the doubt because sometimes they either don’t
know, or they don’t intend, and we’re all really quick to be offended, really
quick to be offended these days. When I went to Notre Dame, I had been
told that Indiana--of course, the modern Ku Klux Klan was rebuilt in
Indiana and that part of Indiana had a kind of bad name for racism.
And I remember I met this guy when I first got to Notre Dame, he
was helping me unload my car and he said, “Now go to the bookstore today
and get the biggest Notre Dame sticker you can find and put it on the back
of your car because they don’t mess with Notre Dame students.” So it was
kind of in my mind. Couple days later I drove down into downtown South
Bend to get a bedspread. I had a brand new car and it had a tendency to
overheat. And so, sure enough, it’s overheating. It’s hot as Hades in South
Bend because it’s August and the thing’s overheating. And I just pulled over

71

to the curb, and there was this gas station about a block away. So I walked
back to the gas station and I said to the guy, “My car’s overheated, can you
help me?”
He said, “You’ll have to bring it here.”
Well, I interpret it as, you know, right away my--because my hackles
were up and I said, “Why?” I said, “Can’t you go and get it?”
He said, “Well I really thought if we brought it over here, we could
put it in the shade and it might cool off, you know.” [laughter] He thought-okay, you know, get that chip off your shoulder. Right.
So sometimes I think giving people the benefit of the doubt is a good
thing, and then if you run into actual prejudice then you have three choices.
You can ignore it as my father said as long as they move, you can get around
it, or you can confront it. And that’s how I grew up.
Brest: As you say, you’ve been at Stanford now for a long time.
Rice: [00:42:12] Thirty-five years.
Brest: What strikes you as the most important changes over that time?
Rice: [00:42:23] Yes. Well, the campus is amazing. I think Stanford’s DNA is just
really good. The ability to live in the world of ideas and knowledge but also
not to be afraid of the real world and translation, whether it’s translational
medicine or the companies that we’ve helped, you know, that we’ve built
with Stanford technology, to people who go in and out of public service.
You’ve got three sitting former Secretaries of State and Defense right here
and the Secretary of Energy. And it’s just--Stanford’s got good DNA for the
modern world. It’s a modern university. That just keeps growing and getting

72

better. It’s a wonderful place. It’s distinctive because of its athletics and I
think that’s just growing and getting better. I worry about the echo effect
around certain views.
I do think we’re becoming more closed off, and I know conservative
students who tell me they don’t feel comfortable saying what they really
think, that they feel ostracized, or they feel that they will be put down for
saying things that they believe. I thought the stuff after Trump was elected
was ridiculous. You know, people who were going into the vapors, right. I
didn’t vote for him. I didn’t particularly want him to be president, but he’s
President of the United States. So you lost an election, get over it, you know.
I just thought that the kind of catering to that--it was just silly. But I’ve
already told you, I have very different views about prejudice and how to
handle it. And my parents were always of the view that if you allowed
yourself to be cast as a victim, you’d lost control of your future.
I think we are in danger of infantilizing our students and trying to tell
them that the world should be perfect, and they’re going to walk out that
door with their diploma and they’re going to find that the world isn’t perfect.
That’s a trend I don’t like. But Stanford’s no worse than any university. It’s
probably a little bit better than most. But universities, in general, have a
problem in this regard.
Brest: What were the most important moments or events for you personally at
Stanford?
Rice: [00:45:03] At Stanford. Being asked to come to Stanford. [laughter] I came
here on a fellowship and I remember I was going to start the fellowship in

73

January of 1981. And I came in November of 1980 just to meet the people at
the Arms Control and Disarmament Program because they were having a
conference and they invited me out to come to the conference. And I stayed
at the Faculty Club. And I walked along the colonnade from the Faculty Club
over to Galvez House, you know, which is where the Alumni Center is now.
And I remember thinking, “Wow, I’m going to get to spend a year at
Stanford.” When I was asked to join the faculty, I remember thinking, “I
can’t believe this is happening. I’m going to be a faculty member at
Stanford.”
I walked the same colonnade to go to talk to Heinz Eulau in Building
160, which was Political Science at the time. So fast forward and I went to
see Gerhard when he asked me to be provost and I walked that same
colonnade. It was like a flashback, you know, to this twenty-five-year-old
who had suddenly found herself at Stanford and now she was going to be
provost in the university. You couldn’t make it up. Right? [laughter] You just
couldn’t make it up. I’ve just had so many great moments at Stanford. This
place is so much a part of me and I’m so much a part of it. When I was
getting ready to leave government this last time, I think it was December--so
you’re not supposed to seek your next job while you’re in government but
everybody kind of does.
So I called Etchemendy and I said, “Etch, I can’t really formally have
a conversation about this, but you know I’m coming back to Stanford. I
know I’m coming back to Stanford. I’m not going to try to negotiate. Just tell

74

me what you think is fair but don’t tell me till January 20th.” [laughter] And
so, you know, that’s how I feel about this place.
Brest: Would you be willing to comment on the current political situation?
Rice: [00:47:39] You know, I think it’s settling down actually. In my area, in
national security, it’s a really good team. Rex Tillerson is going to be a great
Secretary of State. Jim Mattis, who’s been here at Hoover, is going to be a
really great Secretary of Defense. They have a great National Security
Advisor in H. R. McMaster [Herbert Raymond McMaster]. The decisions the
President’s taken, the national security--you know, it’s rocky times early but
every, every White House is rocky at the beginning. And these are folks who’ve
never been in government and so it’s not surprising that they didn’t quite
know what they were doing when they got there. But they’re getting their
footing. I don’t agree with the President about a lot of things, but on foreign
policy, I’m finding myself pretty much in agreement with him these days.
Brest: Let me go back and see what else I left out. I actually had wanted to ask how
you and Randy [Randy Bean]-Rice: [00:48:58] --got to know each other?
Brest: Yes.
Rice: [00:49:00] So Randy was a Knight Fellow, the professional journalism fellows
program [John S. Knight Journalism Fellowships at Stanford]. John Lewis
over at Arms Control had wanted to do some work on public outreach about
arms control issues and he asked the Knight Fellows people if there was any
journalist who might be interested in doing like a year’s fellowship and doing
it. Randy was one of the people they recommended because she’d been a

75

television producer. And so she had a one-year fellowship at the Arms
Control Center my second year there--1982. And we started talking one day
about the fact that both of our fathers were ministers--hers was Episcopal,
mine Presbyterian--and that our fathers had taught us to love sports.
It was getting time to get Stanford football tickets, and we didn’t have
anybody to go with so we bought football tickets together, and that’s how we
started being friends. And we became great friends after that around sports
and other things. We always laugh because Randy’s to the left of Lenin
politically. I mean, we couldn’t be more politically different, but it doesn’t
matter. We’re really great friends.
Brest: I think that I’ve gone through all of the things that I had notes about. So
now it’s free associate. Tell me about anything I should have asked you about
and didn’t.
Rice: [00:50:40] No, I think you did a great job but the question you asked me
about Stanford and [important moments for me]-This place is incredibly special and I’m glad you’re doing the oral
histories because I think universities, in general, are wonderful because
they’re intergenerational. You’ve got the bright young eighteen-year-old and
you’ve got the sixty-year-old Nobel laureate and they’re in the same space,
and wonderful things happen when they are. Anne Krueger, who was a
professor of economics here, had been the chief economist at the World
Bank and she’s now retired. Anne turned eighty and SIEPR, the Economics
center [Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research], had a dinner for
her and I went to it.

76

Not only were many of her students there but so were two of her
professors--Ken Arrow, who died recently, and Ted Anderson, both great
economists. And I thought, what other place do you have that kind of
continuity? And I think universities are also gentle about aging. Too many of
our institutions, particularly in America where it’s kind of always the next
young thing, don’t value longevity of interest and commitment and, in that
sense, loyalty. And here--all universities are that way but this one in
particular--maybe it’s because we have the housing area, you know, and
everybody lives in the area or whatever, but you just see people around.
I realize now that I’m moving into the senior statesperson part, you
know, when I used to be the baby here, and I see people who I looked up to
and they’re still around and they’re still active and they still come to their
offices and I just think it’s great. I wish society were more that way.
Brest: When you came here, you had no intention to be an academic.
Rice: [00:52:55] No. I thought that I would most likely go to work in defense
industry or for Rand. I was offered a job at Rand and I thought I might do
that. I’d been an intern at Rand and then I was offered a job so I was going
to finish my PhD and go back to Rand or maybe to this other defense think
tank called Science Applications. That was my thinking. I had been on
college campuses practically all my life. My father became dean of students at
Stillman when I was eleven, then worked his way up through the ranks at the
University of Denver.
So I’d been on college campuses, around them, but in many ways my
image of what an academic was was my Aunt Theresa [Angela Theresa Rice

77

Love] who got her PhD at the University of Wisconsin in 1952 in Victorian
literature and wrote books on Dickens. I remember visiting her when she
was a professor, first at Southern, the historically black college, then at
Norfolk State and then later at the University of Illinois, Edwardsville. And
so when I was about seven or eight, we visited her in Louisiana and she was
sitting in her study and she was reading A Tale of Two Cities.
And I said, “Oh, Aunt Theresa. What is that book about?” And she
described a little bit. And I said, “Well, have you read it? It sounds like you’ve
read it before.”
And she said, “I have read this book twenty-five times.”
And I thought, “Wow, reading the same book twenty-five times.
That’s really, really bad.” [laughter] That was kind of my image of what
academics did. They read the same book twenty-five times. But she was a
Dickens scholar so, of course, she read the book twenty-five times. So I
didn’t have any great desire to be an academic. I wasn’t at all sure I would
like teaching. I knew I liked research but I figured I would do that at a place
like Rand. But within a very short period of time, when Stanford offered me
the job, I thought well, [Stanford gives you a job], you should give it a try.
Right? And within a very short period of time, I realized it was what I was
meant to do even though my first class--. A little Stanford history-So I started teaching in January of 1982, even though I technically
joined the faculty in September of 1981, because they gave me a quarter off
first. They very often do that with faculty coming in. Heinz Eulau had asked
me what was I going to teach. And when you’re coming out of graduate

78

school, you basically can teach your dissertation and not much else. So I said
I’d teach Civil Military Relations. He said, “Fine. Well, and what else?” I said
I would teach Soviet policy in what we used to call the “Third World.” I
could do that. I had no idea I needed three. And so he said, “Can you teach
Political Elites?” I said sure. I had no idea what he’s talking about but I said
“sure.” He then said, “Well maybe we could teach it together.” So I cotaught it with him. It was a great act of mentorship by Heinz. So comes
January of 1982 and they’ve forgotten to list my class in Civil Military
Relations. So they quickly listed it. I got six students who signed up. And
they also didn’t have a classroom for me. So I taught in Old Chem my first
course [laughter] with the sliding blackboards and all that. That was my first
teaching experience at Stanford.
Brest: Did you like teaching to a really small group?
Rice: [00:56:48] I did. It was great. They were almost as old as I was. They were all
seniors and I was like twenty-six. A couple of those kids I actually stayed in
touch with. They’re not kids anymore but yes, it was great. It was great, but it
was just kind of funny that that was the way I started out.
Brest: Now that I think about it, the course that you’re teaching now with the fivepage paper every week from every student, how many students?
Rice: [00:57:19] Twenty-five.
Brest: Oh.
Rice: [00:57:20] Yes. [laughter] Twenty-five. I get about 120 or so applications and
I would say about half of those are actually qualified in terms of having the

79

right background and so forth. And then they all write an essay. And so I
choose twenty-five out of that group.
Brest: You also teach a course at the Business School?
Rice: [00:57:49] A Political Risk course with Amy Zegart. And then there’s a
course that is not actually core but a lot of MBA students take it called
Strategy Beyond Markets that Kate Casey teaches, and I teach with her in a
couple of sessions of that course. And then this quarter I also have an
Honors Colloquium with a group of students who are studying Grand
Strategy.
Brest: Oh my goodness.
Rice: [00:58:16] I like to teach. I never quite understood people who didn’t want to
teach at universities. It’s sort of a strange thing to be in a university and not
want to teach.
Brest: Thank you so much.
Rice: [00:58:30] I’m so glad you did it. Thank you.
Brest: Extreme pleasure.
Rice: [00:58:35] Thanks for thinking of me.
