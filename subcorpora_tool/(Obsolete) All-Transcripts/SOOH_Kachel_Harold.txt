 Wilson  Kachel  Today is February 1, 2012. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I   m in Beaver, Oklahoma today at the Jones and  Plummer Trail Museum, and I   m interviewing Dr. Harold Kachel as  part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project.  We are joined  by Dr. Pauline Hodges and Dr. Jennifer Paustenbaugh.  Thank you for  meeting with me today.  Very pleased to do so.  Well, to start out, would you mind telling me when and where you were  born?  I was born south of Beaver in a sod house, and a Dr. Smith came out and  delivered us at the house January 25, 1928. And the sod house   I was  the only family member born in Beaver County of my family. The rest  of the family had been born in Major County, but they were also all born  in sod houses. So when we moved out here, my folks, they built a sod  house, and I was born in a sod house with the rest of my family.  How many brothers and sisters did you have?  I had one brother and two living sisters, and I had two sisters that died in  Major County when they were quite young. But my older sister just died  last year. She was 102, so we must be on kind of a gene that   s long  lived.  Where was she living?  She started working here in Beaver at the courthouse, and then during  the war her and her husband moved to Wichita and he worked for Beech  Aircraft. And then in recent years, her daughter moved her to Denver,  5  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  and she was in a nursing home in Denver where she finally died.  Well, how did your family come to settle in Beaver?  They   d moved to Major County and I guess they were tired of clearing  blackjacks, because Dad said he wanted to farm, and he was tired of  those trees coming up every year and having to cut them down. So he  had a chance to rent a quarter south of Beaver, and they moved out here  in 1917. He rented a place called the Baer Place for a while, and then  they got a chance to buy the quarter that they were renting, so they built  a sod house. And in, I think it was 1921 or 1922, they moved to the sod  house on our original home place.  Did they meet in Kansas?  My folks actually met in Major County, and there were two families.  Well, there were several families that moved, they all kind of moved  together. My mother   s maiden name was Bukowski, and they were  married in Major County.  What did your father do for a living?  He was a farmer. He ran cattle, raised wheat. At first, they raised a lot of  broom corn. That was a cash crop, seemed to be broom corn. Along with  broom corn was the wheat and he offset that with maize, milo, they  called it kaffir corn, and crook neck maize. He raised cattle, he had hogs,  and of course, early, he had horses. That   s what they farmed with until  they finally got a tractor. But he had all types of animals,  and  he took  good care of them. He was quite a farmer.  Well, how long did you live in the sod house?  For about a year, and then they attached a wooden house or a frame  house to it. So we moved up. (Laughter)  Were you still using the part that was the sod house later?  Yes, the sod house was there, and they used it for storage for a number  of years. I can remember going back into the sod house and in the  windows, there were black widow spiders. But the folks wouldn   t kill  them because they said they kept the flies down. (Laughter) But they  used it for storage for a number of years after we moved in the wooden  house or the frame house. I think it had three rooms in it, if I remember  the frame house. We were uptown.  My older sister, Letha, tells about the first time she saw a car coming.  6  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Our house was kind of at the top of a small hill, and she said she heard  that thing a-coming and saw it, and she didn   t know what it was. So she  put me and my brother and my older sister under the bed to protect us  from whatever that thing was that came up the hill. And it turned out to  be a first car she ever saw, a Model-T. One of the things that scared her  was, it was coming down the hill, but it couldn   t go up the hill. So they  turned around and backed up the hill. I guess that was kind of common  for those Model-Ts, but at least that had her really worried, because that  thing was coming backwards from when she first saw it. (Laughter) So  she put us under the bed to protect us, in the early years. I don   t  remember what else she did, but I remember being put under the bed for  some reason.  Wow. (Laughs) Well, what were some of your chores growing up?  Basically, my first chore was to gather the eggs. Folks had a number of  chickens, and I can remember that if the big door wasn   t open, there was  a small door where the chickens came in and out, and I   d go out there  and crawl through that small door to go in and gather the eggs and put  them in a basket and take to the house. And then, of course, in later  years my chore was   eventually, we moved to a farm near Balko,  Oklahoma, and there my chore was to be sure that the coal and wood  was in the house, get it ready to fire up the next morning, start the fire if  I got up early. But normally I didn   t start the fire. I just got it ready to be  started.  The other chore that I had was to go get the milk cows and make sure  they were driven into the barn. And later, I was given the right to milk a  few when I finally got strong enough that I could milk the cows. In the  Balko area, I started to school in a one-room school, and it was about a  mile and three-quarters from our house, so I rode a horse down to the  school. And the horse, in the evening, all you had to do was turn him  loose and hold on because he would go home as fast as he could run. In  the wintertime, I can remember taking some feed to the barn, they had a  little barn there, putting the feed in for him so he could eat during the  day. But for two years, I rode a horse to school.  Did many other kids ride horses?  There were two or three. I think there were four horses there normally,  that the children rode to school.  And how far was that?  About a mile and three-quarters from our house that I rode on it.  7  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  So you started to school in Balko?  No, it was the Barker District. It was called Possum Trot. It was actually  the Barker District, but the school was called Possum Trot. But it was a  one-room school.  Do you know where it got that name, Possum Trot?  Apparently, it was near Clear Creek, the old part of Clear Creek. And  apparently, there was some possums that would come up to Clear Creek  and eventually, somehow end up around there, I guess. I don   t know.  But at least they called it Possum Trot. So, apparently, a possum had  been there at some time or other. But there were possums in the area at  that time, a number of them.  How many kids did you go to school with?  At that school there were eight grades, probably there were fifteen or  twenty children at the time. And then the Balko District bought school  buses. And to help pay for the school buses, they talked several of the  little districts around to join them, become part of the Balko District, or  at least join them. So our district transferred us kids to Balko, and we got  to ride a school bus. Now, the school bus was an International ton-and-a-half  truck with a wooden box put on the back, a one-bench seat down the  middle, and bench seats along the side. You got to jostle in that thing for  an hour and a half going to school, because I was normally the first  student on and the last student off, riding that school bus.  But we did get to go to a big school, Balko. I think it had four rooms at  the time. It even had heat inside, a furnace in the basement. Now, that  was something, to go to a school that had heat. Then one storm came  through when we were isolated at the school for about three days. We  couldn   t go home, so one of the ladies across the street fixed us lunch,  served us meals. If I remember right, they separated out the boys in one  room and the girls in another, and we stayed in school at night to keep  warm. Finally, they turned us loose   or didn   t turn us loose, they had  our folks come and get us, but it was one of the storms in the    30s.  So it was a big blizzard?  Yes, it was one of the bigger blizzards that killed a lot of   I can  remember it killing a lot of the livestock, and one of our neighbors froze  to death in it. He was trying to take care of his cattle, and they found him  in Clear Creek. He had tried to cross Clear Creek and fell through the  snow where it drifted and froze to death. That was in one of the storms.  8  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Well, when do you remember the dust starting up?  The dust started in the early    30s,    33,    34, and    35, and    36 got pretty  bad. But the one they normally talk about, if I have my thoughts in  order, I believe that Dad and I had gone hunting that morning   yes, to  hunt rabbits. We ate a lot of rabbits during that time period, especially if  we could find cottontails. They seemed to like the cottontails better. But  we were hunting, and that afternoon we   d gone back to the house and  Dad saw that thing coming, and he said,    There   s a storm coming, and  that one   s going to be bad.     So I can remember him getting us into the cellar. He took the family to  the cellar, and we stayed through that storm, Black Sunday, in a cellar.  The dust, you couldn   t breathe. Mother had rags soaked with water and  put over our faces, so we could kind of breathe. After it was over with,  then the next morning I was out getting the cattle in. We had a rather  large barn, and on the south side of that barn, the thing that impressed  me the most was the number of dead birds that was along that south side.  I guess, I don   t know whether they suffocated or static electricity or  what, but there were a number of birds, and that always bothered me,  why they died during that period.  Were they all types of bird?  All kinds of birds. You could see them coming in before the storm. They  were trying to fly before the storm, so you knew they were coming  through. But I don   t know whether they suffocated or what. It might  have been suffocation on a lot of them because at that time, some of the  storms   Dad had planted a field of wheat right north of the house and it  had came up, and we had cattle out on it. And I   d go with my dad to  catch the baby calves and clean their nostrils out with dirt, so they  wouldn   t suffocate. So they would get enough dirt in their nostrils that  they would just suffocate if you didn   t clean it out. I can remember  helping him clean out those calves    nostrils, so they wouldn   t die.  How would you clean them out?  You   d just catch them and dig it out. (Laughter) That   s the only way you  could. But I guess it saved a few calves, because we did it several times.  Walking in that wheat field, it was really dusty, and then when it did  blow, just that much more dirt would come.  Did the government eventually ever come and purchase your cattle?  Yes. I can remember the people coming, and my dad had put the cattle  in the barn. We had one old roan bull that I was kind of proud of. He  9  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  was kind of my buddy. But I went to the house, and I heard a shot and I  knew that he was gone. And they shot several, but that one bull kind of  impressed me because he   I don   t know, you get attached to those  sometimes. He wasn   t afraid of me and I wasn   t afraid of him, but I  remember him being shot. They killed several of the cattle during that  time period, they sure did.  Then what happened to them?  I don   t remember. I didn   t go out there, but I suspect they hauled them  off or drug them off someplace. A lot of the neighbors lost cattle to the  government. They just killed them. They just shot them.  Do you remember much conversation with your parents during that time  about the cattle being shot or other things going on?  No, I really don   t because they kept that to themselves. They didn   t talk  much around us kids. It was just part of it. We didn   t lose our farm or  anything, but I found out later, years later, that my sister that worked at  the courthouse here in Beaver paid our taxes. So we didn   t lose any of  the farm or anything, but it was because of her, because she paid the  taxes on the farm to keep it going during that time period. I did find that  out later on.  The storms   well, it   s been told and told again, but you could see them  rolling in and the different colors of dirt. You could almost tell where it  was coming from, whether it was coming from Kansas or Colorado or  the Oklahoma Panhandle by the color of the dirt and the way it would  roll in. Amazing. You kind of wonder how as many people lived as they  did and made it through it. Of course, we were pretty much on the  eastern edge of it, basically, of most of the storms. And I don   t  remember anybody in our area having dust pneumonia, but they  probably did. But I don   t remember or I didn   t know of anyone that had  dust pneumonia in our area. Some probably did, but I don   t remember  any.  Was there much discussion when the storms first started about what was  going on?  Yes, but they finally realized that it was going to blow. There wasn   t any  rain, and there was going to be dust. I think the big one, of course, was  the one that surprised most of them, because that morning it was a clear  and nice and pretty Sunday morning. But that thing, when it rolled in, it  came in and it was black.  Did you have many neighbors or friends that headed out? That took off?  10  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  In our area   well, we lived in a German settlement, and as far as I  remember, there wasn   t any of the Germans that left. They stayed. They  figured out some way to pay the taxes and stayed. My folks had friends  that left, but in our general area I don   t remember any of the people  leaving. They were all German stock or Bohemian. They pretty well  stayed. I just don   t remember any of them leaving.  So who in your family came from Germany? Was it your grandparents?   It would have  been my great-great-grandparents that came from  Germany.  Do you know what area of Germany they came from?  No, not really. All I know is that they came into Pennsylvania, and then  from Pennsylvania to Kansas. And from Kansas, my folks came to  Oklahoma.  And in the German settlement, were there a lot of other Germans?  Yes, there were quite a few Germans, and there are still a number of  Germans in the area. You get around southwest of Balko into the  Anthony community and that area and southwest of Balko, those are  German settlements in there. You can almost tell a German settlement  for the Germans usually, for the most part, the first building they built  was the barn, and they put it on the highest part of the land that they  owned. And then if the barn paid for itself, it built the house. And most  of the German settlements in that area, if you   ll notice, the farmstead is  always built on the highest point of the land that they own.  Did you grow up speaking German at all?  No, I did not. My parents and grandparents when they got together  spoke German, but if any of us kids walked into the room, they switched  to English immediately. They would not and did not learn us any  German whatsoever. They just said,    You   re Americans, you   re going to  learn American, you   re going to learn English, and that   s it. You   re not  going to speak German.    And we didn   t. I don   t know any German. But  my parents and grandparents, you could hear them speaking German and  talking German, but if we stepped into the room that was the end of it.  They switched to English.  Did you attend church when you were young?  Yes, we went to a little church called Capitol View, which was about  11  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  five miles from our home place when we moved to Balko area called  Capitol View. It   s right northwest of Elmwood about three miles, the  town of Elmwood, a little break in the woods called Elmwood right now.  There   s nothing there  where the church was  but a graveyard now. We  went to there and when my folks didn   t go, I can remember riding a  horse with my brother, and we   d ride a horse over to the church.  But it wasn   t a German church?  No, it was open. No, it wasn   t Mennonite or anything like that.  Did your parents have many German cultural traits that they maintained  from their parents and their grandparents?  Not too many. They switched to English as much as possible. It was all  English. Probably, the meals were probably more German than anything.  We ate a lot of sauerkraut. I can remember my mother making mash. I  guess it was out of cornmeal. But anyway, it was cooked in the  afternoon, and that evening we ate the mash. It was with milk and sugar,  and usually bread or something with it. But the next morning that stuff  would gel and she would slice it and fry it. So we had mash fried the  next morning with eggs or bacon or whatever they had. But we had a lot  of   we ate a lot of that mash stuff, I know that.  Was it good?  Sure, it was good. It was something to eat. (Laughter) Yes. And one of  the other dishes that my mother made a lot was sauerkraut and weenies.  I tried that on my wife and that didn   t work. She wouldn   t eat the  sauerkraut. She might eat a weenie once in a while, but not that  sauerkraut. (Laughter)  Did your mother make noodles?  Yes, we had a lot of noodles. There was noodles with everything. When  we were at the farm near Balko during the    30s, one incident that was  kind of impressive, or impressed me, there were a lot of English  sparrows. And our neighbor to the south, his name was Doc Tice, and  we had a group of sparrows that would fly between their place and our  place. There were probably fifty or sixty in the bunch, and they became  a hazard. So one time, they decided to land on a fence. They   d come to  our water tank for water, and then if they was in a group, and they  normally were, they would land on the fence, one of our garden fences,  and they   d just line up and there   d be hundreds of them   or it seemed to  me like hundreds of them. There were a lot of them would line on those  fences.  12  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  So one day, they were all lined up there. They just came from the water.  My dad went to my neighbor   s house, said,    Doc, you should come  down and bring your shotgun. We   re going to shoot some of those  English sparrows.    So he got his gun and came down. They came to the  water in the afternoon. They kind of scared them off and they went to  the fence, the garden fence, and they were all lined up. Doc Tice and my  dad, with two twelve gauge shotguns, each one fired together, and the  English sparrows just dropped to the ground. I don   t know, twenty five  or thirty of them. It was a bunch of them. And Doc said,    Well, that   ll  get rid of some of them,    and Dad said,    Well, let   s just eat them.    Doc  Tice said,    Eat them? You don   t eat English sparrows.    And Dad said,     Yes, you do. You just take the center out and just eat the meaty part,  throw the rest of it away.     So I think it was just a bluff, but anyway, they said,    All right.    So they  gathered up those English sparrows, they skinned them and took just the  breast out, took them to Mother, and I can remember she put them in salt  water for about two or three hours. The neighbor finally went and got his  wife and came back, and the two women fried those English sparrows  up, and we had English sparrows for supper, with gravy. They were kind  of tough, but they ate them. And I asked Dad later, I said,    What was  that?    And he said,    Oh, just joking him around a little bit,    but said,     We ate them,    and we did. English sparrows.  What about desserts? Were there any sweets that you remember?  If we had any, I don   t remember much except just wild plums, plum  butter. Once in a while, they would find some grapes along Clear Creek  or the Beaver Sand Hills and pick the wild grapes, and we   d have grape  jelly. But I don   t remember any sweets much, just the plum butter, plum  jelly. There were times when they would take the remains of the plums  and they   d put it out to dry in a batter-type and when it dried, they called  it plum leather. And you could kind of eat it. It would be like jerky now,  but they called it plum leather, and we ate plum leather some. That was  from the leftover plum jelly stuff.  Did you have many other family members, like cousins or aunts or  uncles, living in the area?  My father had one uncle, Uncle Henry Kachel, that lived northwest. He  lived west of the Anthony area. So we did visit back and forth some with  them, yes. Other than that, there was only one cousin, and that was  Walter Parks up near Turpin. And that was about the only relation that  we had in this area.  13  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  So how would you celebrate Christmas?  Well, our Christmas, normally, they was pretty light. I usually got some  kind of a present, but it was always from my sister that worked at the  courthouse here in Beaver and then later when they moved to Wichita.  They always came home. The family always came together for  Christmas, and they   d always have some kind of presents. But my main  present always came from my sister. She was the one that made sure we  got something.  Was there a Christmas gathering in town, at church, or at the school?  I don   t remember my folks going to any gatherings at the church for  Christmas, but there was always a Christmas party at the school. They  always made the school Christmas parties. We were normally in some  little old play or something, so they came to see us perform.  So was Balko a pretty thriving town?  Well, one time, it was rather large. By rather large, I mean it had a bank  and a filling station. I believe there was a drugstore, general store. But I  transferred then from the second grade to Balko and went to the Balko  school in grade school. I graduated from the Balko school in 1942, and  in that year Balko High School disbanded. They quit having high school  in 1942 for a while, so our district was still an independent district from  Balko, and our district voted to send the kids that was in our district,  called Baker, to Beaver. So in 1942, then I transferred to Beaver to go to  school and graduated from Beaver High School.  And what year did you graduate Beaver High School?  1946.  So did you move at that point, or did your family still live in the same  location?  No, we still lived in the same place. When I went to school up here they  just simply rented a room for me, and I stayed in a room. Of course, we  ate the morning meal with whoever we stayed with. They paid them for  my rent, and I stayed during the week. And then that evening I   d ride a  bus, and the bus came within three miles of home, so I did walk home  usually. They very seldom ever came and got me. But I stayed in town  during the school season.  How old were you when you first got a job?  14  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  How old was I? My, gosh  (Laughs) Growing up on the farm, you  always had a job. I can remember I was driving a tractor in the field by  myself when I was ten. When Dad got a tractor, he gave up the horses.  But he didn   t want to drive that tractor or learn how to drive a tractor, so  my brother and I learned how to drive a tractor, and we drove the tractor.  Dad never would drive the tractor. He just never moved from the horses  to the mechanical thing. The first combine that he bought, I had to learn  how to run the combine because he wouldn   t run it.  What kind of tractor was the first tractor?  It was an International F-20 was our first tractor, on steel. Jar you to  pieces. You   d come in looking like a Negro by the evening, you was just  black as you can be. But it was a tractor. You didn   t have to fiddle with  the horses.  Well, when you moved into Beaver for high school, did you get a job  then, or did you go home and work on the farm on the weekends?  No, always went home and worked on the farm. During that time period  to make extra money for myself, I trapped animals. Skunks, sold a lot of  rabbit hides, badger, civit cat, that type of thing.  Who would you sell them to?  There was a fur buyer that came to Beaver once a week on the weekends  and bought furs.  Do you remember how much you   d get for them?  I got twenty-five cents for the rabbits, because I   d skin them and stretch  the hides, and seemed like it would be two or three dollars for the  skunks. But that was a lot of money in that day. That would last me all  week or all month, if I could get a few of the animals in the traps. But I  made my spending money by trapping while I was in high school.  Well, what did you do after you graduated high school?  Got a letter from my uncle, and he said that he wanted to see me. And I  could either volunteer and have a chance at the service I wanted to go  into, or I could just wait until they called me and I   d go into the Army.  So I and four of my buddies volunteered for the Air Force. Two of us  made it into the Air Force, one was sent back home, and the other one  was in the Army. So I got to travel worldwide at the government   s  expense.  15  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  How long did you do that?  I was in from 1947 to1949, just a little over two years.  Mostly overseas?  Yes. I was stationed in Tokyo, Japan, at Haneda International Airport. I  volunteered for the Air Force and got into the ATC, the Air Transport  Command. The Air Transport Command is the one that hauled all the  equipment, people, anything that moved by air went by Air Transport  Command. I did make it into the Air Transport Command division and  was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron in Tokyo,  Japan. The Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron was the one that  handled all the mail. Everything that went through came through our  office. I was eventually cleared for top secret material, and I was  quarantined for a month while they was checking me out. They talked to  all the neighbors around my folks about what I was up to and this sort of  thing. My mother wrote me a letter, said,    I don   t know what it is you   re  doing, but you   ve sure got the neighbors upset. Every time the FBI talks  to them, they   ll call me and say,    Now, what   s that kid done now?       And  she didn   t know. She said,    Well, it   s something to do with his job.     But I had to fill out   or attempted to fill out, I remember a seventeen-page  inquiry from the FBI, went back as far as I can remember and all of  this, and then what I could get my folks to write and tell me about. I was  finally approved so that I did get to handle top secret material in  Headquarters and Headquarters Squadron. Now, to follow that up a little  bit, my youngest daughter married an FBI agent, and she called me and  she said,    Dad, I   ve got an FBI form here that I   ve got to fill out.    I said,     How many pages is it? About fifteen or seventeen pages?    She said,     Yes, how   d you know?    And I said,    Well, I filled one out when I was  in Japan.    I said,    Instead of me repeating all that stuff, you just have  your husband bring my record up and it   ll all be there.    And she did, and  it cleared her.  Oh, wow. (Laughs)  So they keep up with you. I   m telling you.  Did you know a lot of people from this area that went into the service?  Yes, I knew a lot of people. But when I went in, the war wasn   t  officially over yet. So I am classified as a WWII veteran, and that   s kind  of strange because I wasn   t really in the war, although that   s the way my  classification is. So I am a WWII veteran. And being in the Air Force,  when we shipped out, we shipped out of Seattle on a   they called it a  16  Wilson  Kachel  ship. It was more like a boat. We were issued our rifles, our gas masks,  and that sort of thing. We carried them with us all the time. But when we  shipped out, the people at Seattle took our rifles and our gas masks and  some of our equipment. They just took them. Now, when we got to  Japan, checked in, where was our gas masks, where was our rifles,  where was all our shop material? We didn   t have it. So they was going  to charge us for it.  Well, it just so happened that the whole group was   they had taken the  whole group that shipped out. There was about 1200 of us on that boat,  and they decided,    Well, surely, 1200 of them wouldn   t have thrown  their gas masks away or their rifles over the side of the boat.    So they  checked back and found out that they really had taken them away from  us in Seattle. So eventually we didn   t have to pay for that material.  (Laughs) But they was suspicious about why we didn   t have our stuff  with us. And the other thing that they took from us was our shot records.  Now, the Air Force always carried their shot records with them. So since  we didn   t have our shot records, we had to go through all the shots  again, which was about thirty-two different shots. So we   d get eight a  day until we got caught up. But after that, I made sure that my shot  record was with me all the time. We carried that shot record with us.  Did you get to do much sightseeing in Japan?  Well, there wasn   t too much sightseeing in Japan. Where we were  stationed at, Tokyo Airport at that time, called Haneda, was actually on a  manmade island in Tokyo Bay, and it was closer to Yokohama than it  was Tokyo. Now, Tokyo and Yokohama was all one. See, you didn   t  know when you got out at one or the other. But there wasn   t anything  left in the area where we were at except just smoke stacks. Everything  was burned out. There wasn   t nothing there, but we did travel some, yes.  In Tokyo, when I got to the base   the ATC people was on twenty-four  hour duty. We didn   t go like the rest of the Army. In fact, they called us,  ATC, the Air Transport Command, they called us the Air Force   s  Terrified Civilians because we were on twenty-four hour duty, and we  carried a white pass and a blue pass. Now, you weren   t supposed to have  both, but if you carried a white pass that meant you could be off base in  the daytime, and if you carried a blue pass you could be off base at  night. But you weren   t supposed to carry them both. Now, since we were  ATC people, we carried both. Sometimes, if we had some time off, we   d  go to Tokyo, go to the Ernie Pyle Theater, and usually we stopped in and  we would eat lunch or dinner somewhere in one of the approved cafes.  And if we went down before, I think it was six o   clock, we had to show  them our white pass.  17  Wilson  Kachel  Now, we were stopped one time and there were three of us together, and  we were stopped and they wanted to see our pass. We showed them our  white passes. We went and ate, we went to the Ernie Pyle Theater, and it  had three different levels of theaters, shows in it. So we went to the first  show on the first level. And well, we decided we   d just stay and see the  second one, so we went up a level and saw the second show. Now, it   s  ten thirty at night. We come out, we get stopped by the same MPs that  stopped us before. They wanted to see our passes. We showed them our  blue passes, and they said,    Wait a minute. Gentlemen, you cannot do  that. There   s something wrong here. You   re the ones that we stopped  this evening. You had white passes. Now, you   re trying to pass these  blue passes off on us? That won   t work.     So one of the boys just said,    Well, just call our CO at the base and see  when we left. He went to his little shack, called the base and I heard him  say,    Yes.    They gave our names. They said,    Yes, they checked out  about nine-thirty.    He said,    Wait a minute, we stopped them before  that. They couldn   t have checked out at nine-thirty.    He said,    That   s  what I   ve got on my records here. They checked out at nine-thirty.  They   re all right. They   ve got blue passes.    So the MPs finally figured  out if you was wearing the ATC insignia, you might as well just let them  go because we had all kinds of passes, couldn   t get them on not having  the right pass at the right time. (Laughter)  What kinds of planes would you fly?  I didn   t fly. I flew in a lot of them, but I was not a pilot. I worked in the  message center, which handled all the mail, and all the correspondence  went through our office. That   s the reason I was cleared for top secret  material. So I didn   t fly, although I was on a lot of planes that we got to  fly all over Japan and Shanghai if we had some time off. The pilots, our  squadron, I think, had sixty-six pilots and thirty-three enlisted men. I  was in enlisted personnel, so you know who did the work. But if we had  some time off, those pilots had to get in so many hours each month to  keep their flying records up. They had to get so many flying hours in, so  they were flying all the time   or would fly a lot of time. Well, when  they would get a chance to fly, their flight schedule went through our  office, so we knew where they was going and when they was leaving  and when they was coming back. If our times were off, our boss would  let us go, so we would fly with the planes.  We flew on several different types of planes. I think probably one of the  times that I remember that was kind of strange to me, there was five or  six of us that worked in the office and there were two C-47s going up at  the same time. We had some time off, so we decided to put in our  schedule to go with them, and we were approved to go with them. One  18  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  of the planes was delayed about thirty minutes, so we just split up. Three  of us went on the first plane and the other three was going on the other  plane. The first plane took off, and we were flying around Mount Fuji,  which is a large volcano. Actually, there   s two little craters there. We  were taking pictures of it and while we were flying through there, I was  sitting by one of the windows taking pictures. This stream of oil was  coming out of the back of the plane, or near the motor, coming out back  over the back of the wing, and that kind of scared me because it was a  pretty good stream of oil. Being a farmer, if you had that coming out of  your tractor, then you were worried about it.  So I went up and told the pilot, I said,    There   s oil coming out of that  thing pretty good back there.    He came back and looked at it, and he  said,    Nah, that   s just normal seepage. It   s all right.    (Laughs) But our  plane got back to the base and the other one that took off about thirty  minutes later didn   t show up. And when they found them, they were in  this little crater in Mount Fujiyama. They   d gotten too close to it and the  down draft had wrecked the plane into Mount Fujiyama.  One of the other things that   s kind of interesting, to me at least, was I   m  color blind to reds and greens. You   d think they wouldn   t accept me in  the Air Force, but I was in the Air Force. One trip, we were flying to  Southern Japan at a Kamikaze base where they had the old Kamikaze  pilots and their base. The base was underground, but their launch period  and everything was on top of the ground, and we were going down there  to look at it. We came over a range of mountains and the plane was  banking, and one of the guys said,    Well, what are we doing here?    And  I said,    We   re going to land down there, there   s the base right there.    He  looked out the window, and he said,    What are you looking at? There   s  nothing down there.    I said,    Yes, there is. You just watch. That   s where  we   re going.    Well, being camouflaged, the reds and greens they had it  painted, I could see that just as clear as a bell. I could see where the  launch pads were, the runways, and sure enough, that   s where we  landed. But the ones that had normal vision, it looked right. Looked like  just the mountains and the green trees and so forth. But that just stood  out like a sore thumb to me, being color blind.  Well, what did you do when you finished your time in the Air Force?  I came back to the farm and the two of us that actually made it back     one of my friends was   the other boy that was in the Air Force was in  the 101 Airborne division and he was killed in Japan. When I got back,  there were two of us that made it back, and we decided to go to school.  So I went to Panhandle State University on the GI Bill.  What was your friend   s name that made it back?  19  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Marvin Pierce.  Did he go to Panhandle also?  Yes. Yes, he went to school.  So did you move out there?  Yes. We lived in one of the dorms at Panhandle State. It was an old  barracks from the Air Force base in Texas. Dalhart had an Air Force  base and when it shut down, the college moved all the barracks up there,  and they turned one of the barracks into a veteran   s barracks, called  Spacious Hall. I stayed in Spacious Hall, which was a military   all the  people in there, we were all military people. But they called it Spacious  Hall.  How was the atmosphere on campus with all of the returned veterans?  Well, at that time, we didn   t have any trouble. We had a dean of  students, Helen Muller, that was something else. She took the veterans  in under her wing like we was part of the family. She looked after us.  She really did. She made sure we was up and to class, she knew what we  was doing, what we ought to be doing. She knew how to tell us what to  do and when to do it, and she did. She didn   t make any bones about it.  How old were you when you started to college?  Gosh, I would have been twenty, I guess.  So you were still pretty young.  Well, I thought I was grown up. (Laughter)  What did you study?  I started in industrial arts, or shop. They called it shop. It was called  industrial arts technology was my major in the BS degree in industrial  arts technology.  Did you know that   s what you wanted to do from the beginning?  Yes, I think so. When I was here in high school, my shop teacher   I  took shop here in high school and I enjoyed it, working in machinery  with saws and stuff. And while I was going to college, I worked at a  cabinet shop in Wichita, stayed with my sister and worked at a cabinet  20  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  shop in Wichita, designed furniture for them and did some   just worked  in the cabinet shop building. Usually, I worked on specialized designs,  specialized furniture that he got.  Was that just in the summers?  Yes, just in the summers.  Would you visit your parents very often while you were in college?  Yes, pretty regular. I came home pretty regular.  Did you still help out on the farm at that point?  Yes, during the summer most of the time. After I got out of college, my  parents kind of quit farming and I took the farm over after I got out of  college. But during the college years, the farm, I think   most of the  farm was in the early CRP  Conservation Reserve Program . They had  an early CRP. They didn   t call it CRP then, but whatever it was, same  thing. My dad had put all the land back into CRP because I wasn   t there  to help, and he didn   t want to run any of the machinery. My brother was  crippled, and so he didn   t do a lot of the work. But after I graduated  from college, then you had to plow up the old CRP stuff, get it back into  farm ground. The CRP we have now is a new type of program.  So what year did you graduate from Panhandle?  1952.  And then you went back to the farm for a bit?  No, not really. (Laughter) When I graduated from college, I went into  the education department to be a teacher. And for some reason, I had to  do my practice teaching at the college level instead of the high school  level. I never could figure out why, but I was doing one at that period  that went through the teacher education program and taught my practice  teaching at the college level. And when I finished that I started teaching  industrial arts and sciences at a school called Yarbrough School, south  of Elkhart, Kansas. I was there for five years total, but the fourth year I  was there, the president of the college came out, handed me a sheet of  paper, and he said,    Sign this.    And I said,    Well, Dr. McKee, what is  it?    He said,    Well, it   s a contract.    I said,    Well, what   s it for?    And he  said,    You   re going to start teaching back at the college next year.    And  I said,    Well, I can   t leave now.    He said,    No, it   s next year.     So I looked at the contract and it was for the next year, so I went ahead  21  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  and signed a contract to start teaching back at the college, and this was  in 1956. I started teaching back in 1957 at the college. And then is when  I figured out that between the president of the college and my major  advisor at the college that he was planning ahead, and as soon as he  retired, I was to replace him. So that   s the reason I think I did my  practice teaching at the college instead of at the high school like the rest  of them did.  He was really planning ahead.  He was. He finally admitted that he was planning ahead, pretty much,  but he never would really tell me. But between I and Pauline Hodges, I  think we finally figured out that   s exactly what was going on.  Well, when did you meet your wife?  Met my wife while I was probably a senior in college, coming home on  the weekends. She was going to Stillwater at the time, and I knew of her  is about all. But she   d come home on the weekends and sometimes I   d  be home on the weekends, and we finally started dating. The year she  graduated from Oklahoma State University with a degree in Home Ec, I  started my master   s down there at Oklahoma State University. So we got  to see each other rather frequently, and then I waited until after I  finished my master   s before we got married, and this was in 1955. I went  back then to the Yarbrough school, I was still at the Yarbrough school  that year, became principal of the school, and my wife, Joan, was the  superintendent   s secretary. So she practically ran the school. (Laughter)  Most secretaries do. They don   t admit it, but they do. She was also my  secretary at the time, but we don   t talk about that. (Laughter)  How many years were you principal?  Just one year. I   d already signed a contract to start teaching back at the  college, so I was just principal for one year.  So you were principal at Yarbrough for a year, and then moved back to  Panhandle State to teach.  Yes.  And so did you and your wife move to Goodwell at that point?  Yes. We moved back to Goodwell, and Marvin McKee had an apartment  picked out for us. It turned out to be our kitchen was my old room in  Spacious Hall. (Laughter)  22  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  No way  (Laughs)  Yes  I couldn   t believe it. He took us over there and said,    This is your  apartment here, this third apartment.    I walked in and said,    My gosh,  Doc, this is my old room.    (Laughter) Our kitchen was my old room.  Wow. So were there two bedrooms in the apartment, then, and then a  kitchen and living room?  Yes, yes. It was small, but it was nice. At least, I thought it was.  Was it right near the campus?  Yes, it was part of the campus.  So you could just walk?  Yes, yes. The building right across from us was the infirmary, and it had  teachers in it as well, but it was the infirmary for the college, it was  another old Army barracks they moved in.  Well, had the college changed much from the time you were a student to  when you started teaching? There weren   t a whole lot of years there,  but...  From the time I was a student until I got back, no. No, nothing really had  changed at all. There wasn   t any new buildings or anything like that, but  then they started building more buildings. North Hall, Field Hall was a  new dorm. They built a student union and the museum was up and  running then, in pretty good shape. But all the old Army barracks and  everything basically was still there when I moved back, yes.  When did the museum open?  1934, I think. At least, that   s when it started. It had been there   the new  building that   s there now, I don   t remember when it did start. 1950 is  when they moved into it, in the new museum.  What all did you teach?  Well, I started out back teaching the industrial arts. They called it  technology, they wanted to call it technology. I still called it shop or  industrial arts. And when I finished my doctorate degree, they  immediately moved me into the education department, and I taught  teacher education classes   crafts, history, and philosophy of teacher  education for most of the departments. I   ve worked my way up through,  23  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  I was instructor and associate and assistant, finally became full  professor. And I was head of the Industrial Arts, Home Ec, and Business  Departments for a while, had all three divisions under me. And then  years later, became Registrar, and then I retired to the first Vice  President of Academic Administration. So I kind of went from the low  totem pole to almost the high. In fact, I was acting president for a day or  two. (Laughter) But when you   re acting president when the president   s  gone, I   ll tell you who does the work, and that   s the secretary. She  answers the phone and if there   s any questions that come in, I don   t  answer them, she does. She makes the decisions.  What year did you retire?  1995 is when I actually retired, I guess.  And you got your PhD in Colorado?  I have an EdD at University of Northern Colorado.  Did you move to Colorado to go to school there?  No, I didn   t move there, but we spent ten summers there going to school.  The thing that got me to Northern Colorado was one of the professors  when I was an undergraduate talked about Northern Colorado. And the  people at Northern Colorado started to try to attract more veterans. They  started a program toward a doctorate degree and it was summers only,  but you had to go eight summers straight to get it, plus two more. And so  I thought,    Well, that would work out just right,    because our president  at the time encouraged us to go back.  So I started the program. I think there were sixty of us that started the  program. The second year there was thirty, and I think out of that group  there were four of us that actually graduated under that program, the     summers only    program. Their idea was, if they were going to teach  history and philosophy of industrial arts or technology, then they  brought in the expert from across the country somewhere, all the  colleges. So we took classes under, normally, the head of the department  of University of Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas A M, Oregon State,  Oregon University, Oklahoma State, Oklahoma University. We took  classes under those people that were heads of the department of the  colleges across the United States. In other words, they brought in the top  notch individual to teach those classes. But they did it only during the  summertime on that particular program. They ran that program for two  years and then they dropped it, but the ones that was in it got to stay in  it. Kind of as we weeded ourselves out, of course, it was gone, but I  think there was only four or five of us that actually completed that  24  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  program.  And then when did you start working actively with the No Man   s Land  Museum?  When I was a graduate   well, when I was working on my bachelor   s  degree there at Panhandle, I joined the Museum Club and became  president of the Museum Club. And then I   d always worked with the  Museum Club even when I was teaching at Yarbrough, go back and  work with the curator and work with the Museum Club. And then when  we moved back to the college, Dr. Marvin McKee called me up one day  and said,    How come the museum   s not open?    And I said,    Well, I  don   t know.    The curator had quit, Dr.  Nolan  McWhirter had quit and  moved during the summer, and they didn   t have a replacement. So I  said,    I don   t know,    and he said,    Well, you   re the new curator. You  get over there and find out why it   s not open.    I said,    Wait a minute.  I   m teaching classes here.    And he said,    Well, get Joan over there and  have her open it up then.    So my wife went over and opened it up and  started working as a student help at the museum, and I was    curator    for  a number of years. So I worked with the museum then for   I think Joan  and I have about fifty-seven years working at the museum together,  combined.  And has the collection really grown over the years?  At Goodwell?  Yes.  Yes, it has. Yes. It   s expanded quite well.  Is it mostly local residents that make donations of items?  Yes. The Museum is set up through No Man   s Land, just the three  counties,  Cimarron, Texas, and Beaver Counties . So basically, they try  to work with just the three Panhandle counties on the material that   s in  there. Basically, that   s what it is. They do have some nice collections.  They have the Billy Baker Collection from Boise City. They have other  rather large collections that have come into the museum. They have the  Duckett Collection, which is a family that made materials and things,  just all kinds of different materials, vases, everything you can think of  out of Alabaster. It   s called the Duckett Collection. It   s really huge.  And then all the bones.  Yes. We dug out bones. I was on the dig that dug out a mastodon here in  25  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Beaver County on the Billy Wilson ranch that   s out in the museum. Dr.  McWhirter was still there at that time, but I and Dr.  Harold  Hefley  helped a lot, did some picture work on it, took a lot of pictures on it. But  it was a mastodon, not a wooly mammoth. We did, at times, different  times, have different wooly mammoth bones at the museum.  So did you start getting involved with digs just because of your own  interest?  Yes. I   ve always collected Indian artifacts, arrow heads, hunted them  whenever I could. Would see, on the tractor, a piece of flint or  something, I always had to stop and get it. So I had an interest in it, yes.  So do you have quite an extensive collection of arrowheads?  Yes, a pretty nice collection, yes.  Well, what do you remember about some of the digs? And particularly,  the one where they found the mastodon?  It took us several weeks or months during the summer to dig the thing  out, and it   s actually, it was in clay. It   s in a red or grey-type clay stuff.  It   s in clay, so it did take a lot of work to dig it out. But there was a lot  of interest there. There was a lot of volunteer help and over the months, I  think we got most of it. The skull and the tusks came out beautifully.  The tusks polished just like they weren   t in the ground. Of course, they  was in clay, but they   re beautiful on the tusks. Got a pretty good  percentage of the mastodon. They thought it was a wooly mammoth  until they got to the teeth, and they found the teeth and they realized it  was a mastodon, which is a lot older than a mammoth.  How did it feel realizing that this was here in the ground?  Well, it was kind of a shock to find out that it was a mastodon rather  than a wooly mammoth. But Billy Wilson had seen this eroding out and  he thought it was just petrified wood, but then he got to looking at it and  decided it must be bone. So he called the college out there and wanted  them to come out and look. And Dr. McWhirter and I and I think one  other person came out and looked at it and decided it was bone, and  that   s when we started to dig. There were other digs in the area. Since  then, there   s been the   well, the Roy Smith site, Indian. Of course, that  was a lot later, but the Odessa Yates site, which is south of town here,  was dug out the most recent.  What was found there?  26  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  It   s an early Indian camp, meeting site. Dates to about 1336, something  like that, 1342, somewhere in that range. It   s earlier than most of the     it   s the earliest known Indian camp in this general area in the Panhandle.  Most of them date to about 1400, but this one is a little earlier. So it  seemed to be a trading area.  And then you taught a class on archeology out in the Panhandle?  Yes. With the curator, and I   ve always photographed a lot of the  material. I had been photographing the pictographs in Cimarron County  and wherever I could find them, and there was some interest in it. I  started showing the slides and somebody said,    Well, why don   t you  develop a course?    So I sat down and developed a course called     Anthropology of the Oklahoma Panhandle,    and I just   all I used was  my material, my books and my slides, my own equipment. I started  teaching it as a two-hour course, and they could take it as credit or non-credit.  I put in to teach it, and I put the limit on as thirty, because the  classroom I was in in Carter Hall where I taught, the largest classroom in  there, had thirty desks. So I put in for thirty.  When the brochure came out, I noticed that the teacher education person  had put down    unlimited.    I called him and I said,    Why is this  unlimited?    He said,    You   ll never get thirty people in there. It won   t  even make, I   ll bet you.    Well, during enrollment and after enrollment  was over, I had eighty-eight people. So I called him, I said,    All right,  this class that didn   t make has got eighty-eight students in it. Now, what  am I going to do with them?    And he said,    Well, we   ll break it into two  sessions.    I said,    No, you   re not. You   re not going to break it into two  sessions. Half of them will be mad and won   t ever come back, and the  other half will wonder what happened. I   m not breaking it into two  sessions. I   m going to teach them as a group, eighty-eight of them.     So I started using the cafeteria for a while. We met in the cafeteria. Then  I met in Hugh-Strong for a while, and then finally, I started using the  library. There was an auditorium in the library that would seat probably  sixty or seventy people   or no, it would seat more than that, maybe 100.  Anyway, they could all sit in there, so I switched them around. We met  different places at different times, but we taught it as a group. And on  our field trips, we   d have as many as 150 or 200 people on the field  trips, because they all brought their parents and the kids and the  grandparents went with the field trips.  Wow. How would you travel around, on buses?  No, we did it in   wherever we went, it took some four-wheel drive or  vehicles that you   d travel with in the rough country. The field trips were  27  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  basically taken in the Kenton area, Cimarron County, and that   s the  foothills of the Rockies. So it does get kind of rough out there in places  where I wanted to take them. We   d have as many as 110 vehicles at one  time on some of those, on the first ones.  Wow. Would people stay the night out there or just drive out and come  back?  No, they all drove out and came back. There wasn   t any place to stay out  there.  Yes. (Laughter) So what would you look at out there, specifically?  There was a lot of dinosaur tracks there. In fact, there was one area     well, creek that has probably   at that time, it had four different sets of  tracks going across it, which was very unusual. There   s a lot of Indian  writings in the area. There   s probably ten or fifteen different areas that  you can go to, to see Indian writings. Some of them are quite nice.  There   s the three corner marker, the three state marker, and the   well,  there   s other interesting areas. Black Mesa. Most people don   t realize     they see it, they don   t know what it is, it   s just there. But once they  figure it out, that it is Black Mesa    So we usually met at Kenton and  then went from Kenton.  There was an old gentleman, his parents had come to that area early, in  the 1880s. At one time, they owned a lot of land, Truman Tucker, and  his interest was in the dinosaur tracks, basically   Indian. So he knew the  history well, and I usually used him as a guide or took him along  because he knew the ranchers, and he could get us in on places that I  normally couldn   t get us in. But after we got in the first time, then we  didn   t have any problems, because we always tried to leave the place  cleaner than we found it, and we made sure that the people stayed  together and didn   t wander off somewhere. But it was interesting.  There   s a lot of history in that area.  How long did you teach the class? How many different semesters?  I taught it every other year. (Laughs) The last time I taught it was two  years ago here in Beaver. They still want the class taught, so I   ve taught  it several times since I retired. Just two years ago, I taught the class  again here in Beaver. It was just two years, wasn   t it? Two years ago.  They still want it taught. It appeared to be quite popular.  I bet. It sounds interesting.  While it was at Goodwell, I had taught it several years, there was one  28  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  gentleman that took it every time I taught it. He never missed a class. He  took it every time. I finally asked him, I said,    Troy, why are you taking  this class?    He said,    Well, it   s different every time.    (Laughter) I did  change the slides. I had enough slides that I could change the slides in  the same area and get the thing across, and it just fascinated him. He   d  always show up. Troy Holter took it every year I taught that thing.  And you   ve been a pretty avid photographer throughout your life?  No, I just take pictures. When I was in Japan, I got a little thirty-five  millimeter camera. We couldn   t get colored film there, but I had one roll  of colored film. In Japan, I took pictures, and when I got out I just  continued to take pictures. They   re basically on slides. I probably have  1000 or so slides, basically of the Oklahoma Panhandle, of all different  subjects.  And those are what you use in your class?  Yes. I can put together about any type of a slide presentation on about  any subject, I think, dealing with history or the Oklahoma Panhandle  that they want.  What   s your favorite topic dealing with the Panhandle?  I   d have to say probably the Indians. They were here first, basically, and  it   s interesting to do a little research on them, history. It changes pretty  well, pretty much. The last things I   ve been photographing are the old  cellars. They   re about all gone, windmills, have a lot of pictures of  windmills, and they are gone now. The last thing that was kind of  interesting is the Jones and Plummer Trail, itself. We   d talked about  where it came in and how it came into Beaver. My wife   s dad bought the  Overton farm, and discovered that part of the old trail comes right by our  house and there   s still part of it there. So we did get a sign put up that  it   s there. They can still view part of the old Jones and Plummer Trail.  I went to a seminar this last fall, and a gentleman from Wichita State  University was giving a report on Coronado   s route. It   s his theory, and  I   ve run across this before, that the early Jones and Plummer Trail is  actually an old Indian trail used years and years before Jones and  Plummer Trail ever used it. It   s his theory that Coronado, when he came  into Texas and he started north to the Seven Cities of Gold that he  actually used the Jones and Plummer Trail as the way he went, which  puts it right through here. So the sign by Forgan that says this Indian  Jones and Plummer Trail is almost right on it, and it does come out right  by our house, where we live now, and it   s part of it, the old maps show it  coming right through there. So we have an old Indian trail, first, then  29  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Coronado used it, then Jones and Plummer, which named it the Jones  and Plummer Trail. So our history here can go back a lot further than  just the Jones and Plummer, go back to an old Indian trail.  Wow. And you   ve been pretty involved with this museum, the Jones and  Plummer Trail Museum?  Yes, since we moved back to Beaver, since    95. Either been a board  member or president or past president. I don   t think I   ve ever been a past  board member yet. (Laughter) Yes.  Has this collection grown quite a bit over the years?  Here?  Yes.  We haven   t had room to expand it, but it will now.  What   s this new addition that was just added?  The Calhoun addition, Dr. Calhoun and his wife. Dr. Calhoun had an  extensive saddle collection, you can tell, and the room was built for that  saddle collection, basically his collection. This room was put on for a  conference room, what we   re using now. The other room up there we  call the art area wasn   t big enough to really handle the group, and this  room will handle it for a while, yet.  Yes, this is nice. Well, how had Beaver changed from the time you lived  here, or in the area, as a young boy until now?  Probably it   s lost a lot of population. A lot of the stores and stuff are  gone. For one example, when I started to high school up here, the bus  was three miles from our home, and I   d go to the bus. Folks normally  took me to the bus. Preston Thomas drove the bus, and he lived with his  parents and he was the bus driver. They   d take me to the Thomas place  and I   d get on the bus there. By the time we got to school up here, that  bus would have about thirty-four to thirty-five kids on it. I suspect now,  if you went the same route, you might get three kids. Three, and that   s  all.  I can remember my folks coming to town, most people came to town on  a Saturday afternoon. They   d bring their eggs and cream to the Judd  store, creamery, and I   d get fifteen cents. I   d go across the street, stop at  a little hamburger place and get a hamburger for a nickel. Then I   d go to  the show and stay all afternoon in the show for a dime. So the theater   s  30  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Hodges  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  gone, the creamery   s gone. A lot of the businesses are gone, a lot of the  filling stations, car dealerships, tractor dealerships. It   s just slowly  disappearing.  What keeps you out here?  This is home. And well, I   ve always farmed. Some way, I   ve always  farmed. We still try to do some farming, but the thing that   s really kept  us going is oil and gas. When it came in during the    50s, they had kind  of an oil and gas boom, it kept a lot of the farmers going. And now,  recently, with the new type of drilling, they call it the horizontal drilling.  They go down to a zone they want to and they go a mile underground  horizontally, which is kind of unusual, but it has brought a lot of money  into this area. The more of those you   ve got on the land, the better  farmer you are. That   s for sure. So that   s what kind of keeps us here.  Are there any topics we haven   t talked about yet that we should discuss?  I can   t think of any. Pauline, I   m looking at Pauline. She   s our historian  here. Whatever we talked about earlier, was there something that might  be of interest?  You might mention how colorful early Beaver was compared to today,  how it   s changed. Before we became part of Oklahoma Territory and  were trying to get some law and order out here.  Well, it   yes, it was pretty wide open. (Laughter) There was no law and  order out here. Probably, the little thriving interest was Beer City just  south of Liberal, Kansas in the Oklahoma Panhandle. It did have some  madams that kind of ran the place, I think.  And was the beer free-flowing?  I think it was. (Laughter) Not only the beer, but all the rest that went  with it, I think, pretty free-flowing. Yes, I think the town of Beaver has  some hidden agenda behind it. Well, Tracy was the postmaster when  somebody robbed the post office. When they finally trailed it back, I  believe it was the postmaster that had stolen the money and had dropped  the coins along the way. It went right to his house, something like that. I  don   t know. (Laughter) There   s a lot of history here.  There   s a lot of history and it   s gone. For example, a lot of the people  just won   t talk about it. The early ranches, there   s no telling how a lot of  the early ranches got started. My sister married Arthur N. Howe, Jr., and  his father, Arthur N. Howe, Sr., at one time, as I understand it, owned all  the land from where Highway 412 or  Highway  3 crosses the Kiowa  31  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  River. He owned all the land south of there to the Texas border. And  somehow, he lost it all but forty acres. You have no idea what happened  or why. It   s just gone. And I suspect the Barbys and I know some of the  others, the Hitches, got a lot of the land the same way. It showed up in  their account and then a lot of them kept it and some of them didn   t. But  there   s a lot of history unknown here.  Well, have you encountered many beavers?  The animal beaver?  Yes. (Laughter)  I   ve never seen an animal beaver, itself, in this area. There may be some,  but I don   t know where they   re at. Not the beaver. Apparently, there  were beavers at one time along here. Well, I   m sure there was because  all the little streams that are now dry were running. Beaver River used to  run pretty high.  And the town was originally called Beaver City?  Beaver City, yes.  And then they dropped that?  Yes, kind of lost the City part, became just Beaver. Well, a lot of the  towns were    Cities.    The railroads had a lot to do with the towns. We  lost a lot of towns in the Panhandle that either went to Kansas or Texas  when the railroad went through. The south part went through Texas,  Ivanhoe, Old Ivanhoe, the camp, several of them, moved to Texas. And  the ones on the north side, like Liberal, first moved to 54, the railroad  coming through Liberal. And on west, they did the same thing. If the  railroad didn   t go through, the towns dried up, just disappeared. In fact,  there were some towns plotted out here that never became towns. Old  Buffalo was one of them. It was plotted, or supposedly plotted,  supposedly had a post office. There was never a town there. Never a post  office. Somebody made some money off of it, I guess, and that was it.  Do you know how Slapout got its name?  Well, apparently, they say that the lady that ran it or the people that ran  it, somebody would come in and want something, she   d slap her hip and  say,    Oh, gosh, we   re just slap out of that,    so they called it Slapout. I  don   t know whether that   s true or not, but it   s a good story. Sounds  great. (Laughter) Might as well go with it. It   s been around for years and  years.  32  Paustenbaugh  Kachel  I   m just curious, what do you see as the future for this area? For a young  person that was here now, what should entice them to stay?  I   m not sure, unless their parents own quite a bit of land and they have  oil and gas. The farmland in this area, probably a lot of it should never  have been plowed out. And most of it is going back to the CRP, the  government program, and I think a lot more of it will go back into CRP.  So in the breaks, like this area through here, it   s just all ranch land or  should all be ranch land. So there may be a few farms in the south part  of Beaver County, there may be a few farms on the north side of Beaver  River, the north part of Beaver County, but the rest of it all should be  ranch land. So if they are not into the ranching area and their family  doesn   t have already quite a few holdings, I   m not sure they can get  started. It would be awful hard to get started. The future   s just not here  for any young people.  Some of our city fathers here in Beaver, for example, have kept what  industry that did want to come in, out. Some of them have fought the  hog farms, and the state of Oklahoma wanted to move the highway  division up here and they didn   t want it. So it   s stayed at Buffalo. They  built a new highway division at Buffalo instead of out here. So some of  it has been due to the cliques that   s in Beaver County that didn   t want  anything to come in, that kept it out. They have kind of slowed down the  hog farm business in Beaver County. And the latest thing that they   re  fighting is the transmission lines for the windmill, the big lines coming  through. Now, they   ve got the lesser prairie chicken that   s supposed to  be an endangered species, and supposedly, you can   t have windmills  around them, you can   t have cedar trees around them.  We   ve had prairie chickens on the land out here that we farm ever since  I can remember, and that group, since the 1980s, that group has spread, I  know, ten miles to the west. That group has spread fifteen miles to the  east. There   s prairie chicken all through here now where there wasn   t.  Yet they say that the high lines will hurt the prairie chicken, the  windmills will hurt the prairie chicken. I   ve never seen a prairie chicken  fly that high. The last lady said that they needed to take out all the cross  fences because the prairie chicken was flying into the fences, being  hooked and killed. I   ve helped my dad and worked on rebuilding fences  and fixing up old fences for the last seventy years and I   ve never seen a  prairie chicken in one of them. And there   s prairie chicken all around  there.  Where we farm, if you see any prairie chicken, a mother with her little  chicks, they   ll be under the fence. And why are they under the fence?  The hawk can   t get them. They stay under that fence, and she keeps  33  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  them under that fence until they go out to feed. They   re not flying into  the fences. I don   t know where they get this information from. They  complain about the prairie chicken, that they   re destroying their  booming sites. The booming sites, when we were here early in farming  the booming site was south of our place a mile. That site had moved  about three miles west and now, that booming site has moved on another  mile and a half west. They claim they don   t move those booming sites.  Well, this site has moved almost six miles, so I don   t know where they  get this that they don   t move those booming sites. We   ve seen more  prairie chicken now than I   ve seen in years, yet they   re claiming they are  an endangered species, and they won   t let the high lines come through.  Or they   re fighting so the high lines don   t come through, which I don   t  know, to me, it   s totally ridiculous.  They say the prairie chicken won   t stay around red cedars. We   ve had  prairie chickens in our yard and the only way they can get in that yard is  to come by red cedars some way. They can   t get in there without coming  by some red cedars. They   re just there, the cedars and the prairie  chicken. So I don   t know about some of our environmentalists. I think  every farmer is an active environmentalist. He   s not an environmental  activist, and there   s a big difference between the two. If you   re going to  farm, you have to be an active environmentalist. You just have to be.  You   re not an environmental activist. You   ve got to be an active  environmentalist or you   re not going to make it. Mother Nature will  make sure you don   t make it.  How old is the farm that you live on now?  The original house was built in 1917, and then it was bricked in 1928.  So I would expect   I haven   t really checked the record on it, but it must  be 1908 or    09, or maybe a little before that that it became a farm or was  first settled on. Of course, a lot of the land was claimed and they really  didn   t own it. They just claimed it. There   s some 100-year-old farms  now being recognized in the area. Yes.  Well, you have helped discover and document a lot of history, and I   m  just wondering when history is written about you, what you   d like for it  to say?  Well, I don   t know. I hope that they say that whatever I presented and  treated people was kind of fair. I can say that.  And you   ve been an educator for a number of years.  Yes.  34  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  Kachel  Wilson  And affected lots of lives and helped others discover great things about  the area, the Panhandle.  That is one of the things that   s interesting, when you get a letter from a  former student that says,    Glad I had classes under you. You really  helped me.    And sometimes   I got a letter not too long ago from a  student I hadn   t seen, probably, in fifty years that said,    You really  influenced me.    I was teaching science at Yarbrough, and he said,    Your  science classes influenced me and kept me in school.     That   s great. Well, thank you very much for visiting with me.  You   re quite welcome.  I appreciate it.  -------  -------
