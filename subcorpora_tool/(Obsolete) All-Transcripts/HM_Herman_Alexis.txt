Story_ID: 85134
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back and, and really, I wanna start with your parents.  And I'd like to start with your mother, and I want you to tell me what you know about her background and her growing up.
Speaker 2: My mother was the oldest of four children.  And she was born and raised in our hometown of Mobile, Alabama.  She was raised primarily by her grandmother, Minnie.  Although her mother was a, a major figure in her life, my mother came from a very poor family, and my grandmother had to help raise the kids.  And so my mother really lived between her grandmother and her mother's home.  And when she was old enough, she would go back and forth to help take care of the other kids.  She was very active growing up.  She had the lead in her high school play, "Sun Bonnet Sue"; she loved singing; she loved music; she loved dancing.  And she had me when she was twenty years old.  She wasn't married, and I think that was a very tough time for her because it was the Deep South.  You know, it was such a taboo to, to have a child out of wedlock.  She finished high school and had not gone on to college.  But after I was born, education was always very important to her, and she was determined that she wanted to be the right role model for me.  So she went back to school after I was born.  I was three years of age when she enrolled in the junior college in Mobile.  It was then called Alabama State.  It was an extension of Alabama State College.  And then she went on and graduated from Alabama State in education.  And she always wanted to be a schoolteacher.  She always believed passionately in the power of education to make a difference.  And so she finished, and she went on to, to get a degree.  And when I finished college, we actually went back to grad school together.  And my mother actually did go on and she got her master's degree in the '70s [1970s].  And in the '80s [1980s], she was named Alabama Reading Teacher of the Year, and she was the first African American woman to, to claim that title.  And we were very, very proud of her and for her.  She was a strict disciplinarian.  She believed in excellence.  She was very involved in my life growing up, always pushing me and encouraging me, but she was no-nonsense, you know.  She made sure that the homework was always done and no matter how long it took.  She was the cool schoolteacher at home and in the classroom.  Our house was always full of children.  Because my mother always said there's no such thing as a dumb child, only a child that we haven't found a way to reach, and so she was always tutoring kids in the neighborhood, kids who had problems in school.  And eventually when she went back to get her graduate degree, she actually ended up specializing in reading difficulties.  And that's what she really concentrated on.  And we always had children from the time that I can remember in our house with books in the bedroom, in the bathroom, at the kitchen table.  We had a little house.  She remarried.  I shouldn't say remarried; she married once and divorced when I was, I don't know, maybe ten, eleven.  Mommy stayed married for maybe seven or eight years at that time, and she never remarried after that experience.  She always wanted me to get married, and she always wanted to have grandkids.  Unfortunately, she passed at a very early age; at sixty-two, before she had a chance to see me married.  And luckily, I married into a family with kids and grandkids.
Story_ID: 85135
Speaker 1: I saw her [her mother, Gloria Broadus], probably my most poignant memory of the last memories of her, right before she--not my most poignant, but I guess the ones that stay with me the longest now--the moments, the weeks right before she passed, because I'd had a, a chance to go home.  It was August of 1990, and Bill Clinton was then head of the National Governor's Association.  And the meeting was being held in my hometown of Mobile, Alabama.  And I normally would not have gone home for that meeting, but I was then working at the DNC [Democratic National Convention], and [HM] Ron Brown was chair, and he kept saying Alexis, it's your hometown.  And Bill Clinton is head of the National Governor's Association, and we were all friends.  And your mom will make some of that great gumbo for us if we all go home.  So they talked me into going home that August.  And I'd seen her at February, 'cause I always go home every Mardi Gras.  Mardi Gras was a big deal in our family.  It was family reunion time, and everybody always came home for Mardi Gras.  But I saw her last that August, when we were home for the National Governor's Association.  And true to her calling--she was a great cook; she loved to cook--she fed everybody on that trip gumbo, red beans and rice, baked crab.  We played the piano, she sang, but she had a strange peace about her.  And it was one of the few times that we stayed up almost all night talking about my father, and her life, and if she had missed being married, and what it was like for her raising me as a single mom.  My mother was very spiritual.  She was a very religious woman, and as she got older she prayed a lot.  And we talked about the importance of her faith in her life and what had sustained her.  And a week later, she died just like that.  I had talked to her.  I was changing planes in California.  I was on my way back.  I'd been in Hawaii on a vacation trip, and it was like, I don't know, midnight Mobile [Alabama] time and ten o'clock San Francisco [California] time.  And I said you know, I'm gonna call home just to check in because I hadn't had a chance to talk to her for about a week.  And I called her when I was changing planes in the airport in California on my way back East, and told her about the trip.  And I was about to hang up the phone and she said Alexis?  And I said yes, what is it?  She said I love you.  I said I love you too.  And by the time I landed, she'd passed.  She had an aneurysm in her stomach, and she bled to death.  So, we were very close, and it was just the two of really in terms of my growing up.  I later found out that I did have a half-brother, but in terms of our household, it was just really me and my mom.  And to a large extent, her ability to take risk, her ability not to let the status quo define her, her insistence always on excellence, her willingness always to give back, and to be so involved in community and to have a community conscious, were values that I know she passed on to me.  She was not particularly political.  As a matter of fact, she used to sort of shun the political process.  Part of it I think was the racism in Alabama and just how she knew we were treated.  She didn't really see the fairness in the system, unlike my father, who was like really passionate about it all.  And I think maybe because he was so passionate about it all, it may have had the opposite effect on her.  But as I got older, and as I got more politically involved, she also became, in later life, more politically active as well, and took a real interest in what was going on in terms of the whole civil rights struggle, and particularly in my hometown, when we were looking at school desegregation issues and just basics of registering folks to vote and get them to the polls, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, with her, did she--did her family--was, was your family based in Mobile?  Was she born in Mobile?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so your roots there were, you know, long.
Story_ID: 85136
Speaker 1: Can you talk about your father a little bit too (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My father [Alex Herman] was the first African American elected in the Deep South after Reconstruction to any office in the 1940s.  He was what's now called a wardsman.  I guess then they called it a wards man too.  It was Ward 10 in Mobile [Alabama].  Now my father came from a very active family in Mobile.  They were entrepreneurs of sorts.  They had a bakery, and they had a little barber shop, and they had things on the avenue.  That was the black side of town.  And they were a very recognized family at home.  My father was older than my mother.  My father was like twenty-five years older than my mother, so when I was born he was in his forties, but he was very active in my life.  My father was literally there from the very beginning.  It was a long time before I knew that my parents weren't divorced, that they'd never been married, just from the way he took me to school, picked me up, took me to community meetings with him at a little girl, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] growing up or the quiet meetings they use to have in backrooms in houses growing up.  I always knew my father was important in the community.  I didn't understand what that really meant until I got older.  I just knew that he was always sort of out there fighting and pushing.  And when there were problems in the community, people would always turn to Alex Herman.  And when kids got locked up in jail, I used to hear the stories about them knocking on the back door of my father's house to say can you get my son out of jail, you know.  He was determined that political empowerment, know that we were going to make a difference that way, it was what he was committed to.  When I was five years old, I had my first encounter with the Klan [Ku Klux Klan KKK] with him.  He used to go on these night rides and these night meetings.  And so I think that was the first really event in my life where I, if there was a spark that was put in me, probably happened that night when he was beaten by the Klan and I saw it.  And for me, my father was always larger than life, you know.  I never heard him raise his voice.  I heard him utter a cuss word once in his life, and that was when somebody hit his grey and white DeSoto that was parked in front of the house one day.
Story_ID: 85137
Speaker 1: But he [her father, Alex Herman] believed really in the political way as a way of bringing change, and so he was very involved in the Civil Rights Movement.  He was very involved in bringing really the vote to black folk in the state of Alabama.  I can remember this one time we went to the polls and with Papa Joe.  He was always trying to get Papa Joe registered to vote.  And every time they would ask Papa Joe the same question, how many bubbles in a bar of soap?  And of course he could never answer the question.  But he was always explaining to me about the tricks and the games that would be played, but how you couldn't let it turn you around.  You know, you had to keep pushing; you had to keep fight, and never give up.  And so, that's how I saw him, you know.  He never in the face of adversity turned back.  He was always there.  He would give you his last dime if he had it, and he was also a great entrepreneur.  My father ended up running a company called the Unity Barrel Life Insurance Company in Mobile [Alabama].  So he ended up in the insurance business, and he was one of those early African American insurance executives.  For us it was Unity Barrel, Johnson and Allen Funeral Home.  And when I would come home from school, I would get to go to the office with him, and sit at his desk--all the papers--and watch him do his work.  And that sort of became a routine for me.  Even after I was in high school and able to walk back and forth to school, I would always go by the office, watch him do his work, and then he'd, you know, take me home.  So, I probably learned from him the different aspects of not just entrepreneurship, but I think political commitment and, and what it means to, to see real change take place in front of you, you know.  He was the one who organized the night that we tested the Civil Rights Act in Mobile after it had first passed.  And you know, there was a day that got picked by the NAACP across the South, at least I know in Alabama, when we would go in and test the restaurants for--to desegregate them.  And they decided to use high school kids because they thought that this would be less possibilities maybe for violence if they were using the students to do it.  And I remember he handpicked all the kids, and would take us to these training sessions, 'cause most of us had never been inside of a hotel or restaurant.  And we would practice reading menus, and we would practice ordering from the menus.  And they would teach us what to say and what to do, and the fact that we probably wouldn't get served.  We were supposed to stay there all night, you know, no matter what.  And he would make us sit there and practice it just like it actually did end up happening, you know.  But he was just, he was just like that.
Story_ID: 85138
Speaker 1: Do you know about his, his, his family background, and did it go also, was it based in Mobile [Alabama] too?
Speaker 2: My father's [Alex Herman] mother came from New Orleans [Louisiana].  My father's father--actually, the Hermans came from Germany.  They were--he was a riverboat captain.  And I'm told that the first generation actually came from--when Queen Isabella of Spain was settling that part of Alabama, that my great-great-grandfather was one of the sailors, and settled in that area, and claimed a portion of the state when that community was called Chastang, Alabama--it's outside of Mobile--and married into the, the Chastang family.  And that wa--that was the roots on my father's side, the paternal side.  So, they were sailors from Germany, and somehow they were a part of the Spanish fleet that settled in Chastang, Alabama.  And they married into the Chastang family, the Hermans did, and that became the roots on the paternal side.  And the records are still there in Chastang in terms of my father's side of the family.  On the maternal side, they came from New Orleans, and they were half Italian.  They came from Italy.  My great-great-grandfather on my father's side came from Italy, and my great-great-grandmother was his house slave.  And there are all kinds of stories in the family about the Sigmonettis (ph.) and the fact that he fell in love with my great-great-grandmother, and she had four children for him.  And his wife was apparently sickly and spent most of the time in bed.  And when she passed, my great-great-grandfather wanted to take her back to Italy they used to say, to make a "real woman out of her," because he could never marry her in New Orleans.  But she had to make a choice of leaving her mother in New Orleans, as opposed to going back to Italy with him, with the four girls.  And she chose instead to stay in New Orleans, and not to go to Italy and leave her mother.  And there were these love letters were passed down in the family of how she regretted not going to Italy and how she loved him to her dying day, but he felt like her duty was to her mother and the fact that she couldn't take her mother and the rest of the family.  I don't know why, but I just know that that wasn't a part of apparently what the deal was.  And she, so she stayed behind.  So that's all I know about that side.  And then eventually one of the sisters, who happened to be my father's mother, Alice Sigmonetti, migrated to Mobile.  And there she met George Herman and married him.  But the rest of the family, the Sigmonettis, stayed in New Orleans.
Story_ID: 85139
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory?  Is it--do you have an earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory was watching my mother [Gloria Broadus] walk down the street crying and leaving me at a cousin's house when she went off to school.  That's my earliest memory.  I can still see her walking down Dearborn Street.  And I was raised by my grandmother, my cousin, and different family members when my mother went off to Montgomery [Alabama] to Alabama State [University].  But my earliest memory was that of seeing my mother walk away with tears.
Speaker 1: And how old do you think you were at the time?
Speaker 2: Like three.
Speaker 1: Three, okay.
Story_ID: 85140
Speaker 1: And can you describe the Mobile [Alabama] of that time?  What was it--I mean, what was Mobile like, the, the, the, the town--I mean the city?
Speaker 2: Well, Mobile was a very segregated town, as most Southern cities were obviously.  I mean there were black and white communities, and there were the (unclear).  And then within the black community there were two communities really, down the bay, as we used to say, and what they called cross town.  There were two communities of even black people in Mobile.  Mobile also was stratified in terms of the color line within the black community.  There were the, the light skin black folk and the dark skin black folk.  And you know, there was segregation there in terms of the clubs and just the social life.  I came from a Catholic background, so ours was a very close knit Catholic community growing up in Mobile.  And that was another cut.  Because, you know, most of the town was Protestant, and we were black Catholics, so that was an, an even further cut.  But it was a very close-knit community.  It was a very supportive community.  And I don't think I ever thought of being poor.  I never thought--although I, you know, I realize now we were poor, I didn't think of it like that, you know.  We all lived at one point in the same house with my grandmother, and that was just what families did, you know.  They shared; they lived together; they all slept in the same beds; we shared food; it was understood that when the holiday came, you didn't just cook for yourself, you know, you took it around and you shared whatever you had.  We were always conscious of "our place" in terms of going downtown and knowing where you could walk and where you couldn't walk.  And, and you know, the white and colored signs were everywhere and the lunch counters where you couldn't eat.  You know, you just sort of knew your place in terms of growing up.  But there was something about Mobile where they used to like to think that they were "more advanced."  They used to talk about the fact that this was the place where freed slaves could come, and that there were more freed slaves in Mobile than any other Southern city.  The last slave ship docked right at Mobile and Prichard, the Clotilde.  And so Cudjoe and his family, you know, there was all the legacy that they got off and, and they were free, and didn't know they were free, because the war had ended.  And so there was that kind of a legacy that.  Even in the midst of our segregation, we thought we had a leg up, so to speak, that we were freer than most folk because we could start businesses.  And there was a budding entrepreneurial community that developed along Davis Avenue in Mobile, so--and also the fact that Mobile was a port city; the notion that there were these influences when other workers from other countries would dock in Mobile; that there was this notion that somehow we were more accepting, and we were more tolerant.  A lot of people used to say it was one of the reasons that Mobile didn't blow up like Birmingham [Alabama] did or didn't blow like Montgomery [Alabama] did, because we thought that we had the ability to communicate better and that there was more of a, of a dialogue across the races in Mobile.  Now, some of that was folklore; then some of it, some of it was true.  I think the real reason that Mobile didn't explode, quite honestly, was there was almost this sense of pride that we had to manage our racial affairs better, even if it wasn't that way in reality.
Story_ID: 86255
Speaker 1: I wanna take you back to your early days, and I want you to just reflect on or remember back about what maybe sights, smells, and or sounds remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: Sights, smells, or sounds, okay, azalea flowers; that reminds me of growing up, seeing the azaleas, seeing the hats, the church on Sundays, and remembering how everyone used to congregate outside of the church.  It was like the church and the community center, it was all like right there, and you would just hang around. 'Cause there wasn't any place to go after you got all dressed up after church, and so, you know, just sort of hang around and, and being there till it was like the last families would leave.  I think the other from a smell standpoint of view for me it would be gumbo, cooking in the kitchen, particularly at holiday times because that's when you really did all the cooking, and the cleaning, the Pine-Sol, and disinfecting the toilets and letting 'em sit, you know, so you knew that the house had to really be clean, and that Johnson's Wax on the tile, you know.  And you just would shine it so your face would like almost try to see the gloss on it, you know, so.  What else did you ask me (laughter)?
Speaker 1: That's really good.  I said sights, smells, and sounds, sounds.
Speaker 2: Sounds, oh, for me growing up, hearing my daddy sing in the car "You Always Hurt the One You Love," and making everybody sing "Let Me Call You Sweetheart."  And we would all get to sing to the top of our voices "Let Me Call You Sweetheart."  I guess singing, singing; my family sang a lot.  My uncle used to try and sing like Nat King Cole.  He had a great voice, and he could do a Mona Lisa that would make you just stop right where you were.  And so whenever he would take off and do some of those old Nat King Cole songs, we would just stop, you know; hearing my aunt, who was like the oldest one in the family get up and do "Bye Bye Blackbird," you know.  But that's what I remember.  In terms of the sounds, it would be the singing.
Story_ID: 86256
Speaker 1: That's nice.  Now, with the, with the black Catholics, you know, you had mentioned that it was a subset of, you know, Mobile [Alabama].  But, but how--who were the black Catholics?  I mean who were you guys?
Speaker 2: Well, we were basically about three or four parishes in Mobile.  There were like four black churches.  There was St. Peter Claver, which was a church down the Bay where I grew up in (unclear).  There was a group across town, Heart of Mary.  There was St. Joseph's and St. James.  So there were like four Catholic black churches in Mobile.  And there were four Catholic grade schools, and one black Catholic high school in the whole Archdiocese.  And so that's why in one sense it was a small, close-knit community.  We all knew one another.  And because the Catholic Church was then segregated, you know, the bond I think was even stronger as we, in later years, took on the whole issue of desegregating the Catholic schools in Mobile, which was sort of the first in terms of how we started our own desegregation efforts.  But we were a very active community.  We were encouraged to be real risk takers.  We were the first to get involved in all the demonstrations and the what (unclear) that we did have in Mobile.  The priest and the nuns were very active in our community.  And it was a group of, of active Catholics who lived out their faith I mean, you know, and who really I think passed it on to us that even in segregated Mobile, that the Christian principles of what the Catholic Church stood for, then we had to always challenge and push back against the establishment.  So, you know, you didn't call it an activist gospel then, but as I look back on it now, that's really what I'd say we were.  We were really a bunch of, of real activists with inside the church itself.
Story_ID: 86257
Speaker 1: And this was a time--we're talking about a time when the South, you know, the, the movement is really sort of, you know, (unclear).  Now, with your, your father [Alex Herman], I mean you tell the story.  I'd like you tell the story about, you know, you being age five.  But do you know what brought him into being, you know, active?  Do you know?  I mean I know--what was the motivation there, and what--you understand?
Speaker 2: I can't say that I know completely.  I, I know of events in my father's life.  For instance, my father played for a moment with the Negro league, for the Negro Baseball League, and Satchel Paige, you know, was from Mobile [Alabama].  My father used to coach Satchel Paige.  He used to talk about Satchel Paige throwing the ball in the backyard, and watching him pitch, and what a great arm he had.  And he used to talk about, whether it was a Satchel Paige or an Alex Herman, not having the opportunity to, to take advantage of what we ought to be able to do.  And so, for him it was always about taking on some cause or some issue and pushing back.  I had older people--my father didn't tell me this story, but as I got older, I didn't know that my father was the one who'd integrated the Coca- Cola Company in Mobile back in the '40's [1940s], before it was even talked about.  And they did it by bringing the first black truck drivers, who were driving Coca-Cola trucks, and he convinced old man Belengraf (ph.), who owned the Coca-Cola Bottling Company then, to hire them at night and try it out, because they had drivers in the daytime and drivers at night.  And why not start with bringing drivers on and let 'em drive the night shift and see how it would work?  And so he and old man Belengraf worked on that, and, and gradually they started having drivers in the daytime.  And, and there was a time when it was, you know, understood that you might be able to get a job at the Coca-Cola Company, although they weren't openly hiring black people at the time, at the bottling company there, but that they were "working on this project" with black people, you know.  So, he was just always taking on some way to bring some barrier in the community.
Story_ID: 86258
Speaker 1: And I do know when the White Citizens Council got active, I mean really active and the Klan [Ku Klux Klan KKK] was really starting to become more emboldened in Baldwin County [Alabama] and outside of Mobile County, and just really becoming more violent in terms of voting rights.  I think that's what really got my father [Alex Herman] the most, because he brought the first suit.  I remember what he told me when it first really got (unclear).  He brought the first suit against the Democratic Party because they refused to give him an, an absentee ballot.  This was in the '40's [1940s].  And at that time, to challenge the establishment, to challenge the party, and to bring a legal suit against them, was really unheard of.  But I know it was that act of denying him this absentee ballot that sort of sparked the political journey he took after that, including running for office himself, including taking on the party bosses in Mobile [Alabama].  And it--I know it had something to do with traveling with the Negro Baseball League.  I mean he'd been up North; he'd had a chance to, to see other parts of the country; and he used to talk about those experiences.  But his roots were at home, and he wanted to see change come to Mobile.  And I think when he started the business, and he had some base of his own, maybe it gave him the courage.  He used to say one's bravery is in proportions to one's options, so always keep your options open, you know, so I guess for him, having maybe some flexibility, but always being a risk taker, and growing up in a family I guess where they did go to college.  My father went to Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee, Alabama], finished in cooking and bakery, 'cause he was gonna come back home and work in the family bakery.  I can't say that I know exactly, but I just know the story.  I know that lawsuit had a big impact, and he won it.
Speaker 2: He won it?
Speaker 1: He won it, so, you know, he won that lawsuit.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 1: It was in the 1940's [1940s].
Speaker 2: Nineteen--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a story that I didn't know it had been written about until I was running the Democratic National Convention in New York City [New York] in 1992.  And an old reporter sent me a newspaper clipping and asked me if I was the daughter of Alex Herman.  And I said, you know, wrote him back, and he sent me that article, was an old clipping from the Mobile "Press-Register."
Story_ID: 86259
Speaker 1: Now, tell the story about you being five, and where were you headed when you riding with your father [Alex Herman], about that time?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I was headed over the Bay to Father Warren's.  And my father used to always take me riding at night, you know, sometimes as a way of helping me fall asleep.  Sometimes that was his time with me.  Sometimes if he had to go to what I would call a house meeting, I would go with him.  I didn't know really what I was listening to or sitting in or when they would be planning different things, you know, but he would always take me.  And on Christmas Eve, we always got to go look at the Christmas decorations, and that was a ritual.  And there was one particular community in Mobile that always had the lights and the Christmas trees, a white community.  And we would always drive through this area called Siena Vista.  But this particular Christmas Eve he said we would--we wouldn't be going to Siena Vista because he had to go to this meeting, and it was over the Bay at Father Warren's place.  Father Warren was a Catholic priest.  It was another Catholic community, but it wasn't inside Mobile.  It was in Daphne.  And he said that he had a meeting at Father Warren's house at night, and it was an important meeting, and he really needed to go there.  And I could see Father Warren's Christmas tree that night, so we went to Daphne.  We went to Father Warren's place, to the rectory.  And he was there with--the way I would normally see him with the other black men.  And you might see one or two white faces.  I knew it was, you know, an important meeting, as I always said, all these meetings were, but I was--it was--I was playing away.  And it was time to leave.  Now Daphne is a rural community and very dark, no lights, dirt roads.  The church itself was like off, up in the dirt roads.  And my father had a silver pistol with a pearl handle.  Now you have to realize that I never thought of my father as, as a violent man.  I told you I'd never heard even raise his voice, but I always knew if he was upset or there was trouble in the air because he always kept the pistol in the glove compartment in his car.  But if there was something going on of coming back from one of these meeting, the pistol would always sit on the car seat right beside him.  And I used to sit in his lap sometimes, you know, and hold the steering wheel, or I'd sit right up under him and fall asleep on him.  But if the pistol was there on the seat, I would always hug the door on the other side.
Story_ID: 86260
Speaker 1: So this particular night, you know, the pistol was on the seat, and we were driving back.  And I remember the lights, and, and the lights came from behind, and he pulled over, which is something he wouldn't normally do.  But this particular night he actually pulled over on the dirt road.  And he, he said to me, he said, now poppy's gonna get out of the car, and I'm gonna lock the door.  And he put the gun in my hands.  He said I want you to take this gun, and I want you to get right down there under the dashboard.  And he said if anybody opens this door, I want you to pull that trigger.  So I did what he told me to do.  So I got on the floor, and I hunched down under the dashboard, and I had the gun in my hand.  And he got out, and he locked the door.  And 'cause for me it seemed like forever, but I, you know, I heard the noise.  I, I could see like flashes of something running by the car.  I didn't know what it was.  You know, and I heard the yelling, and I heard the screaming.  And then I just heard these sounds, you know, these awful sounds.  And I, and I heard him screaming and yelling.  And I don't really know, to this day, how long I was under there.  I mean, for me, it, it seemed like forever, and I, I remember I was crying 'cause I knew they were doing something to my daddy.  And I heard 'em saying nigger, and I just heard them screaming.  And I knew they were doing something really bad to him, but he told me not to move.  He told me only to move if they opened that door.  And then I heard voices.  And I heard voices saying Alexis, it's all right, it's all right.  I'm coming to the car.  It's Father Warren, it's Father Warren, it's okay, it's Father Warren, it's Father Warren.  And then the door opened, and it was Father Warren.  And I, I, I looked through the door, and I remember I jumped up, and I saw them carrying my father, and had blood all over him.  And I thought he was dead.  And my father had straight black hair, and I remember--and he was a well-kept man.  And his clothes were all torn, and his hair was all down in his face.  And they were like carrying him, you know.  So, anyway--
Speaker 2: That was pretty traumatic for a five year-old, don't you think?
Speaker 1: Oh, for years I didn't even talk about it.  I was a grown woman before I even talked about it, I mean literally.  And--
Story_ID: 86261
Speaker 1: How did Father Warren know what--
Speaker 2: Well, I know, 'cause I learned later, that they knew there was gonna be trouble that night, or they suspected it.  Because you see, they were meeting to, to do their own organizing, and Father Warren was just concerned about my father [Alex Herman] getting back home safely.  And as a second thought, they decided to form a little posse to follow him.  And apparently, at first my father had said no, it was going to be okay, and so we had left.  But I gather they were sitting there and still talking about what they suspected was going on that night, because this was a time when the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] had been very active.  And the group of men who had been sitting there at the meeting with Father Warren said we'd better follow Alex.  We'd better just make sure that he gets back to the highway okay, because these were like, you know, dirt roads.  And so what happened was, I don't know, maybe fifteen, twenty minutes later, they just got in their cars and decided to make sure that my father had sort of gotten out of the, the narrow dirt passages, because it was, you know, Daphne was not, like I said, you know, they didn't have paved roads or, or anything back up in that area where we had to go.  And so they just, on a hunch really, followed my father, and were able to sort of have this--so the noises and everything that I heard was literally this other band of cars that had been at the meeting.  And the Klan, you know, they disbursed.  And I also know that they got a tip.  You see, one of the things that was interesting in terms of the, the Catholic Church at the time, they, they knew some of these men who were in the Klan.  And so every now and then, through the confessional, you know, through maybe guilt, the priest or some parishioner would get word of what the Klan activity was.  So in a way it was a kind of an underground network that, that they would get intelligence from.
Speaker 1: And your father then--do you remember seeing him afterwards or--I mean did, did Father--
Speaker 2: They took him to the hospital.
Speaker 1: They took him to the hospital.  They took you home, to your mother?
Speaker 2: Took me home.
Speaker 1: Okay, was your moth--was your mother away then?
Speaker 2: No, my mother was home.
Speaker 1: So she was pretty frightened?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  It was a terrible night.  It was a terrible Christmas.  It was a terrible night.  I remember that night.
Speaker 1: She probably didn't want you going around--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --with your father much--(laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, that's, that's why I say--
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: That, that's why--(laughter)--that's why I said in later years, I think when she saw my own passion, she was, she was--
Speaker 1: She was really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that, that's--but in the earlier years, she was not--I mean she knew it was dangerous, and, and she was very protective, as mothers are, you know.
Story_ID: 86262
Speaker 1: So now, you--school, what age were you going to school shortly after that then?  Did you go 'cause you were--
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to kindergarten.  Yeah, I actually started like when I was four--Ms. Annie Mae Allem (ph.), before I went to Ms. Daniels, my first real kindergarten teacher, un-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what school?
Speaker 2: Heart of Mary had a little kindergarten at the time.  I had Catholic training all the way through, from kindergarten through grade school.  I went to St. Peter Claver Grade School, and then I went to Heart of Mary High School, and then I started off at a Catholic college.  Actually, I graduated from Xavier, which is a Catholic college, but I started off in a different Catholic college, Edgewood College of the Sacred Heart.  So I basically had a Catholic education from kindergarten through college.
Story_ID: 86263
Speaker 1: Now what were things, what other things were influencing you, or other stories, you know, sort of growing up?  Can you talk about some of those?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, my, my, my first real experience I think that was a life changing experience for me in terms of what it means to take risks and sort of giving me my own courage--I can look back on it now and see, and I didn't know it at the time--I was fifteen years old.  I'll never forget it.  And, and schools were segregated.  I was a sophomore.  And every year there was this annual May Day celebration, where all the Catholic schools--it was the only time that all the Catholic schools came together in a non-segregated environment for the annual crowing of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  And we would meet in the city park, Hartwell Field.  But the black schools always had to march behind the white schools in the procession into the park and take your appointed places.  And then there would be this ceremony and celebration on the field.  And someone from the white Catholic high school, a young woman, a senior, always got to crown the Blessed Virgin Mary that year.  She was the May Day queen, and they would have the escorts.  And every year, you know, it was the front-page story in the Mobile "Press-Register."  And this particular year--I was always taught by an uncle, who was a big influence in my life, to read the papers.  You know, he would always--and he used to teach me about the lack of images of black people and black stories and positive messages.  And, and he would train me to read the newspaper that way.  And he used to always write letters to the editor that never got published, but he would send them around in the community, show 'em what he wrote to the editor.  So it was like a secondary newspaper response.  Anyway, this particular day, there we were, front-page story, area Catholic high schools march in annual May Day celebration, and then the names of all the participants, there it was, and had area Catholic high schools.  It listed all the Catholic high schools, and it didn't list Heart of Mary.  And I don't know what snapped in me that day.  But I thought well, our name's not even in the newspaper, you know.  And I know we're not in the procession, but our name's not even in the newspaper as an area Catholic high school.  So I cut the article out of the paper, put it in my uniform pocket--we had to wear uniforms for this celebration--and I was determined that I was gonna ask Bishop  [Thomas Joseph] Toolen why we were not at least listed in the newspaper.  And I wasn't sure how I was gonna get to him, I was just determined that I was gonna get the answer to that question.  So, we go, we meet at Hartwell Field.  We'd all practiced so we knew exactly the lineup and where we were supposed to go.  And I took my seat along with my class.  And we marched behind the white kids, and I watched the procession come out on the field, and saw Bishop Toolen and all the other priests.  And I raised my hand, and I asked my homeroom teacher, Sister Alberta, if I could be excused to go to the bathroom.  She said I could, but I had to come right back.  So, I left the stands--and this is a baseball dugout--and I walked down.  And I thought well, maybe if I just stand here at the entrance 'cause I--where they're gonna come back in, maybe I can just show him the article, get the question out right away, and get an answer.  And I noticed that there was a policeman walking up and down this one area where the dressing rooms were.  And he went in one and came out, and then he was sort of doing the patrol, and onto the field.  And then I thought, I wonder if that's the dressing room.  So I opened the door where I saw him come out, and I went in, and sure enough, that was the big dressing room where they had all disrobed.  So I decided I was just gonna wait there in the dressing room.  That was better, when Bishop Toolen came back in.  And then I would just ask him, get the answer to the questions, and then for some reason it would satisfy the anger that I had; I had anger.  And by now I'm, I'm really into why is the church segregated?  And why is Mobile segregated?  Why are we living like second class citizens?  And I didn't understand, and it's also '63' [1963], and it's the height of everything else that's going on.
Story_ID: 86264
Speaker 1: So, I finally--I don't know how long I was there, but I heard them coming back in, and I heard the door open.  Well, when the door started open, there was this big table in the middle of the room draped in like these white alter cloths where the hassocks and things were on, and I lost my nerve.  So I crawled under the table, and I hid under the table, under this tablecloth.  And I thought I'll just wait, and I'll do this another day, so I waited right there.  And then gradually, I saw these garments coming off, hitting the floor, you know, 'cause they had on like all the boy tops and hassocks and stuff, you know.  And so they were obviously taking their clothes off and dropping them on the floor.  And I could hear the voices and everything in the room, and I thought oh, my God, I'm in this room and these priest are disrobing (laughter), you know.  I don't what motivated me to come out.  The fact that I was there, and they were taking their clothes off, or maybe I thought somebody was gonna catch me.  I don't know.  So, I just remember I crawled out from under that table.  And I was on my knees, and I looked up, and there was a dead silence in the room.  And here are all of these big white men standing around--of course they seem like giants now to me, or at the time they did.  And I look over, and there's Bishop [Thomas Joseph] Toolen sitting in this big chair in the corner.  He was a big fat man.  And there was one priest who knew me, Monsignor James, Bill James, and he said Alexis Herman, what are you doing in here?  And I said, I came to kiss the bishop's ring.  And so I rushed over to the bishop, I dropped to my knees, and they're all like still like in shock that I'm in this room.  I grab his hand, and I take the big ring--you know, that's what you're trained to do as a good Catholic girl--I kiss his ring, I reach in my uniform pocket, I pull this article out, and I just spill it out, you know.  And I said Bishop Toolen, I really wanted to ask you was this.
Story_ID: 85151
Speaker 1: So you are, you are saying you're rushing over.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  So, I, I kissed his [Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen] ring.  And I reach into my uniform pocket, and I pull the article out.  And I just, you know, I figured I'd got it there in black and white; you know, he couldn't dispute it.  I said this is all the area Catholic high schools.  Heart of Mary is not even listed.  We've never been able to participate in the crowning of the Blessed Virgin Mary; we're never in the procession.  And I just wanna know do you consider us to be an area Catholic high school?  Well, he just turned beet red.  And by now, you know, everybody is like, you should not be confronting the bishop this way, you know.  Does Sister Dismas  know you're here?  She was the principal.  And I'm like, no, nobody knows I'm here.  And so, then he says well, you really should not be in here.  You are being disrespectful to the bishop, and you can be sure that Sister Dismas is gonna hear about this first thing in the morning.  So, you know, they dismissed me, and they're like all in an uproar that I have come in there, and I've confronted the bishop like this.  And so I look at Monsignor James, who's the only one I really know in the room, to see, you know--and he's like, this is a problem, you know, this is a problem.  So I rush back, 'cause by now, I mean I--you know, they're filing out, and 'cause we're last--we're the last ones to leave anyway, so I rush back into our area, and I file out.  And Sister Alberta's going where have you been?  So I didn't say anything.  I didn't tell anybody what I'd done.  I was so scared afterwards, you know, like--but he didn't answer my question, so I still didn't get the answer.  I didn't tell anybody.  I started to tell my mama when I got home that night, but I thought, mm-mm (laughter).  So I go to class the next morning.  I'm in my homeroom class.  You know, I was a pretty good student, you know, and I was active and class president, you know.  And so, I didn't never, I never got called into the principal's office.  So, every morning, your name got called out over the loudspeaker for disciplinary action you had to the principal's office.  So that morning, first name that came out over the loudspeaker was Alexis Herman, please report to the principal's office.  So everybody's looking like you gotta go to the principal's office?  So I knew right away, you know, so I got up.  And Sister Alberta, the same homeroom teacher says something you haven't told me?  I said I'll tell you when I get back.  She was a big influence on me, by the way.  And so I go to the principal's office, and Sister Dismas is just in a rage.  And she's standing there in her white habit.  And she says you tell me you did not do this.  You tell me you did not embarrass this school this way.  You tell me you did not do this.  And I said what did they say I did?  She says did you go into, and then repeats the whole story.  And did you confront the bishop this way?  And I said yes, Sister Dismas, I did.  She said Alexis Herman, you are being expelled immediately from school.  You have brought disgrace on this school.  You go and you get your books, and you leave immediately, and you're not to come back until you bring both of your parents with you.  And so I just start crying, and I start trying to explain to her why I did what I did, and you know, newspaper article.  I'm going through the same story, and that we're--if we're a Catholic high school, why weren't we in the newspaper?  We can never participate in the May Day crowning.  It wasn't fair, and I felt like that we were entitled to an answer.  And she's like, you're out of here.  So I go back to my classroom, and I'm crying, and I tell Sister Alberta what I did.  She's now Sister Patricia.  I tell her what I did and that I was being put out of school.  And she got these big tears in her eyes, and she said Alexis, you did the right thing.  I'll never forget that as long as I live.
Story_ID: 85152
Speaker 1: So I go get my books, and I got put out of school.  And I walked, I walked all the way to my father's [Alex Herman] office.  And I used to sometimes walk, you know, from school to my dad's office, and he'd give me a ride home.  And so this particular morning I walked all the way to his office, and I went there and I cried all the way, carrying my books.  I was just mad.  I was just mad.  And so I get there, and he hadn't even gotten there yet, and they called him and told him that I was, you know, at the office.  And he came over there, and I told him what had happened.  You have never seen my father so upset as he was at that moment.  If I thought he was gonna curse in his lifetime, it would have been then.  He was so angry that I had been expelled, and he was so proud of what I had done, you know, that, you know, it, it was like--he called my mother at school and told her what had happened.  And the next thing I knew, my father had called all the parents.  They had a meeting night, and everybody was boycotting the school.  And they said until we get an answer to this question, and until we're able to come up with a plan to deal with our own racial problems in this diocese, in this high schools, we're not coming back.  And so it became the genesis for the talks that actually started in our community to desegregate our high schools.  And so they came up with a plan that the next year we were gonna have our first exchange of students who would go to McGill-Toolen [Catholic High School].  Those are white schools.  No one, of course, was coming to Heart of Mary.  The issue was integrating the white schools.  And so they went through a process of selecting students that would be the first students to integrate the white Catholic high schools.  But the good news was the next year we had a participant in the May Day procession.  We ran the procession the next year, and the first woman to do it was, was Marie DeTage (ph.); she got to march in the first May Day procession at Hartwell Field.  So, I tell you that story because I--I don't even remember what the question was you asked me now.  But you asked me something about some of my earliest recollection, and I think for me, it was the first time of taking what I con--was a big risk I guess.  But I got positive reinforcement from my parents, from the community, from my teachers, Sister Patricia.  And, and it was like, you know, and we got change; we got results.  I saw something happen, you know; I saw something happen.  And so for me, it just kind of shaped me, you know.  So I guess all that I was learning over the years, but that experience, it was sort of like getting past a fear of confronting Bishop Toolen has helped me over the years overcome lots of fears.  Because, you know, I always say that you have to get into the habit of taking risks.  You have to always keep practicing it, you know, and each time it gets easier and easier.  And you never will lose the fear and anxiety, it just, you just get more courage each time you have to step out on point, you know.
Story_ID: 85153
Speaker 1: Now Sister Patri--is it Sister Patricia?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Why was she such an influence on you?
Speaker 2: You know, she had a little leadership group.  It was called the Young Christian Leadership Association.  Again, I think because it was segregated, and we couldn't participate in the diocesan, diocesan program, she started her own with us.  She started leadership teaching and, and leadership seminars like in high school when I was a freshman.  And she introduced us to great writings, and we had to read books and talk about them, and, and debate them, and, and get our thoughts out.  I mean she, she was like challenging us and I think in a way to defy the stereotypes around us.  And so these sessions with her, these afterschool classes, beyond the books, were very important.  And she was very involved in my mother's life, in terms of she had an enormous respect for my mother as a teacher.  And they would talk a lot about just teaching and the kids my mother was involved in.  And so they had, they had a real friendship; she and Sister Patricia, they had a real friendship.  And I think that was--she always felt like I think there was a kind of sadness maybe with my mother that she connected with, you know, that somehow my mother didn't get to live out her full potential, and I think she saw that in my mom.  But I think leadership lessons I learned from her early on, and just training me how to be an independent thinker and helping to discipline my mind.  And as I had to make decisions about different things during those phases of my life, she was someone that I could confide in, and she kept my confidence, and, and she also opened up a white world to me.  I could ask her questions about white people and experiences that I didn't have, and feel like I was getting an honest answer.  So there was an auth--an authenticity to the relationship.
Story_ID: 85154
Speaker 1: Did--were there other people that were influencing you to, you know, besides the Sister [Patricia]?  Were there--'cause you're, you're talking your grandmother.  Was that your natural grandmother, the--
Speaker 2: No, this was the one who helped to raise my--
Speaker 1: Helped--
Speaker 2: --mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The one in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And her--
Speaker 2: Well, there were two natural grandmothers here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was--well, I don't have two natural grandmothers (unclear)--(laughter)--
Speaker 1: But I didn't mean, I didn't mean that even--but you do have--you have one--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--that was my real grandmother, who's my mother moth--and then there was her best friend, who helped to raise my mother.  Remember I told you that my great-grandmother was really the big figure in helping to raise my mother because we were poor.  And, and my grandmother needed help raising the four kids, so her best friend didn't have children, and so she stepped in really as a surrogate mother for my mother.  She lived in Chicago.  She lived in Chicago.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Margaret Dozier (ph.).
Speaker 1: Margaret Dozier.  Now, is she the one who got up at the, at the, that you talk about at the luncheon with the--where you getting the award?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: You know, and--
Speaker 2: I tell lots of stories about her.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Is this the one she said I had a hearing problem?  Is that the story?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, this is the one that--
Speaker 2: Oh, and the FBI--
Speaker 1: No, no, no--
Speaker 2: --when I--
Speaker 1: No, no, this is another one where she said it's fine to give her awards, but she's needs a--
Speaker 2: Oh, needs a husband.  Oh, yeah (laughter), she's the one.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's the one.
Speaker 1: She's like I've been married three times.
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, I was mortified.  That's right let's have them married once, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) She has not--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --been married once.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that was--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --that was her.  No, and she's still living.  She's 99.
Speaker 1: She's still live--he is?
Speaker 2: Un-huh?
Speaker 1: Is she still in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, she's still in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Dozier, that's where I've the--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's still in Chicago.  She lives at 35th and Michigan in that senior citizen's building there, yeah.  And I spent all my summers growing up in Chicago with her.  I got shipped off to Chicago in the summers.  I was a very mobile baby.  And that's who I spent my summers with, in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So, so-
Speaker 2: Do you remember the Chicago [Illinois] of that--'cause it was much different than Mobile [Alabama].
Speaker 1: Oh, it was much different.  Oh, Chicago was much different.  You had the el; you had the trains, you know.  It was apartment living in Chicago, you know, and you could go downtown, and you could eat at a lunch counter, Goldblatt's, you know.  You could get food in line with the white people and not have to be in a separate line, oh yes.  You could sit in the front of the bus.  Oh, I remember the difference very well, yeah.
Story_ID: 85155
Speaker 1: Now, you also talk about the third grade, 'cause I wanna take--and you know, how someone called you out of your name, you know, because your parents weren't married.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did that--and you said that influenced, you know, that hurt you a great deal, as it would anyone.  And I'm just wondering, did that, did that make you feel different from the community at that point, and did you feel that you had to put on a face sort of, or did you go and ask your mother what was going on?  I'm just--
Speaker 2: I did both.  You know, my parents--I was, I was close to both parents growing up, and so I had this notion that somehow they were divorced and that I was still their child.  I didn't know that they had never been married, 'cause they just never told me that before.  And so I already felt some stigma because of divorce, because in the Catholic Church you don't divorce.  So there was already that.  So it never occurred to me that they had never been married.  So when my girlfriend told me that, I said that's not true.  My parents are divorced.  She said no, your parents were never married.  And I just insisted that wasn't true.  And I went home and I told my mother what she'd said, and I asked her if that was true.  And she told me it was, that they had never been married before.  That was the first time I knew.  I didn't know before that.  And I felt different for a lot of reasons, you know.  That was just compounding it I suppose.
Story_ID: 85156
Speaker 1: But there was a part of me over the years I think not to be labeled as Alex Herman's bastard child, you know.  And I--it was important to me that he be proud of me, and whatever this notion of illegitimate meant, that somehow I wasn't going to be illegitimate, you know.
Speaker 2: In that, so how did you do that?  Did you do it by getting good grade?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Did you--
Speaker 1: I did it by getting good grades.  I think it was mostly--I think it was a combination of good grades, and they used to use the term docile to describe me as a child.  I think I was always conscious of not getting in fights.  I was never an argu--and argumentative child.  I think there was a part of me that somehow was grateful that my mama didn't abort me, that she had me, and that I still had a father figure in my life, and that I wanted my parents to be proud of me.  And so, as a child, you do things to win the favor of your parents, so I, you know, got good grades in school.  I can even remember my father loved racehorses, and I used to think sometimes he wanted me to be a boy, 'cause I could run.  I could run.  And one of my pastimes used to be running, just from one corner from one corner to the next and running back to the house.  And I can see him with this stopwatch, and he would time me.  And he would say you got back this time in however ever minutes it was or--and you know, I, I always wanted him to be proud of me, whether it was running up and down the street and beating that clock or making good grades, you know.  And you never know growing up all the things you're reacting to.  I can look back now and, and realize that a big part of me was working at it, you know, didn't feel like it at the time.  I was just, wanted to get the favor of my parents.  And--
Speaker 2: And you're your father's namesake too.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I was, yeah.
Speaker 2: --was planned, so it was no--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --no mistaking you.
Speaker 1: Right, that was the other big thing.  Actually, my first name they tell me was Minnie Margaret.  My mother's grandmother, the one who raised her, her name was Minnie, and my mother's mother was Margaret.  And so my mother named me Minnie Margaret for both grandparents.  That was the name she had picked out.  And apparently she had a very difficult pregnancy and was not well for the first couple of days.  And when she came to, they said my daddy said no, we're gonna call her Alexis.  I'm glad (laughter).  I would not have wanted to be Minnie Margaret (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You would have a whole different dynamic out there (laughter), same person, but different dynamic.  Now you had mentioned your half--you had a stepbrother too.  You mentioned that.  Was he in your life?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, he wasn't.
Speaker 1: Not until I was grown.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I actually met him, really, to really to meet him for the first time I was in the [President Jimmy] Carter Administration as director of the Women's Bureau.  I had seen him at my father's funeral.  We had a, an encounter at my father's funeral.  But I didn't really meet him for the first time until, to talk with him, until I was really grown.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 85157
Speaker 1: Now, how about your friends, who were they?  You know, Peggy; who, who was this black community, you know, or your friends and what were the things?  I know in her interview she talked about, you know, her mother and, and you know, insistence on dressing and things (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Ms. Gladys (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--she was sort of a counter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of, of--yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering what--you know, who were your friends and who were, you know, helping form you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause isn't there's--that also, I know her as Joan Small, but she grew up also in Mobile, right?
Speaker 2: Joan?
Speaker 1: Joan, her sis-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Jane Lefowich (ph.).
Speaker 2: But they--but were you--
Speaker 1: But they didn't really grow up in Mobile per se.
Speaker 2: They didn't?  Oh, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Not per se, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, I got you.
Speaker 1: I think, I think they came--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I think they were small.
Speaker 2: I see, okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I think Maxine left.  She would come back though.  She had an aunt.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They were close to my father's side of my family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the Lefowiches.  I can't remember the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --maiden name there, but I know exactly who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I know-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA FEMALE VOICE):  Gloria, Gloria, Gloria Bennett.
Speaker 1: Oh, Gloria, yeah, Gloria Bennett.
Speaker 2: Okay, Gloria Bennett, right.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: [HM] Lerone [Bennett] yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, was it--
Speaker 1: Sylvester.
Speaker 2: --is from Mobile?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gloria's from--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Mobile.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: She and my mother were very good friends.  As a matter of fact, she's claimed she's the one who really came up with the idea of Alexis (laughter).  That's what Gloria tells (laughter).
Speaker 2: Everyone's claiming it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what Gloria tells me (laughter).  That's what she says.
Speaker 2: That's cute.
Speaker 1: So, but who would--who were your friends at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, my friends at--it was sort of like two sets of friends.  The, the neighborhood kids, like [HM] Peggy [Cooper] and you know, whoever the neighborhood kids were you grew up with and then your classmates, you know.  I can't say that, as, as I look back on, on my group of friends, I don't know that we were terribly different from a group of, of, of young girls growing up with the, with the--to--except our parents did everything with us.  It wasn't like the parents were always a part of our social life.  Like if I went to--except for Peggy's house.  We didn't socialize with Peggy's parents as per se, although all the kids would end up at Peggy's house.  But most of the parents were working parents, and the social time, when the kids got together, was also the time when the adults could come together.  And so it was much more of Hillary [Clinton] says it takes a village to raise a child.  I mean we really were a village.  Everybody was everybody else's mama in that sense.  And I think that's what was very different about my childhood.  I mean when I think of my good girlfriends, Alita, Lolita, I, I think of their parents.  You don't think of the parents (unclear), but I do, Joyce and her mother, they were never disconnected.  And you decided where you were gonna end up eating that day, and who was cooking, and, and where the kids would end up.  And you spend the night, and it was just sort of accepted that three or four of you would spend the night together, and, and the parents would take care of you.  My house tended to be a gathering place, and as we got older, Peggy's house was a gathering place 'cause we could dance, and they had a big house.  And that was a place where you could really dance, you know.  But growing up, my house was probably the gathering place where most of the kids hung out.  And I think the fact that I was an only child also made a difference, 'cause I always wanted to have lots of friends around me.  But they always stressed education.  They always, you know, were very disciplined about clean fun.  And I had one girlfriend who ended up living with me, who really was very close to me.  She came to live with me when she was finishing eighth grade because they didn't have a black Catholic high school, and she'd gone to grade school all of her life in, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and that was like forty-five minutes from Mobile [Alabama].  And so she came to live with me to go to Heart of Mary, which was the only black Catholic high school in the whole southern half of Alabama and Mississippi for that matter.  So she came to go to Heart of Mary, and she lived with me.  That's why they talk about busing.  She would take the Greyhound bus home on the weekends to Pascagoula just so she could go to high school, or her parents would drive her back and forth.  She lived with me during the high school year, so it's the closest person I had to a sister.  She was a very close girlfriend, and she's to this day my best girlfriend.  She went to the convent when we graduated.  She didn't stay in the convent.  She left after a number of years, and she's now married and living in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Paulette.
Speaker 1: Oh, Paulette, okay.
Story_ID: 85158
Speaker 1: Now, you, what is--just one other question about--what was the young Peggy coup--what was the young Alexis Herman, what was she like?  What were you wanting to be, or what were you sort of, you know, thinking about?  Were you--you know, you said people had called you docile, but you know, you also had a lot of fire in you.  So I'm just wondering, you know, what you were like.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess growing up as a child, I was always considered like to be the leader of our little group.  I was always organizing, whether it was parties at the house, or sleepovers, or projects to take food in the neighborhood for people who didn't have food.  I was, I was always busy in organizing something.  My mother used to always say she would come home and not know sometimes who I was feeding at the table, because I would just--some kid didn't have lunch that day at school, I'd bring 'em home and make them a part of our family.  So, I was always busy.  I was always organizing.  I was always doing something, and I always liked being around my family.  So family time and family weekends were very important.  And I just assumed that that's what everybody's life was supposed to be like, really committed to friends and family.  When I was in school, I generally took the lead in most projects and always tried to encourage the kids to, to compete, whether it was baseball or games that we would play.  I had a lot of friends.  I never felt deprived as a child.  I guess I was, I was just sort of raised up to believe in community service.  I don't know where it came from, may--'cause of my parents.  So growing up, I can--I was just always doing things, whether it was cleanup projects in the neighborhood or the Junior NAACP.  I was one of the first organizers of the junior chapter of the N--National Council of Negro Women in Mobile, Miss Bestidum (ph.) when I was twelve years old.  'Cause she wanted to teach us how to have tea parties, and I didn't know what a tea party was, come and wear your gloves, sit there and have tea, and talk about what happened in church that day, you know.
Story_ID: 85159
Speaker 1: And so you have, you might be Robert Williams, Mardi Gras king for 2003 King Alexis the first, that's, that's your title.  So every king is in the lineage (laughter), is in the lineage of, of King Alexis.
Speaker 2: So you're saying that there were white Mardi Gras too?  There--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: To this day.
Speaker 2: Today.
Speaker 1: To this day.
Speaker 2: But you always hear of it been having the African tradition when--
Speaker 1: Yep, yep, to this day, there's a black king a black--and for years, I mean even to this day, just from a society standpoint--here's another one of these growing up stories--people looked towards Mardi Gras.  I mean we didn't have clubs or thing that we could participate in, so the social life and sanctioning, acceptance, if you will, grew up around Mardi Gras traditions.  So the parties, the balls, and what clubs you join all came out of this Mardi Gras tradition, and the committee that selects the king and the queen each year and the royal court.  And it used to be that you had to, you know, be a professional.  You had to have graduated from college.  You had to be doing something with your life to be a role model for the community, and we even had a mayor for five days.  So we had our own form of government.  It was the only--and I mean we took it seriously because this was our form of government, if you will, and there's a mayor that rules over Alexis Land for five days the grand marshal and, and, and the king of misrule and merriment and joy.  But they would always try to bring a degree of, of seriousness to it.  So the young ladies who were selected for the court were aspiring young women in the community.  And the escorts had to be aspiring young men.  And the king had to be someone who was accomplished, as well as the queen.  And that's when we made the newspaper.  That's the only time we made the newspaper.  As a matter of fact, I was the first queen to make the front page of the Mobile "Press-Register."  It was a very big deal, 1974.  You know, before we were always back pages, but at least we were in there.
Story_ID: 85160
Speaker 1: And so, you wanted to be a (unclear)--when you go off to Xavier [University in New Orleans, Louisiana], what do you want--I mean--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At that point in my life?
Speaker 1: --just wait, wait.  You went to--
Speaker 2: Edgewood [College in Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: --Edgewood first.  What did you want to--
Speaker 2: By the time I was entering college, I really thought I wanted to be a psychiatric social worker.
Speaker 1: And where did that come from?
Speaker 2: It came from I think a recognition from the pediatrician role of, of the medical, wanting to help people and by this time, realizing that I, I seemed to always end up helping people solve through their problems, and, and working, working with families that were in pain.  So it wasn't so much the physical that I was reacting to.  It was really the emotional, and I think my own upbringing, my own family, my mother's own emotional struggles.  My mother from time to time had a drinking problem.  And I used to sit for hours trying to understand what was going on, you know, what--why she would just suddenly snap into that world, and, and working to bring her out of that world, you know.  I think it was all those experiences that made me think I really wanted to be a psychiatric social worker.  And I think they used to tease me too about being a social worker, sort of like I was always doing something with, with families, you know, in the neighborhood.  So they used to tease me about being an old soul and being a social worker.  And I didn't quite understand how to bridge this notion of being a helper in the community, being "a social worker" with what I wanted to do in terms of the mind and medicine.  And I think it was Sister Patricia actually who helped me as I was thinking about it.  And she says why don't you think about psychiatric social--or why not just psychiatry it, itself?  But I also was conscious of, by that time, while my father was helpful, he was in poor health by this time.  So I was scholarship dependent, and I had to work while I was in college.  So the notion of having the money, quite frankly, to go to medical school to pursue the dream of, of a medical career in psychiatry wasn't something that I thought financially my family or I could navigate.  And so psychiatric social work seemed like a bridge, something that I could see myself getting to grad school and working my way to pay for that.  I couldn't see the finances being there or medical school when it was really psychiatry that I was thinking about.  So that's really how I got there.
Story_ID: 85161
Speaker 1: And so you went to Edge, Edgewood [College in Madison, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And you'd went--now why did you transfer to Xavier [University in New Orleans, Louisiana]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Because my father had a stroke and was dying my sophomore year, and I had to come back and forth a couple of times during the year.  And that particular year they didn't expect him to live the year out.  And so by that second half of the year, they, they didn't give him long to live, and I didn't want to be away.  So I dropped out of school, dropped out of Xavier to be at home with him, with the idea being that Springhill College was a local Jesuit college in Mobile [Alabama], Catholic college, that I could transfer to.  And I could go to school in Mobile and still be there with him.  So that was the thought.  So that's what I did.  I withdrew from Edgewood.  I went to Springhill College, which was a Jesuit school in Mobile.  And, and by now, there are few blacks here and there going to Springhill College, not a lot.  This was an all-white Jesuit college.  And I could be a day student there.  I'm not even sure at that time if I could even, could've lived on campus, probably not.  But at any rate, I could be a day student.  So that's what I did, I took classes at Springhill College.  And then gradually my father improved, you know.  He, he didn't pass that year, and he recovered from the stroke.  He was never the same.  And so I decided to go to Xavier in New Orleans 'cause I was closer to home.  And I felt like that if, if he didn't recuperate or something else happened, that at least I was right there in New Orleans.  And so I transferred to Xavier, and I finished from Xavier, and then I went back to Mobile after I graduated from Xavier.
Speaker 1: Now, your--just one thing.  (Unclear) did your father, when was he alder--I mean not a, a ward, ward leader--
Speaker 2: It's like 1945.
Speaker 1: So his--
Speaker 2: --forty--
Speaker 1: He was really in failing health when the civil right--I mean the sits--the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s], right.
Speaker 1: --movement was paying out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So he was an older man and not--
Speaker 2: He was--right.
Speaker 1: --and in failing health, okay, during that time.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 85162
Speaker 1: So, so you go back to Mobile [Alabama], and then what happens then?  I mean what, what are you doing?  Are you moving back, you know, with your mother?  Are you--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, I moved back to my mom.  I'm still committed to psychiatric social work.  My plan is that fall to go to Atlanta University to pursue a degree in psychiatric social work.  That was my plan, and, and I was gonna work that summer to save money.  But a curious thing happened on the way.  I got involved--first of all, I couldn't find a job.  I tell this story all the time about job hunting, you know, my first job.  And I couldn't find a job.  I tell the story about this bank executive.  You've heard that story, right?
Speaker 1: But tell it.
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm going around doing the old resume, you know, job after job after job after job.  And then finally, First National Bank, bank guy, thought he really wanted to hire me, bank executive there.  And, and he was having a hard time though.  I mean I knew he was struggling 'cause he knew my father, and I thought he wanted to offer me a job.  So he says, you know, Alexis, I really would like to hire you says.  You know, maybe I can hire you.  Maybe I can get you in as a teller.  He said if you're lucky, you're lucky, I might be able to get you one of those secretary jobs, you know.  And I often say that I'd love to know where that bank executive is now, 'cause I'd love to be able to say, sir, I did become a secretary, you know.  But I didn't get that job either, as a secretary or a bank teller.
Story_ID: 85163
Speaker 1: And finally, I was volunteering during the meantime at the parish church, working in the housing project there in Roger Williams Housing Project.  And I was working on tenants' rights.  I was doing organizing with the tenants there with the Mobile Housing Authority on tenants' rights, and I got very involved with it.  And, and I stated realizing that nobody in the housing projects were registered, and that was, you know, a big issue in terms of just--this is '69' [1969]--on what we needed to do to, to make the demands on the city.  And so I got very involved in that community, registering of people there, forming a tenants association, confronting the Mobile Housing Authority on just the conditions, and the treatments, and the services.  And the priest at the time, who was one of those priest in the room with Bishop  [Thomas Joseph] Toolen is now a local parish priest in this St. Frances Xavier, attached to this housing project.  He's had a metamorphosis in his life, and is no longer like a diocesan official, but one of the parish, so he's like the parish priest here.  And he offers me the opportunity to work attached to the parish that summer to continue my organizing efforts.  And so that was really my first job out of school, and that's what I was doing. So I was doing organizing, and I was attached to St. Frances Xavier Church.  And gradually, over the course of that summer, he says to me, you know, you really should think about staying with this project 'cause we've just got it where we've got the attention of the city officials.  Would you consider delaying going to school for a year, and let's see if we can, you know, bring this?  We were trying to get everything done, really, new buildings, new everything.  And, and I was getting 'em registered to vote, and they were becoming a political force; you know, they were becoming a political force.  So, he got me an interview with Catholic Charities in Mobile, and said if I can get you on as a social worker there, as a caseworker, and get you assigned here, but you know, you'll have to do some other things as a caseworker there, would you consider it?  So I said I would, so that's what happened.  So I got the job as a caseworker at Catholic Charities.  I still got--so that was my day job, and the housing projects was really my night job.  And, and I was doing casework during the day, traditional kind of social service work, and got very involved with black babies in trying to find foster homes.  Because during that time, you know, you couldn't--you know, black adoption was not on anybody's mind in the state of Alabama.  You were lucky to get 'em in an orphanage.  So I was really trying to find black homes for these babies; that's, that's what I was doing.  And I ended up with two myself, and a little boy and little girl, Lisa and Lamont.  Anyway, so I had the kids.  I had my work.  And I just go so involved that I decided I was not gonna go off to Atlanta, Georgia, that I was gonna go to school at night and work on my degree at [University of] South Alabama [Mobile, Alabama].  That's when my mom was going back, so we both enrolled in South Alabama.
Story_ID: 85164
Speaker 1: And so I did my graduate work, coursework in the evenings, and I was doing these other things.  And George Wallace was governor of the state of Alabama.  And they had the White House Conference on Children and Youth.  This is 1971 now, and the whole year has gone, and I've been doing the tenants' rights work and the casework.  And it's 1971, and the White House Conference on Children and Youth, and the state of Alabama got to send six youth delegates, I think it was, and two had to be--I guess we had eighth youth delegates, that's what it was; four had to be from high school, and four were like young adults up to age twenty-five.  And they had made a decision to have one black high school student and two black young adults.  And then they went through this elaborate interview process of kids in the state of Alabama to be these delegates selected from the state of Alabama, and I got nominated.  And that's how it worked.  You had to nominate; you had to have a community, communities nominating.  So Catholic Charities in the community that I was working in, Roger Williams, but mainly it was the Catholic Charities community, nominated me to be considered as a delegate by the Wallace Review Committee to the White House Conference on Children and Youth.  And lo and behold, I got selected.  And to this day, I don't quite know how it happened, but I got selected.  And so it was myself and a young man from Tuskegee [Alabama] called Milton Carver Davis.  His daddy is a famous attorney who was very active in the civil rights struggle.  But Milton and I were the young adults.  I was selected from Mobile, the Mobile area, the southern half of the state, and he represented the northern half of the state, Montgomery [Alabama], Birmingham [Alabama].  And Milton and I were the two black kids that day that got to go in and meet with then governor of the state of Alabama, George Wallace, to get our charge to represent the state of Alabama at the White House Conference on Children and Youth.  And they took us through a little orientation program.  It's the first time I'd really met Wallace, first time I'd ever been inside any state office building, in fact in any office building, come to think about it.  It was my first time in the state capitol.
Story_ID: 85165
Speaker 1: So, I went to Estes Park, Colorado--it was 1971--as a delegate.  I hadn't seen [HM] Peggy Cooper in years.  Peggy got elected that year from the District of Columbia.  This is our renewal.  And I'm with the Alabama group.  And there are all these kids from all these states in this camp, this big camp.  And I look across the room, 'cause you know, you can always spot black people wherever you go, right, 'cause the D.C. delegation was all black (laughter).  It was like all these black people from Washington, D.C.  It was great.  In the midst of it there's Peggy Cooper.  She's looking, and I'm looking.  Is that Peggy, you know?  So we reconnect, and we hug, and you know, Peggy's all involved in Washington.  And we're, we're not exactly on point here in Alabama.  I mean Milton and I were a caucus of two.  We weren't exactly a bonded delegation.  You know, we were sort of tolerated, which we knew.  And so we were hanging out with the D.C. delegation, you know, but we still had to go to our caucus meetings, 'cause you were assigned from the state and stuff.  But what happened was there was a group from New York as well that came in.  And [HM Ernest] Ernie Green, who was a Little Rock Nine, was a representative from the New York group, and a guy named Lamont Godwin, who actually was born and raised in Mobile, was my homeboy, had gone off--it's one of our playmates--had gone off to Rutgers University [New Brunswick, New Jersey] and had gotten a Ph.D. in economics.  And he had been selected as one of these academic types to work on the evaluation of the conference, and Lamont and Ernie were good friends.  So, again, same thing happens, look across the room, and I'm like is that Lamont Godwin?  And he's like is that Alexis Herman?  We make our way across the room, and sure enough, it was Lamont.  So he tells me he's there with the New York delegation, what he's doing at Rutgers.  I hadn't seen him.  He'd gone to Heart of Mary.  And so it's like old home--I tell him Peggy's here and about all these great folk with the D.C. delegation, [HM] Sterling Tucker, you know, who is a city council member.  I'm real impressed.  And he says we have a, a large--they gave us a cabin, and we want you all to come up to a party.  'Cause we're all saying in these barracks, you know, but they had a house, a cabin--said we're gonna have a party that night.  So come on up, and you bring Milton and tell Peggy.  And so sure enough, we go up to this cabin, right.  That's how I meet Ernie for the first time.  And we're all in this cabin at this party, and this huge snowstorm comes.  This is April.  I mean this huge snowstorm comes, and we got snowed in together for two full days.  Now Peggy, being the ever, you know, on point, active, engaged--but she had something going on that night, so she couldn't stay for the party.  She came, showed her face, and she had to leave.  So she didn't hang out that night, so she didn't get snowed in with us.  But the rest of us all got snowed in, and did we bond.  I mean did I learn a lot that night.  So I didn't know who Ernie Green was.  I, I--something about Little Rock and the troops and [President Dwight] Eisenhower, and you know, Lamont's bragging 'cause this is his buddy.  And you know, you remember [Arkansas Governor] Orval Faubus.  I'm like, I remember George Wallace.  I don't know about no Orval Faubus, right.  So they're telling me all these stories about Ernie and the Little Rock Nine.  And Whitney Young had just died, and Lamont had done some writing and some work for Whitney.  And there was a guy who was on Whitney's staff, Nap Johnson, who was also at the party with the Urban League.  And he was running the Labor Education Advancement Program, LEAP, and they were all talking about the Urban League and LEAP.  And Ernie Green was running this project of getting young blacks into the building trades, working with Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph.  So I'm like in the middle of hearing all this history about what they're doing in New York, and I'm just eating it up.
Story_ID: 85166
Speaker 1: And so they asked me what I'm doing, and I'm like well, you know, I talk about my kids and my work in the housing projects, and how I'm like I've gone from tenants' right now to job creation work.  Now I'm trying to work with getting these kids jobs in the housing projects.  So I'm very interested in this notion of the building trades and what Ernie's [HM Ernest Green] been doing with black apprentices and, and working with the skilled trades movement.  And he tells me that there's gonna be a big ship building operation in Mississippi in Pascagoula with Ingalls Shipyard.  And it's gonna totally revolutionize the Gulf Coast.  And they were talking about coming down there to see if it was possible to, to do any work, to recruit young blacks for the building trades for Ingalls Shipyard.  They wanted to test the trades in the South.  And he was working with this guy named Ray Marshall.  I'm like, who's Ray Marshall?  He says Ray Marshall is this big labor economist at the University of Texas, and he's been doing all of this writing about the building trades and skill trades and the segregation in the labor unions.  And so they have these projects now where they're testing opening up the labor unions.  So I said come to Mobile [Alabama].  I promise you if you come to Mobile, I can find you young kids who would be really good workers that I think would make great test cases for Ingalls Shipyard.  And I said Pascagoula is just forty minutes from Mobile.  You know, I'm sure we can work something out.  I said, you know, but think about opening up an office in Mobile.  So they said they hadn't thought about coming to Mobile.  I'm like, it's perfect.  If you're looking at Ingalls, you know, that's where the labor supply is.  And 'cause I'd been working with these kids in the projects, so I know, you know, we just had something to channel their energies into it could work. So I go back all excited that I've met Ernie and Lamont [Godwin] and you know, Nap Johnson, and, and I wanna find out what's really going on at the shipyard and that whole effort.  So, sure enough, I find out that the Trent Lott, the young congressman from Mississippi, he's all involved in this big shipyard project in Pascagoula, Mississippi, right next door to Mobile.  And it is gonna bring all these job, and 'cause they've all bypassed the black community, and everybody's really excited about what's going on.  So I'm like, we gotta have a piece of that action, you know.  And it's the perfect answer for me with these kids, 'cause I'm running these classes now at night in the housing projects.  And I guess I'm, I'm, I'm a teacher, but I don't think of myself as a teacher.  But I'm bringing these kids together, and we're doing homework, and we're running these like community sessions at night.  But it's all about they don't have work, you know, and they're dropping out of school.  And then we have own desegregation problems now in Mobile, and, and it's clear to me that if you don't finish high school, there's just nothing there, nothing.  So I talk to the folk at Catholic Charities, and, and Rosemary Winder, who's the head of charities, and I say we really should try to, you know, figure out how we can work with the people at Ingalls to see if we can begin to set up training programs that they'll accept some of these kids in.  And I don't anything about training.  This is my first venture into labor market.  I don't know anything about buildings trades.  I don't know anything about skill (unclear).  So I'm calling Ernie back and forth in New York now, and I'm calling the Lamont, saying you gotta convince Ernie to come here.  Train me, train me on how to do this so I'll know what to do, and I'll be your anchor here.  We can open up an office, and I can help raise some money.  So they make this trip into Mobile, and I got everybody all excited and organized.  And mommy's cooking the gumbo, and you know, we do the big Mobile welcome, you know. (laughter).  And everybody's all excited about the possibility of getting this office in Mobile.  So, that's really how it all happened.
Story_ID: 85167
Speaker 1: So I start learning about the building trades and the skill trades, and, what it's going to take.  And we open up this office, the satellite office, and we raise money.  And it was a vested interest, which I'm finding with the employers in Mobile [Alabama], because you remember you got racial tensions now really surfacing.  So they're thinking we haven't had riots yet in Mobile, and so maybe this is a way to start to channel these kids into something more productive.  So I get a few enlightened employers to buy into this, to help me, because I didn't have transportation.  You know, none of these kids had cars, had to get to the yard, and they didn't have resources.  And we had to train 'em on these apprenticeship tests, and they had to pass all these tests to get in, so we needed resources just to get started.  But we were able to, to pull some of those resources together.  And then I got the nuns to agree to be a carpool van to come to the projects in the morning like at 5:00 and pick up these kids.  So we had like a group of ten kids.  We started with a small group of ten kids.  And we ran three cars, and we would pick them up in the mornings, and drive them over, and take 'em to the, to their training, and getting 'em ready for the test.  And then they would come back, and pick 'em up in the evenings, and then we would take 'em back and do the tutoring at night.  So we did this for a long time, but it all paid off because eventually we got the first young black--these were males at the time--into the trades and the, and, and the shipyard, first into the labors union.  That was the first union we broke open, and then the carpenters, and the electricians, one at a time.  That's what was happening, one at a time.  But these kids were heroes in the community.  I mean they started going back and talking about what they were learning, had real jobs paying above minimum wage, I mean really decent wages, you know.  And so they were tracking to be journeymen, you know.  And I'm learning a whole new world 'cause I knew nothing about the labor movement.  I knew nothing about the skill trades.  And I'm learning the skill trades, and I'm learning the labor--and one by one that's what we did.  We gave 'em all the support they needed, whether it was driving them to work, fixing 'em lunch, coming back home, tutoring them.  Whatever it took to help them be successful, that's what we did.  They ran into all kinds of stuff.  They couldn't use the bathrooms, discrimination on the yard.  You know, they were trained to take it, you know, and we would talk about it.  So, that was going, and it was happening.
Story_ID: 85168
Speaker 1: And Ray Marshall came in.  He heard about it, and he started writing about it, to document the experience of what--and the fact that we'd gotten the first African American into the skill trades in the Deep South.  And so he's writing about it.  And out of the clear blue sky one day he says, Alexis, what would you think about moving to Atlanta, Georgia, and taking these same techniques and what you've done with this group of young men, you know, giving 'em all the support and the resources they need, and trying it on a white collar market?  Let's see if this'll work on a white collar market.  And he told me about this study he was working on with Clark University with Vivian Henderson, who was then the president, and Hugh [sic James] Hefner, who was then their chief economist.  He was president of Tennessee State [University].  At that time he was an economist at Clark University.  He was working with Ray, and they had done a study of the (unclear) of '72 [1972] now, '71 [1971], '72 [1972].  They'd done a study of the sunbelt theory.  You know all the jobs were moving the South, and all the growth was in the South.  And now the civil Rights Act is passed, and you've got token inroads that have been made by African Americans into corporate America.  And it was largely black males here and there, no black women anywhere in corporate America, and a few white women.  'Cause now you also got the women's movement of '72' [1972], who were in corporate America as secretaries, and now gradually being cherry picked off here and there for management ranks.  So Ray has this theory of focusing in on black women, corporate America in the South.  And take one city--it's the same way you took the shipyards--and in this one area, to let's, let's take Atlanta, let's go after--he studied the insurance industry, the banking industry, the airline industry, the automotive industry, and there was one other industry.  He said let's take--there were five industries that they had studied in the South, but this was the pattern.  They studied all the companies.  There were no black women anywhere.  So the theory was black males seemed to be, you know, making some headway one by one, black women.  But the, there's this big question mark: what's going on with black women?  Why are no black women showing up anywhere on anybody's radar screen?  He says, I want you to go in.  We're gonna make it a research project.  I'm gonna get funding for it, and I want you to go in, and I want you to start to meet with these companies, same way you met with the heads of these labor unions, and I want you to find out what is it gonna take to get these black women same way you work with those young black kids.  And whatever it takes to get these young black women in, make them successful 'cause I'm convinced if you do it, you know, we start opening up doors, then others will follow.

Speaker 1: [The Catholic Church] had come out of a missionary place, so was it still in that sort of mode, really--
Speaker 2: In the South it was.
Speaker 1: In the South.  That's what I meant, in the South.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the South it was.  In the South it was.  I actually had, had my own Waterloo moment with the church because I could never reconcile Catholic teaching, and segregation, and what I saw inside the church walls.  So by the time I got to Edgewood [College in Madison, Wisconsin], I was pretty disengaged and disillusioned with the church and stayed that way for a while.
Speaker 1: So Edgewood was, was through--
Speaker 2: Madison.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's a--okay.
Speaker 2: It was a Dominican college.
Speaker 1: That's what I was wondering.  So you--who, who chose that--
Speaker 2: See, there were only two Dominican schools.  Remember I was the scholarship dependent.  And there were two Dominican colleges.  One was Edgewood in Madison, and the other was a Rosary College in River Forest, Illinois.  My mother wanted me to go to River Forest because it was near Chicago [Illinois] and my grandmother.  So that's what everyone had picked out for me, was River Forest, and that's where I was going, and I had gotten a scholarship there.  And I got to go see it that summer.  Well, I thought I had joined the Carmelite monastery, the high walls, the brick walls.  Oh, my God, I thought, I can't do this; I just can't do this.  And I hadn't--even though Edgewood was light, but I thought it's gotta be better than this, you know.  And at least it's in a university town in Madison [Wisconsin].  So I went to Edgewood at the last minute, sight unseen.  And this same Sister Patricia, Sister Alberta, helped me, you know, at the last minute get into Edgewood, which was their college.  So I went to Edgewood sight unseen.  That's how I ended up there.  But--and I was the third black to go to Edgewood.  There had been one other young girl from Mobile.  Mary Cook was the first black student to go to Edgewood, and she had just graduated.  They hadn't had anymore.  It's an all-white girls' school.  Then there was a junior when I got there.  Her name was Gail, and she'd come from a Catholic missionary school in Virginia, and then none in sophomore class, and then I came in that freshmen class.  So I was like the third black in my freshmen year.  And it was--you're talking about an experience.  'Cause I'd came from a nurturing all-black environment, where I was taught to push against the system, but I could fall back in my own community, you know.  And I saw my--you know, it was just different.
Story_ID: 85170
Speaker 1: And so here I was in this all-white environment, and I can remember them.  And I meet Gail, the other young black girl there, and the first thing she does to me, she comes and says how you doing, girl?  Let me see those edges.  Oh no, we gotta get those edges straight.  We gotta straighten those edges out.  We gotta put a rag on that head tonight.  We gotta straighten those edges out.  And I'm like, oh, my God (laughter).  So, and she had beautiful black hair, you know.  So we had this little parents thing, where they bring you up--you have your little room.  My parents, you know, my father's not well now, and my mother, you know, couldn't afford to send me, so my grandmother comes up to Edgewood with me.  They drove me in a friend's car.  And we're the only black little setup here, you know, at Edgewood [College in Madison, Wisconsin], and I got my little room.  And my grandmother didn't go past eighth grade, you know, so this is a big deal for her (laughter), bringing me to college, you know.  And she's just going around speaking to people: This is Lex, you know, my granddaughter, you know.  And we're getting these polite nods.  Nobody's embracing us, you know.  And I think oh, my God (laughter).  And then when I finally see a black face, she wants to talk me about the edges of my hair.  So then, oh, my God, so she leaves me, and I am in tears.  I mean when she left that parents day, I am in tears.  I'm like what am I doing here?  So we have this little room, you know, and, and the dormitory was like, you have four rooms that open out into your little sitting area, nice dorms, four little rooms to a little sitting area, you know.  So, Gail's on one floor, and I'm on another floor, St. Joseph's.  And so all of the, everybody's in their little sitting rooms.  And my parents and my grandparents--her friend had to get back 'cause, you know, they're kind of old, and they gotta drive back to Chicago [Illinois].  So I'm the only one still left by myself, and everybody else's parents are still in their rooms, and they're decorating their rooms and stuff.  We'd done my little room, and I'm just sort of sitting there, you know.  So finally we're all alone that night, you know, all the girls.  And I never will forget it.  Patti was my next door roommate.  So they come (unclear) 'cause they had never been around a black girl before.  So they're like very curious about me, and how I got there, and where I came from.  And then in the middle of it all, here comes Gail with her pressing comb.  This is her way of bonding with me, you know.  And they're all standing there like, what, what is, what, what, what is that for, you know?  And so Gail tells them that she's gonna press my hair.  And they go: You're gonna iron your hair?  I never will forget that.  You're gonna iron your--I said I'm not ironing my hair, you know, 'cause I'm embarrassed, you know.  And she was in drama.  Gail was in--and she was a drama queen, you know.  So I close my door.  And so that was my first night.  And my best friend ended up becoming the girl down the hall from Indiana who was really fat; she was really fat.  And so we were like--I think she felt, because of her weight and me, right, so we were like best--and she had heard about Richard Wright's "Black Boy."  And she wanted to go and read Richard Wright's "Black Boy."  She was gonna go get that book, and she wanted to know if I had ever read it.  And actually in my little leadership group with Sister Patricia, I had read Richard Wright's "Black Boy."  So that became our bonding experience.  She was getting Richard Wright's "Black Boy."  And so she got it, and she read it, and we became good friends.  So, Edgewood was a good academic experience for me, but socially it was very trying.
Story_ID: 85171
Speaker 1: And the straw that broke the camel's back was the socials.  When they had the socials, you know, on the weekends--it's all-girls school.  You know, the boys came from the all-boy--'course there were no black guys. So gradually what my friend, Donna, and Gail had told me: you wanna see some black people, you gotta go up to the Rathskeller.  This was at the university.  This was like Union Hall at Wisconsin.  That's where all the black people hang out, but you don't wanna get typed doing that now, you know.  So I was determined to find my way to the Rathskeller.  at the university, right.  And Lord, the first time I saw all those black people in, sitting in their corner in the University of Wisconsin, that became sort of my crowd on the weekends that I would go hang out with when I could, 'cause you was--you know, doing those days you couldn't just leave campus when you wanted to either.  And there was an Air Force base in Madison.  And there were some brothers on the Air Force base, and they would also come over to the Rathskeller to, to meet the girls, right.  And so I bonded with a couple of guys from Alabama who were in the Air Force stationed there.  And they got to be my running buddies and you know, they had a car, and they would take me around.  And then finally, I'm--just maybe in six months, I don't know--it was the spring social.  We could invite, you know, our guest in.  Well, I had never had anybody over there.  I'd always left campus, and I did all my socializing over at the university, or I went with the guys over to the base.  And that was really my social life.  But this particular social, Donna and I decided we were gonna invite the guys to this mixer.  They called 'em mixers; that's what they called them, mixers.  It was pra--it was pra--I'd probably gone a full year.  This was probably into the spring of my freshmen year, 'cause I didn't really do that much.  And I invited them over.  Well, you would have thought that the Black Panthers themselves had walked in that day, you know.  The music stopped playing; the dancing stopped, you know, and here we were with like four of the airmen and me.  And Gail was there with her white boyfriend (laughter).  She looks at me--what have you done?  And so after this kind of pregnant pause, you know, the music starts again, right.  So I'm dancing.  You know, I get out there, and I'm dancing.  So midway through the dance, the, the chaplain calls me off the dance floor and brings me over in the corner.  And he says, Alexis, who are these people that you've brought up in here?  I said these are my friends, you know.  We can invite guests, and these are, these are my friends.  So he says we don't think they should be here.  And I'm like, why?  And he says well, we'd like to have the college--he said something about we like to have the college men or something like that.  They wanted only the college men.  They didn't want the guys from the air base coming.  I think that's how he couched it.  So anyway, they made 'em leave, and they didn't come back.  And, and it had a really bad impact on me, it really did.  That was kind of like the straw that broke the camel's back for me in terms of my own disillusionment with the church.  So I kind of went on my own private boycott after that.  I mean I went to class, and I did what I had to do to keep my grades up, but I never really connected with the fabric of the community.  And when I came back my sophomore year, I was only there for that first semester when poppy [her father, Alex Herman] got sick, and I had to leave.
Speaker 2: So that's why you said that, you know, you wonder what would have happened had you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --stayed there--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Story_ID: 85172
Speaker 1: So let's, let's go back to Atlanta [Georgia].  So, with--you are working for the Department of Labor, right there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Ray (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I'm working for Ray.
Speaker 1: You're working for Ray, but you're working--
Speaker 2: I'm actually--he, he says he's gonna try to get a grant to try this theory out, 'cause this, this is a theory he has.  So he talked to the Ford Foundation to see if they would support this effort, if you will, with an office in Atlanta.  And he approaches a guy by the name of Howard Rosen, who is head of the Office of Research and Development at the women's--at the Department of Labor.  And it just so happens that Elizabeth Duncan Koontz--do you know--have you heard--you must have heard that name.
Speaker 1: I've heard Koontz.
Speaker 2: Elizabeth Duncan Koontz was the first black women to be the president of the NEA [National Education Association], before Mary Futrell.  She was also a [President Richard] Nixon appointee as the director of the Women's Bureau, and she was African American.  She was the first African American.  And she was the director of the Women's Bureau.  And to show you the, these coincidences of life, when Elizabeth was president of the NEA [National Education Association], and they were organizing the teachers in the South, this is when my mother became also more politically active, she had a very good friend who was working for the NEA and organizing the state of Alabama.  And he brought Elizabeth Duncan Koontz to my home.  And my mother had a group of teachers in to talk with her about forming the association in Mobile County with the teachers there.  So I'd met her as a child, but I didn't remember.  I mean, you know, I didn't make the connections then.  She's now the director of the Women's Bureau.  But the first time I saw her she was president of the NEA, and she came to my house.  So now it's like all these years later, and it's '72' [1972], and Ray's trying to raise the money for this concept, really, to get funding through the Southern Regional Council [SRC] in Atlanta, Georgia.  And convinces SRC to be the grant recipient and the home for this program.  Because you've got in this building the Voter Education Project, VEP, and [HM] Vernon [Jordan] had just left VEP to go head up the Urban League.  And so Vernon was affiliated with SRC, so you sort of had this--George Esser, who came out of, you know, North Carolina, and that whole Southern Poverty Law Center, that whole group, you know.  The New South was the home of SRC, SR--the New South was born in the confines of SRC, so all of the writing.  So he thought the (unclear) of having an office in the Southern Regional Council, which was giving rise to all of this new work in the New South was the logical place to test this out.  And the idea was that we were gonna select key companies, found out what it took to get inside the white collar levels, and then go and recruit outstanding black women who could meet the test and who could meet the standards.  And it was just, you know, it was really building on the work of what I had been doing with the labor unions.  So the--so what Ford was willing to invest in was the research concept for transferring this experience to a white collar market and transferring it to a separate population, i.e., professional black women who are college trained, who could not get jobs beyond schoolteachers and nurses.  I mean that was where we were.
Speaker 1: And this was sort of a, this was important, because, I mean the on--the, the work now--you have Reverend [Leon H.] Sullivan, right--
Speaker 2: OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers].
Speaker 1: --of OIC.  But that's more, those were--
Speaker 2: Youth.
Speaker 1: --more youth and, and more--
Speaker 2: And training.
Speaker 1: --more training jobs--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --right, just to get people on the--and in the Urban League was it at--
Speaker 2: It was doing more of--through the Labor Education Advancement, it was doing the blue collar training; it was doing blue collar work.
Story_ID: 85173
Speaker 1: So, so what was the receptiveness of companies at that time?  I know you had success but were they--
Speaker 2: Very closed, oh, it was very closed.  As a matter of fact, for a long time we just didn't get to first base.  We, we identified a cluster of companies, Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola, Southern Bell at the time, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, Georgia Power; those are the--Xerox, Allstate Insurance Company, C and S Bank.  It's all coming back to me.  We had a cluster of companies that we were going to go in and try and find out when their hiring seasons were, what were the qualifications, what did it take to get into.  And Ray had been doing some of this research, so we knew about management training programs and how they prepared white workers for entry level management positions.  And we were trying to get that information and then test it out to see if they would bring in black women.  So I started off really just building relationships.  That's really how it started.  I would just go repeatedly to these companies, and I would meet time and time again with these, mainly, human resource officials.  Every now and then I might meet somebody else, and when I finally started to figure out was the more progressive companies had started to bring in African-American males.  So you could generally find an African-American male here and there in these companies.  So I started looking for the African-American males who worked traditionally in HR, and the executive secretaries who were white women of these CEOs.  That became sort of my mapping strategy about how to get in.  Where there weren't any African Americans, I would find a route in through a, a secretary.  And that's really what I did, you know, and I kept going back.  And then finally, they would say things like, well, Ms. Herman we'd hire you.  And I'd say I don't, I, I don't want you to hire me, but, but I want you to hire somebody like me, you know.  And Paulette, my girlfriend, who had lived with me, has just left the convent, I convinced her to come to Atlanta [Georgia] with me to try this out.  This was a concept.  I say you work on the women.  We got the AU [Atlanta University] complex as sort of the great proving ground here, and I'm gonna concentrate on the employees, and we hired an assistant.  And that's how we started with the three of us, three black women.  And we kind of became the models of what we were selling to these companies.  And Paulette was great.  She was a teacher by training, you know, very disciplined.  And we would go and meet on the AU campuses with the, the seniors who were graduating to find out what they wanted to do.  We were just like a placement office.  We would go on the campus, just like these placement offices.
Story_ID: 85174
Speaker 1: But then we--an amazing thing started to happen.  When we thought we were gonna target these young women at Spelman [College] and Clark [Atlanta University], and what we're finding is the word is getting out about what we're trying to do, because we're also meeting in the community.  We'd meet with the Urban League.  We'd meet with all the community leaders. [HM Andrew Young] Andy Young was very helpful to me when I moved to Atlanta.  Maynard Jackson was vice mayor, and I, I became connected to the community of Atlanta as a way of, of trying to meet people and, and to figure out how to do this.  Maynard was the vice mayor.  He was very helpful.  So--and Andy was running for Congress for the first time, so I volunteered in his campaign.  But what started to happen was these women started to come forward, who were secretaries, who were clerks in Rich's and Sears, schoolteachers, black women who were already in the workforce, young professionals who wanted to try to get into these professions started building our resume file.  And before we knew it, we had a like a base of like 200 women.  We had a core group.  And we were doing everything from--it turned out to be the same thing we did with the, these guys.  It was just a different kind of coaching and developmental experience, from dressing, to how you looked, putting the right clothes on you, to mock interviews, and practicing the interview, and getting some of these white men who worked at SRC on the staff to role play as employers, and to take on these different personalities for us, to figuring out childcare arrangements, and helping create the support systems around them that they needed to be successful, and then getting them in for the tests, where they were, you know, tests for the bank for the management training program, but being very specific around the qualifications.  And quite honestly, you know, we were looking for superwomen, 'cause we knew that's what it would take to be those initial barrier breakers, and they were, and they were fabulous women.  And we would work into the night on interviewing skills and coaching.  And by this time, I've done all the, the legwork on the company.  So I--you know, we created the profiles on the business, the company, where they're going, what they're doing, so they were very steeped in the knowledge.  And so when they got to the interview, they would like shine, you know.  But you had to make sure that you had someone who was really willing by this time to give them the real opportunity for, for a real interview.  And that's where so many of, of the brothers, quite frankly, were extraordinary in opening those initial doors, 'cause they were as much invested in getting that first black woman in as we were, and having her be successful, and over time it worked.  You know, we got the first black woman in at Delta Airlines.  She went in as an accountant.  And one of the things that I discovered was, actually, working on some of the more technical areas was actually easier in the beginning.  The first black woman at Coca-Cola was a chemist that got hired.  The general management training programs where they really took a class of, of, of young professionals to train them in the business of the company was the opportunity you really wanted.  So when we got black women in for the first time in more than one or two into the Southern Bell Company, was the first really big breakthrough, because it was so hard on these women being the only one with no support systems inside and, you know, carrying the burdens of the race on your shoulder, along with all the other stuff.  And many of them had husbands at home who were having a difficult time even accepting the, the new status of, of a professional black woman in their family.  And so, we ended up running these workshops at night for couples.  I mean it, it just started to evolve, you know, and, and dealing with some of the frustrations.  You know, there were a few divorces 'cause they couldn't handle it.  So we went through all of that.
Story_ID: 85175
Speaker 1: But there was a little book that was published.  It was called, "Stepping Up," and it traced the histories of many of these women in terms--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --of those earlier experiences.
Speaker 2: Now did any of the women, would we know any of them, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, as a matter of fact, one of the women who went, went through the Southern Bell experience became one of the first black women judges in the state of Alabama.  And the first woman who got into the J.C. Penney management training program, Duncan, ended up being Elizabeth Stolls'(ph.), executive assistant in the White House when she was working for Reagan as public liaison, Thelma Duncan.  Ria Stanley became the first labor relations negotiator expert.  She got in on the ground floor at GM [General Motors].

Speaker 1: Now, so you have--this is, the period is, we're talking about is 1977 to what--
Speaker 2: This is '72' [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 2: I moved to Atlanta [Georgia] in 1972.
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972], okay, yes, that's right--
Speaker 2: So I was in Mobile [Alabama]--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  That's right.
Speaker 2: --from '69' [1969] to '7--

Speaker 2: --I did the blue collar, the shipyard stuff between '69' [1969] and '72' [1972]--
Speaker 1: Two.
Speaker 2: And moved to Atlanta in '72' [1972].  And--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --I was there until '77' [1977].  I did that for five years.
Speaker 1: You did that, okay.
Speaker 2: But after that first year, it was so, I mean, not--I mean we had success.  I mean after that initial experience, you know, then people were willing to take risks.  And then we had role models, and we had women who could go and talk about their experiences.  So then people started saying well, maybe this is because it's Atlanta.  We don't know if this happened just because of it's Atlanta.  If this is really gonna work, let's try another city.  So they asked me to go to Houston, Texas, and take on the oil industry there.  And that was much, much harder than Atlanta.  And we almost thought it really was unique to Atlanta, and we didn't really have something here that was transferable, because it just wasn't taking hold in Houston.  But to Howard Rosen's credit, the data that we were getting back was so rich in terms of the experiences in Houston, even though we, we were having a difficult time opening the doors, the women and the talent was so enormous.  And we took Hispanic women on for the first time.  So in Houston we were doing black and Hispanic.  So we're also breaking into another set of barriers to understand those issues.  And it was, in part, the strength of the women that were coming forward and what we were exper--and the resistance of the employers in Houston, that we realized that this notion of being both a woman of color, race, and sex, the, the triple di--the double dynamics of race and sex was so hard and so difficult to overcome that we needed more time and more experience to understand not just the race dimension, but the sex dimension as well.  So I actually got the first million dollar grant from the labor department for a woman to--from the R and D [Research and Development] shop to expand this project.  And they gave us the money to do a ten-city pilot.  So, and that we went to, so then we went to Boston [Massachusetts], Cincinnati [Ohio]--'cause they wanted us to go to different regions--Los Angeles [California], Houston [Texas], Atlanta [Georgia], Dallas [Texas], Tulsa, Oklahoma, where we also worked with Indian women; and then we picked up three blue collar cities.  And so that became, that then became known as the Minority Women's Employment Program.  That's what it became known as, and we were very successful in really, in all of those cities, event--eventually even Houston, although it was a whole year.  A whole year went by before we had any movement in Houston in getting some of the first women into, to the system, the Xerox Corporation.  I mean I can think of a lot of the, those early pioneers, those early women.  And I was doing that; I was running this operation, headquartered now in Atlanta.  I'm no longer running the Atlanta office.  I'm now running the ten-city operation.  Paulette's my national deputy.  And we have now modeled the staff in each of these cities the way we started off in Atlanta, so we have young black and Hispanic women who are running these offices.  We had five to seven women in each community, and that was our national staff, and that's what I was doing when [President] Jimmy Carter got elected president.  And he picked Ray Marshall to be his labor secretary.  And when Ray Marshall got to be the labor secretary, he asked me to come to Washington with him to be the director of the Women's Bureau.  And, and that's how I got to Washington [D.C.]
Story_ID: 85177
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, you said, so you, so you said [President] Jimmy Carter--did you work on the campaign, Jimmy Car--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You did--okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't work on the campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But [HM Andrew Young] Andy was very involved in Carter's campaign, obviously, and I had worked on Andy's campaign.  But I was really busy running around to these ten cities, and I was really not politically involved with the Carter campaign.  But--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: --I--
Speaker 1: -so you get, but you get a--you are anointed, really, to go with your, who has become your mentor.  Ray Marshall has become your mentor.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so, you say that [HM] Dorothy Height talked to you, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, but--
Speaker 1: --she--didn't she say something like if times not--that there--
Speaker 2: If the times aren't ripe, ripen the times.  That was Dorothy.  And what happened here, I really didn't know anything about the ways of Washington [D.C.].  And I was--I always considered myself a practitioner, you know, being hands-on.  And I was never one for theory, and I saw Washington as sort of theory, you know (laughter).  And so I said to Ray, thank you, but no thank you.  And he called Dorothy and told her that I didn't want to take the job, and Bayard Rustin.  Bayard Rustin at the time was also someone that, was very instrumental in helping with the whole labor movement and when I was doing the work with the skilled trade.  So Bayard and Mr. [A. Philip] Randolph had all been big figures in my life.  So Dorothy calls and, and says to me I understand that Ray Marshall has asked you to come to Washington as the Director of the Women's Bureau, and that you said you don't want to do this.  And I told her that was true, and I explained why, the great work I was doing with the program, and I didn't wanna leave Atlanta.  And she basically said, you know, Alexis, if you really care about making a difference, if you wanna play on a broader stage than what it is you're doing now, then that's exactly where you have to be, that's exactly where you have to be.  And that's why I said but it's not the right time (laughter).  You know, if this was, you know, another year or two years.  I'm doing this, that, and the other, opening another office.  And she said for you it will never be the right time, you know.  The time is now.  And you call Ray Marshall back, and you tell him you're gonna take that job.  I said I don't even know what they're, Women's Bureau does, you know.  So she says I'm gonna call Elizabeth Koontz, and I want you to have the conversation with Elizabeth.  And I want you to talk to her about the job that she had as the director of the Women's Bureau.  So, that's what happened.  So, between Dorothy and Elizabeth Duncan Koontz, who was [President Richard] Nixon's Women's Bureau director, but the first African-American woman, they both mentored me, really, to Washington.
Story_ID: 85178
Speaker 1: And I was twenty-nine.  I had no idea I was gonna face the opposition.  I thought that's all it took.  I thought Ray [Marshall] offered you the job, and I had to make up my mind.  But then I'm learning about this whole process of, you have to go through a Senate confirmation, and you have to be validated by the powers that be.  And I was not someone who was really a part of the so-called women's movement.  And they had their own candidate for the job.  I was also not someone who came out of organized labor, so I didn't have sort of these natural constituencies that were advocating for my candidacy.  As a matter of fact, my competition for the job was a woman by the name of Arvonne Fraser, who was the wife of the mayor of Minneapolis [Minnesota] at the time, and who was very active with the UAW [United Automobile Workers] and, and Doug Fraser.  And so they had really come out of the whole UAW movement in that region.  And everyone said I was too young for the job, and obviously, I didn't come within an organized constituency.  But I had a strong base in, in my own civil rights community.  I had always been active, whether in Mobile [Alabama] or now in Atlanta [Georgia].  I had a strong church community, particularly with my work in the Catholic Church, with charities and the work that I'd done there.  And I was an active part at this point in my life of the social justice movement in the church, so I had that constituency.  And I had my friends in labor from the shipyards in Pascagoula, Mississippi, who could speak, you know, to my work firsthand.  And then I had these wonderful women across the country in these cities where we had worked with the companies that we had partnered with.  And so I ended up with corporate support that I didn't even realize, just in terms of how you put these political relationships together, that would all become so important in my first quest for public office as the director of the Women's Bureau.  So I, I quickly learned what I had to go through in terms of a process of organizing that support.  And the National Council of Negro Women and Dr. Height were very instrumental in that, and getting me through my confirmation hearings, and everything that was involved there.  And so, I moved to Washington, D.C.  And it was February of 1977, and I've been here ever since.
Speaker 2: So this, this is where the fish found water?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: She was just practicing with--(laughter)--to swim in Atlanta (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 85179
Speaker 1: But you know, I wanna ask one of, just one thing about A., you know, A. Philip Randolph.  Can you give, you know, just a story or anecdotal story about him and you know, I mean, even--you met him, was it, were, was it around the time of the shipyard?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly, during that period that's when I met him.  And oh, my goodness, he was just a wonderful storyteller.  He was a walking history book.  I just loved being around Mr. Randolph.  And he had this deep voice, and he was so articulate.  And when you listened to the struggles and what he had to go through, and he would talk about how he organized the sleeping car porters, and what he did to get that first union, I mean just the, the courage, and the grace, and the dignity of the man, he, he was just, he was something.  I loved him.
Speaker 1: Did he ever talk about the March on Washington when it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He talked about the March on Washington from an organizing standpoint of view.  'Cause, you know, he was really--I mean he talked about it from a, from an organizing standpoint of view and, and what it took.  And he would, he used to love, he and Bayard [Rustin] both, particular Bayard, Bayard loved to talk about all the behind-the-scenes personalities and how it all came together, and even I guess when President [Lyndon] Johnson called (unclear), and they had to organize the meeting.  Yeah, he would talk about it.  And, and I think he believed always that it would be a success, you know.  It was like--but to see it happen in as dramatic a fashion as it did, no one bet on that, no one bet on that.  And that's why he used to always talk about when you unleash the power of human potential.  And he would always point to the March on Washington as the example of that, that you never know quite what sparks you're lighting in history.  But you just have to get in and, and do the work that needs to be done, you know.  He was great.
Speaker 1: And Bayard, did he--he mentored you too, right?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And starting in Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Starting in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, really, really starting--he, he was [HM Ernest Green] Ernie's mentor.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Bayard's was Ernie's mentor, so I really met him when I was doing the shipyard work in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  So that's when I first met him.  That's when I first met him, but he really did become increasingly a part of my life due the experiences in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 85180
Speaker 1: And did anyone else influence you in that Atlanta [Georgia] piece, you know, besides, you know, [Ray] Marshall, and you mentioned [HM Andrew] Andy Young, and--
Speaker 2: Andy was very helpful to me, because Atlanta can be a cliquish community.  So it wasn't as thought we were greeted with open arms when we arrived.  And we were young, single, black women, you know; we weren't married, so you had all of that too.  But it was Andy who kept saying don't let it bother you.  It was almost like I didn't even have to, I didn't even tell him it was bothering me (laughter).  I never will forget one night he called me up.  He'd heard about some meeting we'd had with, I don't know, one of the bank executives.  I can't remember.  But he said don't let it bother you.  It was almost like that moment when Sister Patricia told me that time: Alexis, you're doing the right thing.  He said don't let it bother you, and I really hadn't talked about sort of what I was feeling in terms of the acceptance, you know.  He said it'll be okay.  You just--they're gonna love you, you know; they're gonna love you, just keep doing your work, you know.  You're doing the right thing.  And there was one woman who had taken some umbrage with what we were doing.  She was really more of the major power broker, more or less in the community, and she was particularly not a fan, shall we say.  And we'd heard she'd been making some comments on the side, and we didn't quite know what to do with that, or how to deal with it, 'cause it wasn't like we had a base to move from.  And he just put it right out there on the table that night.  I never will forget it.  And he said she'll be okay too.  And I never even had to tell him what she said.  It was like he knew.  He said she'll be okay too.  You know, you know, you just keep doing your work.  And if you need me to call somebody, do you know, just let me know.
Speaker 1: You know what is interesting about this description, a lot of people, you know, came out of the movement talked about how women were not, you know, necessarily propped up.  They were propping others up, but this is an example of, you know, where he really did mentor you, you know, and made--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Andy was very helpful.  And the other person during that time was Vivian Henderson, who was the president of Clark Atlanta, well, Clark University then.  It had not merged at that time.  He was the president of Clark Univer--but, but Vivian was a labor economist, and he was close to Ray [Marshall], and so he was very interested.  And he was also the chairman of the board of SRC, and so he was like from the New South's perspective.  Vivian was larger than life in that sense.  He was a grand human being, and he was very helpful.
Story_ID: 85181
Speaker 1: Now, this is why you started out wanting to be a psychiatric social worker, but yet your career was influenced by these labor economists.  And I'm just wondering from a theory standpoint, you know, and implementation, do you ever--you know, was there a combination that sort of developed?  Is Alexis Herman a combination of those two forces, or are, you know--
Speaker 2: I think so.  Because for me, when I started working in the housing projects, and, and when I had to help these young men prepare to meet the challenges of going into the shipyards, to take the tests, to take the training, there was a lot of coaching and a lot of counseling that went on.  But I was becoming more motivated by the tangible results of making that connection, of seeing them get a job, and earn an income, and make a living, and to be able to provide for themselves.  And so, my fascination with labor market barriers, and how one overcomes those barriers, and what you have to do to be successful, and, and just how jobs get created, was also influenced by the emotional factors that go into.  You know, what does it take to be a success, and particularly for me, for young African Americans who had so much that they had to navigate, from the racism, to the skill development, to the lack of, of, of resources, you know.  So, in a, in a curious kind of way, it was a merging of two worlds, although at the time I didn't see it that way.
Story_ID: 85182
Speaker 1: Now, so when you go to Washington [D.C.], I mean do you--at what point do you realize this is a really big deal?  I mean was it at the point that you had--you found out you had to go through Senate confirmation, was it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the point, and that it's not, it's not enough for Ray Marshall to say I want you in this job--that was important--but that I had to have the support and the backing of these other political constituencies and coalitions who influenced political appointees, and how the President ultimately selects, because, you know, that the cabinet official for Senate confirmed positions you recommend to the White House.  But it is ultimately the president's decision.  Now, obviously, most presidents today give the cabinet secretaries wide latitude for who they select.  But you certainly aren't gonna select someone that the White House objects to.  I mean you want harmony there.  And the way you create disharmony is you take your political power, and you go to the White House and you lay out all the reasons why not this candidate, but let's come up with a compromise candidate both Ray Marshall can agree on and we can agree on.  And so, it was my first understanding of how you, the business gets done here, and then the fact that you had to go through the confirmation process itself, the hearing itself, and, and what that meant, to make the courtesy calls on the Senate.  You know, for me, I did not make courtesy calls on my home senators initially from the state of Alabama because it wasn't clear that I could get that support.  So I was a born again Georgian for those purposes, and I was very dependent on [HM] Andy [Young] and the political establishment in Georgia to get the support that I needed from my home senators.  So I had to claim Georgia to even be confirmed as the director of the Women's Bureau at the time.  I did not get the support of my home senators in Alabama.  So it was all very instructive in that context.
Story_ID: 85183
Speaker 1: So how large was the depart--how large was the department you were over, the women's--
Speaker 2: The Women's Bureau at that time, we had ten regions.  We had anywhere from ten to fifteen people in each region, and then there were about, so, five, six hundred people at that time.
Speaker 1: That's, I mean that's, that's, I mean it's a dif--I'm just saying you went exponitia--exponentially up--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because it's different.  You said before you had five or seven people in each--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had about a staff of a hundred people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by the time I had the national staff.  And so I had about a hundred people with the minority--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: But I went from three, four, five hundred people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  But even a hundred, that was significant too, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, I had--
Speaker 1: --so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So Ray Marshall, what he was--was he then really looking--did he want to do what the Department of Labor--what, what he had done--you know, was he trying to take, as a labor economist, his, his, his philosophy and things into the--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the federal government.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, how, how did that work?  [President Jimmy] Carter himself re--you know, met some opposition.  Was that really, was that occurring on the labor side of things?
Speaker 2: In terms of the challenges that the administration--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, that--we had a lot of issues, surely, and he was a Southern governor.
Speaker 1: 'Cause people weren't really ac--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --accepting.  And he had brought in all the people from the South (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  No, there were issues.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, there were issues.
Speaker 1: So, now, what about that experience?  What did you learn in ca--you know, come out of the experience with?  I mean what--first of all, you had to get to know Washington. And was anyone directing you in that?  'Cause--
Speaker 2: To, to--that's where my uncle Broadus Butler came into being--well, not came into being, but came into play for me.  By now he is in Washington [D.C.].  He had just retired as the president of the Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana].  So he was, in many ways, family for me here, he and his wife, my Aunt Lillian.  And he was attached to the Moten Institute at that time, and was running the Moten Institute.  So, Uncle Nat knew the Washington establishment in that sense, and so he was a godsend in terms of being family and someone who understood this town and the people who were here.  And Peggy was here, and Peggy was very involved and very active in the community.  So, between Uncle Nat and [HM] Peggy [Cooper], and [HM] Dr. [Dorothy] Height, who was commuting now between Washington and New York, they really were my anchors in, in my transition.
Speaker 1: And Peggy, she had founded the El--had she founded the Ellington School--
Speaker 2: The Ellington School--
Speaker 1: --at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 85184
Speaker 1: So, what were some of the things that you were proud that happened at that time?  You know, because, was your focus still on the corporate piece, or did it expand?
Speaker 2: Oh, it expanded.  We were able to, early on, to develop the first, and this is an extension of what I'd been doing in Pascagoula [Mississippi], women in apprenticeship, the first regulations for women in apprenticeship in the building trades we did, opening up the skilled trades for the first time to women.  We worked on the first pregnancy disability.  I was shocked to learn that women would lose their jobs when they were pregnant, and were not guaranteed reemployment rights in this country, as a part of how our own laws worked.  A man could have six weeks off for a hair transplant, and claim disability under a policy, but you wouldn't give a woman six weeks off to have a baby, ludicrous.  So we amended Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act, after a long Supreme Court fight on this issue, where the Supreme Court actually held the man having six weeks off and not the woman to have a baby.  So we had to fight it legislatively, and we won that.  And that's how I first met Eleanor Holmes Norton.  She was chair of the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], and we joined ranks on that fight, to amend Title Seven of the Civil Rights, to have discrimination based on pregnancy labeled as sex discrimination.  And we were able to, for the first time in this country, guarantee a woman her right to a job after she'd had a baby, that she could not just be summarily dismissed, at least for six weeks.  And so we were very--I was very proud of that in the very beginning, and that happened early on--Women in Apprenticeship Act happened very early--and I think the whole emphasis on putting a thrust on women in non-traditional jobs.  I continued to carry that message and that mission as director of the Women's Bureau, and really did begin to make it a national issue in terms of the stereotyping of what was going on in terms of equal pay and the concentration of women into lower paying jobs in this country.  And we were able in, in many ways to do what we had been doing on a much broader scale.  And [HM] Dorothy [Height] was right, in terms of having the opportunity to open up wholesale industries, and to give women the experiences that they'd never had before.
Speaker 1: You know, just in the, in context, even--(unclear) you were fighting several different forces with the building trades.  I mean your traditional, the traditional labor movement would have had a lot of resistance to that, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Becau--but what--you need to explain, why did you--why, why was it chosen, the building trades?  Why were they specifically slotted out?
Speaker 2: They were specifically slotted out because, at that time, we were looking for jobs that paid really good wages.  And you could get a job as a trainee for a journeyman and an apprenticeship job paying nine, ten, eleven, twelve dollars an hour, and that was in the, you know, 1970s.  And when you reach journey status, you know, those wages would double.  So they were really good paying jobs.  And the only thing that we had been relegated to, we were concentrated at that time only in minimum wage jobs.  So, this was an area where you didn't have to have a college degree; you could get a decent job; earn a decent living; and really be guaranteed a skill for a lifetime.  That was the motivation.  It was all economics.

Story_ID: 86266
Speaker 1: Okay, now when were last talking, we were really talking about your time at the Women's Bureau.  We had reviewed the confirmation process and, and who was instrumental, you know, and it-[HM Andrew] Andy Young, Bayard Rustin, you know, also meeting A. Philip Randolph, and that whole thing.  And I'm wondering--and you talked also about one of the, you know, key areas was getting women in the skilled trades and why that was important from an economic standpoint.  And I'm wondering if they're other things that you--that happened during that time that were significant to you, even for later in your career.
Speaker 2: Well, there was one experience in particular that was very significant.  To this day, I tell the story in speeches, because in many ways it helped to shape both my outlook on Washington, D.C., and what it meant to have to engage the policy process in the development of legislation in Washington.  And it happened in when I first came to Washington.  I knew very little about how legislation or public policy was actually formulated.  And I shall never forget that there was a particular case that the Supreme Court had just decided that had made a decision that discrimination based on pregnancy did not constitute a form of sex discrimination.  And we were involved in the amending of Title VII of the Civil Rights Acts to basically have discrimination based on pregnancy as a form of sex discrimination included in that legislation.  And in this particular case that involved a major corporation, this company had actually given a man six weeks off to have a hair transplant, but it wouldn't give a woman six weeks off to have a baby under its disability policy.  And so we're looking now at the late 1970s.  And of course, at this point I time in our country, we had no job protections for women once they had a baby to be guaranteed of their job when they returned to work.  You had to use your vacation leave.  You had to use your sick leave.  But beyond that, if you did not come back to work, there was actually no guarantee that you would have employment.  And so, we were looking at some way to have guaranteed rights of employment for women who are, had left to have a child.  The United States at that time was the only major developed power that had no such policy regarding women in the workplace.  We could look at other European countries and all of the OECD [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries all had such policies, but not the United States.  So here we were thinking we had a window.  Let's get pregnancy treated as a disability, and let's get a woman at least a six weeks guarantee of employment leave with the right to come back to her job.  Well, for me, the notion, first of all, of treating pregnancy as a disability was something that I had to make a mental adjustment, but then understanding that you work with what you can work with sometimes in existing legislative and policy frameworks to advance the rights agenda; in this instance, women's rights agenda.  This was our challenge.  But what struck me about that particular case with the Supreme Court, not only did it say that discrimination based on pregnancy did not constitute a form of sex discrimination, it actually went on in its brief to say that it could see no clear relationship between pregnancy and sex.  And I used to laugh and say, neophyte that I was from Mobile, Alabama, I knew there was a clear relationship between pregnancy and sex.  But I have never ceased to be amazed that it actually took the amending of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to actually, to get this principle enshrined, and it really laid the foundation for the first family and medical leave policies as we know it today in our country.  But it actually began with that effort back in the late 1970s when we amended Title VII.
Story_ID: 86267
Speaker 1: And so I--it was instructive for two reasons: one, I always say, you know, commonsense is not so common when you're working through legislative agendas oftentimes in the nation's capital; but secondly, you always have to be constantly on top of the changes and the to marry what the public need may be at that point in history with how public policy has to support those changes for the better.  And in this instance, it was the tremendous change of women who were coming into the workplace in, in ever increasing numbers.  And we really did not have strong public policies in place to support that change.  And it had a way of focusing me, that legislative fight, to always stay tuned to the nuances of what was taking place around women moving into the workplace, and so childcare policy that subsequently emerged during that period.  The Department of Labor, was actually the first federal agency to have a childcare center.  We were the model for the rest of the federal government to say that, that we have to begin to take seriously this issue of childcare not just for working women, but for working families.  We began to examine the first policy for flexible workplaces and to begin to examine how we could have flexible hours in the workplace.  And so we pioneered during this period, during the Women's Bureau, the late 1970s, under President Carter, really all these new initiatives that that now get captured under family friendly workplaces today.  But that was really the beginning.
Story_ID: 86268
Speaker 1: Who were some of the--who were some of the key players in Washington [D.C.] on women's issues, you know, these issues at that time?
Speaker 2: At that point in time, particularly when we were working the pregnancy disability issue, Eleanor Holmes Norton was the chair of the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission].  And she was just a fantastic partner to work with to really to help shape the legislation, to present the testimony on the Hill, to enroll the legislative bodies that we had to gain support from to, to achieve the victory, and she was a big player. You had women like Judy Lichtman, who was then head of the Women's Legal Defense Fund, who is still very active on women and family issues in the Washington, D.C. area, and really around the nation.  The Coalition of Labor Union were very important and worked very hard.  I met some fantastic women during that period, Gloria Johnson, who was, is really one of the highest women today in the labor movement with the electrical workers.  It was really their case that was before the Supreme Court.  It was their union who actually brought the issue on behalf of one of their female employees.  So the Coalition of Labor Union Women were very involved.  You also had great champions, of course, like [HM] Dorothy Height, who really rallied both the women's community and the civil rights communities on many of these efforts as they were coming to the forefront.

Speaker 1: Were women coming together en masse, or were there any differences in opinion between black women and white women as approach to this issue?  Because this is still, you know, relatively new in the women's, you know, movement.
Speaker 2: I think we were at the point time where many of the differences really did surface in, in different ways.  I can remember in one particular instance the first introduction of displaced homemaker legislation into the Halls of Congress by a woman by the name of, of Tish Summers, and, and her partner then was Laurie Shields.  I had never heard of the concept of displaced homemakers.  And that is when we were starting to look at mature women who had been at home, working in the home, raising their families, and now found themselves being divorced, being left, with husbands who were oftentimes now marrying younger women.  And these women in particular were left without any support mechanisms.  And some wanted to attribute the breakdown in our, our family structure to the increase of, of women coming into the workplace, and attracting the attention, if you will, of male bosses, of male supervis--of male supervisors.  And so there was a lot of tension around trying to get women to go quote "back into the home," and a lot of debates around why were all of these women coming at the workplace to begin with.  And I kept saying the issue is not why, because women are really are here to stay, to care for themselves and, and for their families, and they work for the same reasons that men do.  But how are we going to accommodate these new changes?  And it all came to a, to head in particular in this legislation, because displaced homemakers were largely white females who really had not worked in the paid labor force.  And I always made a distinction between the paid labor force and those who had worked at home.  And they really wanted to have special job training, special support initiatives directed at this target population, who had no idea really of what it meant to enter the world of work, and oftentimes now were left with teenage children or empty nests.  But they still had to, to provide for themselves.  And as we worked on this legislation to support displaced homemakers, we knew very little about the experience, for instance, of African-American women in this instance who traditionally had always worked.  And we didn't call it a displaced homemaker when there wasn't quote "a male present" to provide for them.  And so we found ourselves really in the midst of, are we pulling resources from other populations in the employment and training world where funds were so desperately need to target a population that perhaps was not viewed as needy.  And it really led to a much larger debate and a much larger discussion in terms of the role of white females in the workplace versus the traditional role that African-American women had played, and particularly those who had been at the bottom of the economic ladder.  We reached an interesting compromise in that legislation, and that compromise was to look at women who were in their final years of being on welfare, whose child was seventeen, eighteen years of age, because that is when AFDC, Aid to Family and Dependent Children, when the benefits cut off when the child reaches eighteen.  And we found ourselves asking the question: what happens to these women?  Are they, in fact, now displaced homemakers because they have been receiving benefits for the children?  But it was not a benefit for them.  So we started to conduct research, and we found ourselves tracking a lot of women who were in their late thirties and forties who were actually in a similar situation who were really hidden from us because there was nothing to follow them once they left the welfare rolls.  And if they were working at all, they were working as maids, doing housekeeping work, really kind of pillar to post work.  And we decided to have a very targeted effort to go after this population as well, and put them as well into this category of workers that we were now calling displaced homemakers.  And then we put together a coalition that actually then went after the funds on Capitol Hill, and we won that battle.  And it was the first time, certainly in my experience, that we had an energetic coalition of white females and African-American women, largely, who partnered in a collaborative way and not in a competitive way for what was then going on very early in the women's movement.

Speaker 1: Now, what did you learn about politics the Hill?  Because up to this point, you had--I mean I know you went through the confirmation, and you know, [HM] Andy Young was very helpful to you in that process, but through this whole process of sort of working in the Hill to do legislation, what, what were some of the lessons you learned?
Speaker 2: Some of the lessons that I learned in working the legislative front, it's very important to understand the self-interest issue.  Sometimes because you believe it's the right thing to do, is not necessarily apparent to a legislator from Oklahoma, or Michigan, or, or Texas.  So, looking at the self-interest issue, how does this particular legislative concern, if we take the displaced homemaker issue as an example, what is it that's going on in my state in regard to that?  You know, how many women are displaced in my state?  So, learning to do your research, learning to do your homework on the self-interest of a given legislator for their constituents is very, very important.  It's not just about the broader good.  Obviously you lead with the broader good, but you have to be clear around the self-interest from the legislative standpoint of view.  The other thing that I learned: I'd been so involved in electoral politics, working to turn the vote out and, and get various elected officials in office, very little about what happens once they get there?  How do you help with that accountability?  What does that look like?  And so staying involved in the work that they are involved in, what issues are they championing?  What bills are they pushing?  Often times because you have so many constituents, a legislature doesn't necessarily ask is it the right thing or the wrong thing to do, but who do we hear from?  How many calls?  How many letters did we get?  Who really cares about this particular issue?  And so making sure that if you've got something that you say is important, that you have a coalition of support with you that's communicating that to various elected officials, either through phone calls, through letters, through visits on the Hill.  And historically I found that we didn't do a lot of that kind of work.  We spent most of our energy on turning out the vote and assuming they'll do the right thing once you get to Washington [D.C.].  And so you really do have to stay connected.  And you really do have to have those calls and those letters coming in to say we're still here, and we care, and we're paying attention.
Story_ID: 86271
Speaker 1: Now, so when [President Jimmy] Carter was--didn't get elected again, you found yourself, like everyone else, you know, sort of out.  And I think you said the phone--you know, that it was--I don't say the phone stopped ringing, but it was a different--there was a lesson in that.
Speaker 2: There was a big lesson in that because, you know, working in government, it is such an intense process.  I often say that we get done in a day what the average work day takes a week to do.  And you do in an hour what you sometimes get to do in a day.  So the pressure and the intensity is very great.  So thinking about the future and next steps is oftentimes not something you have the luxury of doing.  And because you believe in what you're doing, and certainly I believed very strongly in President Carter and the work that we were involved in, and I certainly wasn't as involved politically then as I am now, I don't think I really believed he was going to lose.  That was the other thing.  I mean, you know, for all the talk around the Iran-Contra issue, and what was going on with the hostages, and what else was playing out on the international stage, I, I did not believe that Jimmy Carter was going to lose.  I think it was very, very late, very late, maybe the week of, that I thought, hmm, this is gonna be tough.  So, so a part of it I think was just the, the shock of finding it just ended all in a day, you know.  And there's no such thing as transition when you elect a new president.  You're on the job until noon January the 20th, the new president is sworn in, and, and you ushered out the door.  And that's literally what happened to me.  I was literally working all the way up until the very end, you know.  So there's no such thing as a transition.  You don't get to work with the new team coming in the door to say this is how we did it.  Because basically what happens, even though you have between November and, and January to work "on a transition," what's typically going on--or the new team's trying to figure out, you know, where the bathrooms are, and who's who, and who's where.  It's not about necessarily the substantive work or what you're involved in on a day to day basis, and so all of that just comes to a stop.  And then you really start the process of trying to figure out, okay, what am I going to do next.  And the support systems that you traditionally had, you know, people scatter, and everyone finds himself really in the same situation.  And I think because there were not, certainly at that time, a lot of African-Americans who had been in leadership roles in government, who had led departments, who had led agencies--you know, Pat Harris was a member of our cabinet at that time.  But we really didn't have a lot of appointees who had had the experience of being in government before.  So it's not as though there's this automatic support group you can go to, role models who've said this is how we did it.  This is how you transition out of government.  And, and you feel that kind of absence in terms of, of these kinds of jobs when you don't have that support, and so we were turning to one another not with a lot of answers.  And there were stories in the paper about, you know, Carter appointees, black and white, filling the ranks of the unemployed, and that was true.  It was also a fairly young administration.  And so for a lot of these young people who had worked with Carter as governor, this was all very new to them.
Story_ID: 86272
Speaker 1: I'd had a very fortunate experience as the director of the Women's Bureau to co-chair with the head of the SBA [The U.S. Small Business Administration] at the time, the very first women's initiative in the federal government on women business owners.  The president very much wanted to have a policy to support and to encourage women entrepreneurship.  And the Women's Bureau was charged with doing all of the research and all of the documentation on women business owners in our country.  That was a very instructive process for me because it opened my eyes up personally to the world of entrepreneurship and women, and who was doing what, and, and what it took, from the formation of capital to the networks, to how you do a plan, a strategy.  And, and we put resources in place for the first time to assist women who wanted to do business with the federal government.  We had the very first initiative in 1979.  So, for me, it turned out that that really put me on a very different career path because I realized, having internalized that work, having presented what it took to go into business for, particularly from a woman's point of view and what those barriers were, in a real sense, I was formulating subconsciously my own next career move.  And so, while I had two or three job offers, I must admit, I was probably one of the lucky ones leaving office because I actually did have an offer from a major company, actually two, a private developer in the area, and I also had an offer from the AFL-CIO, I decided that I wanted to go into business, that I wanted to try my hands at being an entrepreneur.  And I had $10,000 dollars in my savings account that actually came from my government service days where you, you know, build up your annuity program, and that's what I decided to take.  And because I'd read all these stories around the risks and, and how some women started off with, you know, literally nothing almost, I felt like I was moving in a great tradition now of trying my hand.  And so I made the decision to, to go into business by myself when I left office.  But it was really that experience that, that put me on that path.
Speaker 2: And you, so you set up your own consultant firm?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 86273
Speaker 1: And what, what were you--where were you--what did, had you decided to target as your clients, and what became your client base?
Speaker 2: Well, that was also interesting.  What I decided to target initially as, as my client base were mayors and governors because, you know, we had worked with them while we were in office.  And I had been very involved in setting up a number of new initiatives for women.  Whether it was the displaced homemaker initiative, the women in skilled trades' initiatives, we had just totally revamped the job training system.  It used to be called CEDA, and so CEDA was no more, Comprehensive Employment Training Act, and it turned into new legislation that was called JPTA, the--I can't even remember what the acronym--
Speaker 1: Job Partners--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was the Job Partnership and Training Act, which required that states have their own economic development plans, and that we were going to link training, job training, to actual jobs, if you will, that were being generated in the state.  And so this notion of, of training for just training sake--we need fifty welders, or you know, twenty electricians, or hospitality industry, which was how it used to be.  Now we were saying let's figure out what the needs are, and let's train for that.  That was sort of the thinking of the greater linkage in the Job Training and Partnership Act.  And the notion of partnership was partnering more states and, and private sector employers.  So I thought it was a great niche to be able to go in and to work with state governments and with mayors to say: let us help you figure out how to come up with these plans; how to comply with the new legislation; and how to target your training programs to where the actual needs will be.  And so that was the market, that was the, the niche, if you will, that, that I had selected.  And that's what I started working on, and it was tough.  Because what I had forgotten was that it's one thing to have the relationships and to get the commitment, but then the, the process, if you will, the bureaucratic process of going through the RFP, and competitively bidding, and, and working with city councils, and working with city councils is like working with Congress, and so you had to do all of your local politics.  So while the commitments were there, it wasn't like overnight that the opportunities presented themselves.  So we had to, to do the marketing and then to wait for the contracts hopefully to emerge.
Story_ID: 86274
Speaker 1: I'll never forget the very first contract that I had actually came from the AFL-CIO to go and to, to do some work on an employment and, and safety issue in Georgia.  It wasn't exactly what I was targeting to do, but it was an opportunity to get a contract.  But I couldn't even buy a plane ticket.  So, I got in my car, and a friend of mine who was helping us set up the office drove with me to Georgia.  And so I packed everything in my car, and, and drove to Savannah, as I remember now, to work on this contract, and got there fresh as a daisy.  They didn't know I had to drive almost 15 hours to get there to do the work, but that was a part of putting on the game face, and you know, not being defeated, and making sure that, you did, you did a good job.  So, and that was instructive.  You know, it's like, if you really want to, to get into the business world, it's like by hook or by crook.  You know, you gotta be willing to take risks and, and sacrifice.  So it was tough that first year.  And so the notion of people picking up the phone and saying, you know, I've got this opportunity for you or that opportunity, that did not happen.  You know, you had to really go out and hustle, make your case, and then wait.  And that was the toughest part, waiting.  We finally had a, a, a private break with one of the publishing companies who did come in and want to have us work with school districts around the country to move their product that they were involved in.  So it was sort of hit and miss for the first couple of years, but then gradually, gradually, and very gradually it started to take hold--missed a few payrolls for myself 'cause I had three people who worked with me.  And you always have to make sure that you, you pay your employees even if that means you don't get a paycheck.  And so, you know, you miss a few paychecks in the beginning, and I certainly did.  But then gradually I actually started to work more closely in the private sector.  And the so-called budding business of working with mayors and governors really never took hold.  It was a contract here; it was a contract there, but my first really big opportunity came with one of the Fortune 50.
Speaker 2: We're gonna change tapes, okay.  Who was that?
Speaker 1: Procter and Gamble.
Story_ID: 85460
Speaker 1: Okay, so Procter and Gamble comes along.  And so, what is--this, this is your first--really the focus before had really been--had it been from the government side on, on private business at that point?  It had been on the unions and trades, right?
Speaker 2: In terms of the business?
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying when you were with the government it was really more with unions, sort of opening those things up.  It wasn't with private sector.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, so how did--tell how Procter and Gamble sort of came about and what your assignment was.
Speaker 2: Let me--I know how it came about.  I'm trying to think about--okay, I got it now.  (Laughter) It's so much, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: So how did it come about, and then, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, when the Procter and Gamble Company contacted me, it had nothing to do with my Women's Bureau days and when I was in government.  That helped, the fact that I had worked certainly as the director of the Women's Bureau.  But I had actually run the program, the Minority Women's Employment Program, where I'd been very involved in placing women in the private sector and helping with the breakthroughs of women who had not been white collar jobs before.  And so, I had very hands-on experience during that time with working with a number of corporate leaders and really looking at that those early opportunities.  And here I was now almost, almost ten years later with some of those women having thrived and, and moved into other areas.  But many of them had left.  Many of them could not take being in the private sector.  And so Procter and Gamble had been one of those early companies that I had worked with back in the '70's [1970s], had had some success in, in getting African-American women into that company.  And they were at that time experiencing, as most companies were, a very high turnover of African-American women, particularly at the engineer and, and level of chemist.  And these were bright, talented women that they had obviously invested enormous resources in recruiting.  They had, along with a few other companies, one of the largest cadre of, of women scientists in the Procter and Gamble Company, and certainly women engineers, and they were interested in trying to keep these women.  And they wanted to better understand what was happening.  Why were they leaving?  What were the high turnover rates?  And what did they have to do to keep them?  So they asked me to come in and basically to do an evaluation, to do an assessment of the situation at the time.  And the women themselves had also asked for help because they knew that they were in pain, that they were leaving in disproportionate numbers, and so they were also reaching out.  And so it was a curious phenomenon, that both the company and the women had come together to say we need outside help, and I was the person that they came to to ask for that assistance.  And so I, I went in, and I actually did an, an assessment for them, took the time to not only interview the women, but the managers, talked to women who had left the company, and came up with a profile; I came up with an understanding of, of what had gone on, or, or tried to anyway; and made some very targeted recommendations on what I thought the company needed to do differently and what kind of, of support systems we had to put in place around the women.  And they asked me, in addition to doing the assessment work, if I would consider leading the intervention of what I was recommending, and would I put together a team to try and make it happen.  And so I did that, and that actually led to not only starting to look at the turnover rates and retention issues of African-American women, but that work led to broader work and the company starting to look generally at what was happening with the join-up experiences when they bring in new hires, paying greater attention to their turnover rates, not just African-African women, but African-American males, Latinos, Asians.  So it took on a whole diversity focus inside the company, and it expanded to the different parts of the business.
Story_ID: 85461
Speaker 1: And then something very curious happened.  Procter and Gamble--this is the mid 1980s--was also in the midst of acquiring new businesses.  It was a period in our country that was called actually merger mania, and companies were just buying up other companies.  But what happens in mergers and acquisitions, these are generally led by the financial officers in a business.  It's led by the legal team.  And very seldom do human resource professionals get involved on the front end.  They usually take over after it's all done to say: okay, make it work.  And you have to blend these cultures; you have to blend these teams; and try to come up with quote "a more efficient new whole."  But what really goes on, and certainly what was going on at that time, was that you find that your top leadership, and all of the studies were showing, and we were involved in some of that work, that sixty to seventy-five percent of top leaders leave in the first two to three years of, of acquiring a new business.  So let's say, you know, if you're the acquiree, and a part of what you're buying--I mean an acquirer--and a part of what you're buying is that talent, and then you lose that talent, you know, your investment has basically lost some of its original luster.  So most companies, and P and G was no exception, wanted to understand: why are we losing the top talent after we buy these companies?  And what we found was that some of the same issues of understand those informal systems, what makes a culture work, how people join up and become effective players, you know, what makes you a member of the in team versus the out team, it's just as real for someone coming in from a new company as it may have been for that young African-American female engineer who was two years old in the business.  And so the learnings were transferable.  So I started to become very involved in merger and acquisition work and starting to pay closer attention to just cultural act--assimilation--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --divert--you know, issues of diversity and culture, and what does it take to become culturally attuned, culturally embedded; what are those informal systems that propel some workers, and others are not a part of it?  And you know, you find it goes all the way from old boy networks of, of hiring people from the same schools, it matters what schools you graduate from, to geographic differences, to where you come from, to whether or not you had family members who grew up in the business.  And you know, you had those informal networks that just propelled you on.  And so I really started to focus and to specialize in that area.  And that really became for me in the 1980s the focus for my business.  And I really ended up not doing any public sector work, and when I did, I basically did it on a volunteer basis as an advisor to mayors and governors who were really friends.
Speaker 2: You know, AT&T, was the nature of the work the same for them too, and were those your two main clients, or did you build others--
Speaker 1: Oh, I had other clients.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  But it generally took on the, the notion of, of culture, and looking at cultural differences, focusing in on retention rates, productivity, and how you build strong teams.  That really became the, the focus of my work.
Speaker 2: Now you were in business for five, six years--
Speaker 1: Actually I had a business for around twelve years.
Speaker 2: Twelve years, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had a business for twelve years.
Story_ID: 85462
Speaker 1: During that time, in the late 1980s, I had decided that I was going to do something revolutionary for me.  I was gonna take a sabbatical.  I was gonna take some personal time out, think about where I'd been, my life, and do some writing.  I believed then, as I believe now, that we don't document enough of our history.  And so, I thought that I would go back and find all of those women that I had worked with in the 1970s, that first chemist at Coca-Cola, that first accountant at Delta Airlines, that first labor relations expert at General Motors, that first management trainee at Southern Bell, and couple that with the work that I was now doing to see if there was a story there.  I knew there was a story there, but to try and tell the story of what had happened in corporate America with the first African-American women, where were they, what were they doing now, and how does that link up to what I was now experiencing, as that second generation of, of women, these young engineers and chemists that I was now working with in, in a Procter and Gamble and in other companies, and to see, you know, where was this energy there, and how do we tell these inner generational stories, and how do we pass it on from a corporate perspective.  And so I started doing the research on that.  And I was actually talking to a couple of foundations to support my research and writing when a funny thing happened along the way.  My good friend, [HM] Ron Brown, decided to run for chairman of the Democratic Party.  And I had been involved in obviously democratic politics virtually all of my life, but always as a volunteer, never as "a professional campaigner."  My work had really been in the public policy area, working in the Carter Administration.  But all of my campaign work, from [HM] Andy Young, to Maynard Jackson, to mayoral races in Washington, D.C., was really volunteer campaign work.  I had never set foot in the Democratic Party.  When Ron decided he was going to run for chairman in 1988, coming off of the presidential campaign of, of [HM] Jesse Jackson and, and Michael Dukakis, where Ron had served as Reverend Jackson's campaign manager, and I had actually come in to run the Jackson operations for the 1988 convention in Atlanta Georgia, all as a part of my sabbatical when I supposed to be taking time off to do this writing, here I was volunteering to run the Jackson convention operations.  And then Ron comes out of that experience saying I wanna run for chairman of the Democratic Party, and he said I want you to run my campaign.  And I said Ron, you know, I took time off to work the convention and to work with you and Reverend for this summer.  I really am trying to run a business, and I really am trying to do some writing.  I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll help raise some money for you, but I really can't take the time to run a campaign.  He says I can win this, Alexis.  I says I'm not saying you can't win it, but I really can't take the time to run a campaign, but I will help you raise some money.  So I actually went out and helped Ron to raise the first funds to, to get him started.  And if I'm completely honest, I didn't think he would win.  But I was glad he was giving it the old college try, you know, because I thought it was important that we at least be in there challenging the party structure and to make sure that we were included.  And he would have been a great chairman, I thought, but I knew there were others who were running.  And there were those who had been really out there campaigning for quite a while for the job.  So, Ron went about the business of running for chairman of the party.  And I did go back to trying to put my business affairs in order because my timeline was to be on my sabbatical beginning in 1989, and trying to leave my business at a point where my vice president at the time, who was a terrific person, who had been with me since the Women's Bureau days, who had been with me in the business, Gloria Gutierrez, would be able to continue the operations.  That was my plan, and, and I did pretty good getting through 1988 and buttoning down the business in a way that I could take six months off.  And so I got through January, and Ron got elected chairman of the party in February of 1989.
Story_ID: 85463
Speaker 1: And he [HistoryMaker Ron Brown] asked me to, to come over and sit with him, which I did.  And we were all very excited and very joyful that he had won.  And we got through that glorious day of, of the election over at the Washington Hilton.  And the next day I went over to the party to meet with him, and he said I need your help.  And I said what is it that you want me to do?  He said I need you to come in and restructure the Democratic Party.  He says now, this is what you've been doing, you know, for the last few years with companies.  You've been going in and doing these cultural studies, doing these cultural audits, and trying to figure out what they needed to do differently to make a difference with their business teams.  He said I want you to take the same approach for the Democratic Party.  I want you to treat it like a business, and I want you to come in and do an assessment and tell me what is it I need to do differently to win the presidency in 1992.  I said what?  He said, you know, I've got one goal: I wanna win in 1992.  And I want the campaign to start today.  And I want you to tell me what is it I have to do to staff up and run this like a business.  And he says you go do a cultural audit; you do whatever you have--whatever you wanna call it, he said, just go do it.  And I went through my thing about I'm on sabbatical now.  I'm trying to take some time to do this right.  And I said but this is so important that I will take a month off, and I will come in here with you for the month of February, and I will spend the time interviewing and going through the staff, and help you put a structure in place that helps you achieve your goals.  But I want, what I want you to do, if you really wanna treat this like a business, I said you put your CEO hat on, and I want you to get very, very clear around your goals, your vision, you know, how do you really see this, because that's going to dictate how we staff up and what we do differently.  And I'm going to be your consultant.  And that's how we started.  And so I went in quote as his acting whatever.  I didn't really have a title, but I went in to do the day to day organizational work for him while he was really spending time talking and visiting with a lot of different people, getting clear on just how to retool the party.  And my Lord, we learned so much during that month of what we didn't have in terms of an infrastructure compared to what the Republicans did have, not the least of which was a communications department.  You would think that the Democratic Party had a communications shop.  It didn't.  It had a press secretary, but it did not have a formal communications shop.  It didn't even have a formal research shop, so there was no real research going on.  So there was a lot that, that we decided that we had to do differently to get this party ready to compete on a level playing field as best we could by '92' [1992].  And Ron said, you know, I know we won't be able to match the Republicans on fundraising.  The party never has because we simply don't have the funds, but at least we need to be competitive.  And so we looked at just where our weaknesses were on the fundraising side, knowing that that was something that we would never be able to match dollar for dollar.  But we at least had to figure out in these other areas how we could be competitive and how at least we could be respectable, is what he used to always say when it came to the fundraising side.
Story_ID: 85464
Speaker 1: So that's how it started.  And we put together I think a great structure and a great team.  He [HistoryMaker Ron Brown] brought in some of the best.  And one of the things that he said when he said he really wanted to run this like a professional campaign for one, was he said I want a professional staff; I want leaders in here that people will respect; I want leaders in here that can go and sit with potential presidential candidates; I want leaders in here that can sit with senators, with members on the Hill, and I want them to know that, that we are a force to be reckoned with.  And so he staffed up with that idea in mind.  He also staffed up with the idea in mind that we were going to bring the different wings of the party in to the party, that we weren't gonna have the so-called [Michael] Dukakis people, or the [HM Jesse] Jackson people, or the this people, or the that people, or the conservatives, or the new Democrats, all of these labels.  But we were going to have an operation that modeled inside the party who we were on the outside.  'Cause he said if we can show that kind of discipline on the inside, then we've got a better chance of, of, of speaking with one voice and working more effectively as a team.  And so he brought in some great people.  Paul Tully, for instance, was the political director.  Mike McCurry, who went on to become President [Jimmy] Carter's communications spokesperson--
Speaker 2: You meant President--
Speaker 1: --President, President [Bill] Clinton's, President' Clinton's spokesperson--was our first communications director.  He had worked as the press secretary for--I'm drawing, forgetting the name of the senator right now on Capitol Hill, but, but that, that's the caliber of individuals.  Mark Steitz came in to head up our first research operation.  He'd done the research for Reverend Jackson.  And, and all of these people were from very different philosophical wings, if you will, inside the DNC [Democratic National Committee].  Melissa Moss, who was a member of the Democratic Leadership Forum, came in as our finance director.  We had retooled the whole administrative infrastructure.  We had Christine Varney, who went on to become one of the commissioners of the FCC as, as the general counsel.  And he wanted a diverse team.  Diversity was very important to Ron in terms of, of, of the--again, not just the stature, but really mirroring who we were inside the party.
Story_ID: 85465
Speaker 1: The one thing he [HistoryMaker Ron Brown] didn't have was a chief of staff.  We had hired all of the other major players, and we had interviewed two or three really top-notch individuals to be chief of staff, and he kept not making a decision, and here we were into March.  And I was like, Ron, we've gotta converge on getting this team in place.  And so I kept extending my volunteer assignment with him.  And then one day--I'll never forget it--he called me, and he says, Alexis, I have found the perfect person.  I said thank God.  I said is it so and so?  No, 'cause, you know, I'm with him in all of these interviews.  He had offered the job to me way in the beginning, and I'd said no, my job is to help you find the right person, you know.  So, I went through the list of two or three people that were at the top of our list.  And I said is it this?  No, no, no.  He says you have to come and meet this person in my office.  I said I am on my way.  I was over at my office at the time.  And so I told Gloria [Gutierrez], I said Ron has finally made a decision on the chief of staff.  And she said who is it?  I said I don't know, but I'm going over.  He wouldn't tell me on the phone.  So I go into his office, and there he is.  And he's got this, you know, sort of Cheshire cat grin on his face that he used to always have when he had something up his sleeve.  And I said okay, where is the person?  He said sit down, and so I sat down.  And I said who is it?  He said it's you.  I said no, it's not me.  We've been through this before.  I can't do this, you know.  I said I told you where I am, what I'm trying to do.  And you know, there's nothing I won't do for you, but I, I can't do this job.  And he says but look at this great team we have assembled.  And then he parrots back to me (laughter) everything we've been doing.  We've got Paul this, and Melissa here, and then--I says I know who've, I, I know who the team is.  He says you can't leave us now.  You know, we're a team now.  And so I stepped back and I realized here I am going on two months at the [Democratic] Party.  I'd been in the midst of, of it all, running the meetings and really playing the acting role of his chief of staff, but never formally accepting the title.  So we sat there for the rest of that evening going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.  And finally, you know, by the end of it all, I said okay, Ron, I will do this for one year.  And I said after a year, we've got to agree that, you know, we're gonna start to figure out who's really gonna stay with you through this journey.  But he was saying, you know, they say we can't do it; look at the team we've got.  We were starting to take a little press hit that he hadn't announced the team, and we were like going into our second month.  And he said we need to get out there, and we need to hit the ground running, and we need to show that we've got a top leadership group in here that can do it.  So, that was the end of March.  April, we made the announcement.  I gave Ron a year's commitment, and, and we hit the ground running.  That was 1989.  I had to do a lot of back-peddling.  Luckily, I had planned to be away for six months on my sabbatical to write.  I hadn't planned to be away for a year, but I figured I'd have to sort of work through that.  I was fortunate enough that I had clients that I was at least into multiyear commitments.  So I could see my way from a business standpoint of view into the beginning of another year, for two years, and I had a lot of confidence in Gloria [Gutierrez].  So I thought financially I could at least go through that first year on the business that we had and possibly a second year if I had to.  So that's, you know, so that started my journey at the party with Ron.
Story_ID: 85466
Speaker 1: Why do you think that he [HM Ron Brown] did not--you know, being black, in that, the first black in that position did not hinder him?  Was it the work that you, you think that you guys did in that early part before he sort of became the black person there?  I mean you know how that happens to us often, that there are so many demands on us because we're the first person to be in that, that position, or--
Speaker 2: Say that again--
Speaker 1: --was it because he--
Speaker 2: --what you're trying to--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to understand, you know, why he was successful.  Do you think it was that early work?  You know, a lot of times when we're the first black we get labeled as the first black, and so all the focus is on that and not really on--and that person is going around being the first and talking and appearing, as opposed to moving an agenda, you know, forward, as, as the head of--'cause you--he really restructured the DNC into a more--or you guys did together--
Speaker 2: I, I, I think Ron was successful for three big reasons.  First, Ron had been a deputy chair in the party, so he had done his homework.  He knew the party; he knew the players; he knew the people; he was a very skilled--he wasn't just a very skilled political person, but he had practical experience in understanding the party.  And it's like, I think so many times for us when we're in a number two or a number three role, we oftentimes don't get the credit being in those roles for really knowing what it takes to run the operations.  So Ron had the knowledge, and he had the experience, and that's really how he won.  He used those relationships, the network.  He knew how to move that party apparatus.  And he came from behind.  Let's remember, Ron Brown was the back of the pack to be elected.  So that was number one.  But I think people underestimated his basic skill and ability when it came to understanding the party, its operation, and his own talents to put it together.  Number two, he had an agenda.  He didn't just come in as the first African American to lead the party.  He knew that he had to make a difference.  And he used to always say to me: Alexis, I don't wanna be remembered as the first African American to lead the DNC.  That's not the legacy that I wanna leave.  I wanna be remembered as someone who made a difference while I was here.  And he never, ever in the entire time that I was with him abandoned the notion that he was gonna do everything in his power to elect the president in 1992, even when [President] George [H.W.] Bush was ninety percent in the polls at the height of the Gulf War.  So, he had an agenda, and he did not stray from that agenda, and he staff up in a way to continue to execute and to, to implement that agenda.  But the third thing that he did, which was quite masterful and it worked, when he said I want to run this party like a campaign, and it starts day one, he said that means we have to start winning now.  We can't wait until 1992, and the party had not done that before.  He stepped back, and he said what races are appointed in 1989 that we're gonna target, and we're gonna go after, and we're gonna play hard to win.  And we're gonna start to partner right now in those races, and lay a market down.  And he picked three: He picked Doug Wilder, who was running for governor in Virginia; he picked [James] Florio, who was running for governor in New Jersey; and he picked David Dinkins, who was running for mayor in New York City, because he said the way you win presidential campaigns, mayors are important because they have the city.  They're on the ground; they're the frontline players.  Governors are important.  They have the secretary of states; they have the, they have the state apparatus.  We have to start to win over our support at the grassroots level.  And so he wanted to send a signal that--he said even if we don't win these campaigns, even if we don't win these elections, we need to start to figure out how to partner with low--mayors at local levels, and we need to figure out more effective state partnerships.  And we've gotta start practicing now how to do it.  And so we went after those races.  And then unfortunately, you know, that was the year Mickey Leland died [1989], and we had to have a special election in Texas, and we had another special election that year.  You know, Mickey, that broke all of our hearts.  But we ended up with some big races on our plate that year.  And guess what?  We won every last one of them, and we didn't telegraph a thing.
Story_ID: 86275
Speaker 1: You said you won every campaign.  So you said he [HM Ron Brown] was gold--that's what you were saying, he was golden at that point.
Speaker 2: At that point, when, two things happened: we won all of the races in 1989, and so the party was back.  I mean we'd had a devastating lu--loss--with [Michael] Dukakis in '88' [1988].  And here a year later, we win all of the races in 1989.  You know, Doug Wilder made everybody feel great as the new governor of Virginia. [James] Florio ran a great campaign and won in New Jersey.  It was an important bellwether state for 1992.  And everyone knew that New Jersey is a very important state when it comes to electoral politics.  And then you had a historic first with [HM] David Dinkins in New York.  So, the party was on a high in terms of what had happened.  But the other thing that was the story behind that story, we had actually raised some money.  And you know, one of the big criticisms of, of Ron's detractors when he was running was that he wouldn't be able to raise the money.  And there had been press stories on that front, that the party was going to go down the tubes; Ron Brown would be the demise of the Democratic Party because he wouldn't be able to raise the funds.  Well, you know, success begets success.  So the fact that we were competitive in these races, we were playing hard, and we were able to raise some funds, and then when we won, we were able to build on that success and started raising money and becoming even more credible, from the party's perspective--now granted, we, to this day, we cannot compete with the Republicans when it comes to fundraising, but we were at least holding our own and starting to make a real difference.  And so all of the naysayers, in terms of those who had said that Ron couldn't do it, basically had to admit that he'd had a great first year and that we were actually positioned to go into 1990 for the off year of the House and Senate races in better shape than we had been in a long, long time.  And that momentum, quite frankly, kept building and building all the way into 1992.
Story_ID: 86276
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe or what the, the night that, begin with the night of the winning of the races, you know, where you were, and who was there, and you know, just how everyone felt?
Speaker 2: Well, that first night in 1989, it was really funny because, you know, Doug Wilder's race was very, very close.  Well, all these races, quite frankly, were very, very close.  And we had two scripts.  We had a script if we won, and we had a script if we lost.  And our losing script was going to be how close we came, and of course the winning script was just wonderful.  But we didn't have a lot of takers that night.  Typically what happens election night at Democratic Party headquarters, you know, your friends come in.  The Democratic club is next door to the party, and, and you're there for the victory celebration.  What was so interesting about 1989, we had extended the invitation, but we didn't have a lot of hangers-oners, if you will.  The crowds weren't necessarily there.  So we had the staff spread out doing the election returns in the offices that evening.  But gradually, as the word started to get out that, that we were winning, we started having midnight crowds showing up.  And for us, quite frankly, it was the next day that was really the big celebration because we had won.  And the press calls, the demand for, for Ron to do interviews, it was just extraordinary.  We had a hard time that first night getting our press lined up, you know, for the victory lap, so to speak.  But he never lost--I can still see his face now--he never lost confidence.  He kept saying we were going to win; it was going to be a great night; and regardless of whether or not you believe it, you always keep your game face on to keep, you know, everybody pumped.  We had works in the field.  We had completely emptied out the Democratic headquarters.  Ron had said there's no need for any staff except essential staff to run election night to be here.  Half our staff was in Virginia working in the Wilder campaign.  We had staff in New York.  And so we had put our people in the field.  And so gradually in the course of the night, you know, the cars were coming back; staff were driving back, those who hadn't stayed in the states.  And our party really erupted that night, in the middle of the night, when it was clear that, that we had won.  And I can remember the Wilder race, which was the one we were really on pins and needles about.  It was the last race to be called.  It was a remote box in Upstate Virginia, and the numbers kept going back and forth.  And we had two staff people who had worked that precinct.  I shall never forget it.  And they called in, and they told Ron don't you worry.  They haven't counted those boxes yet, but we know we won those boxes.  And we knew that if we won those boxes, that Doug Wilder had won the state of Virginia.  But the tally wasn't in, and we said how do we know we won them?  And I can remember Alice saying because we drove people to the last minute, to the call--closed the polls, and it's our people that was standing in line, and those votes have not been counted.  And they were absolutely right.  They were absolutely right.
Speaker 1: That's fabulous.
Story_ID: 86277
Speaker 1: So, at this point, you're not thinking of going back at this point with your business?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, you've catapulted in a whole different direction.  So now--
Speaker 2: Well, I shouldn't--no, I was always thinking about--I never, ever made the decision not to go back to my business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was clear that I was going to do a year.  And for me a year meant transitioning into the spring of 1990, 'cause I had already committed for '89' [1989].  So my assumption was that I would stay until the summer of '90' [1990], transition, because you would then be getting ready for the elections of the fall for the House and Senate.  And so I had planned to transition the summer of 1990, and by Labor Day, be back in place in my business, because that's when the race really begins, September, October, and then election would be November of '90' [1990].  And so you need to make a transition before the new election cycle.  So that was my personal schedule, and Ron and I had agreed to that.
Story_ID: 86278
Speaker 1: Now one, one question comes to mind.  Did, did the, the white part of the Democratic Party, did that, those winnings, did that frighten them at all?  Was there any part of that--you know, 'cause he's--I'm--I've asked my question.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Was there any, you know, sort of tug and pull, even after the success, is what I'm--
Speaker 2: There was always--I mean the tug and pull never went away.  What happened, though, was that Ron was a force to be reckoned with.  And what had been perhaps more public chatter, and oftentimes playing out in the press to undermine his leadership, was probably more backroom chatter, more private chatter, as opposed to the, what I would consider to be more of, of an obvious public commentary.  That certainly changed.  But no, it did not go away completely.  No, it did not go away completely.
Speaker 1: Now is he saying at this point, I still wanna go for president in 1992--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, he never abandoned that.
Speaker 1: He never abandoned it.
Speaker 2: He never abandoned that.  That was always--and when we sat down February of '89' [1989], when I said what's the mission, you know, what's our goal here?  He said our goal is to elect a president in 1992.  I said Ron, all Democratic chairman say that.  That's what you're supposed to say as leader of the party.  But what do you really wanna work on?  What do you really wanna get done?  He says this is what I really wanna do.  That's what I really want to get done.  And I wanna staff up and work as though that's what we're, you know, that's our goal.  I could never get him to change that vision statement, that mission, I couldn't.  And so everything we did, you know, when the money got tight, you know, when--as, as it did, it always came back to, you know, if you have to not support state X versus state Y, candidate X, candidate Y, all the strategic decisions you have to make in running a party, what is the most important call as it relates to the '92' [1992] race, you know?  Are you going to carry the state of Oklahoma?  Probably not.  Do you have a shot at carrying Louisiana?  Probably so.  So when you have resource calls like that, I mean it was all driven through the prism of '92' [1992].  And it actually became very important for us as a staff because, you know, you can get pulled in a million different directions.  And so sometimes we had to stop and ask ourselves, while it might be important and good to do, is it gonna keep us strategically focused on the race for '92' [1992]?  He never abandoned that.
Story_ID: 86279
Speaker 1: So now what was the work that occurred?  So you decide to stay on as what?
Speaker 2: So I took the title as chief of staff to the party, and I was the first woman.  And, and I can even remember [HM] Ron [Brown] and I talking about the fact, when you talk about white backlash, that we had two African Americans at the top of the Democratic Party.  And I even said to him, Ron, you know, I'm not so sure that this is the image, given everything else you are having to deal with, this is just one more thing for your detractors to point to, that we're gonna be too black and too black at the top.  Do you know?  And he said Alexis, you know, this isn't about being too black, or too white, or too anything.  The message I wanna send is that I'm bringing in the best leadership, that I've got the best staff, that I've got a team here that can get the job done.  And if that means they're black, or blue, or green, I don't care, you know.  He said you let them talk.  If it doesn't bother you, it certainly doesn't bother me.  So I said well, that's all I needed to hear, 'cause you just need to know that's probably gonna be said.  And he said they're gonna talk anyway.  He said but once, you know, once we do our work, then they will have less and less to talk about.  And, and so he believed that very strongly.  And we never, ever again talked about the fact that I was, you know, also an African-American woman.
Speaker 1: You know, see, that says a lot about his leadership.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Some people buckle under it, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --he never walked away from that.  And if anything, he liked saying that we had the first woman at the top of the party, in terms of running the party a chief of staff on a day-to-day basis.  That's as far as he would go in, in that context.  And then, you know, sometimes he would jokingly talk about the fact that this is what people wanted to say, you know, when he wanted to brag about the diversity and the strength in our diversity.  And he would sometimes tell the story about diversity as a strength, and how we can't let labels and stereotypes hold us back from doing what we think is, is the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 86280
Speaker 1: So what were the critical things that you then outlined for 1992, the two of you together?
Speaker 2: Well, when it came to '92' [1992], I was prepared to leave, as I said, in 1990.  And so I didn't really plan to be around for '92' [1992], and my mother [Gloria Broadus] passed in, in August of 1990.  And it was, for me, really from that day to this probably the most devastating experience that I'd had.  You know, I was an only child.  It was just the two of us, so it just threw me for an absolute loop.  And I was actually not able to function.  So while I'd planned to work through the summer, leave in September, I had a really tough time just functioning at all.  And so in--when I came back, I ended up taking, obviously, the rest of August off and most of September.  And [HM] Ron [Brown] was very, very supportive of, of me during that time, both he and [HM]Alma [Brown] were very supportive.  And, and he basically said to me, Alexis, even though, you know, we had planned to make a transition, let's just give it until the end of the year, and then we'll talk and see how you feel.  So, that's what I decided to do.  I decided to stay through the end of the year, and we agreed that we would talk at the beginning of the year.  But in, in August of that year, before my mother had passed, the Democratic governors had met in Mobile, Alabama.  And [Bill] Clinton was then head of the Democratic governors.  And I always credit President Clinton with perhaps being responsible for me having the opportunity to, to spend the last days with my mother just before she passed because, quite honestly, had Bill Clinton not been chair of the Democratic governors that year, and it being in my hometown of Mobile, I would never have gone home.  Because our pattern had been whenever Ron was way on conferences or party meetings, I typically stayed behind because it was my job to be the point person at the party and to be there on a day-to-day basis.  He did the traveling, except for the Democratic meetings or the party meetings in the field.  But Ron encouraged me to go to Mobile for the Democratic Governor's meeting, one, because it was my home, and he knew that, that I knew President Clinton from my days in the Women's Bureau, because [HM Ernest Green] Ernie Green and I, who had been great friends, was from Little Rock.  And Ernie had introduced me to Bill Clinton, and I'd actually been in the president and Hillary's home when he was just a young, budding governor during his first election.  And so to have the chance to, to see him in action at the governor's meeting, it was like a reunion, and to do at, at home.  So Ron encouraged me to go to Mobile.  My mother was gonna make gumbo for President Clinton and some of the governors who were in Mobile, and so we had turned it into a little party.  And so I went home, and two weeks later she died.  But we had a great, a great, great time.
Story_ID: 86281
Speaker 1: And [HM] Ron [Brown] said then, you know, he's [Bill Clinton] gonna run for president.  And he said and if he's gonna run for president, I think it's gonna make the race all the more interesting and exciting.  And at that time we had other candidates who were starting to talk about running.  But we had just come through the Gulf War experience, and President [George H.W.] Bush was very high in the polls.  And people were starting to sour on the party and its opportunities.  We had come to the end of 1991, just about with no declared candidates.  A lot of people forget that the typical time period for candidates to be in the race is Labor Day of, of, of certainly that year before 1991.  And so here we were, we'd gone through '90' [1990]l; we'd gone through the races; we had the Gulf War.  I--this is now my time to talk to Ron about leaving.  President Bush is off the charts.  And he basically said to me, Alexis, I know this is what we had agreed to, but if you leave now, it's gonna look like you're the first one jumping ship.  And it's, it's getting tougher, but we're still gonna win.  And I'm like, Ron, Bush is like ninety percent.  And I can remember, I took a bottle of Wild Turkey [Bourbon], and I went into his office, and I closed the door, and I said to him, I said, now this is just you and me talking.  Take off your party chairman hat.  You know, you don't have to tell the world we're gonna win in, in '92' [1992].  I wanna know what do you really think?  So when you're asking me what was the strategy, this is like the spring of '91' [1991].  I says what are we gonna do?  He says we're gonna win.  I said Ron, this is me you're talking to.  What do you think we should really do now?  Now he's been getting a lot of phone calls from members on the Hill, senators in particular, who were saying to him abandon the '92' [1992] strategy.  Let's get clear on our key House and Senate races.  What we've gotta do now is make sure we hold the House and the Senate.  Bush is going to be unstoppable in '92' [1992], coming off of the war.  So, he wasn't hearing any of it.  So we had this drink, and I said this won't go anywhere.  This is just you and me.  You don't really think we're gonna win in 1992.  And he said if we keep doing what we're doing, Bush can't stay this high in the polls for this long.  He said eventually this race is going to turn on the economy.  He said eventually this race is going to be about domestic issues.  He said you don't win presidential elections as important as foreign relations are.  He says as important as that is, this is still going to be about what's going on in my home and in my backyard, and that's where we've got to keep the focus.  And he said you can't leave.  Well, my loyalty at that point said I couldn't leave, because I was also very clear that it was going to be very, very tough.  And we were starting to get people who were saying abandon the presidential strategy and that we had to play it out.  So we decided that I would stay until the fall of '91' [1991], and that we would then look at what candidates we had in place, and begin to play out a presidential strategy.
Story_ID: 86282
Speaker 1: It was also at that time, quite honestly, that he [HistoryMaker Ron Brown] asked me, rather than going back to my business full time, if I would consider making a transition to the convention.  And he said and that would be a better way for you to leave the day-to-day operations of the party if you start to take on the day-to-day operations of the convention, and then gradually go back into your business off of the convention because you can turn the convention over to a CEO.  So I agreed to that, and that's, that's what we agreed to.  So I said that I'd stay until the fall of '91' [1991].  We were actively then working on someone who would replace me as chief of staff.  I would take the title of deputy chair of the party and chief executive for the convention, and that's what we did.  We brought in Joan Baggett, who is a terrific individual who had already been working at the party with Paul Tully in the political division as the new chief of staff.  And I took on the title of deputy chair and chief executive officer that fall for the convention itself in New York City.  And there was only one thing that was missing in terms of our strategy for '91' [1991].  We had no declared candidates, and so it was tough going because here we were all dressed up and ready to go to the dance, but no date.  And so the rumors were really abound then.  Everybody was talking about running, but by Labor Day, we had no declared candidates in 1991.  So we go to the con--Democratic Party Committee Meeting still with no candidates.  That did not gel, if most people will recall, until that fall, October, November, December of 1991.  So it was a very late presidential season.  And we'd had names spanning about at that point from [Mario] Cuomo to [Jay] Rockefeller, [Douglas] Wilder, Tom Harkin, obviously Bill Clinton--oh, my goodness, he has since passed--Paul Tsongas, Jerry Brown.  So it started happening, but it was a very late show.  And by the time we got into 1992, we had our array of candidates.  We were ready to start the early primaries out in New Hampshire.  And personally, I was starting to make the transition to move to New York City that January to take on the Democratic National Convention.

Speaker 1: Now the [1992 Democratic National] Convention, how was that a whole experience?  You had wor--you had worked tangential to the convention before, but you had never been head of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --the convention.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, but that experien--and you had worked tangential during the [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson--
Speaker 2: Actually, my first convention was 1980.
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty--
Speaker 2: --for Jimmy Carter.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got my--I cut my first teeth on a convention as a delegate floor manager--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --for Jimmy Carter.  And I worked directly at that time with Hamilton Jordon and with someone that we then called Delegate Don, Tom Donnellan, who was really running what we called the trailer operations or the candidate operations.  I had never been behind the scenes in a convention before, before that experience.  That was really my training ground.  It was interesting.  I was then viewed as quote "qualified" based on that experience to take on the mantle of helping Reverend Jackson in 1984, which was the convention in San Francisco [California].  Reverend calls it a, a crusade.  It wasn't really a campaign as much then.  But it wasn't until 1988 that I actually did go in and run the Jackson operation, bringing into bear at that point the experience that I'd had in '80' [1980] with Jimmy Carter, in '84' [1984] with Reverend Jackson.  But '88' [1988] was really what I would consider to be primetime running a candidate operation in Atlanta, Georgia, and understanding everything that was involved.  But even that view of running the Jackson operations in, in '88' [1988] still does not prepare you for what it takes to be the chief executive officer of a convention.  Because a convention at the end of the day, it's really like making a movie.  It is a television production, and your audience are really the delegates in the hall, all 13,000 of them.  It is the press that comes from around the world, and it's that television audience that you have to relate to and communicate to for an entire week, in addition to ensuring that the prime objective here is to introduce your candidate for the first time as the nominee of the party to the, to the rest of the country and the world, because that is where the campaign really does begin.
Story_ID: 86284
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go back just to the, the 1988, you know, [HM Reverend Jesse] Jackson campaign.  Who was the teams sort of nationwide that was part of it?  Doc--Emma Chappell was part--right?
Speaker 2: [HM] Emma Chappell was a part of the--she was really the treasurer, who really handled the finance.  Reverend had two campaign managers, Jerry Austin and then [HM] Ron Brown.  Mark Steitz was very involved in terms of the research and, and his communications strategy, 'cause Reverend has always had a great team of, of supporters around him historically through the Rainbow-PUSH operation.  But he really did put together a great cross-section of, of, of leadership support.  Willie Brown from California was really like the campaign chairman in many ways.  You had people like Mario Bladoff (ph.) from the Latino community, great Latino support.
Speaker 1: Was [HM] Richard Hatcher--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Dick Hatcher was very important, very involved.  [HM] Reverend Willie Barrow, who was obviously a part of Operation PUSH, really helped keep the PUSH base together.  You had Arnold Pinkney, who had really been Reverend's campaign manager in 1984, was still very much a supporter, and counselor, and, and coach to him.  The entire Jackson family was very involved.  His children, Mrs. Jackson were all very much a part of, of the campaign and, and really out in the field working.  Frank [Watkins], who has been his loyal press secretary throughout the years, was very much there.  Eleanor Holmes Norton stepped in as his director of issues.  She was very important in terms of putting together the Jackson platform for the convention.  Ron Walters, distinguished professor from Howard University, was very involved.  So it was, it was quite an array of, of talent.  I often say--you know, there're many books and stories that are written about the Jackson campaign, but I often say, for me, the legacy really is the Jackson campaign was a job-training experience.  It was a job-training program.  It really opened up the ranks for young African-American leaders in particular to do their thing, to get exposure to roles and opportunities in the formal sense of a party development, party training presidential campaigns that historically never happened before.  And to me, that is the untold story of the legacy of what happened in the Jackson operation.  When you look across the states where you had to go in and identify state organizers, state directors, African Americans never had those kinds of roles before in white campaigns.  We were always the deputy, the number two, the number three, but we were never the number ones.  And so the Jackson operation was really a training ground for a lot of young political professionals to cut their teeth on politics for the first time, starting with Ron Brown as the campaign manager.

Speaker 1: [My name is] Julieanna Richardson, I'm, I'm the interviewer, and Scott Stearns is the videographer.  And I'd like you to start out by once again stating your name and spelling it us, and today's date.
Speaker 2: Alexis Herman, A-L-E-X-I-S, H-E-R-M-A-N.  Today is July 15th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: We're in my home in McLean, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 85478
Speaker 1: I, I wanna start out just by going back over a few things.  One, I wanna talk before we, just quickly, but before we go forward.  I wanted to ask you about, once again, about your experience with the [Jimmy] Carter Administration and more importantly, from a hindsight perspective, because you worked for two south, you know, Southern presidents and their compan--campaign--and ones that, you know, who've been viewed kindly toward--in the African-American community, and I'm wondering your perspective on, you know, the camp, that campaign, and what you learned, really, during that time.
Speaker 2: Well, my perspective on, on the Carter campaign is certainly one for me that's very significant because it was my first opportunity to work for a president.  But more importantly, we came from a nurturing community I think in Atlanta [Georgia].  And I think, having had the opportunity to be a part of the Carter network in the South that had [HM] Andy Young, that had a Maynard Jackson, that had distinguished black leadership in it, that certainly was able to mentor young people like myself who came into the administration, I think there was real, a real cultural affinity, if you will, coming from the Deep South to the White House.  And so, a part of what I learned was the importance of relationships that carry you no matter where you may go in life, that the networks really do matter, and that oftentimes while we see things playing out in the news, that what goes on behind the scenes is very differently, and learning to understand what it meant to have to control the news and to make sure that you communicated on a daily basis as president of the United States what you were doing, what you were involved in, understanding, quite frankly, how legislation was develop, and, and the difference between electoral politics, which had been traditionally what I had been involved in, and how a president really has to be clear on what his agenda is going to be, how he intends to move that agenda, both in the Congress and in the constituencies around the country, and at the same time, be concerned about moving forward on an agenda that makes sense for the future.  Because to me, presidential elections are always about the future.  It's always about taking the country to higher ground, to a different level.  And that was something I think that I didn't have a real appreciation for.  It really is about the business of the next generation and the next generation after that.  And because we oftentimes are very shortsighted in terms of electoral politics, you know, we often say what have you done for me lightly, it's difficult to, to have a long-range agenda, and to be dealing in long-range issues, and to get the support that you need for that.
Story_ID: 85479
Speaker 1: Now, what--this, the Congressional Black Caucus was not happy, actually, with [President Jimmy] Carter.  Were you aware of that?  I mean, they were happy that he was elected, but they were very disappointed at his administration.
Speaker 2: I think there were a lot of issues, quite frankly, in terms those--of just how the African-American community supported or didn't support President Carter.  In the end, he had the strongest, you know, vote, quite frankly, when you look objectively at the numbers.  The African-American community actually did support President Carter.  But the division came during the campaign, when Senator [Ted] Kennedy was running for the presidency.  And there was a clear divide in, in the African-American community between those who supported Senator Kennedy and those who supported President Carter, because obviously in the African-American community the Kennedy name, the, the legacy of [President] John Kennedy, the legacy of, of Bobby Kennedy, his relationship to Dr. King and, and all of that history was, was very much a part of, of the Kennedy aura, if you will.  And so there was an unspoken loyalty to the Kennedy family name that certain was very problematic for President Carter to get the black vote, to get the support, and to get the enthusiasm, and the energy in the field.  And we had to go out and to work very, very hard and to compete for that vote in 1980 in particular.  And we had to do it, quite frankly, by running on the record.  And the more we talked about the record, the more we talked about the difference that President Kennedy had made in very practical--I'm sorry, that President Carter had made in very practical ways in the lives of African Americans, we were able to ultimately win over the African-American community.  That was one of the reasons, quite frankly, that President Carter did prevail in getting the nomination in 1980 at a very contentious convention in Madison Square Garden in New York City.  I was very much a part of, of that debate and, and the dialogue, and [HM] Ron Brown, my good friend, was heading up the African-American effort for Senator Kennedy.  He had worked for Senator Kennedy, and he was very much in the forefront on that effort.  Ron was the state director for Kennedy for California.  It was the first time you'd had an African American really leading a state effort.  And so there were a lot of issues in terms of both relationships that were at stake and the record.  And we had to work very closely to make sure that the African-American community did not come out of the 1980 convention a divided group, that the Black Caucus, that black leadership, that the rank and file of African Americans around the country would do their best to heal the wounds and to elect Jimmy Carter president in 1980.  Of course, we know that he did not get re-elected largely because of what was going on with the Iran-Contra issue at the time.  But the fact of the matter is President Carter received overwhelming support from, from the African-American community in 1980.
Speaker 1: Then why does the members of the Congressional Black Caucus now and you know, in this period talk about how disappointed they were with the Carter legacy?
Speaker 2: I think they talk about it because a lot of people remember, quite frankly, what happened with the, the division, the dissension.  That's still very paramount in the minds of a lot of people in terms of the contest, really, between Jimmy Carter and Ted Kennedy.  That is still very paramount in, in the minds of, of a lot of African Americans.  And secondly, I think there was an issue at the end of just how proactive, aggressive we should have been on the domestic front as we were embroiled in really bringing home the hostages.  And that's always an issue when you're running a presidential campaign, the foreign policy agenda versus the domestic agenda.  And there was a clear feeling that we needed to have more focus, more attention on, on the domestic initiatives at the end as we came to the Iran-Contra debate.
Story_ID: 85480
Speaker 1: And then thirdly, I think there was still real concerns in the African-American community over the resignation of, of [HM] Ambassador Andrew Young, because Andy Young, you know, had served with distinction as our ambassador and felt compelled to resign, giving the controversy at that time over the Palestinian issue and whether or not we should have contacts with the Palestinians.  Of course Ambassador Young did not believe in a no-talk policy, which was the policy at that time; that was our foreign policy at the time.  And Ambassador Young did not think that that was a way to engage a dialogue to bring about peace in the Middle East.  And of course we see today that that is still the perennial issue of getting the parties to the table and trying to maintain the dialogue today and not have those communications break down.  It's precisely the opposite of where we were at that point in time.
Speaker 2: Were you disappointed in the administration's handling of Andy Young?
Speaker 1: I was very disappointed when Andy long--Andy left office.  And was our mentor.  Andy was our champion.  For those of us African Americans who were in the administration, we looked to him for leadership; we looked to him for those informal cues and guidance points that you always need really in any job.  And he was close to the president.  He had a relationship with the president.  He was the one person who could always walk into the White House.  And so you need, you need those relationships to help you be effective.  And he was a great coach and mentor, certainly to me, and I would daresay to, to the African Americans who served in the Carter Administration.
Speaker 2: Do you think that was a, a very reflective period in his life at that point?  'Cause it was, you know, it--and a lot of the country had been looking and you know, and this was a big deal for us to have someone in that position.
Speaker 1: I think it was a reflective period for him.  I also think it was a historical turning point for the nation.  Because I think it engaged the nation in a core debate on what really is the appropriate response that we should have in terms of Middle East diplomacy.  So in many ways, for me, Andy's resignation was the catalyst for how we were able to, to probably to rethink and to jumpstart the process.  Obviously, President Carter gets a lot of credit for the work that he did at Camp David in bringing the principles together and the Camp David accord.  But Andy Young, to me, is at the top; he's the headliner there.
Story_ID: 85481
Speaker 1: Now, let's spin forward to [HM] Ron Brown, who was, who was--(unclear)--who was key for, I mean your relationship with him, and you've talked, you know, about, you know, him recruiting you and the Wild Turkey [Bourbon], you know, episode, you know, sitting down and saying, do you really think... But I'm wondering if you have--what made that, first of all, that Alexis Herman-Ron Brown, what made it work?  And two, can you share a couple other anecdotes, stories about Ron Brown?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, what made my relationship work initially with Ron Brown was [HM] Alma Brown.  I was first friends with Alma Brown.  Alma Brown worked for the National Council of Negro Women.  She worked with [HM] Dorothy Height.  And Alma and I met really through the National Council of Negro Women.  So, I met Alma first, really, before I met Ron in his capacity as the head of the Washington Urban League, for the, for the Washington office.  So, in many ways, we came together as social friends, as friends first, and certainly when I came to Washington as the director of the Women's Bureau.  Alma was a part of that extended family network of the National Council of Negro Women.  And so I had the occasion to, to see Ron and Alma on occasion socially first.  It really was not until we had the opportunity to be really on opposite sides of the 1980 presidential campaign, with Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter, that Ron and I, in terms of, of, of political partners, really came together in a political relationship that extended beyond our friendship.  And it was because we sat down and we talked about what was going on, on both sides of the aisle with both campaigns, and we recognized that no matter who got the nomination, that we could not have a divided African-American community as a result.  And to the extent that we could be a part of the healing, and that we could maintain our relationship and friendship, that hopefully it would also be a signal for others who, who were involved in, in our campaigns, our respective campaigns.  So, in, in many ways, it was the Kennedy/Carter conflict that cemented my relationship with Ron, but we actually came together because of Alma.
Speaker 1: You know, it's, it's interesting, you know, because we often look at the crabs in the barrel phenomenon, and this is such a wonderful story of, you know, black people working together.
Story_ID: 85482
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna spin forward now to the election, because when we ended you had, you know, we were just at the point of you working with the, you know, being put in charge of the Democratic National Convention.  And I want--and you said it was like a big production.  You know, you have 13,000, an audience of 13,000, and you know, and you had, you had never been involved with something.  Even though you had been involved with the, the convention before, you hadn't been involved with it in that magnitude.  And I'd just like you to talk about the convention and you know, and that, that part of the process.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, running a convention is a terrific, terrific experience.  As I look back on all of the wonderful and exciting things I've had the opportunity to do.  The DNC Convention for 1992, I, I sometimes debate whether I had more fun doing that or being Secretary of Labor.  Those were just two of the greatest experiences for me.  The convention, beca--if you, if you love the details, and if love operations, and if you love having to bounce, you know, 5,000 balls at once, then you want to run a convention.  Because, first of all, it, it is a television production.  You have to be clear that each day of the convention, it's not just about the delegates in the hall, but you're introducing your candidate, the standard bearer for the party, to the country, to the world.  And so how each day is staged and played, and how it conveys that message, is so important.  You have to be clear about what's your platform, what are your issues, what's the substance that you're trying to communicate, and who are the actors, who are speakers that are going to carry that message each day for you until your nominee gets the nomination.  A convention typically runs four to five days, but the preparations literally go on for two years, because you have to select your cities, and it's a competitive process to do that; you have to make sure that the infrastructure in a city has the ability to handle a convention all the way from the hotels that can take up to 20 to 30,000 people, accommodations for the press and the media, and all of the power, the electricity, everything that's needed to accommodate that much of a, of a production; you have to make sure that you've got a large volunteer contingency, 'cause there's no way that you're going to have a staff to handle anything this massive.  And so, you run a large volunteer staff operation of 10,000 people in a convention, and so screening, and recruiting, and being clear about who's on deck.  Your security infrastructure is enormous, from your local police department, to the fire chief, to the Secret Service that has to come in because this is about the next president of the United States.  So the security coordination and the logistics, the transportation, having the buses, and having the street routes and everything cleared so that you can run a convention on time is very, very important.  This is television, and if you're saying you're going on the air at 6:00 or 7:00 Eastern Standard Time that night, and you run four or five hours, then you know, your hall has to be full; your delegates have to be there; and the logistics of just getting them in, getting them screened in is important.
Story_ID: 85483
Speaker 1: You have to worry about the votes; after all, this is about adopting the platform that's going to guide your administration for the next four years that your delegates have input into.  And so there's a whole behind-the-scenes operation that's going on to negotiate what are you going to say about jobs, what are you going to say about the economy, what are you going to say about healthcare.  Is this a platform that you can support as delegates to this convention, and is this a platform that your eventual nominee is going to accept?  And oftentimes, there are big differences between what the delegates want and what the candidate may be saying.  And so you have to work behind the scenes by the time it's show time, to make sure that you've got the alignment, you've got the buy-in, you've got the support.  And that can be a very contentious process if it is not all worked out and, and talked about, and if people do not feel included in the process.  And that inclusion starts state by state by state, as those get delegates get elected, typically six months out, sometimes a year out to travel to the convention, to represent their constituencies and to represent the states.  And so the delegates are interested in the platform, and the substance, and the issues.  The press is interested in the story, and the message, and who's going to be the eventual nominee.  And as head of the convention, I have to worry about it all.  I had to worry about it all.  And to then to see it all come together, and to see your candidate step up and accept the nomination of your party, it is one of the most exhilarating, exciting moments I think that, that I've ever had in my entire life.
Story_ID: 85484
Speaker 1: When did you know Bill Clinton had a chance?
Speaker 2: I knew that Bill Clinton had a chance really almost from the beginning.  I knew him as governor, and so I knew he was an effective communicator, smart, that he could connect with people, that he had a vision of where he wanted to take the country.  And so the question really became: could a governor from a small state like Arkansas make that translation on the larger stage to communicate that vision, that people could feel his presence, and to know that this was a new generation of leadership that could really take us to a different level?  And I always believed that he was able to communicate who he was and what he stood for, that he could win.
Speaker 1: But he was in a crowded camp though.
Speaker 2: He was in a very crowded (unclear).  That's why I say the issue for me was could he break through.  He always had what it took in my vision and in my view to be president.  The question was really, could he break through?  And I always believed that if he could break through, that he would carry the day.
Speaker 1: And what do you think was the critical part or the moment where he broke through?
Speaker 2: I think it was right after the first primary.  I think it was right after the first primaries.  But after New Hampshire and Iowa, he was clearly on a roll.  He was the candidate to beat.  And by the time April emerged with the New York primary, then that, that really did start to cement his position.  And so the only thing that was left to seal it was California that June.  But he started off with Iowa and New Hampshire.  He then had the Super Tuesday, as we call it, which were all of the Southern primaries, which were favored to win--he was favored to win.  So the question was, could you hold out in Iowa and New Hampshire, and get to the Deep South, get to the South in March for Super Tuesday?  And if you could do that, then you were on a roll.  You hit the northeast states, Cali--New York in particular, and then it was on to the West Coast.
Story_ID: 85485
Speaker 1: Now what are you doing in this time after the convention and you know, before the general election?  Are you still--have you--are--you're still working with the DNC, but not--I'm, I'm just trying to understand what, what you did in that period of time.  It's from February to November, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, the convention was in July.
Speaker 1: July, I'm sorry, July.
Speaker 2: The convention was in July.  I spent most of August closing down the convention.  Just closing down that operation is also a massive job, and, and doing the fiscal accounting that is required, because a convention always gets reported to the FEC because they're federal dollars involved, and so you have to make sure that you have an accounting of all of your expenditures.  So it is a huge financial challenge, as well, to bring in a convention in on-time, and on budget, and not have overruns.  So, making sure that the convention was closed out properly was where I turned my attention to in August.  And then in September and October, I headed up a small operation in Little Rock [Arkansas] for the president.  I did not go directly into the campaign.  I headed a small operation that was called Transition Planning.  And there, we didn't know if the president was going to win or not, obviously we hoped he would, and I believed strongly that he would.  But the notion of pran--Transition Planning was to think about what are the first, second, third, fourth steps that you have to engage in should you win.  What do you do on day one after you get the nomination?  And so I worked a very small operation that we didn't even talk about beca--
Speaker 1: Who, who was part of that operation?
Speaker 2: There were only five of us.
Speaker 1: About--okay.
Speaker 2: There were only five of us.
Speaker 1: And so that, that was, that was just for like a two-month period until the, you know, to the election?
Story_ID: 85486
Speaker 1: I wanna ask one question, though, about the convention.  Do you--what did Alexis Herman do right with, you know, your--well, what did you do right, sorry, with your operation of the convention?
Speaker 2: Well, I took very seriously [HM] Ron Brown's charge to me.  When he said Alexis, Democratic conventions are typically the healing of primary wounds where we have so many candidates who are oftentimes vying for the nomination that we have to spend our time in the convention healing those wounds so that we can have a united front to go out in September and Octa--and October to campaign for the election.  Both of us were very reminiscent of 1980 and what happened, and we'd seen that pattern repeat itself in subsequent conventions.  Ron said I don't want this convention to be the healing of primary wounds.  I want it to be the launch of the general election campaign.  I don't want us to have to spend time healing wounds behind closed doors.  But let's let this be the convention where we showcase our candidate, what the Democratic Party really stands for, and let's do all that we can to represent who we are.  So with that in mind, it said to me we had to do several things differently, leading up to that July moment.  We had to spend a lot of time with the candidates who were running for president.  Bill Clinton was not the only one.  And in order to make sure that people were not fighting a lot of ill will by the time we got to New York.  We had to make everybody feel special and included in the process.  So I involved all of the candidate operations, if you will, in the thinking and in the planning of what we were doing with this convention, so there would be no surprises by the time we got to focus on the nomination process.  Secondly, we made a decision early on that I would get very involved in tying down what I call the logistics of running the convention.  Let's make sure the hotels are done; the transportation is done.  Let's make sure that the, the building of the stage, you know, the gathering of the arena staff, and the training, all of the infrastructure support that had to--let's get it out of the way; let's get it done early so that are we fresh and that we're energized when our candidate is ready to take over the realms of this convention.  I don't wanna be worrying about, as the Republicans were worried about in 1992, still trying retool the set, and is the set right, to get it ready for television?  So, I had a timeline that basically had everything completed by May.  I was done by May, which had never happened before, which meant June and July I could really spend time working with whomever the nominee was going to be.  Because by then, as I said, after April, you pretty much knew who the nominee of your party would be.  And you wanted to have time to spend time with the candidate and their operations, even though it was not a done deal who was the frontrunner so that you could get your message right.  When we staged that magnificent walk for Bill Clinton from Macy's into the Convention Hall the Wednesday before the nomination, that had never happened before, where a candidate simply came in to say thank you to the delegates, and I'll see you tomorrow, and I'll be here tomorrow to accept your nomination.  It was an electrifying moment, but that had never happened before.  And it happened because we had the time to work with the candidate and his team.  Harold Ickes was the leader of the Clinton convention operation, and so Harold and I became almost roommates in that last thirty days, leading into the convention.
Story_ID: 85222
Speaker 1: Let's talk about where you were the night of the election.
Speaker 2: Okay.  The night of the election, I was in Little Rock, Arkansas, and I was there with everyone else, celebrating in the, the streets of Little Rock when the president was elected.  And the very next morning, [HM] Ron Brown and I went and we paid a, a house call on Al and Tipper Gore, and we spent the morning with them in their hotel suite, just feeling good about everything that had transpired the night before.  But we were all celebrating election night in Little Rock with the president [Bill Clinton], and with the vice president, with Hillary [Clinton], and with Tipper.
Speaker 1: And did you--so at this point, you've done the plan to know that you're gonna be part of the transition team, but the announcement hasn't been made, right?
Speaker 2: I did not know what role I would be given.  I had was--it moved in very discrete phases.  After the convention, there was the Transition Planning Team, which was this little nucleus.  Then after that group handed over its report, you know, on election night, when the president won, it was the next day that the president announced his transition team.  I did not know until the next day what my role, if any, would be regarding the transition process.  And I was named deputy director to Warren Christopher for the transition.  And my responsibility was to come immediately, and that was the thing that really I had to get on top of immediately.  Warren Christopher was the director; Vernon Jordan was the chairman; and there were two deputies, myself and Mark Gearan.  And my assignment was Washington, D.C.; Mark Gearan stayed behind in Little Rock [Arkansas].  And the theory was that I was to take responsibility as the day to day person in Washington, to interface with the heads of agencies, to interface with the [President George H.W.] Bush White House, and to be very clear on what had to take place to transition the government, the institutional government.  The Little Rock team, with Christopher, was in Little Rock with the president to select the Cabinet, and to select his appointments.  I had to immediately go on a plan, come to Washington, get office space, get the--I mean it's like running the convention all over again in terms of what I had to do.  And I think they knew that, that I had the skills to hit the ground quickly, 'cause I'd just set up the convention; I'd just broken the convention down.
Speaker 1: So now I had to get to Washington and set up a transition office, get it staffed up, figure out what it was going to take to, to pull it all together.  And that was an eye-opening experience for me.
Speaker 2: In what way?
Speaker 1: You know, as an African American in particular, what, what I realized was that, first of all, this is the first time that we'd been in this kind of a role.  And I was not prepared for the large numbers of volunteers who showed almost immediately the day the doors opened for the transition to, to work in President Clinton's office.  But what was amazing was that these were lawyers, these were professionals, people who had been given leaves from their jobs to come in and work on the transition.  And there were very few, at the beginning, African Americans who could take leave from their jobs.  There were very few people of color, actually, who could take leave from their jobs to do this kind of a work on a volunteer basis.  And all of a sudden it sort of hit me, you know, this is how it works.  They're, they're people who have been doing this for years, and they understand when the power changes, when there's a, a new group coming to town, when there's, you know--the Democrats were back.  And a lot of attorneys from law firms released their lawyers to come over and, and work in the transition.  It was just an amazing process, to see these people appear from nowhere.  And we were just flooded with resumes, and I had to, to do a lot more outreach for, for people of color to say this is how it works.  You have to be in on the ground floor with transition.  You don't wait until the president is inaugurated to apply for a "job" in the administration.  And that's how we, we had done it, quite often, more than not.  Because the transition process is fast, it's quick, it moves very rapidly, and unless you know those networks and how to get in there, you would probably be waiting for the administration to get in power to quote try and then influence the, the candidate operations.  And those who knew, knew to be there at the very beginning.  And I was like, my goodness, where did all these people come from?  But they were there.
Story_ID: 85223
Speaker 1: And the decision-making process, how does that happen?  You know, because it's almost a deluge, the whole country, right?  I mean and--
Speaker 2: It was a deluge.  Unlike the convention, where I had time to be a lot more methodical, the transition is like an overnight process, you know, and it lasts for two months.  And so what you do is you set up literally a shadow government, so we quickly organized what we called these clusters.  And these clusters we've been working on in Transition Planning.  And it was a good thing we'd done it that way, because you had the economic cluster, and in the economic cluster you had the Department of Labor; you had the Department of Treasury; you had the Department of Commerce; you had Export-Import Bank - you had the various economic agencies of the federal government in that cluster; the Health and Human Services cluster, you had HHS; you had NIH [National Institute of Health], you had that group; you had an education cluster; and then you had a leader of those various clusters that almost function like Cabinet secretaries.  For instance, Jeanetta Cole was the head of the education cluster.  You had Franklin Raines, head of the economic cluster.  And so, all of the briefing books and all of the issues that were germane to those agencies, so that you could quickly get on top of the issues, would go into that cluster.  And so you managed by cluster.  So let's say there was a pending strike--I'm making this up because there wasn't, but let's assume there had been a pending strike that the labor department was involved in that would have a very debilitating effect on the country,  let's say we're in the middle of an airline strike that the Secretary of Transportation may have been involved in, all of those types of issues would have risen to the top of the agenda as you're transitioning--the transportation department, which Federico Pena headed up, the transportation cluster, former mayor of Denver [Colorado]--so that we would know immediately how to pick up on the negotiations and what was involved in that set of issues.  So you had to have great strategic thinking going on during this two-month period, so that when the official transition took place in January, that your agencies theoretically would not have major issues falling through the cracks.  And then President [George H.W.] Bush designated a person to work on a day-to-day basis with Mark and myself on these operational issues, and it happened to be the gentleman who is now [George W.] Bush, Bush's chief of staff, Andy Card.  Andy Card at the time was the Deputy Secretary of Transportation, and he was then acting Secretary of Transportation.  He was the designated liaison for President [George H.W.] Bush, Sr., and he was my day-to-day contact.  And so we talked quite a bit around issues in the various agencies, and he was a terrific individual to work with, quite frankly.  And in the first meeting it--that we had with President Bush at the White House--it was [HM] Vernon Jordan, Warren Christopher, myself, Mark Gearan, and Andy Card.
Story_ID: 85224
Speaker 1: Now, what--did you have ideas at this point about what you wanted to have sort of as your prize?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  I was very clear that I did not wanna go back into government, that I wanted to go back to my business.  I had taken this magnificent sabbatical that wasn't planned to begin with, with [HM] Ron [Brown].  I felt that I had served in office before under President [Jimmy] Carter.  And I thought between the convention, which had been a wonderful experience--but you know, I was, I was exhausted--so I'd had an intense year of running the convention, which was rounding out with even more intensity as deputy director of the transition, and being pretty much responsible for the day-to-day operations in Washington, for all of that came together while the president, and Christopher [Warren], and Mark Gearan were really working on the Little Rock transition office.  We had two sets of offices.  We had the Little Rock [Arkansas], and we had Washington.  So, Vernon Jordan talked to me, and, and I was pretty clear that I wanted to go back into my own business.  And he said well, the president wants you to, to come into the administration, and he said you need to think about what you want to do.  And I said you now, I'm, I'm honored, but I think I can best help Bill Clinton by staying on the outside, 'cause you need people on the outside as well.  So I really didn't lay down a marker.  And gradually, as the Cabinet was selected, I had five Cabinet members who offered me their number two spots, including Ron Brown when he got named commerce.  He just assumed that I was gonna be the Deputy Secretary of Commerce.  And it was like, well, you know we're a team; you know we go to together; you know you're gonna be my deputy, and I'm like, no, not doing that.  And so the one thing that I did get clear on, after talking with five of my colleagues who went on to, to become members of the president's Cabinet, that I didn't wanna go in and be the deputy secretary for any agency.  I'd gotten finally clear that I didn't want to be the operations person, and it helped me to get clear that I didn't wanna go into an agency.  My name was at that point also being tossed around for the labor department, but I was really in the midst of running the transition, and so it really was not appropriate for me to be in consideration, if you will, for a Cabinet job.  It was my job to help the president staff and select his Cabinet, and so I was involved in the vetting and the recommendations.
Story_ID: 85225
Speaker 1: I tell a wonderful story of literally tracking down Federico Pena in the Dallas [Texas] airport, because he had headed up and done a wonderful job of our transportation cluster head.  He turned over all his books and binders to for whomever was going to be President [Bill] Clinton's Secretary of Transportation.  And he said Alexis, I'm going back to Denver [Colorado].  It's been great working with you.  Good luck to the administration.  And I was begging him to give me one more day, two more days, you know.  And he's like, you know, you're my friend.  I came here to work with you and to--'cause I love Bill Clinton, and he asked me to do this job, but I've got work to do back in Denver.  Federico Pena wasn't out of my office two hours when I got the call from Little Rock [Arkansas], saying where is Federico?  The president wants to name him Secretary of Transportation (laughter).  And I said oh, my God, he just left for the airport.  They said catch him; we need him Little Rock tomorrow morning for the announcement.  I said you've got to be kidding me.  So, they said no, you gotta find him.  So here I was, running down to the transportation cluster's offices, does anybody have Federico's travel arrangements?  Is he on a direct flight back to Denver?  We've gotta, I've gotta find him.  I couldn't say why, 'cause, you know, all of these announcements were like confidential till the president announced them.  And so they said well, he's changing planes in Dallas, and he's--or Dallas or Houston; I can't remember which city it was--on his way back to Denver; we couldn't get him on a direct flight.  I said thank God.  I need that flight number, and I need him paged as soon as he lands--I think it was Dallas--as soon as he lands in Dallas, get him, get him on the phone for me.  And then I told my assistant, who was making some of these arrangements confidentially, I said let's get in touch with Little Rock.  Let's find out how we get Federico from Dallas to Little Rock.  He doesn't know it, but he's gotta get there.  So luckily, I, I tracked him in the airport when his plane landed.  He calls me.  He says, you just don't give up, do you?  What's going on?  Is there something wrong?  I said Federico, you're wanted right away by the president-elect in Little Rock, Arkansas, and you have to be there for tomorrow morning.  He said Alexis, what's going on?  I said Federico, all I can tell you is, number one, you cannot say where you're going (laughter); number two, you gotta get there, and get your family in gear.  He says, does this mean what I think it means (laughter)?  He, he said, what agency?  I said trust me, it will fit you (laughter). And so, we got him to Little Rock, and the next morning, or the--you know, he gets there really in the middle of the night.  And the next morning, there he was, on the camera with the president, being announced as his Secretary of Transportation.  It was great, you know.  But that's what it was like.
Story_ID: 85226
Speaker 1: And so I was very involved in really helping the president pull the Cabinet and pull the team together.  And I thought my work would be finished on January 21st, when the new administration came in.  And I kept saying you need somebody--it was one of the reasons they picked me, actually.  I said you need someone who's gonna head your transition who has no desire to go into the Cabinet, who's not looking to go into the administration, so I'm not trying to compete for a job here.  So I was quite happy and very focused on what I was doing.  And then one day, Mack McLarty came in to see me on behalf of the president, and everyone knew that Mack was going to be the chief of staff.  And he says I hear you don't wanna go in, and I said that's true.  And he says well, we've got two offers on the table for you, 'cause the president wants you in the White House.  I said really?  And then he made me two offers, actually.  And I must admit, by now, I have some inkling here that, you know, maybe if I go into the White House; I have not had had that experience; I've been in an agency; I worked at the labor department, maybe if I go in for two years--this is what I'm thinking--I could kind of work with--the work that I'm doing, I could try to transition off and, and do that.  And so, they offered me the head of White House personnel and public liaison.  And because I'd been very focused on the agencies, and 'cause that had really been what I was doing as a part of Transition Planning, I hadn't given a lot of thought to the inner workings of the White House and how all of that was gonna come together.  That's the personal staff of the president.  It really wasn't high on my radar screen in terms of infrastructure planning, because those are the personal selections; the personal staff is the purview of the president and whoever selects as the chief of staff.  So it was very late in the day for me actually.  I won't, I'll never forget it, 'cause I called [HM] Ron [Brown], and I said you know, I'm rethinking my big decision not to go in.  What do you think?  He says, what do you mean what do I think?  What's there to think about, you know?  And then I remember around the same time, I got a call from [HM] Earl Graves who says, I don't know what you're thinking about, and this is an unsolicited call, but I'm calling to give you some unsolicited advice.  And he was terrific in just talking to me about options and thinking it through.  And then [HM] Vernon [Jordan] was a great coach.  Dr. Height, [HM] Dorothy Height was a great coach.  And I think through these different conversations, I finally decided, yeah, you know, this is history, and it's an opportunity to be a part of a great team, and somebody that I thought was gonna make an enormous difference, and to work in the White House.  And there had never been an African-American woman as an assistant to the president.  There had been special assistants, but no one had ever headed a White House department.  The only other African American had been [HM] Colin Powell, as head of the national security staff.  And of course, the one that we all knew and loved, in the Carter days, was Louis Martin, but Louis was a special assistant.  And Louis really did African-African politics for the president.  So this was this was a chance, you know, to, to break new ground in a different way.  So, the more I thought about it, the more I decided that I wanted to do the public liaison job, and so that's what I ended up committing to that December, just before the president made his announcements.  And I flew to Little Rock [Arkansas] (laughter) with that announcement, right before the Christmas holidays.
Story_ID: 85227
Speaker 1: Tell me what the, the, the role of public liaison, what it entails.
Speaker 2: The role of public liaison for Bill Clinton was four-fold.  And each president shapes their own public liaison office.  First, it's building public support for presidential priorities, so passing the president's economic plan or passing the Welfare to Work Bill, these were all legislative priorities for Bill Clinton that we had to help build public support for.  Secondly, we are the office that really has to respond to the core constituencies of the president when they have issues, when they have concerns, to bring them into the White House.   Whether that's the business community, the African-American community, the, the Hispanic community, the women's community, the disabled community, seniors, it came through the Office of Public Liaison.  Thirdly, we are also the office that really conducts the daily briefing on issues for the President of the United States.  So when we had to invite in perhaps farmers from rural America, or we would have to invite in disabled leaders to hear what we were doing on disability policy, when the president was looking to have his mend it, don't end it policy on affirmative action and we brought in business leaders, leaders from the civil rights community, these were all issues that went through the Office of Public Liaison.  And then lastly, a major events that are coordinated at the White House, such as the signing of the Middle East peace process, the various public bills, the very first legislation the president signed, the Family and Medical Leave Act, all of these major events at the White House, we are typically the office that organized these events, including the guest lists, the invitation lists, for the president.
Speaker 1: Well, this was historic.  African Americans hadn't been at that level before, so I'm just wondering what you learned that was sort of surprising and how, you know--I mean what about that access to power at that level was surprising?
Speaker 2: I learned a lot of thing that were surprising.  I think the thing that surprised me most was how we had not been invited into the White House before, and how many times I would extend an invitation to someone for an event, for a briefing, and they would say this is my very first time of ever being invited to the White House.  So, just the fact that it was such an enormous opportunity to invite people in, to get their input, to get their ideas, made us a much richer, I think, administration because of the diversity of thought and ideas.  And I think, in part, it, quite frankly, contributed to the success that Bill Clinton really did have as president, from his economic policies, all the way to what we were able to do to, literally to turn this country around in eight years.  It happened because we got the input, we sought the input, and we, we had people always in our White House from all over America, and I'm proud to say virtually from every segment of the country.  So that was the first big surprise, the people who hadn't been in, and how easy it was to include them into the process, and what a difference it made when you had an inclusive process, and you are able to hear points of view from different constituencies, and you weren't necessarily held captive to any one point of view, that it was easier to forge a consensus.  And when you couldn't forge that consensus, when you couldn't get that agreement, it was still important to invite 'em in, to have the face-to-face conversations, and to say this is why I can't do it, and to be honest and straight about it.  I think the other thing that I learned was the, the, the lack of involvement that we had on the foreign policy front, in terms of, again, bringing our domestic constituents into the development of a foreign policy agenda, whether it was Bosnia and what we did with ethnic Americans, to Haiti and South Africa and reaching out for African Americans, to what the president did in Ireland.  He was very involved in the Ireland peace process.  We had a lot of Irish Americans that came into that White House and talked to us about it.
Story_ID: 85228
Speaker 1: Wow, talk about a global view of the United States.  But anyway, let's--so you--what other things are you proud of during that period, because I'd like to get to the--you becoming Secretary of Labor.  But what--is there anything else that you were--because how did the, how did the deci--how is the decision--you were in that position three--
Speaker 2: I was in the position four years.
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: The first term--
Speaker 1: First--
Speaker 2: --I served as director of public liaison.
Speaker 1: Now were you getting--would you have stayed in that position?  Were you getting restless?
Speaker 2: I would not have stayed in that position.  The decision for me, after the first term in office, was whether or not I would take a different role in the White House or whether or not, quite frankly, I would consider going into the Cabinet.  Those were the options that I was considering.
Speaker 1: And how did the, how did the, the Department of Labor, how did that manifest?  It was a natural for you, but how did it manifest?  Was it Robert Reich leaving?  Was it--okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it manifested itself--Bob Reich had already announced, of course, that he was not going to, to serve in a second term.  I was, again, a part of a transition process, a very small group, when the president was rethinking the second term, the second Cabinet.  Because I'd worn the transition hat the first time around, I think he thought it was natural for me to be a part of that transition team the second time around.  And then one day I was asked to leave the transition meetings (laughter), to say that it was probably not appropriate for me to continue to be a part of the transition discussions, because the president actually had me on the list for consideration of one of the Cabinet agencies, specifically the labor department.  So in order not to compromise the process and, and what he was considering at the time--you know, there are always lots of lists, lots of referrals--I stopped going to those meetings.  But I was always told that the president wanted me in the second term to be his Secretary of Labor.
Speaker 1: That's so fabulous.
Speaker 2: So it came so--the announcement was made, and then the confirmation process started.  And that's when--and we're in a point where there's--I mean in the context, you know, the Republicans have been stonewalling all of his appointments and things like that, and--so, that was a period of time that was, was, it was 150 days, right, it took you to get confirmed?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Well, actually, it actually did start with my nomination.  Because even thought the president wanted me to be Secretary of Labor, there were other candidates that did come from the outside.  And so there was somewhat of a struggle, if you will, for me to, to secure the nomination.  And in order to secure the nomination, you have to have the support of the committees on the Hill in order to be assured of a confirmation hearing.  So quite frankly, my first challenge was, even though I was Bill Clinton's choice, I still did not have the support, the political support, for the nomination itself.  And no president wants to nominate their candidate unless they know that they will be able to be confirmed or have a good shot at it anyway.  So we had a very difficult struggle, quite frankly, getting my nomination through.  And that happened after two very long months of going back and forth.  And there was a point in time when I actually thought the president would not nominate me as Secretary of Labor because of the political battle that was ensuing on Capitol Hill.
Story_ID: 85229
Speaker 1: There are really three parts to going into public office.  It's the nomination process itself where you really go through your vetting, where you screen, where you have to make sure that you will clear the Hill, that you can be nominated, and that you can withstand the second phase, which is then the confirmation process, where you go through the drilling and the questioning on the issues, and the Senate gets to interview the president's candidate.  That really is what it's about.  But the president has to be first be sure in the nomination process that you are worthy of selection.  And then the third phase is typically called the affirmation process, which is when you're sworn in, and you have the votes, and it, it's then the start of, of your, of your Cabinet tenure.  And typically you, you expect affirmation to come right after confirmation.  That didn't happen with me.
Speaker 2: How did you get over the first hump though, to--with, with, you know, labor?  And just sort of paint the environment.  The unions were already upset--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: The unions were initially supporting the candidacy of Harris Wofford, who was a great senator from Pennsylvania and, and a great friend of organized labor.  And I think it wasn't, as much as they kept saying, they were opposed to me, as they were for Harris Wofford, and were very vocal in, in saying that if the president nominated me, that they would support me.  But I, I think that they would have preferred that I, that I wear--take on another Cabinet post initially.  But I had some good friends in, in labor, and I had worked closely in the labor movement, going all the way back to my days with Mr. [A. Philip] Randolph and, and Bayard Rustin.  And in particular, there was one labor leader, Al Shanker, who was head of the American Federation of Teachers, who was ill at the time, but who called me from his sickbed to say that he was standing with me and standing, standing behind me.  He, he died not too long after that of cancer.  And, and that made a big difference.  And I think because I did have some history with the labor movement, it was an easier conversation for me to have with organized labor.  But my support that I received from the civil rights community, [HM] Dorothy Height was sort of my campaign manager de facto.  The business community was very supportive of my candidacy.  Faith-based communities were very supportive of my candidacy.  It was interesting.  Most of the coalitions that I had worked with as director of public liaison really came to my support as the potential nominee.  And so all of the good work that we had done for the past four years really paid off, quite frankly, in my quest for the nomination.  And in particular, because of the work that we had done across the aisle on many of the president's initiatives together, they were able to help me garner Republican support.  Arlen Specter was actually the first senator to come out in support of my nomination on the floor of Capitol Hill.
Speaker 2: The chief opponent (laughter) of everything is Arlen Specter.  Now, what--how long did the confirmation, I mean the confirmation process take you?  You said that was two months.
Speaker 1: It was actually--I was nominated in December.  I had my confirmation hearings in March, but I did not get confirmed until May 1st.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, let's--okay, that's what I mean.  The, so the nomination, you get nominated, and then things start, other things start coming to the fore.  Okay, that's when May 13th coffee, right--does that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's right, all, everything that was ever wrong with the Clinton White House got caught up in my nomination, because there were two people who worked on the president's staff that ultimately became Cabinet secretaries: myself, as Secretary of Labor, and Bob Rubin, as the Secretary of Treasury.  And so we were the only two White House staff members, quite frankly, that made it through the confirmation process, and certainly mine was much more grueling than Bob Rubin's ever was.  And, and Bob left midterm.  I left at the end of, of, obviously, a very partisan election.  And so everything that was swirling around our White House, whether it was fundraisers, or the Lincoln bedroom, or White House coffees, you name it, somehow Alexis Herman had something to do with it.  And so my confirmation process became the vehicle through which all of these issues got raised.
Story_ID: 85230
Speaker 1: The, the, the one thing about your, your business operations and this Laurent Yene, whatever it's (unclear)--and your friendship with Vanessa Weaver, that tested--that put things--sort of tested things in a way, did it?  Or just--
Speaker 2: That was later.  That, that was not even a part of the nomination process.  That came much later.  All of my business issues got vetted in the nomination process, which was one of the reasons that I was so surprised, as were a number of my colleagues, quite frankly, on Capitol Hill, that this issue ever re-emerged, because it wasn't as though these issues did not get looked at during the confirmation process.  But because there was no there-there, it ultimately, you know, netted itself out.  The subsequent investigations that emerged a year after I was in office was the same issue, but with a different spin because now they came and he--this individual in particular flat out lied.  And--because the first so-called stories that were told got checked out, and they didn't go anywhere.  So this was a reinvention of new stories, so it just didn't end.
Story_ID: 85231
Speaker 1: And so when you--the day that you were sworn in, all your supporters were there, ri--no, the day that your--a vote--the vote came up for your--to be confirmed, right, everyone, [HM] Dorothy Height, a lot of people were in that audience that day, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I had two swearing-ins.  I had a private swearing in because, immediately, when the vote came, the president said you get to work.  And I had a swearing-in the very next day in the Oval Office with my immediate family, and Dr. Height was there.  And the vice president swore me in with the heads of the committee and my home congressperson from Mobile, Alabama.  And my public swearing-in, where I was able to invite all the people who supported me and I had this terrific outpouring of support that was just a wonderful moment at the labor department, was May 9th.  That was my public swearing in, and that's what most people remember.  The Deltas, my sorority, they were terrific because they had really walked the corridors of, of Capitol Hill, as, as had so many individuals.
Speaker 1: And that's--were you surprised about all of this?  Because you had been through the confirmation process before, you know, under the [Jimmy] Carter Administration, and you knew the department and all of that, and there's this long, huge process.  Were you, you know, were you surprised?  Were you disappointed?  Were you--did you feel that once everything was over, at least you were there?
Speaker 2: I was surprised and I was disappointed.  Because you, you're right, I, I, I knew the department.  I felt good about going, and for me it was like going home again.  And so I did not expect to have the issues so drawn out, and quite frankly, I didn't expect after my confirmation hearing, which by all accounts, I thought I did very well in my responses, and, and the senators were satisfied, that my nomination was then held up for an additional two months that had absolutely nothing to do with Alexis Herman or the labor department.  It was an issue completely unrelated that a senator put a hold on my nomination, trying to get the attention of the president to strike a compromise on another deal.  And so I had to wait around for another two months while we were in negotiations on an issue completely unrelated to my confirmation process.
Speaker 1: And was--what did--you said at one point you weren't sure that the president was gonna back you.  Do you know why point that was?
Speaker 2: That was back in November, when we were still working on the nomination process.  And I think it was an issue at that point because there were other candidates and that were surfacing certainly, and as I said, Senator [Harris] Wofford certainly was a leading candidate.  I, I--it was clear to me that he had other political pressures.  And my goodness, I'd worked in that White House for four years.  I certainly understood that.
Story_ID: 85232
Speaker 1: Now when you--so you take the reins.  Do you keep the staff, or do you change the staff, or are you, you know, under pressure to make things happen?  'Cause I think two months after is the UPS [United Parcel Service]--
Speaker 2: Strike.  Well, it was a combination.  As I was learning the senior staff, I'd retained some of the staff that was there, but I also brought in my own team.  And over time, I'd say I had seventy percent my team and thirty percent that I retained.
Speaker 1: And so, talk about the, the UPS strike, you know, and how that was sort of the first thing to really test you, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Well, I'd been on the job for all of two months, really, May and June, and spending most of my time looking at the staff operations, the internal operations, and how to basically to staff up to get the priorities achieved that, that I wanted to focus on as labor secretary and, and what I thought supported the president's agenda.  And these discussions had been going on for a few weeks, and it had been a part of my briefing, you know, that there were issues with the UPS workers and teamsters  But everyone kept assuring me that the teamsters and UPS would settle; this was a union and a company that had a history, an 85-year history; there had never been a strike; and not to worry, that everyone was confident that they would settle.  And so I kept, you know, getting briefed during the course of my on-boarding, as I call it, but I kept getting these assurances.  So I shall never forget I had made a decision that July, to, to go to Chicago to have the unemployment report.  Every first Friday of the month the unemployment report comes out.  And I decided I didn't wanna always stay in Washington to announce the numbers, that I wanted to go out into the communities and talk about where the jobs were and what was going on with the economy.  And so I was in Chicago for the announcement of the unemployment report that July.  And this was also the deal breaker day, when I was told either they settle by midnight that night, or the talks would break down.  And now the staff is getting nervous, and people are starting to say well, we may not get an agreement.  I'm like, what do you mean we may not get an agreement?  I thought you said we were there.  And they said no, we're not sure; this may or may not happen, you know.  So, in the process of, of getting my own economic reports for the day, I spent most of that day getting briefed on what was really going on inside the negotiations.  And I was pretty clear that this was gonna be tough lifting after I heard what I heard that day.  So I was quite chagrin, because I felt that we were at a point of no return, and it was gonna be a miracle if we pulled this out that night.  And it wasn't the labor department that was involved, it was the, actually, the Federal Mediation Board that really handles labor disputes.  And, and the guy who was heading it up had really done a terrific job of trying to get the parties together, but I was not optimistic after that briefing.  And sure enough, the talks broke down that night, and then we were scrambling trying to get them back to the table.  But then there was no way that they would agree to come back to the table.  And to make a long story short, as I got into it, what struck me was the fact that the head of the union and the head of the company had never talked, and it had all been negotiations internally, as typically negotiations go.  But sometimes, you know, when things are at a level that they were, you have to have the principals.  And so I took it upon myself to reach out to both principals to find out if there was any daylight, because I kept being told there was absolutely no daylight on either side, and that there was no way that we could get them back.  So I took it upon myself to, to call both principals and to have a conversation to hear where they were.  And I decided, after listing to both of them, and I listened mainly, that there was an opportunity here to, to at least try and restart these negotiations.  I was being counseled on the one hand not to engage myself directly.  Because typically, historically, secretaries of labor do not settle strikes.  You leave that to your negotiating team.  And when you're ready to announce a settlement, when you're almost there, and you've got the workings of a deal, that's when you come in to kind of be the icing on the cake.  And so I was counseled that this would damage my reputation, to come in where there was just no deal in sight, really, and no opportunity to get the parties back together.  And so I was, quite frankly, ambivalent about what was the role I should play.  I felt that I needed to get the intelligence to find out if I thought there was an opportunity, but then the question of what role should I play was not clear to me at the moment.  So, I elected to, to try and give it back to the, the negotiating team with some guidance to try and get the parties back together.  And that worked only up until a point, and then we were back to the same, you know, log jam, with no progress.  And by now, you know, it's a huge media story.  I had no idea of the impact of the small package market on the economy, because everything was coming to a standstill, from florists who couldn't get their flowers delivered, to brides who couldn't get married, to huge catalog shipments.  It was just amazing the effect that this strike was having on the economy.
Story_ID: 85233
Speaker 1: So--and then, of course, the president was getting enormous pressure at the White House.  And so finally we talked, and I just said you know, even though I know this is unorthodox, I feel like I have to get hands-on and involved directly because I believe I have the confidence and the trust of both sides.  They are not willing to talk to one another yet, but they are willing to talk to me.  And if I'm able to shuttle between the two, perhaps I can find a way to get them back to the table.  And so that's what I did, and I did that for like two weeks.  And I had secret meetings in my home.  I had meetings away from the labor department, and no one even knew I was doing it.  The White House knew, but no one else knew.  And that was a part of winning the confidence, because I think, to the extent that I didn't talk about it, no one else knew what I was doing, and it didn't get into the media, I was able to win their trust and confidence, to, to give them some sense that perhaps we might be able to achieve some kind of a settlement.  And I'll never forget, because I had to take a trip with the president on Air Force One to brief him on the opportunity that I thought we had to restart the negotiations, and that we might be ready to make that announcement.  So I did that.  I joined him one day.  I can't remember where we were going now.  It was some trip in the Midwest, but I have pictures 'cause that, for me that was the beginning of restarting the negotiations, me briefing him at that moment on Air Force One.  And I did get a commitment from the teamsters and from UPS that they would come back to the table, but only with the condition that I was there.  And, and I had to find a way to get them not to leave again.  Because what had been happening, it was start, stop, start, stop, and either one party would walk out or the other party would work out, and you never could seal the deal.  So I had to think of an environment where they couldn't walk out if I was there, so we decided to hold the negotiations at the labor department.  That was the first decision, and they both agreed to come to the department for the negotiations.  But then I said you know, that's too high profile.  I have to have the labor department be ongoing, and if these things go into the middle of the night, I have no ability to, to sleep anybody at the labor department, and I didn't want anybody to leave.  That was the whole notion here.  So I said I'll tell you what, let's go to the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill; let's just set up camp there; and let's agree that we're gonna lock ourselves in until we get it done, and I'm prepared to lock up with you for however long it takes.  And that's what we did, so I had my staff handle all the logistics, all the arrangements.  We went to the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill, and I took my deputy secretary.  At the time, he wasn't my deputy secretary.  He was my chief economist, Ed Montgomery.  And we went to the Hyatt Regency, and I had teamsters on one wing, and UPS on another wing, and I was in the middle, and we had a whole negotiating floor downstairs.  And that's what we did.  We shot proposals, and we went back and forth, and we did shuttle diplomacy, and they met face to face until we hammered out a deal, and we finally got there.  It was like around midnight one night.  I just remember it was late.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.  So you had brought all that together.  Now, so you have this terrific success, you know, 'cause it could have gotten stalled then--
Speaker 1: Oh, no question, it was high risk.
Story_ID: 85234
Speaker 1: And then, then you, you know, are at this point, what do you wanna do?  What do you want your, your whole stamp to be on the department?
Speaker 2: I had four priorities that I had laid out.  Because one of the things that I knew from being in office before was that you can try to do too much in these jobs, and you get nothing done because there's always stuff coming at you.  And so what you want to get done, oftentimes may not get done because you're always reacting.  So I said if I do--I had four priorities.  If I get three of these done well, if I get one well done, I'll feel good about it.  First, the president was very clear to me that we'd had legislation stalled on Capitol Hill for five years to literally to redo the whole employment and training system.  And he wanted that legislation passed, and he wanted us to redo the whole employment and training system.  It was called the Workforce Investment Act, where we could have employers really in the middle of, of being a partner in the process.  He wanted that legislation passed.  Secondly, I asked for the leadership on Welfare to Work, because I had worked in the White House on the legislation itself.  But I thought this needed to have, if, if it was going to be successful, a serious work component to it.  If we were gonna be serious about making that transition, then it shouldn't be something that was still in the traditional AFDC [Aid to Families with Dependent Children] framework, but we need to find a way to give people real skills, real jobs with real employers at the table.  So that was the second priority.  Thirdly, the thing that had shocked me the most coming back to the department was when I left there, the African American employment rate was like at thirty-five percent.  I come back almost twenty years later, and it's still there, and now it's hovering even more.  So I really wanted to make a dent in youth employment, particularly at-risk youth.  I wanted to take that issue on, and try to do something significant to deal with the whole question of, of youth who are at risk.  And lastly, I wanted to take this whole issue of, of our, of our labor standards and try to see if we could have a breakthrough in how we were looking at this whole question of, of core labor standards, which was really getting in the way of all of our trade debates and our trade legislation, because increasingly we're a global economy.  And what does it mean to have some global standards, a common set of rules that we could work with in this global marketplace?  And so I decide that I wanted to take on just one core labor standard to see if we could forge a global consensus, child labor.  And, and get some global agreement on what was possible there to reduce the incidences of child labor, not just in the United States, but around world.  'Cause I was convinced that if you could find just one standard to get people in the habit of working on, then others could follow, safety standards, wage standards, all of the things that are so contentious, environmental standards, all of the things that are so contentious to talk about.  Let's just work on one together, and so I selected child labor.
Story_ID: 85235
Speaker 1: And were you happy with the progress you made?
Speaker 2: Very.  Obviously we got the legislation passed, and we were able to reform the job training system.   And it's still an effective piece of legislation today.  Secondly, we successfully passed Welfare to Work.  We got the authorization that we needed to have a work component, and we were able to significantly reduce the welfare rolls.  But you know, I kept saying this is not a five-year journey, this is not a four-year journey.  This is a ten-year journey, and we've got to have the commitment there for additional funds, additional resources.  And we've got to have a training component with work, so that to me it was just the beginning.  And if there's one regret that I have, it was not having more time in office to follow through on that commitment because it was just laying a market down.  And you always have to be so careful of not being punitive in this area because, you know, electoral politics love to make the welfare state, if you will, an issue.  Thirdly, in the whole area of youth unemployment, we made tremendous progress there, and we called it the Youth Opportunity Movement.  Not only were we able to cut in half the at-risk, the youth unemployment rate for African-American teens, we reduced it for minority teens overall.  And it was the lowest it had ever been in the history of the department, since we started keeping the statistics.  And we were able to wrap--really ratchet up for the first time a serious youth component, and putting a real focus on youth offenders, which were increasingly and are increasingly unfortunately, a large part of what's going on with young people today.  And lastly, we passed the first ever global standard on child labor.  It didn't get a lot of play 'cause it was at the end of the administration, but it took me four years to do that work.  It took me--and I literally had to meet with labor ministers from every corner of the globe, from the Asian continent, to the African continent, to the Caribbean nations, to the European community, to forge a consensus on a child labor standard.  And I had to get the support of Jesse Helms, as chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, to buy into it as a member of the ILO [International Labor Organization].  Because prior to this, Jesse Helms had never supported any standards, any amendments, any recommendations coming out of the International Labour Organization in Geneva [Switzerland].  And that was where we had done our work.
Story_ID: 85236
Speaker 1: And when it was time for that administration, when it was time for the administration, you know, to end, it was not--what are you thinking at that point?  You had been on this long, long path.  In the meantime, you'd gotten married.
Speaker 2: I got married.  The last thing I thought I'd ever do is Secretary of Labor (laughter).  I (unclear) think I'm--last thing I thought I'd do period probably at this stage of my life.
Speaker 1: Which is really amazing, 'cause I was thinking that ten years before that you were actually, you had, you had (unclear)--was 1989 with the election, and had been working with [HM] Ron Brown.  And I think it was February, and you got married in February, right, of--
Speaker 2: I got married in February of 2000.
Speaker 1: Two thousand [2000].
Speaker 2: I guess that's a critical month for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Watch out for February.
Speaker 1: So, what are you thinking at this point?  You know, it's been a long path, but a very, very wonderful sort of climb up.
Speaker 2: At the point of when I'm getting married or the point--
Speaker 1: At the point--
Speaker 2: --that I'm leaving office?
Speaker 1: At the point you're leaving office.
Speaker 2: At the point that I'm leaving office in November of 2001 [sic, 2000], I'd worked very hard with Al Gore.  I was obviously very disappointed in the outcome of the November elections.  But for me, when I got married in February of 2000, I was really struggling personally with what I was going to do next, because I wanted to get on with the personal life.  It had been not eight years for me, but twelve years, four years at the party, four years in the White House, four years as labor secretary.  And I wanted to enjoy more of a personal life.  I wanted to get to know my husband even better.  We had a, a, a stepson, a small child that we were raising.  But Al Gore was really saying to me, you know, if I win, Alexis, I want you on my team.  And so I--my loyalties were, were very divided, I must admit.  And Chuck [Charles Franklin], my husband, and I talked many nights about, what would I do if the president--if Al Gore was, was elected president?  And you know, I, I never really got to the point of a decision, quite honestly, because we did not win re-election, and I didn't have to make that decision.  So, I made the decision upon leaving office that I was going to go back into the private sector.  I had enjoyed being an entrepreneur in the 1980s.
Story_ID: 85487
Speaker 1: So, you said you were, you--can I just ask you, though, one--just real quickly, about your feeling about the election and the recount and all of that.  If you just could--even though you, you were sort of, in your personal space, sort of mixed, there was also this public thing that was happening, you know, with the election and the Supreme Court decision.  And I'm just wondering your, your take on that.
Speaker 2: I think once I realized the Supreme Court was going to take this case up, I believed that the election was doomed, because I thought it was, quite frankly, quite unusual that the Florida State Supreme Court, which typically in these sorts of cases would have assumed this jurisdiction, was not allowed to, to play out in that sense.  And the issue, once the Supreme Court decided to intervene, and the [George W.] Bush Administration appealed the Florida State Supreme Court--appealed the decision--I thought it was going to be very, very tough for the vote, quite frankly, to, to go in [Vice President] Al Gore's direction, because all that we ever really needed was time to count the vote.  And that was all we kept saying, we just need to count the vote.  And the Bush Administration was very skillful in controlling that message of saying we've counted, and we had recounts, and we counted, and the issue really was not about that.  It was really about the ability to count all of these votes and the abuses which have now, of course, has played out in the media that we were so aware of, of people who had been turned away, the irregularities at the poll.  There was just so much at play in Florida that we knew that if we could just have the time to, to have that play out, that we had a fighting chance.  So, I, I was not optimistic once the Supreme Court decided to take the case up.
Story_ID: 85488
Speaker 1: Had you, because you had been on this path, a very aggressive path for so long, and you know, and the election now is lost, are you like thinking you have to have another plan?  Are you thinking, you know, with your husband, we'll just sort of take, take time?  What are you--because it's hard when you're on a path, and you've always sort of--not known that you had competing, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I don't think you ever get immediately past the disappointment of, of an election loss, particularly the way this election was lost.  And it was a very sad day.  It still brings tears to my eyes when I, when I can see the president boarding that plane at [St.] Andrews [Air Force Base], and, and saying goodbye.  And you know, it was like it all ended, you know.  But we were proud of what we had done, and we'd had eight great years.  For me, I felt very blessed that I had been in the Carter Administration.  So I knew what it was like to lose an election and to have to get on with your life.  Most of my colleagues had not had that experience, and so many of them were in shock.  And we had a lot of young administration who grew up with [President] Bill Clinton.  They worked in his campaign; they worked four years; they worked another four years, so for many of them, this was their only job, was working for the federal government.  So in a funny kind of way, I didn't have time to give in to my own emotions.  I tell a lot of people, it has taken me really a full two years to transition from office, because I literally spent the first year not thinking a lot about me, and my plans, and what I was going to be doing next.  I, I got very caught up in coaching and counseling my staff, who still saw me as their secretary. What were they going to do?  They didn't have jobs.  I almost became an outplacement office de facto.  And because I'd been there, I guess I had more empathy, because I certainly felt that pain when I left office during the [President Jimmy] Carter years, when I didn't know how to get started and what to do next.  So, I made a decision to do a couple of things: to attach myself to a speaker's bureau so that I could have income; but also, I wanted to have flexibility to think about the next steps; and I wanted to, to be available, quite frankly, to many of the young people that I'd coached that had grown up in our administration.  And I was quickly finding that I couldn't concentrate on me and them at the same time.  So I honestly, with--I didn't plan it this way, but I gave myself a personal pass in 2001.
Story_ID: 85489
Speaker 1: And because of the opportunity that I was getting to speak out on the issues, to talk about the economy, to talk about the workforce of the future, and that was the area that I had specialized in, I, I found that I was able to sustain myself, speaking.  Secondly, I had had a few corporate board offers that I was also starting to weigh at that time.  And so between those two efforts and then trying to think about a long-term business venture, it really wasn't until 2002 that I started to get clear around Alexis Herman, and what was my plan for the future, and how did I want to approach it.  And it's only been, quite frankly, in 2003 that I feel as though I'm on the path now, that I am enjoying, that I wanna be on, that I have clarity about what I'm trying to get done, and how I want to do it.  So, in many ways, it's taken me a full two years.  And I think if there's something that in the future I wanna write more about and communicate more, it is this notion of transition and what it means to transition, particularly at this level, and how one has to prepare themself.  I had interesting conversations with people like [HM] Colin Powell, with [HM William T.] Bill Coleman, who were enormously helpful to me in just small pieces of advice--Donald McHenry--just coaching me on what it means to leave office, and how you have to give yourself, not load your plate up so completely immediately, and think it through.  And so, all the way from, not only what you're going to do, but how you're going to be staffed--you know, people think you're still the Labor Secretary.  You don't have all of the infrastructure; you don't have all of the support.  They think you're not working full time, so you get a lot of requests for nonprofit work.  And so, you have to weigh all of that.  But I'll never forget Colin gave me some advice when he said you know, you have to think of this sort of on a five-part plan.  And I said, what's that?  He said well, you think about your speeches and how you wanna do that; you think about your business opportunities and how you want to pursue whatever your business base is going to be; you have to think about your nonprofit relationships and, and what surface role you wanna play, how you wanna give back; he said fourthly, whether you like it or not, you're a political figure, so you have to decide what balance you want there in your life; and he said and lastly, and maybe I should have started here, it's a personal life.  You gotta have time for yourself and your family, and you've gotta put all of that together now.  And while it was a brief conversation, it really put in perspective for me how I had to think about my world and, and my future, my personal world.
Story_ID: 85490
Speaker 1: So where is Alexis Herman right now?  What are you wanting to do, and, and how are you looking to sort of form this next part of your life?  You're still very young.
Speaker 2: Well, right now I'm in a very good place.  I'm at peace with myself.  I have put, on purpose, a disproportionate time into my personal life, with a new husband, with a new son, and we've just moved into a new home.  And I had to make personal decisions about compromising, not so much compromising, but not saying yes to everything from a business standpoint of view, even pulling back on the political scene, because I made a personal decision leaving office that I was gonna give my personal family time.  And so I've done that, and I continue to do that.  Secondly, I didn't wanna jump right away into a set of business decisions.  I didn't wanna get on a lot of corporate boards without having the time to analyze what made sense there.  So I've taken my time to do that.  I'm now on a few boards that I enjoy the people.  I think they're great companies, and I'm enjoying the work.  Thirdly, I accepted a special assignment with the Coca-Cola Company to help them with their class action settlement, but more importantly, to help them really be the best company they can be when it comes to human resource practices in corporate America.  And I think that they're on a path now to be a real model and to be a real leader in this area.  And I'm trying to figure just what is it going to take for me to give back in the way that I wanna give back to the issues and the causes that I care about?  I'm still very active with a number of organizations, probably too many, and so I'm, I'm working very hard right now to try and find, particularly that balance, from a service standpoint of view.  And it's difficult for me to believe that, here we are, already in the midst of another presidential cycle and I'm having to weigh my involvement again from a political standpoint of view as to whether or not I'm going to be active with any campaign.  But when you have a small business enterprise to run, as I do, and you don't have a large staff, as I don't, you have to, you have to really be very judicious in terms of your time; you have to be very disciplined in terms of your time; and very clear on your priorities.  And so, I am now trying to get clear around exactly how much more I wanna add to my plate, cause I, I happen to be in a very good place right now, with what I have presently.
Story_ID: 85491
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: What do I want my legacy to be?  I think for me, you know, I've, I've never been asked that question.  And I don't think I've thought in terms of a legacy, because I, when I hear the word "legacy," I think about how people remember you and what they'll say you've done.  And I guess I, I, I'm always seeing myself still in the process of becoming; I still see myself in the process of, of making a difference in whatever I'm doing, and that I've made somebody else's life better by my work, that I've done something to improve the human condition by my work.  And so I don't step back in my head at this point to say, what's the legacy?  I step back in my head to ask myself, is it making a difference?  Is it worthwhile?  Is somebody else's life or some other condition better because I was involved, because I had that as my priority?  So I can't answer that question that way.
Speaker 1: But from Mobile [Alabama], to social worker, to head of the Department of Labor, to still having a long career ahead of themselves, that's a pretty fantastic story.  One thing, just one other thing, you touched upon where you want to, you know, what you wanna do with your life in one aspect, and that's really the refining of public servant, if I heard you right.  And my--because a lot of people don't know where to go afterwards, you know, when they're young and vibrant, and how--if I heard you right.
Speaker 2: Well, what I was saying, and, and I don't see this as a legacy answer as much as I see it as an experience answer, one of the things, and, and maybe it will be a part of, of my personal legacy one day, when I step back, I have oftentimes been the first.  My, most of my work has been pioneering work.  Most of my work has been breakthrough work, whether it was serving as the first African-American female in the White House to a president, or the first African American at the labor department, running a presidential transition, or helping those women way back in the 1970s to be the first African American to get into a Coca-Cola or a Delta Airlines.  So, for me, I think there are lessons in what it took to get there and to see it up close and personal.  And because I recognize that there are still far too few of us who have these kinds of opportunities, that we have a responsibility to pass it on in some way so that others can benefit from that knowledge, from that experience.  And so as I think about just the uniqueness of, of a transition and having gone through two presidential transitions now, I think there are words of wisdom to be shared in terms of what you do and how you plan it, how you think about it, and life goes on.  These jobs don't last forever, and you make the most of what you can do at that point in time, knowing you give it your all, but you always have to think about the next step as well.
