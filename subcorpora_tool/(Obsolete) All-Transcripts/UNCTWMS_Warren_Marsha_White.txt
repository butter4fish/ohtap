Liz Lundeen: This is August 27, 2012. This is Liz Lundeen with the Southern Oral History Program. We&#8217;re in the Love House and Hutchins Forum in Chapel Hill. I&#8217;m here with Marsha Warren and we&#8217;re going to talk today about her life and her activities here in this area. We&#8217;ll start out by just talking about where you grew up.  Marsha Warren: Sure.  LL: If you don&#8217;t mind sharing a bit about your family and where you grew up.  MW: Yeah. So I grew up in Ohio. I was born in a little town called Middletown, and at the age of four I moved to Dayton where my daddy then began working for the NCR, the National Cash Register, which is all over Dayton, Ohio.  LL: Yeah.  MW: And it was a big city. I have two older sisters. We lived in a little rented house for a little while and then mother and daddy got some money and we were able to buy a little house. We lived on a sidewalk with porches and just like, you know, a regular place where people sat on their porches and talked. No air conditioning and all that sort of thing. I thought later, many years later&#8212;my mother was a countrywoman. She had been raised in the country about fifty miles from the area in a place called Morrow, Ohio. She had been born in Kentucky, so she was really a Kentucky girl and had come up as a teenager to high school because her mother, my grandmother&#8212;who had seven children that she raised by herself&#8212;needed to leave Kentucky because she wanted her kids to have better schooling. And I thought many times how much I would love to have talked to my grandmother more about the time they all got on the train in Lee City, Kentucky, and put the children and the teenagers and the baby and the livestock and everything on that train to come up to Ohio.  LL: Wow.  MW: It just amazes me to have that picture. So there&#8217;s my mother. And then, in fact, when she got to Ohio, she had to be put back two years because the Kentucky schools were way behind the standards for that time. So mother, being a countrywoman&#8212; we went to my grandmother&#8217;s house every Sunday with all the cousins. And then we brought the live chicken home in the trunk of the car, you know.  LL: Wow [laughs].  MW: And then when they got to Dayton, the city, my mother had a little pen in the backyard where she would put the little chicken until it was time to wring its neck, that whole sort of drill. So there&#8217;s mother, Kentucky. And then my daddy, a very different sort of life. A little bit more silver spoon. Raised in West Virginia. So here I was from these two southern parents, sort of raised like a southern child in Dayton, Ohio. I think maybe when I came here [to North Carolina] in 1961 there was sort of a coming home in a way.  LL: Absolutely. Yeah.  MW: Although in 1961, I can say, too, that we were feeling, prejudice is not the right word, but certainly felt like the South was not what we were all about. It seemed very backward to us. And, of course, we were in Chapel Hill so you know, this is a heady place to be. But we first moved to Durham when David [Warren] went to law school at Duke and Durham was a little tobacco town. There were six tobacco companies going full steam in those days. So we had a little baby that we had brought across the country from San Francisco where he had been born in the Navy, and so there we were. I taught first grade at George Watts School and put my husband through law school.  LL: Wow.  MW: And had that little baby. And then for the first time in our lives having someone that you called a maid.  LL: Yeah, wow.  MW: That you hire for, and we paid more than most people. We paid twenty-two dollars a week. Other people were paying twenty. And she came at 7:30 and left at&#8212;.  LL: To keep the baby?  MW: Yeah to keep the baby in the house. After a couple of years we couldn&#8217;t really afford that, so we put that little boy, who is now fifty, almost, well I guess he&#8217;s now fifty-one, and put him in Greystone Baptist Church and it was only ten dollars and ninety eight cents a week! So we were saving some money. So that would be what was happening. A very important thing happened to me, though, during that period of time and this was the [19]60s. This was 1961 and we were there until 1964.  LL: In Durham?  MW: In Durham, and living in a little house. And they gave me the first two black children for my first grade and I wondered if they had done that because I was from the North and I would feel, you know, comfortable with them. They were very troubled; they had come from very poor backgrounds and my heart went out to them. Robin was the boy. There were six children and he was the oldest of six.  LL: Wow.  MW: And she was a single mom. And then the little girl, Constance, would have these terrible headaches; it was just, you know, it was such a pressure.  LL: Yeah.  MW: It was such a different environment. There were other poorer white children, too, in the class with no shoes and stuff like that. It was just a hard time. But then David was, in the summer times &#8211; and this is what brought us to Chapel Hill &#8211; David was in law school but he was working at the Institute of Government, which is now called the School of Government. Albert Coates had just left and John Sanders was the director and David was working there in the summer and it was during that time that we then marched and had marches in Chapel Hill. There was a silent march where you walk down Franklin Street and you point to the restaurants that were not serving blacks. It was just, you didn&#8217;t say anything; you just pointed to them. And there&#8217;s a picture that was made of us with our little two year old on David&#8217;s shoulders, which was nice to have. And then we all gathered on St. Joseph&#8217;s Church, which is on Rosemary Street &#8211; a kind of &#8220;we shall overcome&#8221; sort of thing.  Those were really hard times because there was a place down on the corner of Franklin and Estes. It was called the Rock Pile, and it was a building that was made of rocks, big rocks. And it was a little grocery store &#8211; he may have sold gas, I can&#8217;t remember. But there were kids who sat outside and students who sat outside and he poured something very caustic on them and it really hit the newspapers. It was an egregious act what he did.  LL: Wow.  MW: Like Clorox or something that he poured on these kids that were out there resisting because he didn&#8217;t let any blacks come into his little store. And that was called the Rock Pile and people around here would know that.  LL: So was it a group of black and white kids that were protesting?  MW: Those I think those might have been, and I can&#8217;t say for sure, but I&#8217;m under the impression that they were black kids, that they were black students or black people. I just don&#8217;t know, I can&#8217;t remember that. So anyway that&#8217;s what started us all off.  LL: Can we go back a little bit? I&#8217;m really curious as to what your reactions were when you were going to be having the first two black children in your classroom. I mean how did you act? How did you prepare for that? What kind of steps did you take?  MW: As well as I can remember, I was very happy about it because I wanted integration. I had been integrated as a child myself in Dayton, Ohio. In Ohio and in the North we also had kindergarten, and there was no kindergarten here. My youngest son, who is now forty-three, was the last age to not have public kindergarten to go to. So it was after that &#8211; he was born in [19]69 &#8211; so sometime later than that kindergartens were starting. But I was very happy about that. Now, at the same time that I went to integrated schools, there were several incidents that happened in Dayton, Ohio that were very meaningful to me. I was sort of a protected child, the youngest of three girls and sheltered and so when I was the president of Y-Teens in high school, this girl named Beverley was going to be the vice president, or something of that sort. She was going to be an officer also, and they sent us to Ohio University down in Athens, Ohio. I believe that&#8217;s where they sent us. My mother was going to drive us, maybe my mother and my daddy, and mother said, &#8220;I think, let&#8217;s take a picnic.&#8221; And I thought that was such a cool idea, having no idea why she said that, because I didn&#8217;t realize that that child might not have been able to go into a restaurant.  LL: So Beverley was black.   MW: Beverley was black. Uh-huh. And then the other incident that I remember real clearly was as a senior in high school being with my boyfriend who was a quarterback on the football team. Another guy on the team was black. His name was Ron and he had his black girlfriend. There were probably eight of us all together and we all went to a restaurant in Dayton with our formals on and our corsages. Then we sat there for a while and then the manager came up and said that we were very welcome to stay but that Ron and his girlfriend were going to have to leave. And that was so alarming! And we all got up of course and left. But those were two instances out of my own life that I brought with me.  LL: And what were your parents&#8217; attitudes toward &#8211; this would have been the [19]50s that you were in high school, right? The late 50s?  MW: Yes.  LL: So what were their attitudes?  MW: I graduated from high school in [19]56.  LL: Their racial politics? Did you talk about it at home?  MW: Well mother was a very gentle, kind person, always. She would never have had an ounce of that, of any animosity toward African Americans. And I don&#8217;t think I did ever understand about my daddy. He was a good man, too, except that there was something that happened after my mother died. She died when I was only 39 and so daddy lived beyond that. And so, I remember bringing daddy to a movie and why I chose it&#8212;well I know why I chose it. It was because it was about a boxer and daddy loved boxing. He loved to watch what he called the fights. And as a little girl I remember our next door neighbors, Mr. Houston&#8212;he was a single man&#8212;would come over to our house and watch the fights with daddy, and mother and I would go across to his house where his housekeeper, Ms. Ashworth, we would watch &#8220;This is Your Life,&#8221; and she would give us a glass of Pepsi or Sprite [laughter], like a miracle. So daddy liked the fights and so we went to The Great White Hope.   LL: Ahhh.  MW: I mean you talk about, you know, woah. So that was pretty startling. And it was James Earl Jones who played that amazing part of [Jack Johnson, called Jack Jefferson in the film]; he was sort of portraying [Jack Johnson], the boxer from Texas. And when he kissed the woman, I don&#8217;t know who it was. It might have been Pat Neal but I don&#8217;t remember who it was [the actress was Jane Alexander]. My dad was just outraged. Now maybe that was just beyond the pale, as it were. Maybe that was just the limit for daddy. They would not have agreed, of course, they would not have agreed to interracial marriage. I know that neither of them would have done that and I think a lot of people feel that way.  LL: But certainly you went to integrated schools and they did not.  MW: Yeah. Right.  LL: Wow so can you talk a little about the Y-Teens. Is this the YWCA teens?  MW: Yeah, and I can&#8217;t remember.  LL: Yeah, well certainly that conference was really influential for you.  MW: Yeah and imagine being able to go to a college campus and stay overnight in Stuyvesant Hall. It was amazing. It would have been leadership. I was a leader. I was always one of the officers of my junior and senior high school and that was my sort of capacity.  LL: And so you then went to college I presume.  MW: Mm-hmm and so I went to, at still seventeen, I went to Miami University which is about fifty miles from where I lived in Dayton.  LL: Oxford? Is that where it is?  MW: Mm-hmm in Oxford, Ohio, thirty-five miles from Cincinnati. A little town, just a tiny little town with countryside all around it sort of like, what&#8217;s the one, Dartmouth. It&#8217;d be like that where it&#8217;s just countryside all around. And I met my husband the first week of school.  LL: Wow.  MW: Yeah, we dated off and on and then we&#8217;ve been married for fifty-two years. He&#8217;s two years older than I. So that was, yeah. I studied elementary education. I had gotten a scholarship because my family had a very modest income, so in order for me to go to school I had gotten what&#8217;s called a cadet scholarship. They needed teachers very badly in Ohio at that time, and if you went for two years to school, then they would pay for that. But then you had to promise that you would teach for two years. Well I got to school and fell in love with the whole idea. Plus, I&#8217;d met Dave you know. I transferred to a regular program and I had to completely work for my room and board in the dining room to pay for it.  LL: Right, right.  MW: So that was good and it was a very, just an aside, but it was a very interesting way to have an education because in that transfer I was taking classes at night sometimes and teachers who were actually practicing out in the field were coming in to complete their degrees. So I was actually in classes with people who were in the classroom which was just really valuable.  LL: Yeah. Did you have any other experiences that, you know, would foreshadow your involvement with the civil rights movement when you got to Chapel Hill? Maybe when you were in college?  MW: Well we were southern Baptists, so we were in the North and we went to church a lot. And we did a lot of things at church. We were very aware of other people, other people&#8217;s needs. Mother was just one of these people that just helped people all the time, you know.  LL: Right, right.  MW: So you just kind of pick that up.  But I realized about in junior high school that I wasn&#8217;t a Baptist at all [laughs]. So I had to make this great announcement to my parents that I was going to become an Episcopalian for heaven&#8217;s sake.  LL: Wow.  MW: Yeah, oh my gosh [laughter]. That&#8217;s like being a Catholic or something. Really scary. But I pursued that, and continued that into college and was confirmed in the Episcopal Church. And this church here in Chapel Hill, first we started at the Church of the Holy Family and then at Chapel of the Cross. Very very, conscious of the community in all ways. My husband &#8211; the Meals on Wheels started at our church and the Hospice started at our church and my husband actually did the 501(c)(3) tax identification status for those two organizations and then of course they moved beyond our church. But it was those people in Chapel of the Cross that spearheaded so many social programs, you know?  LL: Yeah. So in [19]61 is when you participated in this silent march, is that right?  MW: No it probably would have been &#8217;62 or &#8217;63. Yeah.  LL: Can you tell me a little bit about how you got involved with that? Were there organizations or people you know sort of informally?  MW: So you heard a buzz. You heard a buzz around town didn&#8217;t you? You knew that, of course, it would have been in the papers. And there was talk about, and of course, it was already, we were already supposed to have moved to integrated schools. But it hadn&#8217;t come down the pike; it hadn&#8217;t caught on. And it took until, finally I guess till [19]65 when Johnson finally, or I&#8217;m going to lose the history of it.  LL: It&#8217;s all right. [laughs].  MW: Yeah. But when it--.  LL: Yeah the Civil Rights Act in &#8217;64.  MW: Yeah when it [the federal government] finally said, &#8220;Okay, this is the way it will be.&#8221; So I know that the person who took the picture was from Hawaii and of Japanese descent. He was the photographer at the Institute of Government, Charlie Nakamura. And so, he would have been going along. It makes me wonder if David had found out about it through the Institute of Government? Was it something that the people at the Institute were interested in? And we were living in Durham so, you know, we weren&#8217;t Chapel Hill people but we came over here. And it was such a small place in those days. In fact&#8212;I have to tell you this because you won&#8217;t believe it&#8212;in those days, there was a traffic light in Pittsboro. And the next traffic right was at the bottom of the boulevard at University Drive in Durham.  LL: Wow [laughter]. So you&#8217;d just drive all that way.  MW: I mean just imagine: it was just, all that way. All the way from Pittsboro to University Drive. We used to call it the Dairy Bar. There was a Dairy Bar there. But it was just a two-lane road; it was just a much smaller place. Now I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m saying that but that&#8217;s just, when I try to envision what it was like in those days I just, that&#8217;s the way it felt, you know. Now there were blacks and whites in that march and in Chapel Hill you could do things like that. What it would have been like in other places&#8212;as a matter of fact, what stunned us after we had read and met Tim Tyson and read Blood Done Sign My Name, and we said, &#8220;What were we doing? Where were we when all of this was going on?&#8221; You know over in Oxford. And that whole sort of situation, that was just contained to Oxford? Of course it involved Raleigh, too, and but then we were raising our kids and by the time you got three kids you&#8217;re sort of into trying to manage, you just couldn&#8217;t do everything.  LL: Yeah, absolutely. But you marched.  MW: Marched, yeah.  LL: I saw that picture actually in the write up for your Caldwell Award.  MW: Yeah.  LL: It was very, very striking.  MW: And that kind of life stream has fit right into my life. Either I have fit it in, or it has fit itself in because in 1987, I started running the North Carolina Writers&#8217; Network. And, as I said in my Caldwell talk, I briefly said something about the fact that it was right there on the grants. I was having to write grant proposals for funds to fund the programs that we were running and it was right there. The state was such a great leader and the arts council was such a great leader, saying, &#8220;What, well, tell me who was there. How many blacks? How many whites? How many young? How many old?&#8221;  LL: Wow.  MW: &#8220;How many women?&#8221; All the different sorts and you were really judged on that. You have a staff&#8212;I started out just on my own but then I&#8217;m hiring. And then, &#8220;You&#8217;re hiring? Oh yes you&#8217;re going to hire. How many blacks are on your staff?&#8221; So then you&#8217;re so conscious of it that you just really pay attention to it and you know how important it is. So we discovered that we had eleven black writers on our database and you&#8217;re going, &#8220;Wait a minute, this is not possible in this big state.&#8221; So we got some money from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation and started a program called the black writers identification program.  LL: Yeah.  MW: The acronym was BWIP, which we loved saying. BWIP [laughter]. And they gave us $7,000, which is an enormous amount of money and we brought in David [Bradley]&#8212; the writer who did The Chaneysville [Incident]?  LL: Um.  MW: You&#8217;ll think of it in a minute. Anyway he was in town and he was our &#8211;  So we had a competition and we said if this is for African Americans &#8211; now we weren&#8217;t talking about Hispanics, we were just talking about African Americans &#8211; and we said, &#8220;Send us your stories, your poems, your whatever.&#8221; And then five were selected. Then we met Jaki Shelton Greene and Rudy Wallace and all these other important people. They were tied with David [Bradley], and they went around the state to five different locations with a well known writer &#8211; he teaches at Temple and [was] then this emerging writer. Black and black; it was really a lovely program. We ended up with 350 people in our database.  LL: Yeah.  MW: We later did it with Native Americans. ZSR funded it again.   LL: Wow.  MW: Of course, some of them were &#8211; a woman who had it in her apron pocket or something. But it was a lot of different people and we really determined that this was very important.  LL: What about once you identified them? Was there a program where they would come together? Or did you publish sort of, &#8220;Look there are all these writers who are African American in this state?&#8221;  MW: Published them and we had programs on the radio. And we had a big to-do. By that time I was out at the White Cross School. It had been in my house for eighteen months. And then I got a grant from what was called Burroughs Wellcome at that time, and Burroughs Wellcome then gave us $5000 which gave me the money to pay the rent to get into White Cross School, which is a building out on [Highway] 54, and also to buy a printer, or a copier, excuse me. So we had that money to, gosh imagine paying that much money for a copier [laughter].  LL: They&#8217;re amazing.  MW: You know, they&#8217;re so cheap!  LL: They sit on your desk.  MW: They sit on your desk. This one took over my whole dining room table and I could remember Tom Lambeth and Valeria Lee (from the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation) &#8211; because we&#8217;d written this grant, this proposal for funds for one of the programs in the area and &#8211; they come in my house; they did site visits wherever you were. And we&#8217;ve laughed about that since [laughter]. So anyway that worked out so we moved out there. And, to answer your question, had a great f&#234;te, so then you see this, these pictures of this gathering of black and white together. And then the thing that really turned it around, which was right on the heels of that, we had a conference every year, and in 1989, we had a conference in Charlotte, and we had Alex Haley.  LL: Wow.  MW: We had Rita Dove. We had Li-Young Li who is a fine Asian poet from the Chicago area, and maybe there were some others as well because one of my board members, um, I&#8217;ll think of her name in a minute [Kirsten Mullen], had said to me &#8211; a black board member said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to show what you&#8217;re presenting. Your brochures, your programs have got to indicate that. If I&#8217;m a black person that sees that program, then I&#8217;ll know that&#8217;s who I am, that I&#8217;m invited.&#8221; That sort of thing. And it was amazing what we had there. It was just lovely, a lovely gathering.  LL: Yeah.  MW: And we worked with the African American Cultural Center down there and Charleon Maria Macon and other people and pulled the Charlotte people together and it was just a wonderful time. And it really just turned the corner to black-white stuff. In 1991, I was still at White Cross School of course. And so I had been there since 1987, I had been the director, and in 1991, I was asked to be the director of the Paul Green Foundation. And it was a resources sharing sort of thing. I called the Paul Green Foundation, my little hat with the Writers&#8217; Network and my big hat with this sort of thing because the jobs were very different in the amount of work and so forth. But I discovered there were no African Americans on the board of the Paul Green Foundation.  LL: Wow.  MW: Isn&#8217;t that amazing?  LL: Wow in [19]91.   MW: Not because anybody had been neglected. No one had thought about it.  LL: Yeah.  MW: I mean Paul Green, of all people! [laughter] So I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this job unless we change this.&#8221; So we of course immediately changed it and we have continued to, you know, have an African-American presence. You may know Reg Hildebrand.   LL: I do, yeah!  MW: Yeah Reg is nominating chair on the board. So there have been, and then to segue, thinking of Reg. In 2001, Paul Green, Paul M. Green, the grandson, who is a capital case lawyer in Durham, who works with people who are on death row. Because one of our main goals is to abolish the death penalty which we are moving towards happily. But he had been in Barbados at a conference and saw an amazing statue of a black man, huge, with his arms stretched up to the sky and the chains falling off his arms, you know. Emancipation. And it had been erected in 1960 by Queen Victoria for the 100th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the United Kingdom which came before ours. And he came back and he said, &#8220;What are we doing in North Carolina? What are we doing in the country?&#8221; He&#8217;s such a scholar. Of course he did this whole big thing and figured it out there was very little. And so we brought it to the Paul Green Foundation and the foundation took that on as what is called the North Carolina Freedom Monument Project. We have since spun off as a separate 501(c)(3). But I think it&#8217;s the most important project that we&#8217;ve started. And this is to build a major piece of public art in downtown Raleigh on the corners of Lane and Wilmington which honors the African-American experience.  LL: So the state capitol&#8212;.  MW: Right across the street.  LL: Right across the street.  MW: Right across the street from the legislative building. Right behind Archives in History.  LL: Yeah, okay, yeah.  MW: And our chairman of our advisory board was Dr. John Hope Franklin.  LL: Wow.  MW: Who, when he was doing some research as a student at Harvard came down to North Carolina&#8212;he&#8217;s from Tulsa, Oklahoma&#8212;and tried to go into that state library, the Archives of History library, would not be served. But the guy who was in charge of it kind of took a liking to this young gangly bespectacled guy and said, &#8220;I can tell you what I can do. Nobody&#8217;s gonna get books for you. But I&#8217;ll tell you what you can do: you can get your own books. I&#8217;ll give you a carrel in the stacks.&#8221; So he did. And you should hear Dr. Franklin talk about that; it was so cute. He says, &#8220;I&#8217;d load up that little cart and I&#8217;d have these books piled up,&#8221; you know. And of course other students said, &#8220;I want a carrel too.&#8221;  So it was really fun. But the idea that we&#8217;re doing this major monument behind the very building where Dr. Franklin&#8212;  LL: Where he&#8217;d risen up.  MW: Yeah.  LL: Yeah.  MW: So that&#8217;s cool.  LL: So where is the project?  MW: [Sigh] Well it&#8217;s struggled because the economy tanked, but we&#8217;ve received $200,000 from the state. We&#8217;ve received other funds. We had early support by the arts council, ZSR, humanities council, and individuals and so forth. We now have a pretty heady capital campaign committee. One of our top sort of honorary chairmen is Branford Marsalis. So we&#8217;re really moving along now and when we get this Democratic Convention over, it&#8217;s going to be a little bit better [laughter]. We&#8217;ve stalled on many accounts. We&#8217;re trying to get Obama elected, and then everyone is working on that, both financially as well as emotionally and energetically.  LL: Absolutely.  MW: And then the economy went south and then just sort of, and now we&#8217;re back at it again. But we have no doubts that we&#8217;ll achieve this. It&#8217;s a park; it&#8217;s an art park. You&#8217;ll have to google NCFMP. And that honors the African American experience. We had an international search. The arts council helped us with that RFQ [Request for Quotation]. We had 108 applications from all over the world.  LL: Wow.  MW: And the team from Carrboro and Chapel Hill won. One here at Carolina is Juan Logan who&#8217;s the sculptor and professor in the Art Department. And David Swanson is our token white guy. He&#8217;s a landscape architect in Carrboro. And then a PhD, lovely woman, by the name of Lyneise Williams who is an art historian, she&#8217;s our wordsmith who helps us with &#8211;  LL: Wonderful.  MW: So it&#8217;s really a wonderful project.  LL: It sounds really exciting!  MW: Yeah and you see it&#8217;s all about the children, because that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about. It&#8217;s about the 400,000 school children that come from all around the state to Raleigh to study North Carolina history. What do they see? They see white supremacist governors and confederate soldiers, which are part of our history and they&#8217;re important. They&#8217;re part of the history but we need to balance that. Level that playing field.  LL: Can I flashback for a minute, and I just wanted to ask for a minute, obviously the civil rights movement &#8211; what came before and what came after &#8211; have been important parts for you. Were you part of the women&#8217;s movement at all? Did that resonate with you? Obviously the ERA battle in North Carolina is really huge but I&#8217;m just thinking you were here in the [19]60s and 70s and I don&#8217;t know if you have any reflections on that.  MW: Mm-hmm. I am not what you would call a feminist. But at the same time I am a feminist. I was fortunate that my husband has given me full rein to do whatever I want to do and to be my own person and to do my own thing. We have a very democratic household. So I definitely am a strong believer in women&#8217;s rights. As far as being a part of the ERA at that time, I wasn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t burn my bra. I followed it all, of course. But in 1986&#8212;well, okay the writer&#8217;s network started in 1985. And it was in downtown Durham and they hired a poet and they said to Robert Long &#8211; because we had never had a statewide organization for writers before, we only had only the poetry society, they said &#8211; &#8220;Well you can work for thirty hours a week and then you can write for ten hours,&#8221; and of course it was a sixty hour, eighty hour week job, so he lasted one year. They did the same thing the next year with the playwright and the same thing happened. And then they decided they needed to hire someone who could raise funds and that&#8217;s when it came to my house. That year just before I took it on, there was a women&#8217;s conference that was held in Asheville, and Margaret Baddour out in Goldsboro headed that up, and it was the first sort of really big deal. It was 1986. All these women, hardly any men came, but it was a real enlivening time. And then move forward to 1992, that&#8217;s when Emily [Herring Wilson] and I really took on the world from my seat at the writers&#8217; network and her seat being a professor at Salem College. We just took a hold of this thing and decided that we were going to have a women writer&#8217;s conference. People are still talking about that; we can&#8217;t get over it. We were expected to have 300 and we had 1,200 it was just amazing.  LL: Wow!  MW: We had to keep upping everything: upping the meals, upping the everything. And we had all these lovely speakers and Doris Betts was our chairman and it was a wonderful time. And this artist did pictures of, portraits of, all these women writers. Most of them were made in my living room because I had a good light in my living room and so we sort of rolled the rug back and this woman whose name escapes me from Winston-Salem who did this art came and did the portraits of each of these women. And then it hangs somewhere over in the Triad area I think that&#8217;s enormous because you&#8217;ve taken maybe twenty-four pictures this big and then put them together.  LL: Wow.  MW: It was quite magnificent. And then we made posters of it, which were really cool.  LL: Yeah. Can you say something a little bit about the planning for this event? What motivated you and Emily to team together on this project?  MW: Well this is an Emily sort of thing isn&#8217;t it? Emily is really a wonderful feminist, a wonderful person who is always going to be looking to the women who have succeeded. And the books that she has written; she&#8217;s such an intellectual. So we were an amazing team because she&#8217;s very very smart and I&#8217;m very very organized [laughter]. We were just a great team and we used my database at the writers&#8217; network and all the things that I could do and the grant writing that could come through the writers&#8217; network and then being able to partner with everyone. We just pulled in people from everywhere.  LL: Yeah.  MW: And I need to give you one of those posters, because you&#8217;ll see the black women, you&#8217;ll see the white women, you&#8217;ll see the Native American women. We have Laura Hughes, a Cherokee. We have Barbara Braveboy-Locklear, a Lumbee, you know. It&#8217;s just wonderful. It just tells you when you see that: these women are together. This is North Carolina. Black, white, Native American. Now still again, we&#8217;re still not at the Hispanic thing at that time. I don&#8217;t know what the Hispanic sort of thing means when I say that but in 1992 that was not an issue, which is interesting isn&#8217;t it?  LL: Yeah, absolutely.  MW: Because it certainly is an issue now and one that is being addressed in many ways. So we just put our resources together. And we&#8217;re big believers in enabling others to succeed; that was always the idea of the writers&#8217; network. It was about empowering you to have, by providing some technology, and then your organization can &#8211;. As a matter of fact it&#8217;s kind of interesting because you go from 1985 when the writers&#8217; network started as a physical thing with one staff member. I had as many as eight staff then at White Cross School. It was a veritable literary [pause], what would you call it? [A literary wasteland.] There wasn&#8217;t much going on all over the state. I&#8217;m not getting the right word I&#8217;m looking for. There were not the readings. There were not the conferences. We had one MFA program.   It was just&#8212;. Now one thing we did have in those days were independent bookstores, which we&#8217;ve supported heavily and now there are a few of them. But we then, through the years, then, you see what&#8217;s happening is that we closed White Cross School and now it&#8217;s kind of like virtual. [The Network isn&#8217;t at White Cross School anymore.] So it&#8217;s like now everybody&#8217;s got their umbrella! Their own umbrella [laughter]! Their own, you know. We&#8217;ve got MFA programs everywhere. We&#8217;ve got [so many] readings you can&#8217;t even do &#8216;em all. So in that we have succeeded. It&#8217;s being run now without a physical location. It&#8217;s back in the director&#8217;s house in Winston-Salem. And being done online, of course, which is what so much stuff is now. But it&#8217;s a neat story because it sort of did exactly what it was supposed to do and then just sort of moved on to a kind of place where it can continue to serve, but not in the same ways.  LL: Do you think that prior to that conference or sort of, was it difficult for women writers to get as many publishing contracts as men? Did women writers struggle particularly you think? Was that one of the motivations that are about sort of having this conference to sort of highlight that women writers have really been an important part of this thing?  MW: Mm-hmm, and I don&#8217;t know the answer to that. We certainly know historically.  LL: Yeah.  MW: We know people who have used pseudonyms to be able to &#8211; George Eliot is a perfect example; Mary Ann Evans, or Mary Jane Evans or whatever it is. To be able to be published. But I can&#8217;t answer that directly because we also know that the Algonquin press, you know, came along about that time and were doing some wonderful work with Kaye Gibbons and other people. So I have not personally experienced that or sort of had that made known to me. I think that&#8217;s from a different time.  LL: Right, but it was certainly an empowering event regardless.  MW: Right.  LL: For everybody there.  MW: All of them. The gathering, and then to be able to separate yourself off as women is also very important. I was heartened to hear that they&#8217;re starting a girl&#8217;s school, the girl&#8217;s academy, to be a public school. And they&#8217;re going to try to do a male one, too, in Raleigh. I love that idea. It amazes me that they&#8217;re allowing such a thing. Of course Peace College has just opened up to men. But I think the opportune women love to be together and there&#8217;s something different about it. And then when you can run it yourself, as we did with no males to help you. We&#8217;re going to be running it all one of these days soon [laughter].  LL: Well is there anything else you want to say about your work as it is today at the Paul Green Foundation?  MW: Hmm.  LL: You talked about the monument, which I think is just wonderful.  MW: Yeah, yeah. Um [pause] well this work is phenomenal and we just had our Paul Green conference. Festival, actually, Paul Green festival in Hartnett County where we were really able to explore his work. You see he was the person&#8212;I mean I&#8217;m really in the right place, the right job because I feel so strongly about it&#8212;he&#8217;s the person who gave a dignified voice to the African American, then black, then Negro actor. He brought dignity to the roles. Real lives to his Pulitzer Prize piece In Abraham&#8217;s Bosom. This was a real man who had real aspirations for education and it wasn&#8217;t a shuffling kind of a, you know, black man who was a servant or something. This was a real &#8211;. He was, he was heading, you know, on all of that. And so much of his work is like that.   His story In Abraham&#8217;s Bosom was triggered in him and written as a result of him, about a ten-year-old child, being at a railroad station, seeing the train pull in. And a black teacher had gotten out, he had a white shirt on was dressed up real nice, with glasses, and the train had stopped and it had some trouble. And he had his students with him and they were going to go from someplace to someplace. Maybe they were going to go from Hartnett County to Raleigh, something of that sort, for some event. And the conductor, the engineer was underneath the train trying to fix it. And the black teacher came up and said to him, &#8220;Captain, do you know when we might get going?&#8221; or something of that sort. And the white man was so furious that he was underneath that train and that a black man, for heaven&#8217;s sake, in a white shirt had to ask him because he felt so demeaned. He grabbed a cudgel. There were civil war veterans standing around Paul describes, and he grabbed the cudgel, which was something if you had a peg leg or something you&#8217;d use, and he whacked this teacher on his face and he bled. And then Paul tells us that the man said, &#8220;Captain, you done ruined my shirt,&#8221; or something like that. And Paul was just, the idea, that juxtaposition. That black man who is trying to make a better life, and that&#8217;s what made him [write on Abraham&#8217;s Bosom].  But he&#8217;s a great person to work for. I never met him. And it was so interesting to get to know him in the [19]20s and 30s when then chain gang was still evident. He had heard a story from Charlotte that he was very disturbed about. That the keepers, the guards, had tied up several men outside while they went in and had coffee and it was bitter, bitter cold and the men had lost their fingers and toes and stuff like that. Paul was furious! He was furious. Of course he and Jonathan Daniels were always going to Raleigh and pounding their fists on the table trying to change things and the legislature wasn&#8217;t listening and he wrote Hymn to the Rising Sun and copied it and sent it to each of the legislators and that was the beginning of the end of the chain gang. So where you take a person like this whose artistic ability is never even a nanosecond away from his social work is just fascinating.  LL: Yeah, absolutely.  MW: Yeah, so anyway, it&#8217;s a good place to work.  LL: Absolutely. Do you have anything else that you&#8217;d like to add?  MW: No, is there anything I didn&#8217;t answer?  LL: No, I think it&#8217;s great. I mean, one of my questions was going to be how do you see because you&#8217;ve done a lot of work with empowering writers through the years and your sort of social justice beliefs and how those things melded. But I think through Paul Green&#8217;s story, you know, I can see it.  MW: Yeah and I can continue the work. Yeah. Mm-hmm.  LL: Yeah.  MW: Yeah! It&#8217;s good.  LL: Thank you so much!  MW: You&#8217;re welcome, you&#8217;re welcome and I&#8217;m so sorry about being late today. But anyway it wasn&#8217;t too far.  LL: Let&#8217;s turn this off. No not at all.
