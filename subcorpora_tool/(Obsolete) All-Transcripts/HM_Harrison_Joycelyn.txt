Speaker 1: All right, before we go into depth, there five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, not really, probably "All that glitters is not gold".  That's one I adapted from my husband (laughter).  He always says that, and it's true.
Story_ID: 22870
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but separately so we don't get 'em mixed up.  And then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, her name is Viola McKenzie Simpson.  So Viola is V-I-O-L-A, McKenzie, capital M-C-capital K-E-N-Z-I-E, and Simpson, S-I-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is March 6, 1936.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in a little town called Byromville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Is that B-Y-R-O-N--
Speaker 2: B-R-Y-O-M-V-I-L-L-E, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace that side and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Okay, so my mother's family were, they owned land in Georgia back in the '30's [1930s].  She had, her father had, I think six or seven brothers.  And so several of those brothers banded together, and they bought land.  They bought a lot of land, and they farmed that land.  It was primarily, they farmed cotton.  And so my mother grew up picking cotton from a very early age.  She, but--so I know my grandparents on that side of the family, my grandfather and then my step-grandmother.  My mother's mother, Gatrice (ph.), died when my mother was early teen, I think about maybe twelve or thirteen years old.  She died, after having ten kids.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Gatrice.  Gatrice Calloway--
Speaker 1: How do--
Speaker 2: --McKenzie.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Gatrice is G-A-T-R-I-C-E.  And so, and my father--my grandfather's name is, her husband, is Emmitt McKenzie, E-M-M-I-T-T, I think.  Yes, two m's, two t's.  And so they were married, and they had ten children.  And I think seven girls and three boys or four boys and six girls.  I take that back.  And, but as I mentioned, my grandmother died.  I believe she had cancer back, back then, back in the '40's [1940s].  And she died when my mother was still fairly young.  And then my grandfather remarried to a lady by the name of Freddie Mae McKenzie, who was the grandmother that I grew up knowing.
Speaker 1: That's F-R-E-D-D-
Speaker 2: F-R-E-D-D-I-E, and then capital M-A-E, Freddie Mae--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: McKenzie.  Now, in terms of my great grandparents, of course, I never knew them on that side of the family.  I only have heard stories of my grandfather's mother.  And I only heard her called grandma.  I don't remember her name because my mother and her sisters always referred to her as just "grandma" because their grandmother lived with them after their mother died.  Their grandmother lived with them and helped my grandfather raise the kids until he was remarried to Freddie Mae.  So I've heard stories about her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in terms of our lineage, I have not documented this myself, but I was, I've been told that our family name came, McKenzie, came from the family that is now the owners of McKenzie Frozen Foods.  They, they were apparently the slave owners that owned that side of my family, my mother's side of the family.  And that's where they got their, their name.  One of my mother's cousins on her dad's side of the family did some genealogy and found that.  That McKenzie family, I think is--with the frozen foods, is based in Vienna, Georgia or somewhere close to Vienna, Georgia.  And that's where our roots come from.  But we don't have any, you know, official documentation of that, that I know of.  My cousin did some research.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so McKenzie Frozen Foods is well known in Georgia, I guess.
Speaker 2: It is, it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where is Byromville in relationship to say Atlanta [Georgia] or--
Speaker 2: It's about two hours South of Atlanta.  I guess the closest that some, a bigger city you might have heard of is Cordell, Georgia.  And I guess another close city might be Plains, Georgia where President Jimmy Carter is from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Two hours South of Atlanta, okay.  All right, now, you say there were stories about your grandma, though you don't remember her name.  But what are some of the stories that they told about her?
Speaker 2: Well, they're not, they're not really flattering stories (laughter).  She was kind of, I think she had dementia early on, and so my mother and my aunts would refer to stories of grandma doing kind of bizarre things because of her dementia.  And so, they kind of, you know, would tell funny stories about that.  But she was, she was very loving to them and helped a lot with their upbringing, but she was also a little off (laughter)--I don't know, for lack of a better way of putting it.
Story_ID: 22871
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your mother [Viola McKenzie] say about growing up?  Did she grow up in Byromville [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she grew up in Byromville, all of her early life.  I think she left maybe around twenty, nineteen or twenty, after she finished high school.  The stories I hear of them growing up are related to the fact that when they were young, early on they were, they picked cotton.  They all were fortunate enough to go to school.  And, but they talked about walking to school, many miles back and forth.  So those stories about, you know, walking, you know, I walked ten miles each way to school apparently were true for my mother and her siblings.  They talked about having a farm and raising, you know, animals.  And my daughters were amazed when my mother told them the story about going out and getting a chicken and plucking it and, you know, preparing it for dinner.  And it's just an odd, odd thing for kids today and for me, as a matter of fact.  But my mom did that routinely and milked cows and things of that nature.  So she grew up in a farm environment.  But in that environment, I think they were very fortunate because they owned their own land, and they were able to, you know, they could afford to go to school.  And they did fairly well.  They did very well for themselves, considering.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother go on to college?
Speaker 2: No, my mother did not go to college.  My mom, I think when she graduated from high school, she worked at the high school bakery, I mean the high school cafeteria where she was like a baker.  And, but what I found is that most of my aunts and uncles, my mom's siblings, their way up and out was through moving further North.  So my mom probably around nineteen or twenty, she moved to Chattanooga [Tennessee] to live with one of her mother's--one of her father's brothers, Uncle Sam.  And she went to cosmetology school.  And so my mother, you know, went to cosmetology school and became a licensed beautician.  And she owned her own beauty salon.  To this day, she owns her own beauty salon.  She still actually works in that salon and she's what, seventy-six now, and she still does a great job.
Story_ID: 22872
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, let me go to your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, his name is Charles Nathaniel Simpson.  That's C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Nathaniel is N-A-T-H-A-N-I-E-L, and Simpson, S-I-M-P-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is May 15, 1929.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: My dad was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about your dad's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Okay, a lot of them were based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which is where I grew up.  So I, I had the privilege of, of knowing my grandmother, my paternal grandmother very well, although she did die when I was in the third grade.  I think I was around nine when she died at an early age of fifty-nine.  Her name was Reba Simpson, R-E-B-A, Simpson.  Her maiden name is Henderson, Reba Henderson Simpson.  I did not know my paternal grandfather.  He was deceased before I could have a memory of him.  But I knew my paternal grandmother and great grandparents.  My great grandmother, her name was Maude Hender--Maude Stanley, yeah, Maude Stanley, a lovely lady.  I have fond memories of her.  And also my great grandfather, whose name is Walter Henderson.  But we called him Papa.  He was just called "Papa" to us, and he lived in this little town called Chickamauga, Georgia.  And so I remember very clearly on Sundays, very often we would, after church, we'd go to Chickamauga, which was maybe half an hour, forty-five minutes from Chattanooga [Tennessee].  And we would go to see Papa.  And Papa's, Papa had an outhouse.  So that's one of the memories that stood out with me because I never had to use an outhouse, but I really remember the horror (laughter) of going to Papa's outhouse when we went there.  So that was a memorable experience.  And he was, he was a very nice old gentleman who was, you know, he was, he was old all, every since I've known him.  And he probably died when I was, I don't know, ten or so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Chickamauga, that's the site of the Civil War battle.
Speaker 2: Civil War battlefield, yeah.
Speaker 1: Battle of Chickamauga [1863].
Speaker 2: Absolutely, in Chickamauga, Georgia, absolutely, yeah.  And he lived in that house that I think he built himself for all of his life until he died.  And he was a pretty old fellow.  And he married a lady by the name of Ms. Viola, who was his second wife.  My, my, my great grandmother, Maude, was his first wife.  And they had several kids.  But then he also later married Ms. Viola, which was interesting because she was the same name as my mother, and Viola is kind of an odd name.  But she was very sweet, very nice lady.  So I have fond memories of her, just kind of taking us under her wing and talking to us.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories on that side of the family from your great grandfather or anybody that's, that are passed down about the end of slavery [1865] and Reconstruction [1865-1877] or any of that?
Speaker 2: I really wish I knew then what I know now because I didn't know to ask.  I'm sure there are, but I don't know the stories.  And, unfortunately, by the time I had an appreciation for that type of thing, they were, they were deceased or, you know, aging to the point where they didn't know.  They couldn't tell us.  So, I do have an aunt on my father's side, Aunt Johnnie, who knows a lot about our family history.  And so every now and then, I probe her, and I need to do more of that because it's very interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay, at a certain point, I guess your father's father, your grandfather, moved to Chattanooga, I guess from Chickamauga?
Speaker 2: No, my--okay, so I don't know anything about my father's father because he died before I--I don't know.  It may have been before I was born.  And that side of the--oh, well, I do know some of them.  They were from Georgia as well.  They were from somewhere in Georgia.  But I know some of my father's father's brothers lived outside of Atlanta somewhere.  So I met a few of them, but I don't know enough, I don't really know much about them to be quite honest.  The one in Chickamauga was my father's mother's father.  That was Reba's father, Walter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Henderson was Reba Henderson's father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know much about my great grandfather on my dad's side.  I met a few of his brothers and maybe Aunt Esther and Aunt Nina were--oh, boy, okay.  I think they were on my grandmother's side.  I think they were on my grandmother's side.
Speaker 1: So as far as you know, your father's father could have always been in Chattanooga, you don't--
Speaker 2: Well, I think he was from somewhere in Georgia.  I think he was from somewhere in Georgia, but why he migrated to Chattanooga, I don't know.  I have this vague recollection that he might have worked for the railroad in Chattanooga.  So maybe that brought him there.  My grandmother on that side was a domestic.  I remember that.  You know, she would kind of--she was a very proper lady.  And, as I mentioned, she died when I was in the third grade, but--
Speaker 1: Now, this is Reba Simpson?
Speaker 2: That's Reba, uh-huh.  But I often wonder how I would have been different had she lived longer because she taught etiquette at a young age, and she was insistent on ladies being lady-like.  And so I remember that about her, like she was always just a very gentile, you know, proper lady.  You went to her house.  It was always a pitcher with lemonade and sweet tea.  You know, she was a Southern lady.  And so she taught me a lot early on about, you know, how to carry yourself and etiquette and things of that nature, but she died when I was young.  So I wish she had been around.  I would like to have learned a lot more from her.  She was a really nice lady.
Speaker 1: Now, do you suppose that she worked at a domestic for some wealthy family?
Speaker 2: I think so.  I don't know exactly where she worked, but I think she worked as domestic.  I know she worked as a domestic, and it was probably for, you know, a--you know, in Chattanooga, there is this thing called "Look Out Mountain".  And we always say that a lot of, the people with the money live in the mountain.  So I think she might have worked in Look Out Mountain, but I'm not sure, to be honest.  Now, my father actually, also dropped out of school--well, he didn't drop out of high school, but he didn't go to college.  He went to work early because when my grandfather died, apparently, he had to work to help take care of the family.  So he, my father was really, really smart, exceptional with numbers.  And I think if he had not had to, you know, he was definitely, could have gone to college and excelled if he had not had to start working at such an early age.  He would have, he could have been an engineer or whatever because he was very, very good with numbers, and he was just a smart man.
Story_ID: 22873
Speaker 1: Okay, so he [her father, Charles Nathaniel Simpson], did he finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he finished high school.  He graduated in the Class of 1948, Howard University [Washington, D.C.]--Howard High School in Chattanooga, [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but he didn't go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, Howard High School in Chattanooga.  Okay, now, did he talk about growing up in Chattanooga, what it was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he did.  So my dad was, what he ended up doing was when he, early on, like I said, he had to get a job.  And so he became a custodian at a store called Kay Jewelers.  Kay Jewelers still exists today.  But it was a store, downtown Chattanooga.  And so he was a custodian, and he tells the story about how one Saturday, they were shorthanded of sales force.  And so the manager of the store came to my father and asked him if he had a suit.  And my father said, yeah, sure I have a suit.  And he said, go home and put your suit on.  I wanna try something.  And so my dad went home, and he put a suit on and he came back to work.  And the manager let, put my dad on the sales floor and let him be a sales person for the day.  And my dad did fantastic.  He actually, he, he did so well that they turned him from being a custodian into a salesman.  So he was the first black salesman in downtown Chattanooga.  And many years later, the "Chattanooga Times", the newspaper there or the "Free Press", I don't remember which one.  It was the "Times" or the "Free Press", did a feature article on my father because they talked about how he actually integrated the sales force and did a lot to begin to integrate, you know, and bring more, open up opportunities for African Americans in sales in the stores, in the department stores and things like that in downtown Chattanooga.  My father also talked a little bit about the Civil Rights Movement [1955-1968] because he was downtown where Woolworth's, Woolworth's was.  And that was where many blacks sat in at the counters because at that time, you could go in and buy your lunch at Woolworth's, but you could not sit there and eat it if you were black.  And so many blacks went in, and they had a sit-in, and they bought their lunch, and they decided they were gonna sit there.  And so that was one of the, the things that's documented in Chattanooga about in the, during the Civil Rights Movement, is how they had those sit-in's at Woolworths.  And I think my dad was a part of some of that.
Speaker 1: Now, those would have been around '61' [1961], '62' [1962], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they were in the early '60's [1960s].
Speaker 1: Now, when did he, when was he elevated to salesman?  Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly the year, to be quite honest.  I think it was all well before I was born.
Speaker 1: Do you think it was before the sit-in movement or afterwards?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I don't know.  I, I don't know that timeline.  Perhaps, if I go back and look at the newspaper article, it's there.  I have the article.  So it may be there.  I could maybe find out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed to be nationwide that those barriers started breaking down around '63' [1963] for some reason (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that may--I think so.  I think you're right.  I think you're right.  So, yeah, so my dad talked about that, and he later, the store that he was originally the janitor in, he became the manager of years later.  And he became a regional manager and a district manager for Kay Jewelers.  And he worked there until he retired.  I think he worked for Kay Jewelers for something like forty-eight years.  It was a long time.  And over the years, he was like honored many, many times by the company for being like their top sales person and top manager, top, you know, regional manager, that type of thing.  So it was a really nice story of starting at the bottom and staying with it and moving up.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know the name of the family that owned Kay Jewelers?
Speaker 2: No, Kay Jewelers is a national chain.  They still have them.  There's some in the malls here in this area.  So I don't know the start of Kay's to be honest.
Speaker 1: Well, I was just wondering who was, you know--
Speaker 2: In that area at the time, who were the managers?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I never asked that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know they have 'em in Chicago [Illinois] too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so I don't know who were the managers at that time, and at the store that actually gave my father a chance.  But he talked about how he knew, like there were some people that he could go up to and wait on, and there were some people he could tell that they weren't quite ready for his type of salesman.  So he has stories that, he's, you know, very intuitive about people.  And so he had, tells us the stories about, you know, how some people would come in, and he'd get a look.  And he'd know, well, I'll let somebody else wait on them.  But some people were quite ready for him.  And we always teased my dad.  We said he could sell ice to the Eskimos because he was, he was very charming and able to, you know--I don't know, persuasive at what he did.  Both of my parents are in that regard.  My mom is similar.  She's a people person.
Story_ID: 22874
Speaker 1: All right, now, is there a story about how your parents [Viola McKenzie and Charles Nathaniel Simpson] met?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter).  So my mom came to Chattanooga, as I mentioned, to go to cosmetology school.  And that was on, what they called at the time, 9th Street.  That's now, that was like the black street in town.  There's always one in every city.  And it's now been renamed to Martin Luther King Boulevard.  But back then, it was 9th Street.  And so the cosmetology school was there.  And my father would go into the cosmetology school to get his hair washed and cut because, you know, it was cheaper there.  And so one day my mom was washing--she was the one designated to wash his hair.  And she was still learning, and so she was washing his hair, and she, she--the water got away from her and ran down his back and neck.  And then she was apologetic.  And he said, oh, that's all right, you can let that water roll or whatever, he said.  It was funny.  He was flirting (laughter).  And so, that was kind of the beginning.  He, he thought she was really nice, you know, because she was apologetic about getting water on him, and he was like, oh, I like her.  So, so then he started to frequent the cosmetology school.  And he actually knew the owner who was actually a member of our church and became a great family friend.  Her name was Marjorie Moore.  She owned the school.  It was the Marjorie R. Moore Cosmetology School.  And so Mrs. Moore, you know, could vouch for my father to my mother's uncle, that he was a good man.  And so, I guess that's why they were, she was allowed to see him.  And so he would come over, and they would sit on the couch at my uncle's house and my mother's--my uncle's grandson--his name is Tyrone, would sit there and chaperone while my mom and dad sat there on the couch (laughter).  So she has funny stories.  And I'm like, she'd say, yeah, we, we just sat there and smiled at each other and said a few words she said, because Tyrone was right there always (laughter).  So, so, yeah, that was the beginning.
Story_ID: 22875
Speaker 1: All right, now, so when you consider your parents' personalities, their looks, their habits, their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I probably take most after my mother [Viola McKenzie].  My mother, as I told you, she runs a beauty salon.  She owned a beauty salon.  It was in the basement of our house.  So we had a, you know, the bottom floor of our home was her salon.  And then we lived upstairs.  And she's just, well, she's very much a "people person".  So is my father [Charles Nathaniel Simpson], so maybe it's a mix.  But I think that the, you know, the beauty shop was my first job, you know.  I grew up working there, helping her.  I was the shampoo girl, I was the comb-out girl.  I was the one who washed all the towels and folded them.  So those were my first jobs.  My first memories are, and my fondest memories probably, are hanging out in the beauty shop with people.  And so being in the salon and watching how my mother dealt with people and learning to deal with people similarly, I think has been my greatest asset in life because, because I love people, and I have an intuition about people.  And I tend to, you know, that's probably my strength, is my ability to manage and interact well with others.  And so I get a, I think I get that from my mom, but probably also my father.  It's hard to say.  My mom is a very, "know how to get it done" kind of person.  She's, she's what we call a "wheeler-dealer" (laughter).  And so my husband kind of laughs at me sometimes because he says, "Oh, no, you're in that mode.  You're doing like your mom.  You're trying to wheel and deal."  (Laughter) So I guess it's more like her.
Story_ID: 22876
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting 'cause when we do these interviews, you know, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, we expect the people we interview to be like scientific geniuses and that sort of thing or to be very, very bright in terms of science.  But what you're describing is that your parents [Viola McKenzie and Charles Nathaniel Simpson] passed on to you this social I.Q., high social IQ.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I think that's been my biggest asset even in science because I agree that a lot of scientists are more introverted, are less adept with their social, socially.  And so to have the ability to learn the science, but then have the social skills that help you to convey your science, communicate it effectively and to work well with others in the lab, because, you know, science is--it requires teamwork, especially research, you know.  So being able to effectively work and form and run teams, I think has been a really, really helpful for me.  And I got all of that from the beauty shop and, you know, from my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I often tell my mom, because my mom had a saying that she would say because she didn't consider herself, you know, a very, you know, academically smart lady.  But she had what she called "mother wit".  So she would say, you know, you can get a lot of book sense, but make sure you have common sense.  Make sure you have mother wit that goes along with that.  And that'll take you far in life.  She would always tell us that.  And so--and all, you're getting, you know, you can get your degrees, but keep--make sure you have common sense.  And so that's what she taught me.
Story_ID: 22877
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you just have the one brother, right, or do you have--
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I have a blended family.  And, because what I didn't mention is my father [Charles Nathaniel Simpson] was married prior to my mother.  He married a lady by the name of Olivia.  I don't remember her last name prior to marriage.  And she had, she had, they had three kids.  They had my sister, Patricia, my brother, Charles, Jr., and my sister, Jean.  And his first wife died during childbirth, child delivery.  And so, so my father was left a widow with three kids.  That was, what, I guess that was in the '50's [1950s].  And so that was a very, that was, that was difficult, I think for him.  So I have three siblings there.  I have two sisters and a brother.  And then when my father remarried my mother [Viola McKenzie], they had two kids, and that was myself and my older brother, Barry, Barry Scott Simpson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I really have four siblings.  My other three siblings lived with my grandmother and my great aunt on their mother's side.  So they didn't grow up in the household with us, but we were close.  And, you know, the way our family worked is we all went to church, and after church on Sunday, we always had dinner.  And so, you know, we grew up with each other, but not, you know, we had separate roofs.  And they were several years older than my, you know, Barry and I.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Barry is, how many years younger than you is he--
Speaker 2: No, he's older than me.
Speaker 1: Oh, he's older, that's right.
Speaker 2: He's four years older than I am.
Speaker 1: That's right.  I remember the picture where you're--
Speaker 2: Yeah, three and a half.
Speaker 1: --the baby and he's--
Speaker 2: I'm the baby, right, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'm the baby, but he is who we tease and say he is the "beloved" one because we always tease that he was my, he's my mother's heart.  He's my mother's favorite (laughter).  And that's, that's only in jest, but he and my mother have a very close relationship that I really appreciate because, you know, he, he makes sure that our mom is well taken care of.
Story_ID: 22878
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory.  Like I said, I think my earliest memories are related to the beauty shop.  I remember just growing up and, you know, I started a store early on in the beauty shop 'cause my mother's clients would come and, you know, they'd want sodas or, you know, different things.  And so I opened a store, and I would sell sodas and chips and then it kind of grew.  And so I grew up kind of learning how to be a businesswoman, learning--like, I knew how to count money and write checks and do deposits to the bank pretty early in life because of, of my experience with the store.
Speaker 1: Now, you say you started the store?  Was that your idea?
Speaker 2: I think it was.  I think it was my idea (laughter) because, well, see, so my mom [Viola McKenzie] had this saying, "The customer is always right".  And, you know, whatever the customer ask you to do, you had to do it.  And you had to do it with a smile.  So, you know, customers can be very demanding, and so, you know, they would say, "Baby, go get me a glass of water; baby, you can--yawl got any cake up there" or, you know.  I was always waiting on customers.  And so I think I got kind of tired of it, and I said, well, you know, maybe I can sell them stuff.  And so we got a refrigerator, and we put it downstairs, and, you know, I'd have, not bottled water.  That wasn't there at the time, but a pitcher of water and some cups.  And then I'd also have like sodas and things like that.  And they stopped asking for water once I started selling sodas.  So then I made money off of 'em.  So (laughter), I think it was my idea.  But, you know, even--we had that store in the basement of our house until very recently.  When I left to go to college, my dad [Charles Nathaniel Simpson] took over the store.  And, and he expanded the store.  So, and then when my dad passed a few years ago, my mom still had the store.  And it was supposed to be just for her customers, but over the years, it became like a neighborhood store.  I mean we didn't sell big food items.  We just sold, basically, junk (laughter), you know, like frozen and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they, down South, they call them confectioners or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, something like that, yeah, something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know relatives that had a similar store next to, across from the school where the kids would just come and look into the kitchen window and buy a candy bar.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  It was that kind of store.  It was that kind of store.  So it kind of expanded.  It started out just to serve her beauty, beauty shop clients, but it expanded to kind of being in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's one of my childhood memories.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when you did that?
Speaker 2: Oh, Lord, I think that store started when I was about in the second grade, maybe about seven, six or seven years old.  Yeah, I think it was pretty early, maybe seven or eight, maybe seven or eight.  The other childhood memory that just stands out in my mind, and it's not a fond, particularly, fond memory, but I, it does stand out, is that, was death because my mom had two sisters that had breast cancer in the early--let's see.  I was, the early '70's [1970s], and they both died within like a week of one another in Macon, Georgia.  And in between that--well, about a week and a half, but in between the two of them dying, my grandmother died, my paternal grandmother.  So, you know, we had three deaths in my family like within a month when I was in the third grade.  And I just remember that introduction to, to death as being--that was significant.  I can never forget it.  I remember like the details of each one of those and how it made me feel.  So that was the other thing I really remember, and I was, I was about nine, I think, eight or nine.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, can you describe the neighborhood you grew up in?  Did it have a special name in Chattanooga [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's just called North Chattanooga, is what we called it.  I think now they might call it City View [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: And this was, I take it, a mostly black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it was a working-class neighborhood.  It was, it was black, but there were a few whites.  There were a few whites.  It was mostly working class, the blacks and the whites, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, yeah, it was primarily black.
Speaker 1: Now, did--what kind of house did you all have?  How many rooms did you have and what was it made of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so we had a nice house.  It was, it was a brick house.  And it was--originally, it had like two bedrooms, but then my parents added on, and so, and they had, they added like a big master suite with another bathroom in, I think I was, you know, maybe about the third grade or second grade or something when that happened and, and a garage, a two--yeah, a garage.  So it was, it was a nice house, two levels.  The beauty shop was in the basement, but also there was like a big area, open area in the basement that was kind of like a den, like a family room, playroom kind of thing.  And then we had a bar room 'cause my parent, my parents [Viola McKenzie and Charles Nathaniel Simpson] liked to have parties.  And so, you know, we, you know, it was, it was a socializing place.  It was--
Speaker 1: So the basement was big enough to have a bar and a den as well as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like, so you come in the door, and there's like, there's like two big sofas in the basement, and then you go on back.  And the beauty salon was in the back or it still is.  My parents, my mom still lives there.  And, and that was, you know, you know, a reasonable sized--but it was closed off room.  And the rest of it was just a basement.  And then back behind there, there's a bathroom, and then back behind there was the bar room.  And that led off to, then the garage was on the side.  So, yeah, it was, it was a reasonable sized house.  Like people, it was probably one of the biggest houses in the neighborhood.  It was probably the nicest house on the, on our street at the time.
Speaker 1: It was like a ranch-style house or what--
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was long like a rancher, but it was stubble, it was two levels.  So, yeah, it was an upstairs and down.  And upstairs, you know, was the, again, it was the kitchen and a breakfast room and then the dining room, living room and three bedrooms, two baths and another den.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have other operators in the salon?
Speaker 2: No, no, her salon was always herself and me (laughter).  So I knew early on what I didn't wanna do because of working in the beauty shop because washing--I was the shampoo girl.  And washing hair and combing out and all of that was hard work.  It hurts your back to bend over and wash hair and stuff.  And, so I knew that I wanted to go to college, in part, because of my working experience in the beauty shop.  I wanted to, I knew I wanted to do something less physical, maybe use my brain and not my body as hard.  So the beauty shop helped that.
Story_ID: 22880
Speaker 1: Okay, now, we always ask this questions.  When you think about the neighborhood in the times you grew up and the place where you grew up, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells.  That's interesting.  Whoa, well, I think I had pretty--well, okay, sights.  Growing up, you know, it was a neighborhood with a lot of kids.  So, you know, we would play in the yard, and up the street a little bit and across, you know, up and across the street, there was this vacant field.  And so we would play softball.  And it was one of those neighborhoods where, like some of the parents [Viola McKenzie and Charles Nathaniel Simpson] would come out and play with us.  So we'd form a softball team, and I remember my dad always played with kids.  So, you know, we would, we would go up and play softball in the field.  And like, we had a bad mitten set.  So my dad was always out there playing bad mitten, trying to beat all the kids.  And we played a lot of, you know, we would at night play games in the street like "Mother May I" and "Red Light" and again, parents would, some parents would be out there.  My parents were probably some of the more involved parents in the neighborhood.  So when the kids were around, you know, my parents would be with them, you know, they would do stuff with us all.  And then we'd play a lot of board games, especially me, more so than even my brother.  I just liked board games.  And so, and my dad liked them, so some of my friends would come over.  And they'd wanna play a game with me, and I didn't wanna play, and my dad said, I'll play with you.  So, you know, he was, he liked board games too.  So those were some of the sights and sounds, just like kids, just having fun, playing.  My family loved, loved to barbeque, to grill.  So smells, is like grilling.  And my mom, again, she's very, like I said, determined.  So I remember several times, like it would be really cold outside like snow on the ground once, at least, and she would be grilling in the garage.  She'd have the garage open with the grills, the smoke going out, and it'd be snow on the ground, and she'd be grilling ribs (laughter).  So, so we liked, you know, we'd do stuff like that outside.  You said sights, sounds, smell.  Sights, I don't know, just, just a nice, you know, working-class neighborhood.  It's changed a lot, you know.  When I go back now, it's not the same, you know, like the neighborhood has kind of gone down.  But back then, it was like working-class and, you know, families.  And now, it's, it's different.  It's not as safe.  There's an element that has moved in that's just not good.  So, so it's different, but it was very nice coming up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can't really go back to it now 'cause it's--
Speaker 2: We go back.  I mean I go back 'cause my mom still lives there, and it's not--I don't wanna give you the wrong impression.  It's not totally, it's not totally bad, but it's just, you know, there's, you can tell there's an element of, maybe some drugs have come in and some, not on our street, but you see the people just kind of walking around, loitering and things of that nature.  So you have to be little bit more careful.  And, but Chattanooga's [Tennessee] doing a really nice job of revitalizing the city, and some areas in particular in the city.  So I think our area is, is gonna be okay.  It's gonna be fine.  It hasn't deteriorated completely, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you lived there the whole time you grew up, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I lived there until I graduated from high school in 1982.
Story_ID: 22881
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to your first school, and what was the first--did you go to preschool or kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to preschool.  I remember that very well, me and my best friend for all my life, for all my Chattanooga [Tennessee] life (laughter) was, her name was Tanesia (ph.), Tanesia Townsend, and we went to preschool together.  Our parents were friends, and so one of our parents would take us, and the other would come pick us up.  And so I can't remember the name of the preschool.  But I remember my first preschool teacher.  Her name was Ms. Pringle.  And so I remember that, and I remember learning a lot there.  And after preschool, I went to elementary school at a school by the name of G. Russell Brown.  I don't know who G. Russell Brown [Elementary School] was, but it was walking distance from our house, maybe, you know, nine, ten blocks away.  I walked to school.  Now, one of the memories I have of that era was walking to school.  For some reason, I used to get beat up (laughter), not beat up, but I get bullied.  And I think it was because, even though I, I had a mouth.  You know, I was kind of smart alecky.  And I was also always a pretty good student, and so I was kind of what we would refer to as the teacher's pet a lot of times.  And so there were a few girls that would just wanna fight me for some reason.  And I wasn't a big fighter.  So I'd come home crying, you know, and I'll never forget the time--I think I was about the fourth grade.  And I came home.  I was crying and my mom [Viola McKenzie] was on the porch because she worked out of the home, so she was always there.  And she was on the porch, and she saw this girl just kind of bullying me along the way.  And she came, when I came in crying, my mom said, you're gonna have to learn to stand up for yourself.  And if you come again crying like that, without standing up for yourself, I'm going to, I'm gonna spank you myself.  So she said, you take, you stand up for yourself.  And so the next time this girl--her name was Evelyn, the next time she was bullying me and walking on the back of my heels and pushing me as I walked up the street.  I remember closing my eyes, turning around and closing my eyes and making a fist and just punching her as hard as I could.  And I really like punched her out, I think.  And every since then, she stopped messing with me.  And I came home, and I told my mom, I took up for myself, you know.  And, you know, the rest was history.  It kind of stopped because I, I stood up for myself.  So that's a memory I do remember.
Story_ID: 22882
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, that's a good story.  Now, I take it you liked school.  You were a good student--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were teacher's pet and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that (laughter).  Yeah, I always liked school, loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there any, one particular aspect of school you liked the best or--
Speaker 2: No, I just liked school.  I just, I mean I liked learning.  I still do.  Given the option of, you know, something to watch on TV, I'd much rather watch a documentary where I'm gonna learn something than watch a movie, you know.  So that's a struggle I have right now because my husband's like, let's watch a movie, and I'm like, but there's a documentary on PBS, you know (laughter).  So, but, so I just like learning, and probably in school, I liked math a lot.  And I remember another memory--okay, so now the memories are coming.  But another memory, I think that was good for me was my mom would let me write on my wall in my room with chalk.  I had one wall, and my mom doesn't remember this now.  Somehow she's forgotten, but I remember it very well.  She would, I would, I'd have chalk and I could write on one wall in my room, and I would use that wall as, to teach.  So I'd line my dolls up and I'd write on the wall and I'd teach 'em, you know, like whatever I was learning in school.  And so, and I'd put my, like my vocabulary words on the wall, and I'd lie in the bed.  And the last thing I saw before I went to sleep were those words or whatever I was trying to learn.  And it's the first thing I saw in the morning.  And it helped me a lot to learn and just kind of, like when you teach something to someone, you really know it.  And so I think that helped me a whole lot.  And my mom, to this day, she says, I can't believe I let you write on the wall.  But she did.  And I did it with a chalk, and then I'd have a little spray bottle with water, and I'd spray it and wipe it off like an eraser.  And then I'd just, I just wrote on that one wall.  That was before they had that paint that's like chalk, you know, like a chalkboard.  You couldn't do that now, but back then, it was just regular paint on the wall.  So, I remember doing that, and that was, I think that helped me a lot in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, well, that's interesting.  So, did you dolls learn much?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I had really smart dolls.
Speaker 1: All right, so did you have--now, you're the only--well, your, it's you and your brother there--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --growing up.
Story_ID: 22883
Speaker 1: So you say your best friend was Tanesia Townsend.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so would you all like do school kind of games too?
Speaker 2: We didn't do much school stuff together.  We mostly just played together.  Like, we had, our parents would coordinate, I think, what they were gonna buy us for Christmas.  And so we had every Barbie doll accessory there was.  So she had the airplane, and I had the Barbie townhouse.  She had the country camper, and I had the beach camper, you know, (laughter) so we, we would just play together a lot.  And so that's my fondest memory of her.  I think I mostly did academic stuff by myself.  You know, I read a lot, and I, like enjoyed, you know, just teaching, you know, my dolls.  So I always thought I was gonna be a teacher because I loved doing that.
Story_ID: 22884
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, you mentioned the documentaries.  Do you remember some of the documentaries you saw growing up?  Did you watch much--
Speaker 2: Growing up, I was intrigued by the Civil Rights Movement [1955-1968], you know.  So I, you know, I don't know if they were documentaries, particularly, that I watched.  But that was interesting to me.  I remember drugs, you know, like at the time, you know, the worst, the worst drug that I really knew of--like I didn't, I knew about heroin and cocaine and stuff like that.  But marijuana was, was big.  And so I remember seeing a documentary on that and then going out and doing research, like going to the library and looking up more information about marijuana and the effects of it.  And I wrote a paper on it, or--yeah, I wrote a paper on it, and then I participated in what they called at the time oratorical contests.  And so this one man by the named Malcolm Walker, he was at my--was this junior high or high school?  It must have been high school.  He, he saw my paper, and he said, you know, you could be in this contest.  I think it was sponsored by the Optimist Club.  And so I went, and I gave this talk about drugs and it's effect, marijuana, in particular, and the effect on the brain and the body and, you know, all these pros and cons or whatever.  And I won this contest because of that research and doing that talk.  So that was probably the first time I ever did research, now that I think about it.  And it was one of, and it was like my first public speaking kind of presentation thing.
Speaker 1: Now, about how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was probably, about in the ninth grade.  So that was maybe, eighth or ninth grade.  So how old are you then?  Maybe thirteen or fourteen.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, okay.
Story_ID: 22885
Speaker 1: All right, so this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I kind of skipped elementary.  I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, well, since we acknowledged we skipped it, let's--were there any favorite teachers in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I had a favorite teacher who's still alive and who's--today, and who still goes to my mom's [Viola McKenzie] beauty salon to get her hair done today.  Her name is Mrs. Grisham.  And
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: G-R-I-S- Grisham, H-A-M.  Oh, boy, she'll be upset if I couldn't spell her name right.  And she was my second grade teacher.  And she became my favorite, in part, because I mentioned a while ago that my mom had two sisters that had cancer in Macon, Georgia.  So my mom would go because she was the only one of her siblings that was self employed.  And so she had a lot of flexibility.  So she would go and help take care of her sisters, take 'em to chemo and do things like that.  And she'd be gone for maybe a week or two at a time, help take care of their families, while, you know, they were ill.  And so I remember--so because of that sometimes, you know, I didn't have anyone to do my hair.  And so my mom, who knew Ms. Grisham well, she would send me to school, and Ms. Grisham would comb my hair.  My mom wouldn't, 'cause my mom would be out of town in Georgia.  And Ms. Grisham would, she would, I think maybe even pick me up and comb my hair and made sure I was, you know, right for school.  So I just remember her being very caring, and she was also a really good teacher.  She was always pretty tough on me.  So, and she's still a family friend, and her daughter and granddaughter to this day.  But she was very impressionable.
Story_ID: 22886
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, did you have a middle school or did you go--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had, back then we called it junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So, yes, junior high was seventh, eighth and ninth grades.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your junior high school?  Is that a--
Speaker 2: North Chattanooga Junior High [Chattanooga, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.  North Chattanooga Junior High, okay.  Now, while you were, when you were in grade school or junior high school, did you have a chance to go to any special programs, you know, for gifted children or anything like that?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't think those were so prevalent back then or at least not in my schools.  I don't, I don't recall any special programs.  And when I got to high school, I did.  I was in, I was elected to go to a program that was, I think sponsored by Wayne Odom from Wendy's Corporation.  And it was a leadership program, and it was in Nashville [Tennessee].  I remember that was my first time hanging in a really, really nice hotel in Nashville.
Speaker 1: Well, I'll get to that.  I just wondered if in grade school--'cause you're in North Chattanooga [Tennessee], and that's, you know, you said that was a pretty stable, working-class community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was working-class community.  The schools were integrated.  I always went to integrated schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was our next question too, if it was integrated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have to be bused to a school or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't get bused.  A, most of the--well, I could say a lot of the African American kids were bused.  But we happened to live in the neighborhood where the school was, but there were, you know, I guess to get balance between blacks and whites, they had to bus in more African Americans.  So they bused them in from the West side, which is kind of like the predominantly, predominantly black area in Chattanooga, you know, where there were more housing projects and things.  So they bused a lot of the kids in from there.  But I, I walked to school every, to all of my schools, elementary, junior high and high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, did you have a favorite teacher or a mentor in middle school, in junior high school?
Speaker 2: I, I remember the, probably, she wasn't a favorite at the time, but the one I learned the most from was a lady by the name of Ms. Kissinger.  She was tough.  She was an English teacher, and she would like give us a lot of work, and I remember she had a saying that, her saying was, "An idle mind is the devil's workshop".  And she'd say, "And the devil won't get you on my watch 'cause you're not gonna have an idle mind as long as you're in my class".  And so she would like pile on the work.  And that was, she, I learned the most from her.  You know, now that I think about it, I think Mr. Walker was also the one who put me in the contest, the Optimist Club contest where I spoke, he was also in junior high school.  And so I was younger than I thought when I did that contest and won.  But he was there.  So I think he was impressionable for me.  And the last one was probably a lady by the name of Ms. Dorothy Jones.  And Ms. Jones was our librarian.  And so I loved to read, and I would go to library a lot.  And Ms. Jones, you know, looked out for me.  She'd recommend books for me to read.  And she was from a very nice African American family in Chattanooga.  She knew my parents, and so--and she helped run the summer camp I used to go to.  So she would, she was kind of influential as well in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very nice lady.
Story_ID: 22887
Speaker 1: So what kind of books did you like?  Were you reading--I just wondered if you were geared towards science or engineering as a child or if you--
Speaker 2: Not that I can say for sure, that I can say.  I, I would just read, you know, all the fiction, all the classics that you know of, like, for the time, you know, "Little Women", and, you know, all the, what I guess would be the classics.  And then I started, I--where I got into science a little bit was my parents bought us the Encyclopedia.  You know, people don't know about those anymore, but back then, you know, serious parents that wanted their kids to do well, always, you know, they brought a set of the "World Book Encyclopedia".  And so my parents bought the encyclopedia, and they also bought, they bought the, what was called "Childcraft".  And "Childcraft" as like a volume or several volumes of books that would the encyclopedia.  But they had experiments in those.  And so I would, I could read those "Childcraft" books, you know, they were like an encyclopedia volume, but I could read 'em from cover-to-cover.  And, yeah, they had experiments.  They had, you know, just cool crafts, you know, things you could learn.  You'd learn about, I remember I did an experiment with--I don't remember what the purpose of it was, but it was with snails.  You could make an eco system, and you put a snail in it, some fish in it and certain plants, an algae eater in it, and you could do some experiment related to the eco system.  And I got that out of the "Childcraft" book.  And then had my mom go to K-Mart and buy me all the little, the bowl and the fish and the snails and everything I needed for this experiment that I did.  So I did, I did stuff like that.  I think I read "Childcraft" and saw lots of science in there.  I learned about forces and why air--why balloons float and stuff like that from reading in "Childcraft".  But I didn't read other sciency (ph.) books.  It was, and I don't like Sci-Fi.  I never have.  So, you know, "Star Trek" and "Superman" or all those kinds of things never really interests me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was like fact (laughter), I wanted.  I didn't like the Sci-Fi stuff.
Speaker 1: That's interesting 'cause you grew up during the, I guess, were the golden ages of science fiction.  It was "Star Wars", the "Revival of Star Trek" on TV.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: The movies had big special effects, "Close Encounters"--
Speaker 2: "Close Encounters", all that stuff, I never liked or was even--I just never knew about it until I married my husband.  My husband is a big Sci-Fi fan and so he introduced me to all of that much later.  And I listened, I endure it because he loves it, and so I'll watch some of that with him.  But I always liked real science.  Like if it starts to seem too, like too good to believe, then I'm like, no that defies the principles of, you know, the physics.  So, you know, I can't get into that (laughter).  So, you know, he always tells me to lighten up.
Story_ID: 22888
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that somehow reminds me of religion.  I haven't talked about that yet.  Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My family was very involved in the church.  We grew up in the Warren Chapel African and Methodist Episcopal Church.  And so we were very, very much involved in church.  And one of the things about, it was a kind of prominent African American church during that time.  And so a lot of very educated, you know, African Americans in the city attended that church.  So I was exposed to, you know, people with, you know, college degrees and things like that through my church more so than from my family.  And so, you know, some of those people helped expose me to, you know, options about college and stuff like that, that my parents, you know, really didn't know as much about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was good that--do you think your parents consciously chose that church because of that (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it was a family church.  I mean my grandmother and grandpa, father, went there, and I don't know when we started there as a family, but it was just our family church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were, we went to church every Sunday, and we went, my brother and I grew up in Sunday school, and my sister and my older brother by that time was, was off.  He was in the war, in the Vietnam War [1959-1975].  So he wasn't there as much, but my sister and I and my brother did.
Story_ID: 22889
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were only five years old when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon [1969].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I don't remember it at all.  I, I--even though I work for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], you know, many years later, you know, I didn't--I was oblivious to that whole era of, you know, entering space, the Space Age.  I was too young, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I wondered.  We interviewed someone yesterday that was five that remembers watching it on TV.
Speaker 2: Really, yeah, see, I don't remember it.  I don't remember that.  I don't remember, now, you know, a lot of stuff happened back then when I was probably four, five, six, you know, Martin Luther King [Jr.] and the Kennedy [Robert Kennedy] assassination and stuff.  I was little.  I was alive, but I don't remember it, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you, do you remember how old you were when you kind of became aware of the--I guess the, some of the sensational aspects of the Space Program were starting to die down, right?  I mean, well, we had Challenger [space shuttle Challenger], you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, see, well, when Challenger happened, I was in college, and I remember that very well.  It's one of those moments where you know exactly where you were and what you were doing when that happened.  So I absolutely remember Challenger.  And by the time the Columbia accident happened, I was working for the, for NASA, and I was, I became very involved in that.  But a lot of the intervening years, I remember seeing shuttles launched when I was growing up, but I wasn't particularly drawn to that, you know.  It wasn't something that was, I can say that I saw that, and I always wanted to work for NASA.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case for me.  I thought it was cool, but I didn't, you know, that wasn't the draw.
Story_ID: 22890
Speaker 1: Now, did you receive, you know, decent, you know, science training in grade school, middle school?
Speaker 2: Probably, and for the time, yeah.  I, it probably was.  You know, I learned after I went to college that my, my education probably at the time was about average or maybe a little below average 'cause when I got to college, I ran into a lot of smart kids.  And in Chattanooga [Tennessee] in the schools that I was in, I was, you know, my class Valedictorian and I was always one of the top students.  And when I got to college, I realized there were a lot more kids and a lot more smart, a lot smarter than I.  So that was like a really eye-opening experience for me.  So I think my education there was not, you know, supreme, but it was, it was good enough for me to make it.
Story_ID: 22891
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Chattanooga High School, yeah.  That was, again, in North Chattanooga [Tennessee], my neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in high school, how many public high schools were in Chattanooga?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, there were quite a few.  They always called my school "City" 'cause it was named after Chattanooga [Tennessee], so it was called City High.  And then there was Howard [High School], Riverside--there were two predominantly black high schools, Howard High, where my dad graduated from and Riverside.  Then there was a, a trade school called Kirkland where a lot of kids, a lot of African American kids went there.  Mrs. Moore, the lady who owned the cosmetology school taught cosmetology there.  And then there were schools that were more, were less integrated, mostly white, Hixson High [School] and Tyner High [School].  So I think that, there's about six or seven high schools that were in the city at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay, so at Chattanooga now were you, you were Valedictorian of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at my high school, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were there any special teachers there that you remember that--
Speaker 2: Yes, gosh.  Let me think of who they all are.  One is Ms. Moore, Ora B. Moore.  She gave me my one and only "B" and I guess I earned my one and only "B" from her, is the way she'd want me to say that.  But it was like a B-plus.  I'll never forget thinking, like, that could have been a A-minus, right?  (Laughter) Why didn't you just give me an A-minus?
Speaker 1: What did she teach?
Speaker 2: She taught English, yeah, she taught English.  The other teacher that I would say probably had the most impact on me was a, was my chemistry teacher.  His name was Silverman, Dr.--yeah, was he doctor?  Or Mr. Stu Silverman, Silverman.  He was, he was like a football coach, the wrestling coach and the chemistry teacher.  So that was like a odd combination.  But he really inspired me, I think, the most because, you know, I took chemistry from him maybe in the eleventh grade.
Story_ID: 22892
Speaker 1: And I was really good in chemistry, and he [Dr. Silverman], he asked me, you know, well, are you gonna go to college?  And I told him, yes, and he said, well, what are you gonna major in?  I really didn't know.  I had no idea what I wanted to do.  And like I said, I thought maybe I would be teacher.  And then I, but, and I was talking to the chemistry teacher at the time, so I said, well, maybe I'll major in chemistry.  And he said, well, have you ever thought about engineering.  And I didn't know much about engineering.  I didn't know any engineers coming up.  And he said, chemistry's cool, but if you major in engineering, you can major in chemical engineering and engineers make more money than chemists.  And I said, that sounds good.  So I, I went off saying, I'll be a chemical engineers, not really knowing what that was.  And then Mr. Silverman, several, well, like maybe my junior, yeah, about my junior year, he told me about a program called "Introduction to Engineering for Minorities".  It's called MITE, Minority Introduction to Engineering.  And it was at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] in Atlanta [Georgia], and Atlanta's about two hours from Chattanooga.  And so I applied to that program, and at that program, it was like a week-long residential program where you stay on campus at Georgia Tech.  And you get exposed to different types of engineering and what they're about.  And they also took, took us over to the Atlanta University Center, which is where, you know, Spelman College and Morehouse [College] and Clarke-Atlanta [University], and at the time Morris Brown [College] were located.  And so we got to see those schools and learn more about engineering.  And so that kind of shored up my interests and my plan to major in chemical engineering, still really not knowing that much about it.  But, you know, I had this introduction, and so I decided, okay, that's what I'm gonna major in.  And so somehow or another I was, I got on a list.  I was on somebody's list, and I had applied to go to school in engineering at, go to college rather, at Tennessee Tech [Tennessee Technological University] and I think, Georgia Tech.  And one day I came home from high school and my mom [Viola McKenzie] said, there's this lady that called that wants you to call her back.  And she says she's gonna give you a scholarship to go to college.  You need to call this number, and like I said, my mom was not really, you know, that savvy about things like college and the details of admission and planning and stuff.  But she was like, call this number.  So I called the number, and, and the lady told me that, that there was this program at the AU, Atlanta University Center called the dual degree program.  And she said, I know you applied to Georgia Tech, but if you apply to one of the schools in the Atlanta University Center, you can go to that school and Georgia Tech, and we'll give you a full scholarship.  And so that's how I got to Spelman [College] because I, I elected to go to Spelman College.  And there, I majored in chemistry, and then I went to Georgia Tech.  It was a three, two program.  So I spent three years at Spelman and then two years in the hardcore chemical engineering courses at Georgia Tech.  And at the end of the five-year program, you get a degree in chemistry from Spelman and a degree in chemical engineering from Georgia Tech.  And so I had a full scholarship to do that.  It was a Department of Energy scholarship.  And so that's how I got it though.  It wasn't, you know, throughout my life I think I've just been really blessed because opportunities just kind of fall into my lap.  And it's one of those cases where preparation meeting opportunity.  You know, I was prepared because I was a pretty good student, and the opportunity came, and I could grasp a hold of it.  And that's how I got through college because my parents [Viola McKenzie and Charles Nathaniel Simpson], they would have sent me to college.  They would have worked two and three and four jobs if they had to, to send me to college.  But they really had not prepared fiscally for the amount of money it would take to send me to college.  They thought, they were saving, but they really didn't have enough.  Like what they saved would have sent me for one year perhaps.  So getting the scholarship was a real blessing.  So--
Speaker 2: Okay, now, did your brother go to college ahead of you?
Speaker 1: My, my brother did not go to a four-year college.  He went to community college, junior college, Chattanooga State [Technical Community College].  And he got a degree in like Information Science, and, but it wasn't as expensive.  So I think they, my parents paid for that like courses at a time, a few courses at a time.  So it was, you know, it was different.  He lived at home, so it was a lot less expensive than for me when I went away to a four-year college.  But, yeah, my husband--my brother did get a, he got his Associates degree, and he started working when he was--well, we always worked.  As a matter of fact, that's one thing my parents stressed.  They gave us a serious work ethic.  And so from, before I was working age, I think I was fifteen, I had my first job at McDonald's.  My brother actually misrepresented his age and told them he was older than he was, and he got his first job digging ditches--I'll never forget that, when he was about thirteen or fourteen.  And every since then we always worked, and at one time, I had three jobs.  I worked at McDonald's.  And then I worked at the hospital as a, the person who would, in the cafeteria, like I would go and interview the patients to see what they wanted to eat and then bring them their, the items, their food.  And then I was a Candy Striper.  So, you know, my mom would say, you know, you're working too many jobs, you know, 'cause I was still working in the beauty shop.  And she was like, you don't have any kids to feed, you know, you gotta, you're working too, you're doing too much, you know, 'cause I was also very active in school.  And I was doing all these jobs.  I was always busy, always.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And my brother was too.  So he got a job at TVA, Tennessee Valley Authority very young, and he's been there every since and moved up the ranks very nicely.
Story_ID: 22893
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you had the opportunity to go to Spelman [College].  Now, did you--now, how did you like Spelman?  You discovered a lot of people were smart at Spelman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a wonderful experience for me.  Spelman was great for me.
Speaker 1: This is 1982?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '82' [1982], and I, I had never been around that many African American kids who were so focused and academically oriented because usually, when I was in high school, you know, I got called an Oreo very often because I would be like the only one or two, one of two or three black kids in the accelerated classes.  And I took college prep courses and stuff.  And so I was always kind of like one of the exceptions.  And then when I got to Spelman, there were all these black women and Morehouse [College] and Clarke [Clarke-Atlanta University], all these black kids that were all, you know, focused on their careers and their academics.  And so that was a really good experience for me.  I, I think I got a lot of my, you know, because feeling like an Oreo and being called that wasn't so positive in high school.  So I, I, it helped me with my identity, and I was having an identity crisis probably before that.  So it was very good for me.
Speaker 1: You met other black students that were serious about--
Speaker 2: Serious about school and very smart, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna pause here I think and--
Speaker 2: Let me go do my--[pause] (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Speed.
Speaker 1: Who was president of Spelman when you got there?
Speaker 2: Dr. Donald Stewart.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And who were some of the, now, at a school like Spelman, they're all, some of the other students are worth mentioning.  So who was there when you were at Spelman that you remember that--
Speaker 2: That everyone would know?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah--
Speaker 2: You mean famous people or--
Speaker 1: Well, it could be famous or famous to you, but who were some of the memorable--
Speaker 2: Bernice King was there, Dr. Martin Luther King's daughter, youngest daughter was there.  She was a year ahead of me.  Then, of course, his sister, Dr. Christine Farris, taught at Spelman.  And she taught English.  And so I had early encounters with her.  I wasn't in her class, but she was the head of the department, so I, I had AP'd out of that first set of English.  So I had to deal with her.  Famous, I mean--you didn't say famous, just--I was in the sorority.  So, you know, like I have line sisters who--we're in Delta Sigma Theta is my sorority who are now doing really great things.  I think of Dr. Lisa Cook who is a professor in economics now, was at Harvard [University].  I think she's, she's just moved recently.  I'm not sure where she is now.  Adrianne Joy Johnson, who's an actress and who was also in my sorority and we were friends then.  Many others.  I mean do you really want me to name names or (laughter) other names--
Speaker 1: Well, if you think they're significant.  I mean, you know, I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, just, I mean Spelman can be like a who's who, you know.  So there were lots of, you know, you would see people and it's like, oh, that's Gladys Knight's daughter or that's, you know, and you just get to know them as friends.  So, there were many people like that I would say over the years, that I met at Spelman.  And also a lot of really accomplished women that have gone on to do really good things.  I see Spelman sisters, I was watching a documentary two nights ago on PBS on "Frontline", and they were talking about the AIDS epidemic in the black community.  And I saw one of my freshman classmates, Dazon Dixon, Dr. Dazon Dixon.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her first name?
Speaker 2: D-A-Z-O-N.  And she was on as a, as an expert, talking about, you know, what the epidemic has done in the black community.  And it's, it's amazing because my kids, they laugh because very often I'll be looking at something, and I'll say, that's, I know her.  We went to school together or I know--and they're like, you know all these famous people (laughter).  But it's just that you start to see them kind of doing really good things and being, you know, being called upon in the community to do nice things.  So.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any, were there many African or Caribbean students there?
Speaker 2: African--
Speaker 1: Yes, or Caribbean students from the continent of Africa.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yeah, there were, there were.  And I, I can't say that I had a whole lot of friends that were directly from Africa at the time.  That happened in graduate school.  In graduate school, there were lots of African, like the other black graduates students were almost always of African descent, especially the men.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did, I know Spelman, like a lot of the black colleges, like all of them, actually, bring celebrities to campus and guest speakers.  Who came to Spelman that you remember--
Speaker 2: Oh, lots.
Speaker 1: --that really impressed you?
Speaker 2: Dick Gregory.  I remember he was one of the earlier speakers my freshman year.  And, yeah, he was very, what do you call it?  Irreferential (ph.), irreverent, that's the right word.  And it left an impression, but what he said, it was so poignant and directed, it left an impression.  And it was true.  Most of the things he said were true.  The other one that I remember was, now, I'm drawing a blank of her name.  But she wrote, Nikki Giovanni, Nikki Giovanni was one of the speakers.  And they brought a lot of business leaders there.  Maynard Jackson was, you know, a standard around campus.  Andrew Young spoke early on, and I really remember learning a lot from the things that he had to share.  He's such a diplomat.  Bill Cosby, of course.  He's like an icon on campus, and his wife, Camille Cosby, I met.  Shirley Chisholm, I remember having a picture with her, and she spoke to us probably my sophomore year.  And she was a Delta [Sigma Theta Sorority], so she spoke on campus, and then she came and she met with some of the Deltas, offline and we got to take pictures with her and talk politics with her.  She was a really delightful lady.  So there were many that came through over the years at Spelman.
Story_ID: 22894
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you--now, you're a Delta [Sigma Theta].  Were you involved in other activities on campus in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, well, let's see, I was involved in, mostly in the sorority.  And we had like regional clubs like the D.C. Metra Club, and the Tennessee Club, things like that.  So I was involved in that.  We'd help arrange for buses to go home, things of that nature.  And then I was involved in, like the Math Club, the Math League, things like that, but not really, I wasn't like Homecoming and all those kinds of activities.  I was more engrossed in the academics at that point 'cause being a dual degree engineering major, it was tough.  You know, it was a, it was a pretty tough curriculum.  So I didn't, my primary extracurricular was my sorority outlet, and we did a lot of volunteer services.
Story_ID: 22895
Speaker 1: All right, now, who was your, I guess guide or mentor in chemistry?
Speaker 2: I would probably say, again, Dr. Silverman, Stu Silverman, from high school was the one that really guided me and mentored me in that direction.  But then the most lasting impact has been, been from two ladies, one at--both from Spelman [College].  One is Dr. Gladys Bayse, who was the head of their chemistry department.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?  Gladys--
Speaker 2: Gladys, G-L-A-D-Y-S and Bayse, B-A-Y-S-E.  And the other is Dr. Cornelia Gillard, C-O-R-N-E-L-I-A, Cornelia, I think, and Gillard, capital G-I-L-L-A-R-D.  And they were very influential.  I did an honors chemistry research project with Dr. Bayse starting my junior year, I think, or maybe it started in my sophomore year at Spelman.  And, you know, where I actually--that was my first real laboratory research where I got in the lab and actually ran instruments and had to analyze my own data, and, you know, do these experiments.  And so she really taught me how to do research.  And Dr. Gillard taught me organic chemistry.  And she was just a brilliant, phenomenal teacher.  She still teaches at Spelman in the chemistry department.  So I think Dr. Bayse may be retired.  But Dr. Gillard is still there, very impactful.
Story_ID: 22896
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what about at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology], you know?  So you were commuting back, so did you have to--so you spent like three years at Spelman [College] academically, basically, and two at--
Speaker 2: At Georgia Tech.
Speaker 1: Georgia Tech, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  So, basically, the first three years, you're pretty exclusively at Spelman.  And then that fourth year, I lived on campus at Georgia Tech, the fourth and fifth years, I lived on campus at Tech.  And I was pretty exclusively there.  And I would commute back to Spelman some because I was working and finishing up my honors science, my chemistry dissertation.  So I had to write a, write that up and finish off my experiments.  And so I would do that from time to time, from Georgia Tech.  But, you know, you were pretty much in residence at each of those schools during the period that you were there.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, who were some of your teachers at Georgia Tech?
Speaker 2: Well, Georgia Tech was different.  It was extremely different from Spelman.  You know, I tend to wonder if I had gone directly from high school to Georgia Tech, if I would have excelled.  Spelman was a good incubating ground for me because it was a very supportive environment.  And they really cared and would, you know, help you if you fell.  At Georgia Tech, it was almost like designed to weed out the weakest.  And so I can't say that I had a lot of teachers early on that were, you know, particularly, you know, inspirational or helpful.  That did change once I went to graduate school there.  When I entered graduate school, I had a professor, my thesis advisor, Dr. Sue Ann Bistrop (ph.).  She was the, the first woman faculty in the chemical engineering department at Georgia Tech.  And I was fortunate enough to get, to become her graduate student.  And she was very, very helpful and inspirational and, you know, just a really good mentor for me at Georgia Tech.
Story_ID: 22897
Speaker 1: But I can't--go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just wanted to emphasis what you're saying, that, for anybody watching this.  You're defining the difference between the black college and what the purpose of it is and maybe what a state school with a mass attendance (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah, it was, I mean--
Speaker 2: One to nurture and one to weed out.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so, yeah, it was very much like that.  You felt that when you went.  And, you know, Spelman [College] gave me a chance to mature, get a better sense of myself and more confidence.  And so those three years, I think, made all the difference in me being successful and maybe even ultimately going to graduate school because I was mature enough and able at that, by the time I got to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] to deal with a professor who told me, and there was myself and one of my best friends now, her name is Donna Watkins.  But at the time, she was Donna Tumor.  And we, we both matriculated through Spelman and Georgia Tech together and took all of our classes together.  And so one of the professors told us when we registered for his class that we probably--'cause we had a pretty heavy load, a lot of, you know, all hardcore classes.  And he said, well, you probably don't wanna take that many classes because, you know, you are from Spelman, and your background is probably not good enough for you to be able to handle that, you know.  Basically, there was this expectation that we would fail from the outset, and we hadn't even taken the first test.  And, you know, he had already, you know, speculated that our background was inferior and we wouldn't be able to perform.  Well, of course, we did.  We, we did perform, and I, I finished up with my undergraduate at Georgia Tech with, you know, three point, I think, six [3.6] GPA.  So, you know, we did just fine.  And both my friend, Donna, and I proceeded to go to Georgia Tech for our Masters degrees.  And she got a degree, her Masters degree, in civil engineering, and I got mine in chemical engineering.  And so we could excel in that environment, and we did.  We did just fine.  But there was that, you know, preconceived notion that we couldn't because of our backgrounds.  So--
Story_ID: 22898
Speaker 1: Well, explain the difference between being a chemist and being a chemical engineer?
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, it's kind of, it can be subtle sometimes, but--especially, to those not, that aren't as exposed.  Chemist, a chemist is a scientist.  And so scientists study, like the fundamentals of whatever the area is.  They understand the principles that govern how things reacts, say in chemistry or how the world works, you know, in that particular area, whereas engineers take what scientists know, that fundamental understanding, those fundamental principles, and they try to make useful things and do useful things utilizing those principles and those fundamental theories.  And so I think of an engineer as more applied than, whereas a chemist, a chemist or scientist is, is more theoretical in their, in their approach to how things work and, you know, making things work, whereas an engineer will take what a chemist understands and say, well, now, we can use that to make this, which can be a product that people use and that makes the world go round, so to speak.  So, that's kind of the way I describe the differences.  Engineering is applied.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you 'cause we, a lot of people don't know the difference.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so you have dual degrees in 1987--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22899
Speaker 1: So how did you decide that you'd rather be a chemical engineer than a chemist?  I mean how did you make that decision?
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, you know, I really consider myself more of a chemist to be honest than a--I mean more of a chemical engineer than a chemist because I, all of my summer experiences, all of my work experiences had been drawing on my chemical engineering background.  So I just felt like more of an engineer than a pure chemist.  And so when it was time for me to go to graduate school, it just made sense for me to get my Masters in chemical engineering, more so than chemistry.  I can't say that I thought about it.  I just, you know, it was just obvious that I would advance my degree in engineering as opposed to straight chemistry.
Story_ID: 22900
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you're, you went straight through.  Did you take any time to savor getting a Masters degree or did you just--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I, I got my Masters, and I knew that I wanted to get the PhD in the process of getting my Masters.  Now, when I went in, to be quite honest, and I like to be honest because sometimes kids and people think that you have your, you had all these great plans for yourself.  I really didn't.  I kind of stumbled into a lot of the things that I've done in life.  And the idea of going to graduate school was very similar.  I had a good friend who, who's become a dear friend.  Her name is Dr. Christine Grant.  But at the time that I met Christine, she was a graduate student at Georgia Tech.  She was like the only black woman graduate student at the school, and she was like the first to get her PhD from Georgia Tech in chemical engineering.  But anyway, I was an undergraduate, and I interviewed her--okay, so, 'cause I was involved in the National Society of Black Engineers [NSBE].  And I was writing a newspaper article for the paper, for the, the new, the NSBE newspaper or newsletter.  And I wanted to interview this lone, black graduate student in chemical engineering.  And so I went in and interviewed her, and as a result of that, it, a friendship budded, and when it was time for me to decide whether I wanted to go to graduate school or not, I was really not intending to go to graduate school.  But Christine pulled me into her office one day, and she said, hey, you have really good grades.  You're really a good student.  You have to go to grad school.  You have to think about this.  And I had been interviewing and I had gotten several job offers and fairly lucrative job offers.  As a matter of fact, my father [Charles Nathaniel Simpson], when I got my first job offer from Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio] and I told my parents about it, it was more money than my dad was making, and he was, you know, in his fifties.  And it was more money than he was making at the time.  And so he was just like, oh, my gosh, you gotta take that job.  And then I had this girlfriend who was telling me, you gotta go to graduate school.  And so one day she pulled me into her office, and she said--she sat me down, and she said, I need you to fill out this application.  And it was an application to a program called Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering.  It's the GEM program.  Yeah, graduates, yeah, Graduate Education for Engineering or something.  And so I filled out the application for the GEM program, and she said, okay, that's all I need from you.  And she took the application, and she mailed it for me.  And a few months later, I got an, in the mail, a letter saying that I had won a GEM fellowship to go to graduate school.  So that's what really made me decide to get my Masters degree, is because I had this friend who had basically pushed me (laughter) in that direction and opened up a door for me by forcing me to fill out this application that I would never have filled out.  I didn't know much about it.  And I had a free ride to go to graduate school through the GEM program.  And so because of that, I applied, and I applied to Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology].  And so this goes back to your first question, "Why chemical engineering and not chemistry?"  Really, it was because the GEM program was for engineering (laughter).  So I had forgotten that.  And I applied, and I got accepted, and that's how I got my Masters degree.  And to be honest, I really was only doing it to get a Masters degree.  Georgia Tech had a two-year Masters program.  And I thought, well, this is good.  I can learn more.  And then I will, you know, leave, and I'll go make this money that my dad was anxious to see me make.  And I was also dating someone, and so I was thinking I'd do this two years, and then I'd go off and get married.  And again, not me planning, but in the process of those, that two-year period, my boyfriend and I broke up.  And right around the time when I had to decide what next, was I gonna go and work or what, you know, I was kind of heartbroken.  And so I was, just kept doing what I was doing.  And I just applied for the PhD program.  And, and I found out that I liked it in the process of getting my Masters too.  That was the other thing.  It was the first time I had really done research in a way that it just turned me on.  I really loved it.  And graduate school was not at all like undergraduate.  It wasn't just, you know, going to class, taking notes, studying, working problems and then taking tests.  It was, you're in the laboratory, you're, you know, designing your own experiments.  You're understanding how things work and doing that analysis.  And it was--and you took classes, but it was, it was a different pace, a different mode.  And I liked it.  So when, when I wasn't going, decided I wasn't gonna be getting married and, you know, moving away to live with my boyfriend, I decided I would go, and stay in grad school and get a PhD.  So I just kind of, again, stumbled into that.  But it was, it was a really good thing.
Speaker 1: And your story is a lot like a lot of other people we've interviewed that, you know, in terms of, you get swept along with the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, by the current, you know.  You can't say, you know, like, a lot of people--and I think it's intimidating to kids because they, they hear someone has done reasonable well.  And they think like, oh, they were, you know, they always knew what they wanted to do.  They always had this plan, and they'd always, you know, things worked for them.  And it's intimidating to them.  And I like to tell kids, no, sometimes, you know, if you prepare yourself, you do your part, and good things start to happen.  And sometimes, you'll just be open to those things, and, you know, it's a good thing.  You know, ultimately, it's been a real blessing for my life.  So.
Story_ID: 22901
Speaker 1: And it also highlights the importance of mentors, people like Dr. Christine Grant--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was working on her degree when you met her, and now she's, she brings you along.
Speaker 2: She mentored, and we are still the best of friends to this day because--and I always, I like to mention her because you're right.  We were not that far, different in age.  She was only a few years older than me, but, you know, she, she took the bull by the horns.  I really was not going to graduate school.  I was going to work, and she just said, keep your options open; fill this out.  And I was kicking and screaming the whole time, and she just said, no, just fill it out.  I'll take care of it from here.  And she still mentors me to this day, but we, you know, now, it's just, it's mutual.  She's a professor now and dean of, associate dean of engineering at North Carolina State University in Raleigh [North Carolina], so we're good friends.
Speaker 1: And you couldn't be something like that without a graduate degree, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, of course, no, no, no.  You have to have your PhD 'cause she was a professor for many years in the chemical engineering department there.  And then, just in the past several years, she's become associate dean.
Speaker 1: All right, so there's a lot, in terms of salary and options and freedom to do things when you have a graduate degree.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  So, yeah, it's amazing how, when you, when you get that advanced degree, especially, like the PhD, it automatically qualifies you for a lot of things by nature of having that credential, you know, those letters behind your name, so to speak.  And so, yes, even, you know, it does open a lot of doors, a lot of doors and a lot of options.  And that's why I also tell young people, don't limit yourself by limiting your options, especially early in life, you know, because you never know what you may wanna do.  And if you, you prepare yourself and be open, you know, you have options.  It, it really keeps the doors open.  I had that this year with my daughter, one of my daughters who decided she didn't, she wasn't loving math anymore.  And I said, no, no, you have to, you have to continue to love math and do well in it because, you know, by the time you get to twelfth grade, and you're ready to go to college, you don't know what you wanna do.  But if you've decided, you know, at this age, in sixth grade, that you don't like math, and then you decide to like, not focus there and, you know, you know, your skills aren't up to par, you automatically limit your opportunities when you go to college because you haven't prepared yourself at the right level to enter into college and do well.  So she caught on, and she made A's in math.  But it took a, it took a little battling for a minute, just a minute.  We got it together.
Story_ID: 22902
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell us about your dissertation.  What was--your dissertation, from what I have here was entitled "Structure Dielectric (ph.) Property Relationships and Epoxy System, a Free Volume Analysis".  Now what does that mean to earthlings (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, basically, it was in an area where you're looking at composite materials.  So a composite is, you know, you encounter composites every day.  It's a high performance plastic, essentially.  It's made with carbon fiber.  It re-enforces a polymer.  And so what I was studying in graduate school is how to effectively make and cure these composites and monitor the reaction that takes place as you make these composites by looking at how their electrical properties change and how their radiological properties change.  So we're looking really, you know, at the chemistry of the molecules in the polymer and trying to see how that molecular, the polymer backbone became inhibited as a function of time and how that correlated with things like ions in the polymer.  And, gosh, I feel like I'm getting too deep here, but basically, trying to correlate that so you could monitor and know when your composite was fully cured and appropriate for, you know, use, had the ultimate properties that you wanted to see in it.  Now, these composites get used in a lot of things, like, and so when I worked at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], the work was related to composites for aircraft and spacecraft, you know.  So you look at something like steel, iron, things that airplanes were traditionally made of, prior to the composites revolution, those were a lot heavier than composites.  So you can make a plastic that's stronger than steel.  And so those were the kinds of materials I was working on, how do you actually make those, and process those such that they give you the properties you need for something like building an airplane out of it or building a component on the space launch vehicle or something.  So, but without getting into the physics of it, that's the basic area that I did my PhD work in.
Speaker 1: So, as a chemical engineer, working on these different polymers and plastics, you're trying to develop the most, I guess suitable material for that application--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  So we're trying to understand what the right perimeters are and how you can effectively, you know, process that material to get the properties, get the output of it, out of it, that you need for whatever the given application is.  And so over the years, I've worked on developing many material systems for many different types of applications, you know, what NASA needed for, like out in space, for vehicles, for, you know, different spacecraft systems.  And now I do similar things for the Air Force because we also work in, you know, aerospace systems.  So, you know, my background is in that.  Now, I, I don't do the research.  I fund the research, but when I was at NASA, I actually did the research, and I managed other scientists and engineers that did the research in the lab.  So I ran the lab.
Story_ID: 22903
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I don't wanna get too far ahead of us--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of where we are right now, but 1994, when you were thirty, you joined NASA's [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Langley Research Center--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in Hampton, Virginia as a post-doctoral associate, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And here, you work on--
Speaker 2: Piezoelectrics.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: I'll help you there.
Speaker 1: I wanna say "pie" all the time, when I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's piezoelectrics.
Speaker 1: Piezoelectric materials.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, these are polymers that conduct electricity, right?
Speaker 2: Right, they're like, piezoelectrics are like transducer type materials.  And so basically, you think of transducer, it, like takes one form of energy and converts it to another.  And so a piezoelectric, if you, if you have a piezoelectric material and you put a force on it, like a mechanical energy, it will give you an electric signal.  So they call that electromechanical coupling.  And so I worked to try to develop new classes of, of piezoelectric polymers at NASA in my post-doc.  And particularly, what I was looking for there is high, more durable piezoelectric polymers.  There's some that are naturally occurring piezoelectrics like quartz, it's not a polymer or crystal, that we use every day in things like watches and clocks.  But then there are manufactured piezoelectrics like in things like polymers, like poly-vinylidene (ph.) fluoride.  But those kinds of materials aren't very durable like, in terms of temperature, like you can't use 'em above a certain temperature or you can't use them in a certain hostile or caustic environment because it will degrade the material.  And so I looked at working at high temperature, you know, much more durable polymers in trying to induce this response in those materials.  And so, so we were working on making high temperature piezoelectrics that could be used in aircraft and spacecraft and things of that nature.
Story_ID: 22904
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your research advisor was Dr. Terry St. Clair--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell us something about him.
Speaker 2: Wow, he happens to be probably the one, the single-most influential person in my working career, after schooling.  Dr., Terry, Terry, Dr. Terry St. Clair, is a, was an older white, gentleman who I wasn't even sure I was gonna like working with 'cause he's kind of, you know, like blah, but he's turned out--well, I thought he was.  But he's turned out to be one of the most [sound noise] delightful, he turned out to be one of the most delightful people and most influential in my life because he mentored me, and then he later became my boss at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] when he hired me after my post-doc.  And then I became, I, after several years of working on the bench under his guidance, I became his assistant branch chief.  And when he retired several years after that, I was selected for his job.  And so that was pretty big because he had, he was well established in the area, and I was relatively young.  But, but I kind of followed in his footsteps in that regard.  And so, he's taught me the most in life, I think, in terms of my, my science and engineering, and just a really nice man.  One other thing I tell kids is that we all need mentors and we need role models.  And they don't always have to look like you.  There's no one as, you know, as different than me as, as Terry.  You know, he was an older, white man, but he's done the most to help my career of any other person, you know.  And so, you have to be open minded about your mentors and be willing to, you know, anyone can help you.  And you never know where people are coming from until you get to know them.  So I just, I just caution people that very often, your mentors don't necessarily look like you.  Be open to that.  And this is one of those cases.  Terry has since retired, and he and his wife are dear friends.  And we still, I still visit them often and just go by their house and hang out, spend the night, talk science, talk, talk whatever, you know, politics, whatever.  They're great, great people.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: --that's the Terry story.
Story_ID: 22905
Speaker 1: So in '95' [1995], you became the research leader at Langley [Research Center]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you established the Electroactive Polymers Research Program.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So when I came there, we didn't have any research on electroactive, you know, piezoelectric and other, like electricactive polymer materials.  We had a small effort in ceramics.  But we didn't have any in polymers.  So I started that effort, and, and established a lab and established the funding for us to venture into that area.  And, again, this was under the, the guidance of Dr. St. Clair.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think, it says here that you and Dr. St. Clair filed a patent for thermally stable piezoelectric and pyroelectric polymeric substrates (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that was my first patent, and it was, it was funny because I worked on developing these materials, these piezoelectric polyamines (ph.), and I, I was kind of, not meticulous in the lab, but I, I kept not being sure I had enough data.  And Dr. St. Clair would say, Joycelyn, you should write up.  This is, this is great.  You know, this is, this is a new class of electroactive materials.  You have to write this up as a patent.  And I kept thinking, like, I don't have enough to write a patent.  I need to get more data.  And so one day, he pulled me to the side, and he said, either you write that patent or I'm gonna break your arm (laughter).  It was a joke, but sure enough, I, I said, okay, I hear you now.  I, I understand.  So I started writing the patent and, of course, it, it was enough for a patent.  And that was my first patent.
Story_ID: 22906
Speaker 1: All right, so in, so this first patent is filed, and 1996, you received the 1996 R and D 100 Award from "R and D Magazine".
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what is "R and D Magazine"?  What is that?
Speaker 2: Research and--
Speaker 1: And development, okay.
Speaker 2: --Development Magazine.  And so, what they do is, every year they award like the 100 most important innovations in a field, in a, in a broad area.  Well, I think in this case, it was in science and engineering.  And so I got that award, along with some co-inventors for what was probably my second patent.  And it was for a technology called thunder, that we called "Thunder".  And Thunder, it's an acronym, and I won't go into the details of the acronym, but basically, it was--
Speaker 1: Well, yes, you should tell us what the acronym means, stands for.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, okay.  So let me see if I remember it all 'cause it's kind of complex.  It's under THUNDER.  It's Thin Layer Unimorph Actuator and Driver, I think it means, and driver.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we had here Thin Layer Composite Unimorph Piezoelectric Driver and Sensor.
Speaker 2: Driver and sensor, okay, yeah.  I'm getting the words all mixed up because it's been a while.  I, we just always called it THUNDER.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So what is it?  We still don't know what it is even though we've read it.
Speaker 2: It's, again, it's one of those transducers.  It's an actuator, but it was a new type at the time.  And what made it novel is how we made it, and the materials that we used to make it.  And we made it in, we made it with--well, I won't go into the details of that.  But the product we got was much higher strengths.  So I mentioned to you that if you apply pressure to a piezoelectric, it gives you an electrical charge.  So you can use that for a transducer like sensors, and they use them in microphones and amplifiers and things of that nature.  But the reverse effect is also true.  So if you apply a voltage to a piezoelectric, it moves.  And so with THUNDER, if you apply like a voltage to it, it, it moves back and forth.  And so you can vary the frequency, the amount of movement, the strain that you got, based on how you drive it with electrical signals.  And so in this case, THUNDER moved a lot.  So it was one of these kinds of transducers that was an "A" link 'cause you could use it for applications that may, like ceramic piezoelectrics were, didn't strain enough to be useful in.  So it was enabling in that way.  And that's why it received the R and D 100 Award as one of the most innovative inventions of that year is because it opened up new possibilities for using these high-strain piezoelectrics.  Now, there were others, other people, other scientists working on other types of configurations, and there are some that are competing with it.  But this technology, THUNDER, got license to a couple of companies who, who started implementing it in some of their devices and systems.  I think Caterpillar licensed it.  A couple of other companies licensed it.  And it's actually in products that are being used today.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me just go back from this as a true layman 'cause I'm not a scientist.  So, just as you have a quartz watch, I guess, where you, a battery gives it a charge--
Speaker 2: A charge.
Speaker 1: --and it pulsates.
Speaker 2: It pulsates and it moves the hand, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a regular rate.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And so this THUNDER moves more--it just doesn't pulsate.  It moves, actually moves.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it moves, like you can actually, visibly see that strain, the movement with your eye, with the naked eye.  And a lot of piezoelectrics, you know, they move just a little bit, you know.  And so you'd have to, you know, magnify it to see that response.  Well, THUNDER wasn't like that.  It moves a lot.  And so you can have a lever that's moving several inches back and forth, depending on the configuration, how you, you know, what the geometry of the device is.
Speaker 1: So it's a plastic kind of material (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, in the case of THUNDER, it was a, it was a composite.  It had a plastic layer, and it has a ceramic layer, a very thin ceramic layer.  So, yes, it was kind of encapsulated in plastic which made it more durable than most ceramics 'cause most ceramics are brittle.  But because of the way we configured it with, with the polymer encapsulation, it wasn't as brittle.  So you had a lot more range of motion without breaking it.  So it was more durable.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when this stuff is given electrical charge, it moves.  You said, you can see it move.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Story_ID: 22907
Speaker 1: So what were the applications that, well, what was it used for?
Speaker 2: Oh, you can use those for a variety of, you know, well, we call 'em actuators.  So actuators get used in a lot of type--a lot of devices to translate a load, you know, in instrumentation, for instance.  Like all of these, you know, a lot of transducers are used in like medical equipment, to work all the mechanisms, in vehicles and systems like your, the pistons and things of that nature.  I think that's one of the applications that Caterpillar was interested in.  You know, it can drive things.  In addition, if you put a voltage on it, as I said before, I mean if you put a load on it, it gives you a voltage.  So you can use it as a sensor.  Say you have something that you wanna know how much weight was put on something.  This is a very elementary example.  But if you wanna know how much weight was impacted on something, if you have this piezoelectric, and you roll a load across it or force, it gives you an electrical signal.  And that signal is proportional to the weight that was on it.  So you can use it also as a sensor.  So that's what we call a sensor and actuator.  And NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], one of the things that they would be interested in that response would be like remember Columbia, and when it failed, some of the tiles, the shuttle tiles had been damaged because they had been impacted by ice.  And that damaged tiles.  And then when it, when the vehicle reentered, it couldn't handle the loads because it damaged the heat shield.  If we had something like these sensors in there, you would know how much impact was exerted on that heat shield or of those tiles, you know, you could measure that amount of force and know that, okay, this thing has sustained a significant amount of damage because it got hit by, with this, at this force.  So those types of sensor applications would be useful to NASA.  Now, this particular one was never used in that way, but I'm giving a hypothetical example of the kinds of things you can use these materials for, lots of robotic-type devices, articulating arms in Space.  One of the projects I worked on, they wanted actuators for something that sounds pretty trivial, but it was a big problem.  It was, they wanna to send these rovers, like a little robotic instrument, basically, it's an instrument on wheels.  And they wanted to send it to an asteroid.  And, but one of the problems is the asteroids and the moon and a lot of surfaces in Space are very dusty.  And so the lens on the robot was continually getting dirtied up or clouded up with the dust and stuff from the surface of the asteroid.  And so they needed like a low-power, lightweight windshield wiper.  And so they looked at these materials to serve as windshield wipers because, you know, anything you put in space, there's a big cost for putting it up there.  So you'll always have a weight penalty.  You want things to be lightweight.  You want things to be low power.  And in this case, these kinds of actuators were pretty low power, and they were plastic.  They were really lightweight.  You could make 'em really tiny, but they could keep that surface clean so you could get really expensive experiments, experimental data because now the optics were clear enough to see what was going on, on the surface.  So those kinds of things are very useful for, you know, a myriad of applications that NASA was interested in, and in the commercial market as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is an award-winning, so this is a--is this the biggest thing you worked on, you think, in the THUNDER [Thin Layer Composite Unimorph Piezoelectric Driver and Sensor] project?
Speaker 2: Probably--it was big, but probably not the biggest.  I think the most rewarding thing I've worked on was related to the area that we broadly call nano technology now.  And that was, nano technology is, is basically, seeing at the nano scale.  Nano is really, really small.  It's like, you can see a single atom.  So you think of, you know, all matter is made of atoms and molecules and things.  You can actually get down to the atomic scale and, and resolve and begin to move molecules.  And I work, I started, the capability or this whole area of nano technology was birthed about twenty years ago.  And so I was, you know, a scientist in the lab, doing research at that time, which is a great time to, in science, to be in that position.  And so I've done research in working with what we call carbon nano tubes, and you mentioned earlier, grapheme, things of that nature, that are nano scale element.  And we look at how you can now combine, if you can start moving one atom at a time, how you can move atoms to design materials that are, you know, you have a lot more control over what you can make.  You're not just in the lab mixing molecules.  You're now moving atoms at a time and developing new compositions of matter and structures and to engineer in the properties that you wanna see or you need in a given material.  And so this whole era of nano technology, I think has been, you know, it's, it's been a hay day in the scientific and engineering community.  We've done a lot in the past twenty years in this.  So I think that's the most exciting work I've done.
Story_ID: 22908
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's work you're current involved in, managing the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in part, you know.  I run, now, at the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, I run the low density materials program.  And so low density really, you're going towards low mass, you know, lightweight materials.  And so, yeah, so I look at, nano technology is a big part of that because, you know, if you can manipulate at the atomic level, you can design materials that are lightweight and low density and engineer and like I said, those properties that you need to see for various things.  And so my work there is, is more so with funding scientists, both here and abroad to do research that will, that is, that will lead to innovations and scientific discovery in this whole area to end up with new and improved low-density materials.  And so, yeah, that area is one that, that I kind of manage now.  I fund scientists at, primarily professors at universities, U.S. and some abroad.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in '98' [1998] you received an award from the National Technical Association as one of the minority women in science and engineering.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Then in '98' [1998], you received a special commendation for outstanding leadership and superior support of NASA, from the NASA Langley Research Centers Education and Outreach--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Program.  In '99' [1990], you were appointed chief of the Advanced Materials and Processing branch at--
Speaker 2: NASA.
Speaker 1: --NASA, right, yeah.  NASA Langley.  Now, is this the spot that Dr. St. Clair had before you?
Speaker 2: That was, yeah, that was, he was the branch chief.  He was the branch head.  And I think he retired in 2000 or '99' [1999], maybe, and then I was appointed as his successor to lead the organization, yes.
Story_ID: 22909
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you spoke earlier about what you learned from your parents in terms of how to deal with people and, you know, social IQ sorts of things.  I mean are these skills, I mean are they--can you pick them up if you don't (laughter) have them already or can somebody teach them to you later on if you don't really have 'em?
Speaker 2: I can't say that I'm an expert at that.  So I don't know to be quite honest.  But like I said, I think I mentioned earlier, out of all the training I've gotten, that training in the beauty shop and under my parents, you know, just watching them in action, has been the most valuable and this job, in particular, that you just brought up is a good example because when I was hired for that job, I was hired by a person by the name of Dr. Mark Short.  And there were several people that applied for the job, all of which were older and more experienced men who I would have thought would have gotten that job over me hands down based on the number of years they had been there and all the good work they had done.  So when I got the job, you know, I asked Dr. Short, "Wow, this is amazing.  You picked me, you know", kind of, you know, I was very unassuming about it.  And he said, "You know, Joycelyn, technically, you are very sharp.  You have all the training, all the, you know, you're sharp.  You can--you know your stuff", you know, that kind of thing.  He said, but what gave you the edge is, is your people skills.  We need a leader.  We need a person who can go in and work with the various personalities and, you know, lead the organization, you know.  It's that skill, I think, that distinguished me from the other people that I thought were probably, maybe even better qualified than me.  I don't know.  That's just my humble opinion.  So, but he told me, you know, no, you're just as good as anybody else in that regard.  But this is where you have the real edge.  And so, yeah, going back to my parents, you know, I told them after I got that job, I said, well, guess what, mom, you know.  You got me a job today.  And she said, what?  And I said, well, my boss told me it's because of the training I got in your beauty shop that I got (laughter) hired for this job.  And she just laughs, you know.  So, so anyway, I don't know if you can teach that.  But I got it there.
Speaker 1: Well, they try in management classes all the time, to teach people to do these things.  And I guess it's somewhat effective, but, you know, having a sense of it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before you even start is probably--
Speaker 2: I think so, I think so.  But, you know, it took me a while to understand that.  I didn't realize that, that that was something that was different early on.  I didn't know that.  I've been told that over the years, and that's how I started becoming aware.
Story_ID: 22910
Speaker 1: Okay.  Somewhere around this time, I think you received the Technology All Star Award from the National Women of Color at the National Women of Color Technology Awards Conference, I think--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I don't know when that was.  Do you have a date for that?  Do you know when that was?
Speaker 2: I have a date on the plague (laughter).  I don't know it right off to be honest.
Speaker 1: No, that's all right.  But, so how did you, you know, what were some of the challenges in managing these high-tech projects in a big organization like NASA?
Speaker 2: I think, okay, so what I found in managing people at that level is that we had like, we had like the brightest scientists and engineers.  So the people were really smart.  They were also very motivated.  So I think the challenge--they can do the science.  The challenge is managing the teams and making sure that people work together effectively.  And, you know, sometimes what comes along with that brightness can be egos.  And so, and I worked, I was the boss of people who were, you know, almost old enough to be my dad in some cases, you know, these older white men.  And I was, you know, you know, like one of maybe two African Americans in the organization.  And I was, and I ended up--and one of the youngest ones, and I was, ended up being the boss.  So navigating that and trying to understand the different personalities and their perspectives and earning their respect, I think was probably the most challenging.  But I think over time, that actually happened, you know, I earned the respect of those folks by, you know, you know, learning how to, you know, get in there and be honest and upfront when you know something and when you don't know something, be honest and upfront about that.  And I think over time, that really worked in my favor.  And I, so I think the most challenging part is managing the people.  It wasn't the science as much because I always like, I think one of the things that makes a good manager is hire people that are smarter than you.  So I like having people that know more than I know.  I always wanna learn from the people that worked for me.  And so I respect that.  And so I can contribute to the science, but I had the best people working, and I just needed to make sure that I made the environment such that they could thrive and that I had the resources there at their disposal and not, not have them bogged down with all the, you know, the nitpicky stuff.  Let them do their thing.  And I handle all the rest.  So that was kind of my philosophy.
Speaker 1: I know one theory in management is to stress out people and to pick with them to get better production.  Do you (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Now, I don't, I don't like, adhere to that.  I think when you have good people, they're already self-motivated.  Let them do their thing.  And I would try to make it as easy as possible, you know.  There's what I call bean counting, a lot of bean counting in the government, in particular, probably, and I would try to protect them from a lot of that.  I'd do it so they can do their thing.  And, you know, and, of course, you know, there were limits on that, but that's, that was part of my, my philosophy in management.
Speaker 1: So you wouldn't want a scientist to be focused on his per diem or something or something like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, although there're some things I can't do for them (laughter), per diem and travel and stuff like, you have to do yourself because there's an honesty aspect to you filing that this is actually true.  But everything, other things beyond that, like workforce deployment.  Who's paying for your time?  What projects, what programs, you know, within the agency?  There's a lot of that workforce aspect and programmatic that has to be done.  And you don't want, you know, top-notch scientists having to worry so much about all of that, you know.  As a manager, you know, you try to deploy them and let it be seamless for them.

Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2000, you received the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Exceptional Achievement Medal.  Now, this is a medal that Carl Sagan received, that--
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: --Gordon Cooper received, Allen Sheppard received.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is a big, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is, it is.  As a matter of fact, that's probably one of the things I'm really proud of because--and most people don't recognize it when they look at your resume or something.  They don't know the significance.  But a very small percentage, I'll avoid saying what that percentage is, but I think it's something like less than one percent of people that work for NASA ever get a NASA medal.  It comes from the headquarters level.  You know, it's at the highest agency level that you have to get, go through the competition and get approved to get one of these NASA medals.  And so very few people get them in their career.  And I actually got two in my tenure at NASA.  I received one Outstanding Technology Achievement medal and that was for my work with the smart materials in electroactives and, you know, piezoelectrics, all of those because I was, you know, at the beginning phases of helping to develop a program in that for NASA that actually ended up prospering and rising up and, you know, making solid contributions to the agency.  So that's why I got that medal.  But then several years later, after being the head of the Advanced Materials and Processing branch, I got another NASA medal.  And that was a medal for being an outstanding leader in my job as head of the, Chief of the Advanced Materials and Processing branch.  And so, my work there got recognized at higher levels and I got a second medal.  So I'm really proud of that, I think, probably more so than anything in my NASA career, that I was able to get two medals in the ten years or so that I worked there.  It's absolutely wonderful.
Speaker 1: I know we have one cited as being received in 2000.  When was the other?  When did you get the other one?
Speaker 2: So 2000 and then probably 2006, maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the leadership medal or 2007, somewhere along in there.  It was right before I left NASA, and I hadn't planned to leave.  And I know my superiors didn't think I was leaving either.  But I got that medal shortly after--before I left.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, 2006 it says here.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.  We did have it here, and I didn't know, I didn't look ahead.
Story_ID: 22912
Speaker 1: But so, now, during your time with NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], you had a lot of materials patented.  Do you wanna talk about some of those and maybe just summarize what--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think, and I don't know for sure, but I think I have about fifteen patents that are issued in the U.S. and then another, you know, maybe dozen that are international patents because, you know, science is global.  And so a lot of the work that we do here in the United States, you know, it's followed and picked up across the world.  And so I know my patents have been filed in, you know, other countries and have been licensed in, in South Korea, for sure.  I know that.  But so over the years, I worked--again, I started the work in electroactive polymers and then moved on to like composites with THUNDER actuators.  Then this whole area of nano technology, in the late '90's [1990s] I worked on trying to use carbon nano tubes to enhance the electroactive performance in polymers.  And so we were able to make significant improvements in properties by doping with these nano-structured materials to make composite electroactives.  So I have some patents related to that.  And then probably the most significant are patents that are related to how to effectively disperse carbon nano-tubes into polymers.  And so me, along with a large team of researchers at NASA, worked for several years on methods and the theory behind, the underlying theory, to explain how you can get these die poled interactions between nano-tubes and the matrix, a polymer matrix that would essentially render them more effectively dispersible in a, in a system, in a composite.  So that, that science was patented and licensed by a company in South Korea who has now implemented that into some of the products that they make.  And so, that's kind of rewarding as well, just when you see something you worked on was enabling to actually create a product that people buy and use and, hopefully, improves mankind's condition.  So that's, that was kind of, that's the span of the work that I've done that was patented.
Story_ID: 22913
Speaker 1: Okay, now, 2007, you left NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and you went over to the NSF [National Science Foundation].  Was it the Materials Processing and Manufacturing program, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah, so it wasn't exactly that I left NASA.  What I did was, I did what they call an interagency detail assignment.  So I was still a NASA employee.  But my husband had gotten a job in Northern Virginia in this Arlington, Virginia area.  And so we wanted the family to be--that was three hours from our home in Hampton [Virginia].  So we wanted our family to be together.  So, so I did, I talked to my bosses at NASA about the possibility of doing this detail assignment where I would go to the National Science Foundation for a year, broaden my, my understanding of how governmental agencies work.  And it was in an area that was also, you know, one that was, you know, my materials background, you know.  So I could see kind of what was going on in the academic environment, research environment and bring all that knowledge back to NASA.  And so I, I applied for this position at National Science Foundation.  And it was to be a program director for the Materials Processing and Manufacturing program.  And I was selected, and I did that for a year, and really liked it.  And then my family was, my husband wasn't gonna be moving back right away.  So I ended up extending that detail for another year.  And so I stayed at the NSF for two years.  And after that I realized that really his relocation here was probably gonna be more permanent than we thought.  Originally, we thought he would be moving back to Hampton.  But it turns out, some good things happened in his career.  So we stayed in this area.  So I resigned from NASA in 2009 and took a job at the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in 2009.  So I left one agency and, you know, the next day was hired by the next.
Story_ID: 22914
Speaker 1: Okay, 2009, this is the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in Arlington.  That's, so, well, tell how you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, yeah, I, I was hired by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research in Arlington, Virginia right after, well, before I left NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] I was offered a job there.  And at AFOSR [Air Force Office of Scientific Research] which is what we call it, Air Force Office of Scientific Research, I, I'm a program manager.  I run the low density materials program.  And what we do at AFOSR is fund fundamental research.  We fund discovery in all areas of relevance to the Air Force.  And so that is, you know, aerospace systems, cyber systems, you know, computer systems as well.  And so I, I work in the aerospace chemical and material sciences directorate and interface with scientist and professors all around the country that do things that will add to our discovery and understanding of the fundamentals of lightweight materials, low-density materials.  So, and the way I do that is by, I attend a lot of conferences.  I interface with a lot of professors and try to understand what their latest and greatest emerging research is, understand that, and understand how that can impact the technologies of the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are low-density materials, just for the listeners?
Speaker 2: So when you think of low density, you think of, you know, density is mass over volume.  So you think of low mass, lightweight materials.  So, you know, any time you have a system that rises above the ground, okay, and whether that's an aircraft or helicopter, a spacecraft, anything that has to be launched into space like satellite systems, you want them to be as lightweight as possible because there's a penalty, the weight penalty when you have to carry them over distances, particularly, lifting them into space or into the atmosphere.  And so my job is, you know, look at how can we decrease the mass, lightweight, in many of the structures and the systems that the Air Force works with.  And what is the science that can enable continued radical, you know, what we call transformational improvements in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 2010, you were working with the department, as a Department of Defense liaison for the National Academy Study on Structural Light Weighting.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is a part of the job at the Air Force?
Speaker 2: This is part of my job, yeah, exactly.  So what the National Academies does is, they're kind of like the unbiased arm of the government that launches studies to, you know, in a variety of science and engineering areas that kind of do fact checking, and, you know, can address where we are as a country, as a nation and how we compete, compete or stand up against other countries in certain areas or what needs to be done in certain areas.  And so this is a study that was launched by the Department of the Defense or commissioned through the Department of Defense to the National Academies to look at light-weighting of military vehicles, military systems.  And so it included naval vessels, air, aircraft and spacecraft and also Army systems, tanks and things of that nature.  And so my job, through part of the Reliance twenty-one which is an interagency DOD [Department of Defense], tri-service board, was to work with that committee.  I helped to nominate the members of the committee and work with them to, as they studied.  It's, the members of the committee were all from academia and industry.  They're non-governmental, but I was the government liaison to assist them as needed in trying to understand military systems.  And they did the study on how light-weighting can impact that, and what needs to be done in the future in that area.
Story_ID: 22915
Speaker 1: Okay, now, also in 2010, you authored, I guess an article called "Nano Fabrication of Tunable 3-D Nano Tube Architectures".
Speaker 2: Well, okay, so that, that's--it's not a publication.  It, that was a MUIRI, what we call a MUIRI which stands for Multi-University Research--let me see, Multi-University Interdisciplinary Research Initiative.  And basically, these MUIRI's are targeting interdisciplinary research university teams.  And so the MUIRI that I sponsored, it's kind of a, not a competition, but we put forth, program managers put forth MUIRI and they get down selected.  And a few of them are awarded every year.  And so this one was awarded for me, to me a few, in 2010, I guess it was.  And so I solicited teams that could do research in this area, multi-disciplinary teams, and we had two big awards.  And so I have a team of about twelve professors at universities across the country that are doing research in this area to try to develop the next class of, of three-dimensional nano-structured materials.  So that, that's what that was about.  It wasn't a paper as much as it was a topic that I got, that I wrote, and it was adopted.  And as a result, it resulted in like a $15 million investment by the DOD [Department of Defense] in this area of research.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you basically chose a topic, and you formed a team and managed the team's development around this, I mean work around this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I developed the topic, and then we put out what we call a broad agency announcement.  And teams kind of self formulate and propose.  They write proposals to say what can they do in this research area.  And then I'm in charge of, yeah, deciding which teams to select.  And, of course, we have a review board that helps in that regard.  And then I made recommendations as to what teams we should fund.  And each team gets, you know, about $1.5 million a year for the next five years to do this research.  And in that five-year period, yes, I actively engage in managing and overseeing and understanding what the science is that they're doing and how it, kind of steering it to make sure that it stays relevant to what the Air Force needs.
Story_ID: 22916
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, and well, just kind of, I guess, bring us up to date now, you know, in terms of what you're doing.  I guess that'd probably be the best way to do it 'cause we have things here that, I don't know if they're really relevant or not.  But just, yeah, you can--
Speaker 2: Bring me up to date.
Speaker 1: --from 2010, from this, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, okay, from 2010 to 2012, I've been doing much of the same (laughter).  So my program is, and it's continuing to progress.  And we are, primarily, the newest area that I'm involved in is trying to really advance the state of the art in terms of composites.  So it goes back to the kind of things that I did early on in my graduate career, but now, in addition to just regular carbon fiber reinforced composites, we're looking at what we call nano-composites.  And so we're looking at how do you integrate nano technology to improve composites, to make them even stronger and even more lightweight than traditionally composites are.  And so I've just in the past several months, I think back in April, sponsored a workshop at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology] in Atlanta [Georgia] where we invited leaders from the academic community and also companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin and others to come.  And we really kind of set the stage and laid the groundwork for what needs to happen in this whole area of nano-technology and nano-composites to improve the state-of-the-art to get these nano materials onto Air Force systems or aerospace systems in the next, you know, twenty years.  And so, so I think I'm, I've leading, a leading impetus in that area to try to really stimulate and direct research and funds to achieving that goal.  And so, that's what I plan to dedicate a lot of time to in the future, in the next several years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you're also involved with the Historically Black Colleges and Universities program.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, throughout my career, I've been really involved and, you know, very aware of, to, you know, very, I guess I'd say committed to working with HBCUs and other minority-serving institutions, you know, because I think that, in particular, because of my background, you know, I can be a, you know, a role model there.  You know, I mentioned before that your role models always don't look like you.  But sometimes they do.  And so I like to be there and be accessible and available.  So I, you know, I do try to keep a presence, and probably in the past several years more so, even--well, I've worked a lot with, in the black community, but--in the African American community, I should say, but even in the Hispanic community, I think during my time as NSF [National Science Foundation], a lot of women, Hispanic women, young professors came to me.  And so, since then I've been involved in, like the Hispanic Society of Engineering and speaking and helping to do workshops on how to write good proposals, how to get research funding from, you know, different agencies, and so I've kind of taken on a role as a mentor to several young women professors in particular, to help them navigate their careers.  So I've done that with African Americans, but also more recently, with Hispanic women primarily.  And so, that's, that's been rewarding.
Story_ID: 22917
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you rose rather quickly to a position of management, of top management, and, you know, people might look at that and say, well, now, we're in the post-racial era in science and engineering.  Now, it doesn't matter.  Black women can just get involved.  Anybody can get involved and rise.  There's no glass ceiling.  I mean how do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I disagree.  I don't think we're post-racial in society.  I still think that, it depends on where you are, but there are still many, many obstacles, some imposed intentionally I think to kind of minimize your, your ascent, the ascent of African Americans and others.  So, you know, I think I've been just very fortunate, in particular, when I was at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], to work for Dr. [Terry] St. Clair.  You know, I think what you need, very often, is a mentor and an advocate.  You know, sometimes when you have an advocate, someone that's well above you but that kind of puts in a word for you, and I think that's what Dr. St. Clair did for me.  And so you said my trajectory was pretty, my ascent was pretty quick.  And I attribute a lot of that to him because, you know, I was prepared perhaps, but, you know, the doors would not have opened just based on my preparation alone.  I think the doors were opened because I had someone that, you know, would say my name in the, in the board room, and who would, you know, say, hey, you know, she should be promoted or she can do this job.  And that gave me opportunities, and then the job was for me to respond once I got there.  And, fortunately, by the grace of God, I've been able to do that fairly well.  But I don't say that, that we're in a post-racial society.  We're not, in my opinion.  I think race still matters a lot in a lot of environments, and I hope that changes for the sake of my children.  But, you know, it's--we're not quite there yet.
Story_ID: 22918
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that leads to another question that's always asked, I guess, in public events probably.  How do you balance family with your career?
Speaker 2: That's, that is a challenge.  I had, I get a lot of help (laughter) is the, is the basic answer I have to that.  And I married well.  I have a wonderful husband, and he's good.  He can do everything I do with the kids for the most part.  And we, we planned it that way when, from, when they were first born.  It's like you have to know how to do everything I do because sometimes I'm not gonna be here, and you have to do it.  So, so I have a good husband, and, but then also we get help.  And so we have, when I travel quite a bit for the job that I have now, so when, I travel, you know, we have someone that cooks and that helps my daughters with their homework if they need it, and, you know, makes sure that things don't fall through the cracks.  And then I have to plan a lot.  So, so the balance is tough.  It's tough for, for, I won't even say women now because there are a lot more proactive men nowadays that are being, a lot more engaged in their family activities.  So it's tough for anyone who has that as a prime responsibility, to manage family and work.  But it's doable.  It's, it's doable, and you don't always, you know, you make sacrifices.  I think I've made sacrifices in my career to be the kind of wife and mother I want to be.  There's some things I won't do, and I don't care if it, you know, has an adverse impact because, you know, other--I had opportunities to, to become SES [Senior Executive Service] within the government when I was at NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], to go to the SES training program.  But I had recently had a baby, and it would have required me to go away to a training program for an extended period of time, several weeks.  I couldn't do that.  I wouldn't.  So that opportunity kind of got by me.  But that's okay because I think, you know, you have to make choices in life, and you do that.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the SES?
Speaker 2: SES is the highest level in, within the government, Senior Executive Service, and so, you know, that's where, you know, all the top management level within the government are SES'ers.  And I'm sure I'll still become an SES'er at some point.  But at that point, it just, the timing did not, was not consistent with my family commitment.
Story_ID: 22919
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us something about your family.  How did you meet your husband and tell us about your children?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Wow, let me figure out the short version of how I met my husband.
Speaker 1: How and when?
Speaker 2: So I met my husband when I was working in NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].  I was, I guess I was still a post-doc when I met him.  And it was, it was interesting because I was, I had met him through some friends, friends of mine that were attending church with me.  And his, the, my husband happened to work with the husband in this couple that we met.  And my, my, my friend was at work saying, talking about me, basically saying that his wife, Laura, was trying to hook me up with his best friend, and that his wife, when she gets on these matchmaking crazes, it just annoys him, you know, 'cause she gets, her mind's determined, she determined that she's gonna hook her friend Joycelyn up with my friend.  And so, so my husband said, well, who's, who's this girl that Laura's trying to hook up.  And he told him a little bit about me.  He said my name and he said, you know, he told him just a little bit about me.  So my husband made the comment, said, well, if it doesn't work out with your friend, I'd like to meet her.  She sounds nice.  So that's how it happened.  My, his friend, Brad, didn't give him my full name and wouldn't give him my number because the wife was dead set on me getting with this other guy who I didn't like.  But anyway, the long story is that my husband, he knew that I worked at NASA.  He knew my first name, and he knew that I had a PhD.  Those were the only things he knew about me.  And so he got a NASA phone back--back then we still had paper phone books.  And he said, every day or, you know, periodically, he looked through the phone book for a lady named Joycelyn.  And my last name was Simpson at the time, so he went through a lot of names.  The phone book had like four or 5,000 names in it.  And he went through a lot of names, and he eventually found me.  And so he called me at work one day, and when he called me--no, he, he, no, he didn't.  He, he got my last name, and then he looked me up, and he got my number at home.  And he called me one day.  And that's how I met him 'cause his friend wouldn't give him my number.  But he said, I'm gonna find her anyway.  So he found me, and that's his story.  He likes to, he tells our daughters, you know, let, let the man find you because when they find you and they work hard to find you, then they'll treat you right (laughter).  So that's how we got, that's how we met.  And we dated for several years, and then we married.  And now we have two daughters, Kayla, Kayla Joy and then Kyra, Kyra Joy.  And they are nine and twelve now.  Oh, and I should mention my husband's name is Catlet, Catlet Nathaniel Harrison.  So that was a clue, 'cause he has the same name as my father [Charles Nathaniel Simpson], same middle name as my dad.  So I liked that.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, Nathaniel, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nathaniel.
Story_ID: 22920
Speaker 1: All right, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm concerned with education.  I really think that we've gotten away from what my parents always told us and what, you know, was always stressed in the community, that, you know, the way up and out is through a good education.  And they, you know, our parents used to always tell us, you had to be twice as good as the next person to succeed.  And so always work hard and always do your best.  And, you know, I just feel like education is, is not stressed in our community the way it used to be and that, you know, kids are not understanding the value that a good education brings.  And so I, I'm, that is one of my concerns about the African American community, is just that it's not so cool to be smart anymore and excel academically and that's a problem.  That's probably my biggest concern.  Yeah, that's it.
Story_ID: 22921
Speaker 1: Okay, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Wow, you know, I'm sure there are.  I can't point to anything.  You know, in retrospect, I think I'm in the wrong field for my personality (laughter).  I probably should have been a, you know, something social, you know, like one of the social sciences based on the things that I think I have an affinity for and that I love doing.  But I find myself, even in the scientific community, being the one that people come to for counseling, being the one that, you know, people feel like they can talk to.  So maybe I'm, I'm meant to be where I am and with, you know, this other skill set.  But, so sometimes I think, you know, like you should have been something different.  You probably shouldn't have gone into science and engineering or at least, not the hard science, maybe social sciences.  So.
Speaker 1: I know you mentioned a couple of times that you liked your English teachers and they taught you a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, what would you be if you weren't a chemical engineer?
Speaker 2: Well, I really can't say that I know for sure.  Perhaps, I don't know, something in the social scientists, something helping people.  So, like now, I try to make, try to see--like the things that motivate me about my work now are when I can help people, you know, like I said, mentoring people, knowing that the research I do can improve a product that, that helps people.  You know, if I know my actuator is in a medical instrument that, you know, or MRI, that's, you know, moving something, that, you know, helps people, that's the thing that I think makes me feel good and that motivate me.  So I don't really know.  I can't say 'cause I haven't speculated on what I would be if I weren't--you know, sometimes I think I would have been a physician.  But, you know, that's not a social science either.  So I don't know for sure, to be honest.
Story_ID: 22922
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, we always ask this question too.  What today, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy is that, you know, I've tried to live a honest, you know, I'm a Christian, so honest, Christian life and help people do good work and hopefully, raise good children good--I'd like to see my, you know, my daughters grow up to be good contributing members of society.  And so I guess my legacy is a combination of who I am.  It's just, you know, being, doing the best that I can in all that I do and hopefully, that having impacted society for the good.  That's hard for me to do 'cause you don't often think of your legacy.  You know, I don't, I don't think of my legacy 'cause I think of your legacy is kind of like when you're gone.  And I'm not trying to go anywhere any time soon (laughter).  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there anything we haven't talked about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we've covered a lot of bases.  I can't think of anything right off that we haven't spoken about.  No.
Story_ID: 22923
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, how would I like to be remembered?  Oh, okay, I didn't think about that either.  Again, I'd like to not think about, being remembered, like leaving here.  But it's probably kind of tied up in what I was trying to say about legacy.  I, I'd like to be remembered as a good person who gave it her, you know, gave it my all, and whether that was science or working in the community or the church or with raising my children and, you know, creating my family, you know, that did her, you know, that I did my best and I made contributions over a pretty broad spectrum within the community.  And, you know, one of the things that I love about my mother is that, and she taught me this, is that she's not a respecter of persons.  This is what she would always say.  And I really didn't understand what she meant.  But she used to say, you can't be a respecter of persons.  And what she meant is that you treat the doctor, lawyer, judge, scientist, you treat, you know, everyone the same.  And so, you know, in our neighborhood, there might be the neighborhood drunk or the, you know, kind of like the bum or the yardman or the garbage, she treated everybody the same, you know.  It was, it was cordial, it was kind, it was, you know, she offered them food, you know.  She would just--everyone the same.  And I really love that about my mother.  And so I think it taught me to, you know, just treat everyone the way you want to be treated.  And so I'd like to be remembered as a person like that, you know, because I run in circles sometimes where they're pretty prominent people.  But, you know, I try to treat maybe not-so-prominent people the same way, you know, just treat all people nicely.  So that's important to me.
