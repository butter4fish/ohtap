Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Rachel B. Keith [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith], R-A-C-H-E-L, B, K-E-I-T-H.  The B is for Boone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's your maiden name, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have another middle name at one point?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh my, I had Hannah and Celestine.  Now, there was a little bit of a discussion as to what my middle names would be.  My father [Clinton Boone] insisted my middle names would be Hannah and Charlotte.  My mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] insisted Hannah and Celestine.  Now, Charlotte was my father's mother [Charlotte Chavis Boone].  Celestine was a woman in our church who had been very helpful in the missionary effort, sending over clothes, sending over supplies.  And my mother thought that she should be rewarded, since everyone felt that I would be the last child.  So, just to not have too much confusion, I always use Boone as a middle name.  It is my maiden name, but I use it as a middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us, do you have any nicknames or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I've always been called Rachel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have--oh, can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Really (laughter)?
Speaker 1: This is for history.  So, this is--
Speaker 2: I was born May 30, 1924, and I was born in Monrovia, Liberia, Africa.
Speaker 1: All right.  And Ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a physician.
Speaker 1: All right.  And any particular branch of medicine that you specialize in?
Speaker 2: I specialize in internal medicine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, today is January 21st, 2005.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At my home in Detroit, Michigan.
Story_ID: 303685
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions, five lightweight questions that we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, ma'am, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Um, that's a tough one.  I probably have to say peach cobbler.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, something like, that's all right, or we'll make it.
Story_ID: 303686
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about your family history first.  And I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Clinton Boone] side of the family.  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Rachel Ellen Tharps Boone. T-H-A-R-P-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  Now, she was fifty-four when she died in 1938.  Her place of birth, Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your family tree on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: I only know my grandmother [Hannah Tharps].  I never knew my grandfather [William Tharps].  I never knew any of the other relatives except my mother's sister, Bessie [Tharps]; her sister Mary [Tharps]; and her brother, Fred [Frederick Tharps].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories in the family about the ancestors or anything, or where the family came from?
Speaker 2: I don't know too much about my mother's side.  I know they were very staunch church people.  But somebody was a Cherokee Indian [Native American].  I just heard that. I don't know exactly which--that may have been on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So are they, so they're--are they mostly from the Virginia area?
Speaker 2: Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hanover County, Goochland County, Louisa County in Virginia, that's where my mother's people came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's the rural places around Richmond, near Richmond?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 303687
Speaker 1: Well, what was your [maternal] grandmother [Hannah Tharps] like?  What did she do for a living?  What was she like?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker, as far as I know.  And the thing I remember about her is Sunday morning breakfast, fried fish and hot rolls, the best hot rolls you ever tasted (laughter).  And of course, I remember hearing her pray, and I was very much impressed.  At the time that we came back from Monrovia, Liberia, I was two years old.  And I have to tell you this little incident, because it's the first thing I really remember.  And that was being on a big steamer pulling into the harbor.  I think this was in New York [New York].  And I was wearing a white angora cap that my father [Clinton Boone] had given to me.  And it was very windy, and the wind took this cap and blew it overboard.  And I started running after my cap, and it was all my father could do to keep me from getting over that board to get my cap.  That was one of my first recollections of the United States. Actually, it is the first recollection.  And I remember we lived at that time, since we'd just come over from Monrovia, we lived with my grandmother.  And we stayed there until my father decided we should move over to the south side of Richmond [Virginia], but it was when I was living with my grandmother that I first saw snow, I'd never seen snow before.  And I remember running in and telling my mother [Rachel Tharps Boone], mother, come look.  There're chicken feathers coming through the, coming down from the sky.  And she explained to me what it was, and that was my first encounter with snow.
Story_ID: 303688
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] talk about growing up in Richmond [Virginia], and what it was like when she grew up?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember she was a singer, and she talked about singing.  I think it was in First African Baptist Church in Richmond.  And then she talked about after high school going to college at Hartshorn Memorial College [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], that's H-A-R-T-S-H-O-R-N Memorial College.  Now, that was connected with Virginia University [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].  That was the women's portion at that time.  And of course, it's not there any longer.  But that's how we got the connection with Miss Mary Tefft, T-E-F-F-T, who was a teacher at Hartshorn, and became very interested in our family.  And she was so interested in my mother's sister, Bessie [Tharps], that she took her up to Rhode Island to live with her after she retired.
Story_ID: 303689
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Clinton Caldwell Boone.  Caldwell, C-A-L-D-W-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, Caldwell, okay, all right.  And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Cofield, North Carolina.  The date of birth would have been about three years before my mother [Rachel Tharps Boone].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, okay.  And was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He would have been about fifty-seven or so when he died.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he died right behind your mother, almost the same--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My mother died in 1938, and my father died in 1939.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was a couple of years older than your mother, is what you're saying, right?
Speaker 2: Older than--?
Speaker 1: He's a couple years older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I don't have the exact dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think, from what I'm--yeah, 1884 I guess would be the date after your mother's birthdate.
Speaker 2: That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And your father was born probably in--
Speaker 2: In 1882 [sic. 1872].
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighty-two [1882], yeah.  Okay.  Well, what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back--I know you can trace them back a little further.  But tell us about your father's side of the family and where they come from.
Speaker 2: Well, they are from Cofield, Winston-Salem [North Carolina], Raleigh [North Carolina], Ahoskie [North Carolina], and Durham, North Carolina.  Of course, they've grown up and scattered across the country.  And I think at our last family reunion, we had almost two hundred people from all over the country.  And I believe it was on my father's side of the family, somebody was a Native American.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably Cherokee, and that's all I have heard from the family members.  And as you know, so much of that history is not available now, because people have passed on with the family history.  Questions you want to ask now have gone unanswered.
Story_ID: 303690
Speaker 1: From what I read, you can trace your family history back to Lemuel Boone?
Speaker 2: Lemuel Washington Boone, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He's the patriarch.  He had thirteen children, of which my father [Clinton Boone] was the eleventh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Lemuel Washington Boone was born around 1857, is that what it was that I saw?  I think that's it.
Speaker 2: I think that's, I think that's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1856, yeah.  No, no, it's further back than that.  Let's see, wait a minute.  Yeah, somewhere in the 1850s.  There's not an exact date here, but I know he had a, I guess his son is Isiah Boone?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Isiah Boone was born in 1856.  So, you have to suppose that Lemuel Washington Boone was born in the 1820s I guess, maybe?  It seems like a good guess, anyway.
Speaker 2: I don't know, actually.  They did find the tombstone from Lemuel Washington Boone.  And they cleaned it up and designated a plot down there in, I think its Ahoskie, North Carolina, for him.  So, if we could see that picture, we probably could tell some of the dates, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your father's father was Clinton C. Boone, Sr.?  Was that your father's father?
Speaker 2: Clinton C. Boone, Sr. was my father.
Speaker 1: He was your father.  Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And my brother is Clinton C. Boone, Jr.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: And he, his son is Clinton C. Boone, III.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I knew that sounded close (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the date on this document I'm looking at here says Clinton C. Boone, Sr. was born in 1872, it says here.  And, right, okay--
Speaker 2: That's right then.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  So, it's ten years earlier than what we thought a few minutes ago.  Okay, so, but, well, tell us, did he talk about growing up, and what life was like for him when he grew up?
Speaker 2: I don't remember him talking very much about it.  He talked more about Africa and the tribes there.  He'd been a missionary for twenty-five years, and I never heard him talk about his youth, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how he became a missionary?  Did he talk about that?
Speaker 2: I think he outlines that in his book ['Liberia As I Know It,' Clinton Caldwell Boone].  He was a minister, and he became a member of the Lott Carey Foreign Mission Society [Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention].  And from there, he decided to go to the mission field.  He also was involved with the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society [American Baptist International Ministries].  And he went over, and then he came back to the United States and went to medical school at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  He went back and he was in medical missionary, and then he came back later on and took dentistry, and went back again.  My mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] was only there for about six years.
Story_ID: 303691
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] and father [Clinton Boone] met?  Did they talk about how they met at all?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know.  I've never heard that.  I never heard them talk about it.
Speaker 1: So, but she went over [to Liberia], what, about 1918 or so, I guess, about six years before you were born?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--or it would have been, actually it would have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My brother [Clinton Boone, Jr.] was seven when we came over, and I was five.  So, she must have gone about 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  Well, your father wrote two books, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of those books?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He wrote 'Congo As I Saw It' [Clinton Caldwell Boone] and 'Liberia As I Know It' [Clinton Caldwell Boone]. They were published in 1929 [sic. 'Congo As I Saw It,' 1927].
Speaker 1: They were both published in the same year?
Speaker 2: Would you like me to check that?
Speaker 1: No, not right now.  But, you know--
Speaker 2: It's over there, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Well, we have the names, but you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We have the names of both of them, so it's all right.  So, 'Congo As I Saw It,' and 'Liberia As I Know It.'
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, these books are being republished now, you said?  You and your brother are republishing them?
Speaker 2: Yes, we're in the process now of getting them republished.  They should be ready in about a month or so.  I just talked to the publisher last week, and she assured me that--well, what we're waiting for is the registration with the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.].  As soon as that comes through, then we'll be able to publish.
Story_ID: 303692
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your parents [Rachel Tharps Boone and Clinton Boone]?  What kind of personalities did they have?  And what were they like?  What did they do?
Speaker 2: My mother was a schoolteacher, and she was an excellent one.  She taught over in Liberia.  And in the book I believe there's a copy of, a picture of her with her students over there in Monrovia [Liberia].  She was very congenial, docile, flexible, yet very strong, and a good Christian.  And I always, I always admired her long, beautiful, wavy, hair.  And she was a very good singer, and my best memories of her are at the piano and singing.  And to this day, I get choked up whenever I hear, 'God Be With You Till we Meet Again,' because that was the last thing that I remember her playing.  And I don't remember her playing anything else after that.  She contracted tuberculosis and she died in 1938.  But in Richmond [Virginia] she was a teacher, an elementary school teacher at Dunbar Public School [Dunbar School; James H. Blackwell Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia] over on the south side of Richmond.  Now, my father was a silver-tonged orator, he could really preach.  And his descriptions were so vivid that you felt you were right there.  You know how some people can just transport you into the scene where they'd like to have you?  My father could do that.  But he could also shout, I mean he was a tremendous minister.  (Laughter) You know, from him--I remember him starting off very slow, you could hardly hear what he's saying; you'd have to hang on to every word.  And then he builds it up to a pitch, and he has you.  He was very, very, strong, extremely stubborn.  My father was--
Speaker 1: Was he very strict?
Speaker 2: Not with us.  I don't ever remember, I don't ever remember him being strict.  We were disciplined, he would discipline us.  But I always tried to be obedient and good.  I tell you, I was never there when any whipping was given out.  (Laughter).  That was not me at all.  But to my brother, yes. Oh yes.
Speaker 1: So, was it just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Just the two of us.
Speaker 1: You and your brother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, my brother is two years older than I.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He's C.C. Boone, Jr. [Clinton Boone, Jr.], right? Or?
Speaker 2: That's right, he's junior.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I don't remember too much else about my father.  When my mother died, I went to live with my Aunt Bessie [Tharps].  And I would see my father when he came to visit, but I went to live with her because it was more convenient for me going to school.
Story_ID: 303693
Speaker 1: Just one more thing about your father [Clinton Boone].  He was in Congo [Belgian Congo; Democratic Republic of the Congo], first, right, before he went to Liberia?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  He was in the Congo first, and his first wife, Eva Coles-Boone, was with him for about a little over a year.  But she succumbed from a, what we believe was a snake bite and subsequent fever.
Speaker 1: Well, this was around 1901 or so?
Speaker 2: Nineteen o-one [1901], 190--
Speaker 1: And she died in 1902 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She sailed in 1901, and she died in 1902.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let me ask you about--now, you already told us what your first childhood memory was, one of your earliest childhood memories, about coming over on the ship and you were losing your hat.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But do you have any memories of Liberia at all?
Speaker 2: None at all.  When we went back there in the end of the 1970s, I did see the church that my father had helped to establish.  And we actually met some of the people who were there that remembered him.  But I didn't know, I didn't remember any of the surroundings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We went to, we went to a law conference in the Ivory Coast.  Then from there we went to Monrovia [Liberia], and we met Mrs. Tubman [Antoinette Tubman], former President Tubman's [William Tubman] wife.  But I, unfortunately, just didn't remember; I don't remember any of that.  Like I said, maybe my brother [Clinton Boone, Jr.] may remember a little bit more.  But I was two when I came over, so I don't remember anything else.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about growing up.  What, where did you live in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: We lived on 5th Street, not too far from the church [Fifth Street Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia] there.  And--
Speaker 1: Oh, what was the name of your father's church? Of the church you attended?
Speaker 2: In Liberia?
Speaker 1: Well, it would be good to know that one too, but I was talking about Richmond.  But give us both.
Speaker 2: In Liberia, he was head of the Providence Baptist Church [Monrovia, Liberia].  And we lived on 5th Street, not far from the Fifth Street Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember--of course, my father did a lot of speaking when he came back as a missionary.  And my brother and I were always introduced as the little boy and girl born in Liberia.  And we had been taught a song in Zulu, 'Come to Jesus,' and we would sing that.
Speaker 1: Can you sing it now?
Speaker 2: (Singing in Zulu) "Come to Jesus just now."  And we used to sing that, and that was the unique part of the ceremony.
Speaker 1: You say that was in Zulu?
Speaker 2: That's what I was told.
Speaker 1: That seems odd that it would be in Zulu if you were in Liberia.  That's not a Liberian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was in one of the dialects.  Now, my father knew twenty-five of the dialects.  And I'm not certain just which one it is, probably some African scholar can tell us that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is it, I know that there's the Gio and the Kru, and a lot of different groups in Liberia.  That aren't as well known over here as some of the other African groups, but I'm glad you sung the song, because we (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  (Speaking Zulu) Find out what dialect that is.  Maybe somebody from over there can tell us.  But that's what we sang (laughter).
Story_ID: 303694
Speaker 1: So, were you popular as a little girl singing these songs in church [Fifth Street Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Oh, look at that picture of us, my brother [Clinton Boone, Jr.] and myself.  Yeah, everybody made a big fuss over us, yes.  (Laughter) We were a curiosity of some kind, I'm not sure.  But they made a big fuss over us, yeah.  The only other thing I remember growing up, let's see.  My piano lessons, I took them very seriously.  And I had to go on 4th Street to a Mrs. Olivia C. Bolden.  And I don't know if you know about the houses in Richmond [Virginia].  But the steps can be very, very, steep on the front of the houses, and I remember going up those steep steps.  And then having her as a teacher, if you struck a wrong note, she had the pencil and she would crack your knuckles.  "No, no, you know that's not right."  (Laughter) But I always admired her marimba.  And I thought, oh, my, I would love to play that marimba.  And I even think of it now.  I say, you know, if I want to do something besides amuse myself playing piano--which is all that I do, because I did take a minor in music when I was in college [Houghton College, Houghton, New York].  But I didn't go any farther with it.  But I always thought, well maybe I might like to try marimba.  The only problem is it's such a great big instrument.  You have to have a half of a wall to put it in.
Speaker 1: Now, what is a marimba?  What, can you explain what it is?
Speaker 2: You know, a xylophone?  It's a big, oversized xylophone with all of those pipes.  And you just take these--
Speaker 1: Mallets or something?
Speaker 2: Mallets.
Speaker 1: Mallets.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, mallets.
Speaker 1: And are they made out of rosewood?  Are those the rosewood like xylophones that you see, like from Africa with the gourds underneath them?
Speaker 2: No, these are metal.  And the mallets are cushions, like--
Speaker 1: Rubber ends on them.
Speaker 2: Leather, or--
Speaker 1: Padded mallets, like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're, they're padded, like miniature pillows.
Story_ID: 303695
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Pig feet.  We used to have these church suppers, and we always had pig feet.  I used to like pig feet.  And as I said previously, I used to like sour pickles.  And the corner store, just a little grocery store, had a big gallon jar of sour pickles.  And he would cut them into about ten long slices.  And I'd get a long slice for a penny, and then go back and get another long slice.  That was about all I could handle.  But I liked that.  And I liked to roller skate.  I liked dodge ball, oh, was I good at dodge ball.  I was small and I was quick, and it was hard to catch me.  And I enjoyed that.  And of course, I liked jump rope and the usual things that kids like.
Story_ID: 303696
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little kid, as a little girl?
Speaker 2: You mean how did I look?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess how did you look, but how, more importantly, how did you act?  And how did you, what did you like to do?  And what was your attitude, your disposition?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I was very introverted.  If I could get ahold of a book, I would read it.  And if I got ahold of another book, I would read that.  I just kept on reading books.  I had a thirst for knowledge; I couldn't get enough of the books.  I did not do as much actual playing or partying as some of the youngsters did.  I don't ever remember an actual birthday party for me.  My parents [Rachel Tharps Boone and Clinton Boone] were not financially well-off.  They, we were not exactly poor, but almost poor.  My father would get five dollars for each sermon.  And of course, you could get on a bus for ten cents, and a nickel would buy a few things.  But I remember well the Great Depression.  I remember standing in soup lines and bread lines with my father, and oftentimes I was hungry.  I remember one time there was nothing in the house but oranges and hot chocolate.  And I was so hungry that I just kept on eating and kept on eating, until I was literally sick.  And to this day, I don't like hot chocolate. I'd just been conditioned to it.  I keep thinking each time I see somebody with hot chocolate, I remember how hungry I was at that time.  But we made out, we made out.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a sense that you were growing up during the Depression?  I just want to, I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --now going back to that time when they said it was the Great Depression, did you know it at that time?
Speaker 2: I knew it was a depression, yes, I certainly did.  And I remember the WPC was it?
Speaker 1: WPA [Works Progress Administration].
Speaker 2: WPA and the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps].  And I remember how hard it was for people to find jobs.  And I remember there was no meat.  It was just a terrible time at that time.  I remember--and every time I hear the word depression or recession, (laughter) I can remember back to 1929.  I do remember that.
Story_ID: 303697
Speaker 1: What school did you attend in Richmond [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Dunbar Elementary School [Dunbar School; James H. Blackwell Elementary School, Richmond, Virginia].  And from there, I went to Armstrong High School [Richmond, Virginia].  By that time we had moved from the south side to the north side of Richmond.
Speaker 1: Now Dunbar High School, of course, was named for Paul Laurence Dunbar, of course.
Speaker 2: It was Dunbar Elementary.
Speaker 1: Elementary school, okay.  And Armstrong High School, that's named for the same Armstrong [Samuel C. Armstrong] in Washington, D.C., isn't it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: There's a famous Armstrong School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Armstrong Manual Training School] in D.C (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, I'm quite sure that's true.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us about Dunbar High School.  Did you like school when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved it, I loved it.  And I especially liked my second grade teacher, Miss Dabney [ph.].  She was so efficient, oh, my.  She was well-trained, and she was brilliant.  And I thought, oh, my, she'd be a good one to be like.  And of course at that time the role models were all schoolteachers, educators.  And it never dawned on me to even think about anything else, until I was in my junior year in college [Houghton College, Houghton, New York].  I had majored in social science and history.  And I thought maybe I would specialize in black history, but they didn't have any of those, they didn't have any of those classes at the college where I was.  So, I felt, well, maybe social science would be good enough.  But then in my junior year, I thought well, I want to be closer to people.  I don't want to be where I can't help people.  And then I said, well, I think I would like medicine.  I wasn't even thinking about my father [Clinton Boone] at that time.  I just decided on my own that I would go ahead and take medicine, which I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I want to backtrack back to grade school for a minute.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In grade school, did you like sciences and things like that?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Literary, I liked English.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you were in high school, did you take a lot of math and science courses in high school?
Speaker 2: I took the requirements.  I took algebra, trigonometry, and I took lots of English, whatever was required.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in high school, did you get involved in all the high school activities?
Speaker 2: (Background noise) Let's see.  In high school, let's see, I was in the Student Council that was about all.  My mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] had taken ill by that time, and I would rush home to help her.  And especially on the weekends I would start at the top of the steps on the second floor and clean up the whole house.  I just--nobody else to do it, so I would always do that.  But I didn't do much in the way of extra-curricular, I did more in college.

Speaker 1: Are there any high school [Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia] teachers that stand out as mentors?
Speaker 2: I'll never forget the principal, W.A. Townsend [ph.].  He was very rigid, and a strict disciplinarian.  I remember the English teacher, Daisy Jones.  She was very strict in grammar, and wanted to teach you well.  And Bill Calloway [ph.] who was my math teacher.  He was very patient with us, and would explain things very well, I remember that.  The only other one was my fourth year teacher.  His last name was Lindsay.  Was it C.W. Lindsay [ph.]?  Anyway, he stands out.  And then I remember Ransom [ph.].  He was very short, with glasses, and very impressive.
Speaker 1: Not Reverend A. Ransom [sic. Reverdy C. Ransom], wasn't it?
Speaker 2: I think Reverend W.A. Ransom's son.  He was related in some way.
Speaker 1: I know there was a Reverend A. Ransom, a Reverend A. Ransom at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  He's--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know him.  But W.A. Ransom was the pastor of South Side Baptist Church [Richmond, Virginia] where my father [Clinton Boone] preached very frequently.
Speaker 1: Um, so um--
Speaker 2: I had to walk, you know.  I lived at that time on 10th Street, and I had to walk about fourteen blocks every morning past two white schools to get to my school.  And one of the white schools was the John Marshall High School [Richmond, Virginia].  And interestingly, I met somebody in the last month who was a relative of John Marshall.  (Laughter) I told him, I said, I couldn't even go to your relative's high school, I had to go by.
Speaker 1: Now, it probably goes without saying, but most of the institutions, the public institutions and accommodations originally were segregated.
Speaker 2: At that time, they definitely were, definitely were.
Story_ID: 303699
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school, did you know--well, before we get you there--your mother [Rachel Tharps Boone] died when you were a freshman in high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in June.  My mother died in February, the same year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you graduated a little earlier than people graduate now, right, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: That's, that's four years earlier than people graduate from high school today.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And it's interesting, because there was one young man in the class who was sure he was going to be valedictorian.  And when I got into the class it ended up, my grade point was point two above his, so I got to be the valedictorian. (Laughter) He didn't like that.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: But he was a friend of mine later.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you graduated from high school--now that was, now your mother died and your father [Clinton Boone] died two years later.  That must have been a pretty rough time for you.
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't at all easy.  It wasn't at all easy.
Speaker 1: Did you know at the time, now, you went to stay with your [maternal] aunt, you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you think at that time that you were going to be able to go on to college?  Was that already planned out?
Speaker 2: Well, as you say, I was quite young.  And at that time, there wasn't a college that would accept me.  Now, they probably would.  But at that time, they would not accept me.  So, I actually went to high school [Cranston High; Cranston High School East, Cranston, Rhode Island] up there in Rhode Island and took an extra year until I could get old enough to be accepted into a college.  And then I got into a small Christian college [Houghton University, Houghton, New York] up in Upstate New York.
Speaker 1: Now, let's backtrack a minute.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you, did you graduate from Armstrong High School [Richmond, Virginia] in '38 [1938]?
Speaker 2: Armstrong High School in June of 1938.
Speaker 1: And, now, in Rhode Island, how did you get to Rhode Island?  Who took you to Rhode Island?  What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Well, after I finished at Armstrong, I spent the summer at Virginia Union University [Richmond, Virginia].  And then because my mother had died, Aunt Bessie [Tharps] had already moved to Rhode Island, so she took me to live with her in Rhode Island.  And that was at the home of Ms. Mary Tefft, who was a teacher at Hartshorn [Hartshorn Memorial College; Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].
Story_ID: 303700
Speaker 1: Now, how did you manage to--you must have been pretty bright, to come out of high school at age thirteen, right?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked hard and, you know, it was pleasant for me, studying.  And I enjoyed studying, and I just kept right on up with it.  And I always wanted to achieve.  I didn't think about getting all A's, I just wanted to learn the material, master it, and to do well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, I wanted to keep my grade point average up.  But I wasn't competing with anyone.
Speaker 1: I'm just putting this in perspective.  A valedictorian at age thirteen, that seems to be something.  Now, in Rhode Island--let's get you from--you're at Cranston High School [Cranston High; Cranston High School East, Cranston, Rhode Island] in Rhode Island (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --while you're staying with your Aunt Bessie [Tharps], right?
Speaker 2: And the curriculum was a little bit different.  Twelfth grade at Armstrong High School [Richmond, Virginia] was not the equivalent of the twelfth grade at Cranston High School.  So, I was learning some things that I did not have in Richmond [Virginia].  Now, I don't know what the reason for that was, but it was true, it was not quite the same curriculum.  So, I was very prepared for going to college when I got out of Cranston High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where did you decide to go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, the place that accepted me was Houghton College [Houghton, New York], H-O-U-G-H-T-O-N, and that was in Houghton, New York.  That's in the Finger Lake section and right on the Genesee River, a beautiful campus.  I was the only--
Speaker 1: You were the only?
Speaker 2: I was the only black (laughter).  My brother [Clinton Boone, Jr.] was in the class ahead of me.
Speaker 1: He was at Houghton (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not sure, now he--
Speaker 1: He was at Houghton, too?
Speaker 2: He went to Houghton also.  But it seems to me he was at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia] first, and then transferred to Houghton, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were not in the same class.  I was in the class behind him.  But it was a real adjustment for me, going to Houghton.  I had a roommate from Japan, oh, a very beautiful young lady.  Jennie T-S-A-I was her name, and we got along very well.  But I really didn't enjoy being the only black in my classes (laughter).  It was just pioneer work, which I was not really ready to accept.  But--
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I did it.
Story_ID: 303701
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You described yourself as sort of shy.  And this--and here you were the only black person in the class [at Houghton College, Houghton, New York]. So, was a lot of attention called to you?  Well, what kind of things happened to you?  Are there any stories about--
Speaker 1: Well, as I said, I had a minor in music.  And I, at that time was a mezzo-soprano.  And now, I'm an alto.  But I was a mezzo-soprano, and I just loved being in the a capella choir.  And every spring we would make the tour, a bus tour, going to various churches.  And I always looked forward to Christmas, because we would sing the whole 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel].  And of course, being short, I was always on the front row.  And I always said, one of those times I want to get that solo.  But the girl who got the solo was actually a music major, and they put them to the front more than somebody who was just a minor, and who really didn't want music or a music education as an entire vocation.  But I enjoyed being a part of the choir, and a part of the student council.
Speaker 2: Now, did you, what did you major in?
Speaker 1: I majored in social science and history, and minored in music.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, are there any teachers or administrators--are there any people that stand out that you, that were helpful to you, or that you really learned a lot from?
Speaker 1: Well, I remember the president, Stephen Paine, P-A-I-N-E, as a role model.  I always thought that he was the acme of success.  Of course, this was a Wesleyan school, and there was just a lot of religion all around everywhere.
Speaker 2: Is there a particular reason why you chose this college?
Speaker 1: Well, I was young, and they would accept me.  Actually, it was chosen for me.  We went, and we were living with Miss Tefft [Mary Tefft].  And she was the one who was responsible for the finances, and that was the only way I could get in college.  So, I just went ahead with the program.  I didn't apply to a whole lot of colleges like they do now.  And it was just that, or you don't go to college.  So, I went and I liked it.  There were some good teachers there.  I had a, I'm trying to remember--the first year philosophy and psychology teacher, he was excellent.  And then they had a, I can't remember that name. (Background noise) There was a female math teacher who was very, very good, and was very helpful to me.  Because calculus I didn't do too well with, I did much better in English, and even German, that I took.  But, and then I was impressed by the musicians.  Eugene Shram [ph.] was one of them, and the other one was Mr. Karapachian [ph.].  And I thought for a while--I tried to get private music lessons with Mr. Karapachian, but he was the full professor, and he was too busy.  And besides, I was not a music major, so he didn't go out of his way.  But at that time, I was very interested in music.
Story_ID: 303702
Speaker 1: And you said earlier I think, on the last reel, that when you were about a junior in college your thoughts turned to medicine?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I decided that I would take medicine.  And then, I didn't have enough pre-med credits.  So, I graduated from Houghton [Houghton College, Houghton, New York]; I was second in my class then.  And I went to Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island] to take the rest of the pre-med credits.  I took embryology and proctology, and physics, I took physics.  And that was a pre-requisite, but I was glad when I got out of physics.  (Laughter) I didn't like physics that much.  It was just too, it was not dealing with any people.  And I would rather think about people, or something living, than something theoretical.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was at Brown University, I served as a lab assistant in biology.  And I got interested in glass-blowing, but I was never able to follow that up.  And it was interesting.  I told one of my classmates, her name was Marjorie Gallop [ph.], that I was thinking about--I was there because I was preparing to go to medical school.  And I told her that I had applied.  And the next thing I know, she decided she would go to medical school, too.  And she figured, (laughter) I guess she figured--well, you know, she was white--but if I could do it, she could do it.  So, she was in the corresponding class at Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts] when I was accepted to the class at Boston University [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts].  And I only applied to one medical school.
Story_ID: 303703
Speaker 1: But let me go back and get some dates straight.  So, you graduated from Houghton [Houghton College, Houghton, New York] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-three [1943]. Houghton.
Speaker 1: Okay, Houghton, I'm sorry, Houghton.  And you went to Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] immediately thereafter for a year?
Speaker 2: Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, okay, Brown University.  And then you were accepted to Boston U medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: In 1945.
Speaker 1: In 1945, okay.  Now, what was med school like?
Speaker 2: Well, you must remember that the war was just getting over, World War II [WWII] in 1945, in August.  And I entered in September, and there were eleven of us females, of which two were black.  There were seventy in the class altogether.  And the men who were left were actually 4-F men, and the medical school preferred to take healthy women than to take disabled men.  So, that's how, I think, so many women got in that particular year.  The corresponding class at Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts] had twenty-four women, and the corresponding class at Tufts [Medical School of Tufts College; Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts] had forty women.  Now our sophomore year they cut back, and they had only two women.  And years after that, it was just a few.  But of course, you know, now women are quite plentiful.  But--
Speaker 1: But in those days, you didn't see a lot of women doctors (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In those days it was a rarity.  And I'll never forget the razzing and the teasing in medical school, oh, especially when we were doing GYN [gynecology] and OB [obstetrics].  They just (laughter) the men just had a ball with us; they teased us and teased us.  And we just grinned, because, you know, if I had been myself, maybe it would have been different.  But there were enough of us that we could just off in our own little huddle and try to study the material.  We recently had our fiftieth class reunion, and I think that was quite well attended.
Story_ID: 303704
Speaker 1: It was difficult in medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts], it was not easy; none of this was easy.  I tell you, this pioneering was very difficult.  And I, I was always struggling to keep in the upper third of that class.  You know, it was just something which I had to do, and I was driven to do.  And so much so, that at the commencement, my classmates in the row ahead of me all turned around and said, "Congratulations, Dr. Boone [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith]," because they knew how hard I had been working.  (Laughter) But they were still teasing, they were still teasing.  But I had some good professors in medical school.  I remember Alice Marston [ph.], who taught us biology.  She was a masculine looking woman, and she was always on the side of the females.  "You'd better get this down.  This is what you should know."  And my anatomy teacher, Dr. Connell [Jay Leroy Connell (ph.)], I'll never forget him.  Because when we were dissecting our cadaver that we had named Charlie--there were four of us females, and we were on the stomach.  And this man had died of cancer of the stomach.  And we could not dissect the anatomy of those blood vessels, because they were all mixed up with the cancer.  And so, one of the girls at our table started crying.  And Dr. Connell came over and he said, "Don't ever cry."  He said, "That means that you have self-pity for yourself."  He said, "Always be strong and believe that you can do it."  (Laughter) And I never forgot him for saying that, you know.  So we got through, but we had to learn that anatomy from a book, and not from a cadaver.  The sophomore year was difficult like the others.  That's the time when you have these heavy textbooks that you have to carry around, and do a lot of reading.  But the junior and senior years were the ones that you really feel like you're beginning to be a doctor.  That's when you put a white jacket on and you go in and you speak to patients, and they may or may not think that you're a doctor.
Story_ID: 303705
Speaker 1: My senior year I was a part of a first at Boston University School of Medicine [Boston, Massachusetts], that was the first year, 1949, that they had the Home Medical Service.  And my team, consisting of Maurice Vanderpol, Paul Burk [ph.], myself, and perhaps one other student, went up to Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], I don't know if you're acquainted with the Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's the traditional black neighborhood in Boston.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: The Roxbury area.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  We went up to Roxbury, and we made house calls.  And we took care of children. In fact, we gave them their immunization shots.  And I remember about that experience, we had--well, I went to a house where there was a woman who weighed over three hundred pounds, and she was five by five, literally five by five.  And I took her blood pressure.  And in those days, all we had was a wrap-around cuff.  I wrapped the cuff around, I inflated it.  And I kept on inflating it, and the reading went to three hundred, and I still hadn't gotten the blood pressure.  So, I was puzzled.  And that day, I went back and I told my instructor, I said, I could not take this lady's blood pressure.  It was way off the cuff.  And I asked her if she would come into the hospital with us, and she refused.  So, at that point there was nothing more that I could do.  Two weeks later, that same lady came in as a patient to the emergency room, and she'd had a stroke.  And that's one patient I will never forget, because I didn't know any other way to make her come to the hospital.  She just wouldn't move, I couldn't move her.  But that was the highest blood pressure that I ever remember.  Now, in the practice of medicine, I've had some patients maybe 280 and 290, but I never had another one quite that high.
Story_ID: 303706
Speaker 1: That was the Home Medical Service.  And we were accompanied, on our trips we were accompanied by a reporter and a photographer from Look magazine.  Remember Look magazine?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: And they did this story on 'What's Wrong with Doctors?'  Talking about doctors should go to the houses and make house calls and help people.  And they wrote it up, and one of the pictures that they took had me going through an alley there in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] between the apartment houses.  And there were rows and rows of just clotheslines, full of clothes that hung up.  And that picture was resurrected by one of the alumni.  He found the article in Look magazine, and they blew up the picture, and they have the enlargement of it on the wall now at the School of Public Health [Boston University School of Public Health] there in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You can see that later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think we have one copy of that article.
Speaker 2: Who shot the pictures for Look?  Did they have a black photograph shooting?
Speaker 1: In 1949, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks shot for Life, but I think--I don't if he started, but I think he started in the '50s [1950s], didn't he?
Speaker 1: I'll check that article again.  When we get through, we can check the article and see.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Well--
Speaker 1: I don't remember a black photographer.  I would know, I would know that.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not saying there was.  I'm just saying I know Gordon Parks was one of the first, and he was for Life though, not for Look.  But that was I think in the early '50s [1950s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, this was Look.
Story_ID: 303707
Speaker 1: At Boston U [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts], now who were some of the teachers up at Boston U, in the medical school that you remember?
Speaker 2: Alice Marston [ph.], Vernon Walker [ph.], who was the dean; Jay Leroy Connell [ph.], who was the anatomy professor; and I had a surgery professor by the name of Hans Pretorius [ph.].  The one who really influenced me a whole lot was Dr. Chester S. Keefer, K-E-E-F-E-R.  He did the initial work on penicillin, and that was useful during World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was Dr. Max Weinstein [ph.].  He was just a genius, an infectious diseases specialist, one of the first and one of the best.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance when you were in medical school, did you get a chance to--or did you know about, or did you ever meet any of the black physicians, say, from Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] or Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], or any of the--or Homer G. Phillips [Homer G. Phillips Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: I wasn't fortunate enough to meet them until I went to Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York] to intern.  Now, at Boston there was a black physician couple, Charles Branch [ph.], who I think was in rehabilitation medicine, and his wife was a psychiatrist.  Not Branch, his name was Bonner, Charles Bonner, B-O-N-N-E-R.  Those are the ones that I knew in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And what was his wife's name?
Speaker 2: Frances [ph.].
Speaker 1: Frances Bonner, okay.  So they were, they were residents of Boston?  They were living in Boston?
Speaker 2: Yes, living and practicing in Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything else about medical school before we take you to Harlem Hospital as an intern?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  Um, I took the National Board of Medical Examiners, and I placed very high on the biochemistry exam.  And the medical school put that in the newspaper, The Boston Globe.  I was, for one year, I was president of the Blackwell Society [Elizabeth Blackwell Society], and that was a group of females.  And we would have a female lecturer come to lecture every year.  And one year, we had a psychiatrist.  Her name was Greta [ph.], oh, I can't remember her last name.  But I remember she wanted me to show her the ladies' restroom, and I did.  And I, you know, was just making conversation, how do you like psychiatry, and what do you think?  And she said, "Oh, it's fine.  But sometimes you just have to wash your hands."  And she was washing her hands then (laughter). And I thought, well, that's a good way of putting it.  Because I think if were in psychiatry, I'd want to wash my hands sometime, too.
Story_ID: 303708
Speaker 1: When did you graduate from Boston U medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: It was in May of 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you went on to Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was the only internship that was available at that time.  I had two strikes against me; I was black and I was female.
Speaker 1: And a lot of doctors say that they went--a lot of them went to--Homer G. Phillips [Homer G. Phillips Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri], I know, and--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --some to Provident [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County] in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's the group that went to Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  I did not apply to there.  I did, however, apply to the Medical College of Virginia [Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia].  I told that I had grown up in Richmond, Virginia, and I was just graduating from medical school.  And they wrote me back and said that they were not ready.  Since then, of course, they have had some very good black females who have come through and have practiced.  But I couldn't get in.  You know, when I was turned down from there, I said, okay, I'll just take Harlem.  So I went to Harlem and I met the residents from Meharry, from Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]--very, very brilliant people, and I was so proud of them, to be able to study with them.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people you met?
Speaker 2: Well, Alphonse Jordan [ph.], a resident in internal medicine.  There was, I think his first name was Jimmy Thomas [ph.], and he was an Ob-Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology].  And there was a Dr. Price [ph.]; I think his name was Cordell Price, he was in surgery.  And I met Dr. Addison Prince, an Ob-Gyn, who was from Detroit [Michigan].  It was not through him, but there was another young lady who was interning there, by the name of Lucille Gunning [Dr. Lucille Constance Gunning].  And she knew that there was a black female in internal medicine residency in Detroit.  So she said, "Well, they accept females and they give you good training.  Why don't you try to go there?"  So I wrote to this female resident, her name was Marjorie Meyers [Marjorie Peebles-Meyers].  And at that time she was the chief resident in internal medicine at Wayne University School of Medicine [Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan].  And she wrote back to me and told me that I would be accepted as a female, that the living quarters were adequate at most, but I could make it there, and that I would get good training.  So, I applied to Detroit Receiving Hospital [Detroit, Michigan], and I was accepted there.  Marjorie Meyers was the first, and I was the second.
Story_ID: 303709
Speaker 1: How did you like Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, I had to grow to like Detroit.  I came to Detroit in 1951.  And I'd just finished one year of residency at Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn [New York], in pathology.  And from there, I came to Receiving Hospital [Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, Michigan].  When I was in the taxi and I was riding up Hastings Street coming to Receiving Hospital, I was completely turned off.  The place was just like--well, I was coming through the ghetto at that time, and that was my first impression of Detroit.
Speaker 1: That was the east side of Detroit, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Near Black Bottom [Detroit, Michigan]?  Was the Black Bottom still in existence?
Speaker 2: That was the Black Bottom, coming through there.
Speaker 1: And this is in 195--?
Speaker 2: This was 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I thought Detroit was very cold.  In fact, I didn't know anyone in the city and I didn't have any relatives here.  And I was just at the hospital working.  But the female resident in Ob-Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology], her name was Hackett [ph.].  She took pity on me, and put me in her car and drove me around Detroit.  And she drove me out to Grosse Pointe [Michigan] along Lake Shore Drive, where those mansions were, where Henry Ford lived, where Al Glancy [Alfred R. Glancy, Jr.] lived, and a beautiful view.  And I thought, well, there are some nice places in Detroit.  (Laughter) But we were not allowed to live out there, of course, but we just looked.  But anyway, that sort of changed my idea about Detroit.  And everything went well.  There was a black surgical resident by the name of Malcolm West who was very nice to me.  And of course, I discovered that Addison Prince was here, and he lived here.  Plus the fact that he had married a nursing supervisor from Harlem [New York, New York].  And she was a nice person to me the whole time that I was an intern.  Whenever I was on call as an intern, she would just stack up the admissions for me.  And five o'clock in the morning, she'd call and say, "Dr. Boone [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith], I have four admissions for you."  I'd get up, and then I'd be up for the rest of the day.  But I could sleep from 11:30 until 5:00, and I was always grateful to her for that.  And she eventually became my private patient, and I took care of her for years.
Story_ID: 303710
Speaker 1: So, had you decided to make Detroit [Michigan] your home at that point, I mean at this point, in the early '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: I was looking at Detroit, but not knowing anyone here, I didn't think of it as home.  I was going to go back to Richmond [Virginia] and practice there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had--Aunt Bessie [Tharps] had practiced in Richmond for about seven years, and all of my people were in Richmond, so I was going to go back there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what prevented you from going back to Richmond?
Speaker 2: Well, one evening--I'd been in Detroit less than a year.  And Malcolm West, who was a surgical resident, knew Damon Keith [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith].  And he asked Damon, "Well, do you have any hang-ups about a professional woman?"  And Damon said, "No, I don't care," (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's your impression of Judge Keith, who was then an attorney (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's him. (Laughter) So, Malcolm said, "Well, if I weren't already married, I would think about this young lady."  And he took Damon and he brought him over to Herman Kiefer Hospital [Detroit, Michigan] while I was admitting polio patients.  I was on call that night, and I was admitting paralytic polio, bulbar polio--I was--Herman Kiefer was the hospital for contagious diseases, and I was on duty.  So, he brought him over and actually introduced him to me.  And right away, Damon started telling me about his family, and his mother and his father and his sister.  And I'm like what's this, you know?  So, then he wanted me to go to a football game with him.  So I went to the football game, and that was the Detroit Lions versus the Los Angeles Rams.  Anyway, Damon loves to tell this story.  I was rooting for the Detroit Lions, because here I am with somebody who's from Detroit, and this is the Detroit team, and I'm in Detroit.  (Laughter) So, he whispered in my ear, he says, "Look, I'm not rooting for Detroit, because they don't have any colored people on their team."  (Laughter) So, I learned my lesson starting off on the first date; I learned my lesson.  (Laughter) So--
Speaker 1: I think the Rams had Ollie Matson, I think was the name of the black player who was the star for the Rams then, Ollie Matson.
Speaker 2: I thought there were two.
Speaker 1: There might have been two.  I know there was one, at least one, Ollie Matson.
Speaker 2: Well, the Detroit Lions had none (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, Woody Strode might have been actually playing for them then, I don't know.
Speaker 2: They had none back in 1951, they didn't have any.  So, I became better acquainted with him, and we were married two years later.  By that time, I'd just finished the residency and was starting to practice.  And Damon was in his law practice down on Randolph [Street].  And we lived in an apartment over on Blaine [Street], in a third floor apartment over on Blaine Street in Detroit.

Speaker 1: You specialized in internal medicine?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, and you were stationed at--well, what hospital were you based at?
Speaker 2: Um--
Speaker 1: Or were you in private practice?  Did you have your own office?
Speaker 2: In private practice, I had an office.  I went and practiced with Dr. Thomas Batchelor, Dr. Garnet Ice [ph.], and a dentist by the name of Dr. Shepard [ph.], and Dr. Alegro Godley.  That was in a new office building that was built over on Conant [Street] at Nevada [Avenue], in Conant Gardens in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year did you go into private practice?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did the black community have any trouble accepting a black woman as a physician, as a doctor?  I know you weren't in general practice, but you--
Speaker 2: Well, I had just come off a three-month affiliation in pediatrics at Receiving Hospital [Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, Michigan].  So, they didn't have a pediatrician there, so as I was working up my practice, I did a lot of pediatrics.  And I did the pediatrics for the group there, until I got so busy with my own practice that I had to let the children go.  I made a lot of house calls, to build up the practice, even, well the first year Damon [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] would be my chauffeur, and I would go out making house calls.  I would come in after the office, and I would call the answering service and say, I'm available.  If they're any calls, give them to me.  And they would call me, and I would make five or six calls in the evening.  Because it's interesting, after our wedding, I came back to the office building and, of course, the office rent was due and so forth.  I wrote a check for twenty dollars, and it bounced.  I said, what?  I'd forgotten that I had written a check for my wedding gown, and I hadn't subtracted it from that.  But then that year we made more house calls than ever, trying to build up the practice.  And I made them for several years after that, until I became so busy in the office I couldn't, plus the fact, I had young children coming along.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you have three daughters, right?
Speaker 2: There are three daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Born in the '50s [1950s], I guess, all of them?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], '58 [1958], and '60 [1960].
Story_ID: 303712
Speaker 1: Now, you were sort of a pioneer.  There weren't--there's always a shortage of black doctors, and always a shortage of black women doctors, not as many.  But what would you see as the biggest challenge you faced in those days as a black physician in a city like Detroit [Michigan], which was becoming blacker and blacker?
Speaker 2: Well, remember, at that time women doctors were perhaps five percent of the total number of black doctors.  And it fairly often happened that a male patient would come into my office and take one look at me, and go out and say, "Oh, I made a mistake."  And he wouldn't come back, you know.  And at that time, I was busy enough so that I didn't mind that.  But then in later years, the exact opposite occurred; they came to me because I was a woman. But that was many years after.  In the beginning, yes, yes, there was difficulty being accepted.  And when I was an intern at Harlem [Harlem Hospital Center, New York, New York], I used to have patients always asking me, "Please get me a bed pan, bring me a tray; do this, do that."  And I would never get impatient with them.  I would just say, "Well, Ma'am, I will get somebody to do this for you.  I can't do this.  I'm your doctor, I cannot do this.  I'll get somebody to do this for you."  But they couldn't figure it out (laughter) that I was a doctor (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, these are people that more than likely would never ask a male doctor to go get them a bed pan, or such a thing?
Speaker 2: No, oh, no, they never would.  And even though you have a white coat on, that makes no difference, you know.  You're just supposed to wait on them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had a problem with our patients being segregated, also.  In 1954, I got on the staff of Detroit Memorial Hospital [Detroit, Michigan].  And that was because Dr. Batchelor [Thomas Batchelor] recommended we intervene, and he recommended me.  And I just have to say that when I was being interviewed to become a staff member, the administrator was named Pinkerman [Owen Pinkerman], Mr. Pinkerman.  He was this tall, gaunt--he looked like a hospital administrator.  But he said, "Now, Dr. Boone [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith], you must accept the fact that the patients here are segregated.  And if you're not accepting of that, then we can't accept you."  So, at that time I had no choice; either I was going to be a staff doctor or not a staff doctor.  So, I said, all right, we'll see what happens.
Story_ID: 303713
Speaker 1: Mr. Pinkerman [Owen Pinkerman] was the administrator [at Detroit Memorial Hospital, Detroit, Michigan] for about five years, and he was followed by Mr. Franklin Carr, C-A-R-R.  Mr. Carr was aware of the segregation of the patients, and I used to have to go through the double doors to Station 41 to get to my patients.  There was a double door that separated them from the white patients.  So, by that time there were a number of black doctors on the staff at the hospital.  So we got together, Dr. Thomas Flake, Dr. Chavis [ph.], and myself, and one of the foreign doctors.  And we went to Mr. Carr, and we told him that it looks like our patients are now not all in one unit, but they're being admitted to the same beds.  My patients were being admitted to 205, 305, 405, and 207, 407, 307, and 407.  I said, now, why can't they occupy other beds?  And he said he realized what the problem was, but he did that all himself by assigning those beds, hoping that the situation would work out.  Well, during that time, we were going back and forth to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was active, and the cases were before the Supreme Court.  Then when we got, oh, was it 1964, the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965]?  And we got a very liberal senator, Philip Hart, who by himself desegregated Grace Hospital [Sinai-Grace Hospital, Detroit, Michigan], which was with Harper Hospital [Harper University Hospital, Detroit, Michigan], the two most prominent of the white hospitals.
Speaker 2: Now, wait a minute.  Let's pause on this for a second.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You're telling us that in 1964, Detroit [Michigan] still had segregated hospitals, and they had been--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Segregated to the extent that the patients were being admitted to the same beds.  But when the Equal Employment, I'm not saying it correctly, the Equal Opportunity [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]--then they could not segregate anymore, so they didn't after that, after '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, did your physicians stay together, or did they just come together just to do that?
Speaker 1: Well, that was more or less an ad hoc committee.  And after that, after he promised that things would be better, we did not meet again, not officially.  I became a member of the executive committee there at Detroit Memorial Hospital.  I think I was the first black female member of the hospital executive committee.
Speaker 2: Now, that's at what hospital?
Speaker 1: Detroit Memorial.
Speaker 2: Detroit Memorial, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, downtown Detroit.
Story_ID: 303714
Speaker 1: Now, were you a member at that time of the National Medical Association?  Was there a Detroit [Michigan] equivalent, I mean, a local chapter?
Speaker 2: There's a Detroit equivalent.  It's the Detroit Medical Society, and they were very active.  I was a member of the National Medical Association.  I remember I went to a convention down in Atlanta [Georgia], and Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was the speaker for our banquet.  And he was dressed in this dashiki, and he had an afro, a big afro.  And he just bawled the doctors out.  I mean he, he said, "You're riding in your Cadillacs and your limousines, and wearing your fur coats," and this and that.  And by the time the doctors left, they were just so upset with him (laughter), with him.  But I think that was just part of his youthfulness.  He became much more seasoned after that.
Speaker 1: So, this is in 1969 or '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: That would have been 1970.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But things are certainly so much, so much different now.
Story_ID: 303715
Speaker 1: Now, you're a lifelong member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And you say you've seen a lot of things change here.  I know one of the old stories about Detroit [Michigan] is the story about Dr. Ossian Sweet, whose home was invaded, I think, as he tried to move into it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes.  And that was one of the reasons for forming an NAACP chapter here.  And my husband [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] and Arthur Johnson were a part of the first men's committee for the NAACP.  And I was a member of the women's committee, and for a few years I was the chairman of the hospitality committee of the women's committee.  And every year I would meet with the women at the committee meetings, and we would plan how we would handle the hospitality for the Fight for Freedom Dinner [Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner].  Because, as you recall, the Fight for Freedom Dinner grew to be quite large.
Speaker 1: From what I understand. Now, Detroiters have been telling me this for two or three years, I didn't know it at first.  But it's the largest NAACP dinner, and quite possibly the largest dinner in the country, occupying three adjoining halls with three podiums going on simultaneously, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, ten thousand attendees.  And The New York Times wrote it up as the city that came to dinner.  And they had a picture of the auditorium with all the people there, a huge crowd.  We would have a VIP reception before the dinner, and then the dais guests would parade in, and they had sections of blue, red, green, and yellow. And people used to vie to get seats in the blue section, because they knew that's where the speakers were.  So, if you were in the blue section, you had the better seats in the house.  But we had it divided up into the dais committee, a committee to take care of visiting dignitaries, and several other sub-committees.  But I did chair that for at least nine or ten years.  And of course, I became a life member of the NAACP.  And of course, I got this by proxy, because my husband was so active in the NAACP that I couldn't miss.
Speaker 1: It was quite an undertaking, to be the chair of.  From what I understand, it was the largest of its kind of dinner in the country.  So--
Speaker 2: Well, I was only chair of the sub-committee, the sub-committee; I wasn't chair of the whole thing.  They do have co-chairs, they have two men who are co-chairs.  Then now, they have a woman who is chair of the women's committee.
Story_ID: 303716
Speaker 1: What are some of your concerns about the general health of the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm very concerned about it.  As you know, African Americans do not get the same advantages in healthcare as the whites do.  And there have been studies on that, showing that the care given to blacks is in some ways inferior to that which is given to whites.  One of our main problems, of course, is high blood pressure.  And a good percentage of us have it.  I think a number of people do not get regular checkups, so they don't know that they have hypertension until they develop a complication.  They develop a stroke, they develop a heart attack, they develop peripheral vascular disease.  Not that peripheral vascular disease is caused by hypertension, I'm not saying that, but they very often are associated.  Or, they get kidney disease.  We're seeing a resurgence of tuberculosis and, of course, you well know about HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome], I hardly need to mention that at all.  But we need more black doctors, we need better health care, we need the economy to improve, so that we can have better health care.  The costs are rising from one year to the other, and it's a situation that we have to all be aware of.
Story_ID: 303717
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at all the things that you've done--now, you retired in what year?
Speaker 2: December of 2002.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you look back at what you've done so far, is there any major thing that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed the private practice of medicine.  I liked the challenge, I liked the one-on-one with the patients.  And I would still have chosen that, because for me it's fulfillment, it's satisfaction.  I was always very pleased when I got a letter or sometimes a Christmas card from a patient saying, Dr. Keith [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith], you've been very good to me.  I appreciate all that you've done.  And my health is good now because of you.  And then taking care of patients in the ICU [intensive care unit] and seeing them walk out after four weeks, when you never thought that they would walk out again.  I have seen what I say are miracles, because I never believed some of these patients would make it, but they did.  And I remember I was on duty, and I had some extra lunch time.  So, I went over to Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] to try to get a dress for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Fight for Freedom Dinner [Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner].  And I went in the store and this saleslady waited on three different people before she got to me, and I knew that I was there before them.  And so when she finally got to me, I said, look, I just want one dress, that's all.  I have to get back to the hospital, and I did.  But it was like you could expect to be ignored.  And the same way with when we moved into this house in 1963, around there.  I went down to J.L. Hudson's Department Store [J.L. Hudson Department Store; J.L. Hudson Building, Detroit, Michigan], and Damon [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] said, "Well, we have to decorate.  So, go down and pick out what you want to decorate the house."  And I was just starting to practice medicine.  I went down, and the salespeople down there ignored me.  So, I came back, and Damon said, "Well, did you pick out anything?"  I said, no, I didn't get to talk to anybody.  So that just shows, I wasn't very aggressive at that time.  So, Damon went to the head of the store, J.L. Hudson [Joseph Lowthian Hudson, Jr.].  "My wife went down there and she can't do this and she couldn't do that."  So, they assigned me to a Lillian Dearing.  I will never forget her, she was as nice as she could be.  And she did the whole house for us, because she was very cooperative, and we had an easy time working for her.  But those are just incidences that happened along the way while I was trying to practice and raise a family, decorate a house and everything.  But that's part of what you had to go through, or what we had to go through.
Story_ID: 303718
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: I don't believe so, I don't believe so.  I was glad--I never regretted the decision to become a female doctor; I never regretted that decision.  I was happy with it, I was glad for the challenge.  If I had had more opportunities, I would have gone ahead and taken a residency in gastroenterology and become a gastroenterologist, but I just did not get the opportunities.  The residencies were not there for me, and I just decided I'd like to go into private practice.  And there was some hesitation on the part of a few of my professors on that.  When I decided to go into private practice, they decided I shouldn't do that.  And after I got so busy and became quote successful unquote, not financially.  I never made any money, because my patients were usually not financially able to pay a lot.  And I never pressed them for money, because I was more interested in seeing them get as well as they could.  But I got a great deal of satisfaction out of it.  I don't think I would done anything differently, except I would have gone farther ahead.  I would have sub-specialized.
Story_ID: 303719
Speaker 1: Now, as a doctor of internal medicine in the black community--this is just my subjective observation--that a lot of us take a lot of over the counter medications for, and sometimes there's so much of it that's taken.  I was wondering about the wisdom of taking so much over the counter medication instead of going to the doctor.  Do you find that to be a problem in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, that's why we used to tell the patients to bring the whole bag full of their medicines.  Bring me everything that you're taking, so that I can look at it and I can tell you what to take and what not to take.  Yes, we prefer for them to come to us before they over-medicate themselves.  And, you know, for a lot of people, polypharmacy is a problem.  They're just popping pills, and they like to do that.  But usually when the patients came to the doctor they've already taken everything they possibly could.  They didn't get any better, so they decided, well, it's something I'd better go and see the doctor about.  But it's true.  They'll try their own cough syrup, they will take their aspirin, they will drink their fluids.  And then they would come to us when they had pneumonia, and we had to treat that.  I think that nowadays we're seeing so many of these medications advertised over television.  And people say, "Well, okay, I tried Preparation H, I tried this, I tried that, and nothing helps."  They come to us and we give them something.  And you wind up seeing them with these big hemorrhoids, and we say, you'd better see a surgeon.  Actually, those who are less well-off financially, and a number of them who are on Medicaid, will keep going and keep going until they have to go the emergency room, because they can't afford anything else.  And those that come to the emergency room are apt to be more acutely ill, and more, as we would say, deathly ill, that would require ICU [intensive care unit] or intensive care.  They'll wait that long, and treat themselves that long before they come to a doctor.  But in the last ten years or so, people have become more educated.  They want to go to a doctor, and they want a doctor who's going to do a thorough job.  And so, they'll come and say, "I want a complete physical.  I want the whole program."  So, nowadays if you don't suggest a colonoscopy, or an ophthalmoscopic exam of the eyes, or a cardiac workup, you know, they don't feel like you've done a complete physical.  Because now they know (laughter) what a complete physical is.
Story_ID: 303720
Speaker 1: When you look back at all the things that you've done up to this point, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I would like to be remembered as a caring, thorough, sympathetic, kind physician.  Actually, I always took a lot of time with the patients.  And so, my office was always behind time.  Because I'd take a lot of time with each patient and try to do as thorough and detailed a job as I could.  And a number of patients came to me because of that, because that was the way that I handled my practice.  But sometimes, you know, I wouldn't get through, I'd get home about nine o'clock or nine-thirty, and the kids are already sleep.  But I always felt I had to do that kind of job.  And I just, I'd just like to be remembered as a sympathetic and kind and caring physician, who really wanted to do the best possible for the patients.  And I actually did try to do that.  I can't say that I didn't, because I always did, I always did.  I didn't write as many articles as I would like to have written.  And as I think back on it now, there are a number of articles that I could have written.  I remember I had a case of an adrenal rest tumor, and I did not realize how rare that was.  But the pathologist that I was working with down at Memorial [Detroit Memorial Hospital, Detroit, Michigan] did.  And lo and behold, he presented my case before the state, the Michigan State pathologic society [Michigan Society of Pathologists], and then they wrote it up in the journal.  And I said, oh, goodness, that there, I should have written that one.  But they did put my name down in the footnote--
Story_ID: 303721
Speaker 1: And then the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --other one I've been interested in recently is the Board of Visitors of the Wayne University College of Nursing [Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay, you're on that board.  But you were saying earlier that you were on the board of the trustees of the Detroit Science Center [Michigan Science Center, Detroit, Michigan], too.
Speaker 1: Detroit Science Center (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: --and the College of Nursing, those are the two that I'm doing now.  I've been appointed, I was appointed by Mayor Coleman Young to the world, let's see, hunger relief committee, and also to the Health Advisory Commission [Detroit Health Advisory Commission], the task force on substance abuse.  There were, you know, various committees on the hospitals, like the medical record committee.  I was chairman of the bioethics committee at Hutzel [Hutzel Women's Hospital, Detroit Medical Center, Detroit, Michigan].  And, its, it will be all there in the resume (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right.
Story_ID: 303722
Speaker 1: Tell me, this is something I need to ask you.  Like how do you feel--do you feel that--how do you feel about socialized medicine?  This is something that, you know, Hillary Clinton had a bill [Health Security Act of 1993]--
Speaker 2: I'm in favor of national health insurance, yes.  We were invited to the White House [Washington, D.C.] for a Black History Month dinner in February of 1994, and we were welcomed by Hillary Clinton.  And that was because Bill [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was making a speech and he was late, but he came to the dinner.  Now, at that time she was working on health care then.  And I took the opportunity when she was shaking our hands, I said, well, I wanted to talk to you about healthcare.  Because I belong to a couple of health maintenance organizations, and we have nothing but a lot of paperwork, we have to do a lot of paperwork.  Can you do something about that?  And she said, "Oh, yes, yes, we have discussed that.  There will be one card, and there will be just line of paperwork, and that will be simplified."  And I was always sorry that her program did not go through, because I thought that that would be much improved from what we had.  And I'm in favor of national health insurance, because I've seen so many people who are uninsured that it's just very disappointing.  You can't order this test for them, you can't order that test, because you know they can't pay for it.  If they start asking you prices, then you know that they're thinking about their budget.
Speaker 1: So, the poor are at a definite disadvantage in terms of, when it comes to healthcare in this country (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, absolutely true.
Story_ID: 303723
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family; we didn't say much about your family.  But did your--now your, both of your parents [Rachel Tharps Boone and Clinton Boone] died before you went to medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts] or anything, but did your [maternal] aunt [Bessie Tharps] get a chance to see you graduate from medical school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, my aunt lived until 1979.  So, she got a chance to see me graduate from medical school, and she was extremely proud of that.  She fortunately came up--she had moved back to Virginia.  And she came up from there and helped me each time that there was a new baby.  She didn't have any children of her own, and she was just tickled to come and sort of be grandma for the kids, and to help me.  I always did have a live-in housekeeper, though.  I had to have a live-in housekeeper, otherwise I couldn't go out on house calls at night and I couldn't go to my medical meetings in the morning.  And I was fortunate enough to find a lady who had come up from Alabama who had thirteen children of her own.  And she was a staunch, religious grandmother.  And she lived in and helped me with the children.  And because of her--she stayed with me for about sixteen years--I was able to do as much work as I wanted to do.  And then she would sometimes stay--well, a lot of times she would stay on the weekend if I asked her to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you have three daughters [Cecile Keith Brown, Debbie Keith and Gilda Keith], and, how many grandchildren do you have?
Speaker 2: I have three daughters and I have two grandchildren [Nia Brown and Camara Brown].  The grandchildren are now sixteen and nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And have any of your daughters gone into medicine at all?
Speaker 2: No, they haven't gone into law, either.  I think it was an overkill.  (Laughter) They saw how hard we both worked, and they decided, I'll do something different.  They're in public relations.  I have one daughter who is in public relations with Triple A [American Automobile Association (AAA)].  The other one is with Ford Motor Company [Dearborn, Michigan], and the one that you know in Chicago [Illinois] is with the Children's Museum [Chicago Children's Museum, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 303724
Speaker 1: The last question we always ask--and you've already--I asked you about legacy, and you actually answered the question about how you'd like to be remembered, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I don't know what to ask now, except ask it again.  How would you like to be remembered? That's how we ask it, so.
Speaker 2: That same way.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who cared for other people and did it as well as she could.  I'd like to be remembered as someone who helped a lot of people to get well, to get better.  Those that I could not get better, I had no resources to help them, or there were no resources available because of the illness that they had.  I'd like to be remembered as a good Christian, and following in the footsteps of my father [Clinton Boone], although I did not ever think of it at the time that I was doing this.  I knew that I couldn't be a missionary in Africa, but I felt that this was my mission field in the home location, where I could be a health missionary, so to speak, to help them to be better people.  Because when you feel good, you can be a good person.
Story_ID: 303725
Speaker 1: That's our Christmas greeting for 2004, my husband [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] and myself.  We had started the practice, oh, long time ago--of our prized pictures. This was at the White House [Washington, D.C.] in February of 1994 at the Black History Month dinner.  And we're there greeting Hillary Clinton.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's my daughter's wedding picture, Cecile Keith Brown and myself.  And incidentally, she is wearing my wedding dress.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, that was taken at a reception after one of the Fight for Freedom Dinners [Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner].  This is in the '60s [1960s], and Sammy Davis, Jr. was the entertainer.  And he offered his services completely gratis to us.  And this was the dress that I bought at Saks Fifth Avenue, and it cost the whole amount of fifty dollars.  I lived with her [Keith's maternal aunt], and she preceded me--she graduated from Boston University School of Medicine [Boston, Massachusetts] in 1916.
Speaker 2: In 1916?
Speaker 1: Bessie B. Tharps, T-H-A-R-P-S.
Speaker 2: Is she related to you?
Speaker 1: That was legacy, in those days, legacy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a family picture on the occasion in 1983 when Damon and I both were awarded honorary degrees from Central Michigan University [Mount Pleasant, Michigan] in Michigan.  And on the picture you have James Parks [ph.], who is, coming from left to right here.  James Parks; my sister-in-law, Marie Harris, who is Damon's sister; my oldest daughter, Cecile; Damon and I; and then on the front row you have my youngest daughter, Gilda Keith.  And behind her is Laura Parks, who is my niece.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's the graduation picture from Central Michigan University, being robed. I don't remember exactly the names of the faculty members doing it.  But the president there was Harold Abel, and he was on the Governor's Commission on Higher Education [Lt. Governor's Commission on Higher Education and Economic Growth].
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Is, fast forward. (Laughter) We're in 2002, and I served then as the attending physician for the nurse practitioners clinic at Receiving Hospital [Detroit Receiving Hospital, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: This is as close to a baby picture that I can give you.  Here I am with my brother [Clinton Boone, Jr.].  I am five years old, he is seven.  And we are in front of the flag of Liberia. You notice I had a different uniform there, we used to wear bloomers then. And yes (speaking Zulu) was the song that we sang.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.  That's your father?
Speaker 1: That's my father, Clinton Caldwell Boone, Sr. [Clinton Boone].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is my mother [Rachel Tharps Boone], and she stayed over in Liberia until 1924--1926, actually, when we came to the United States.  And after that, she was a public school teacher in Dunbar School [James H. Blackwell Elementary School] in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my picture when I graduated from medical school [Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, that's a picture of myself, my husband, Lynn Whitfield, and I think that was her agent.  She was here, I think for, it was either like Black History Month or the Ball African, I'm not sure which.
Speaker 2: The DIA [Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Now, this is a picture in May of 2003, at the forty-ninth anniversary of the Brown v. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] decision.  I am there with Dean Mahoney [Joan Mahoney], who was then-dean of the Wayne University School of Law [Wayne State University Law School, Detroit, Michigan].
Story_ID: 303726
Speaker 1: Going left to right, that's Aubrey McCutcheon [Sr.] who was a deacon at our church, Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church [Detroit, Michigan].  I'm in the middle, and the person on the right is Congressman John Conyers [HistoryMaker John Conyers, Jr.].  That was 1961.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, this picture is from the old Latin Quarter in Detroit [Michigan].  And that was where the first NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Fight for Freedom Dinners [Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner] were.  But this occasion was with Reverend Frederick G. Sampson [Reverend Dr. Frederick G. Sampson II], who was the minister of our church, starting in 1971.  And the other people are Judge Henry Heading, Richard [H.] Austin, who was city treasurer, I believe.  He was one of the first black CPAs [certified public accountant] that we had.  James Hudson [ph.], a deacon, and Arthur Johnson was the secretary of the NAACP.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My early pictures.  I was at Armstrong High School [Richmond, Virginia] at that time.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a picture at the Soul Food luncheon that my husband [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] gives in his chambers every year, celebrating Black History Month.  And I'm with Janet Hill, that is the mother of Grant Hill, who used to play for the Detroit Pistons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture taken after Damon had spent twenty-five years as a judge.  And his law clerks gave him a dinner, a banquet.  And they gave us some gifts.  And some of the gifts were a beach hat.  See, the straw hat.  And we had sunglasses they gave us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a picture of myself with Damon's mother.  And this was, this was at her house on Virginia Park [Virginia Park Historic District, Detroit, Michigan].  And I put on a white coat because I was examining her.  She had severe bronchitis, and she was chair-bound, and I was just beginning to examine her.  But that's about the only picture that I have of Damon's mother, Annie Louise Keith [Annie Williams Keith].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Here's a more recent--I believe this was 1999.  This is with Al Gore, and this was on the occasion of a tribute to Rosa Parks.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That is at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  I'm being robed. (Background noise) No, that's, I'm being roped there, just being robed.
Speaker 1: Say that again.
Speaker 2: This is at Boston University at, this is in 1998.  I think it's, no, 1999.
Speaker 1: You're being honored as a--
Speaker 2: And that's the time when I received an honorary degree and a doctorate of humane letters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is our family.  And the occasion was when Damon received the Edward Babbitt Award [sic. Edward J. Devitt Distinguished Service to Justice Award], that's given to an outstanding jurist every year.  And we have our children.  Let's see, we have Gilda [Keith], myself, Cecile [Keith Brown].  Debbie [Keith] is on the second row, and Damon is holding our grandchild, Camara [Brown].  And her father is there, Daryle Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is when Damon received an honorary degree from the College of William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia].  And Margaret Thatcher, being the provost of the college at that time, was the one to award him the honorary degree.  And I'm there in the picture with her.  We went after that to--this is back when I had just started practice, and my aunt [Bessie Tharps] from Virginia had come up to live with us.  So, you see my husband, Damon, my aunt Bessie, Dr. Bessie Tharps, and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's a good one there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's an early picture when we only had two babies.  And let's see, you have Damon, myself, and then you have Debbie and Cecile, the old--
