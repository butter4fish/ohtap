Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Today is December 27, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum and I   m here  with Anastasia Pittman who is in the House of Representatives of  Oklahoma   was elected in 2006, right?  Yes ma   am.  This is part of the Oklahoma State University Library   s project called  Women of the Oklahoma Legislature, Past and Present. Thank you for  joining me today. Let   s have you start by telling a little about your  childhood and then we   ll move forward.  Okay. As you stated, I   m Anastasia Pittman and I was born in Miami,  Florida and that was a long time ago for me but actually it was 1970. I  lived in Miami, Florida   lived in Dade County, lived in North Miami  Beach. My parents worked there. I had an older brother at the time, and  we migrated back and forth from Oklahoma City to Miami during the  summer. One summer my grandparents had us and they  parents  didn   t  return on time so she enrolled us in school. We got our immunizations  and we started attending school in Oklahoma. My grandmother later  became our legal guardian and continued to care for us. We finished  high school and college here in Oklahoma.  Which high school in Oklahoma?  I attended Rogers Middle School, Star Elementary   which no longer  exists   Rogers Middle School, Star Spencer High School. I attended the  University of Oklahoma, graduated with a bachelor   s in Journalism and  then I attended Langston University and got my master   s in Urban  Education. So I had a very fun and balanced childhood. When you have  grandparents raising grandchildren, it   s a unique balance. They are  always there because they   re retired, and you later learn what that word  means   that you never leave, you never go to work.  5  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  I   ve had the best of both worlds by having both my maternal and  paternal grandparents in Oklahoma with just a rich, rich history. My  father   s side was educators and entrepreneurs, and my mother   s side was  in medicine and they were sharecroppers. They were Native Americans,  and they did their own thing, but mostly it was in medicine and in  teaching spirituality. It was just great on my mother   s side of the family.  And were they native Oklahomans?  Yes. My maternal grandmother was Mary Lee Thurmond Taylor and she  was born in Cromwell, Oklahoma. They lived in Sasaqua. Those are  Native American towns just outside of Seminole, in between Seminole  and Shawnee. Sasaqua is where they had land. We still own that land  today. We have Thomas Town, Thomas Town Baptist Church   they  had a little red house school there and it   s called Little River.  So when you talk to older people who are from what they call    down-home     because the city was the city and they would say    down-home     or    Little River.    That was where we learned a lot of our traditional  dishes, our main course meals and little things that went with every meal  called fry bread, and it looks like what we call today, the little Chinese  bread, but it   s fry bread and it   s made from an Indian recipe and it is like  a delicacy. You have it with every meal. Nobody eats without fry bread.  So living down there, she came to Oklahoma City at the age of 16. She   s  the eldest of eight children. She was the oldest but she was called    Little  Sis.    Everybody had a nickname for everyone and by her name being  Mary, she had her grandmother   s name. She was raised by her  grandmother, as well.  And so do you have a nickname?  I do, I do. I have several.  Do you want to share?  My nickname is    Sunshine.     Okay.  I was born in the    Sunshine State    so it was very easy for my dad to say,     Hey, Sunshine.    I thought it was because they were referring to my  skin color, as my brother most often did. He very often referred to me  being fair-skinned and very bright, so that was his take on sunshine or  being yellow, as he called me. But my dad reminded me that I was  always the first one to wake him up, first one in the bed, so he would  6  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  say,    Good morning Sunshine.    When my eyes open, I   m ready to eat,  My grandmother was always up early, always up before everyone and  when food permeated in the home, it was time to wake up, so we did and  we had a very healthy childhood.  Even though it was fragmented with family members because African  Americans and Native Americans tend to live with extended family  members, it   s kind of unique. It   s not so much today, but when I was  growing up and other friends had just their mom and dad in the home,  living with your grandparents or maybe an uncle or an aunt   it was  unique. They wondered why are were so many people in the home but it  worked well for us. It kept us balanced because everybody had a  different perspective on how to raise children     I   m sure.     and it was better for us to be raised by our grandparents than our  parents at the time because they had an opportunity to do it over, and  made it easy, made it fun.  Did you discuss politics around the dinner table?  No.  No?  No, not often. It was more so a spiritual type gathering, and it changed  as we got older because then you were taught,    This is what   s right, this  is what   s wrong, now you choose.    We find ourselves making decisions  for those grandparents who raised us and it was unique when the tables  turned. At nine years old, I began to give my grandmother medications  that required discipline. You   ve got to lay these meds out there every  day and that   s what you do. But you did it and that was a part of your  lifestyle. You didn   t know they needed it to live, and they were really  depending on you.  Were you a Girl Scout?  I was a Brownie, which is before Girl Scouts. I had the option of  choosing between Campfire Girls and Brownies. I was in Brownies.  They were a little more active. My brother was in Boy Scouts and my  dad was a very active outdoorsman. It was unique because we had  sports. I was always outside. I was a tomboy. There were all guys in the  neighborhood, and I was the little sister. I was the baby, and it was very  difficult because they didn   t want you to go outside. They didn   t want  you to participate in those sports. My dad was a fair guy   if you wanted  7  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  to go with him hunting, camping, fishing, bowling, anything, he allowed  you to do it even if you were a girl. So I learned about cars, martial arts,  fishing, chess   and he was just great. Now my mom is a little more of a  strict person. She   s a no-nonsense type of gal, and her rules were rules  and she   s very vocal, very boisterous   a lot of fun. She just held her  own and she grew up with mostly brothers and raised two younger  brothers but she came from a large family, as well. Altogether it was  seven of them and only two girls and five boys. She learned that if you  want a piece of the pie you   d better reach in and grab it, (Laughs) and  they did.  How early on did you get interested in the political arena?  I was about 12 or 13.  That   s pretty early.  Well, when you hang out with old folks, you learn the little clich  s. My  grandmother always spoke to us in parables, and you   d figure it out later  on as you grew up that they didn   t speak directly to you. They gave you  innuendos or affirmations or things that they believed in or things that  they held dear to their heart to be true. You quickly learned that when  they said things it came to fruition, it came to pass. You learned wisdom  at an early age, and in politics   in school, I guess I began to perfect  politics when it was time for me to get in trouble. And if I was to get in  trouble, I was able to articulate what I was thinking at the time of my  behavior, whether it was against the rules or within the rules. If you  allowed me the opportunity to share with you why my behavior was as  such, then most often times I was not in trouble. So that was a good  thing for me and debate became of interest to me.  But at 12 years old, I was at Rogers Middle School and we had a career  day, and there was a teacher there. I believe she was a special-ed  teacher, she wasn   t one of my professors but her husband came to speak  with us, and he was an attorney. When he spoke, even though the room  was filled with children, I felt as though I was the only one in the  room   the only one that he was talking to. He helped people. He fought  for justice and things that weren   t right. He did what he could to make  them right. And he balanced that by the mandates and rules of the laws  of the land, and that was of interest to me, and that was my ticket   that  was my interest. After he spoke, I made my way through the crowd and  met him and introduced myself and told him that I wanted to be a lawyer  and I loved what he did and it just sounds like he was just talking  directly to me, and that was my purpose in life. That was my calling, if  you will.  8  Finchum  Pittman  He said to me,    I   m gonna tell you a secret, Anastasia. I believe that you  can be anything you want to be, and you   d certainly make a great  lawyer, a great attorney, a great council person. But the secret to being  an attorney is learning how to write.    I said,    Really?    And he said,     Yes. Do well in English. Learn how to write because we pay people to  write briefs for us and to do research for us. If you can do that yourself  then you would make a great attorney and you wouldn   t have to pay  someone else to do that research for you.    From that point on, my  academics were geared toward journalism and public relations and  learning those skills, honing in those skills on how to write.  Even though we were active in city council, we were active in student  council, human relations, you name it, we did it in school. I was the  freshman class president, the sophomore class favorite, the junior class  president, and I just flourished because I had great teachers. They  communicated with your parents. They really fostered an environment  for learning, and learning was not an option. You learned what they  taught and you embraced it. You really felt good as a child to do well  and make your teachers proud, and I had wonderful teachers     wonderful people who encouraged me.  As a little girl, not knowing that I was poor or was borderline poverty,  we never missed a beat. We had everything that we needed   a home full  of love. We had our challenges, you know, with various people in the  home. Not everybody agreed on everything. Not everybody included  children, but my grandmother did and we were part of the decision-making  process. We were a part of how we were to plan out our  education. So you made the decision as to whether or not you wanted to  go to college because they worked and they went into the military and  not all of them went to college. I was thankful that I had some  opportunities, thankful that I had some privileges.  And you chose OU for any particular reason?  Yes, yes. As a kid, my dad is from Oklahoma as well, and at the time he  went to Central State University, graduated from what we now call  University of Central Oklahoma   but he was a swimmer, captain of his  team. He bowled, he was just great at football, and by the time we came  along and moved back to Oklahoma   because my parents were away  for quite some time and they lived in California at the time while we  were living here with our grandparents   well, when he returned to  Oklahoma, he was a sports fanatic. And we played sports and he took us  to OU. We   d frequent the University of Oklahoma library. We went to  OSU a couple of times, but it was a longer drive and we were more  interested in the crimson and cream, and just being on the campus, it  breathed a new life into us. We were able to reach for the goals that we  9  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  had, and going to college was not just a dream, it was actually tangible.  So when I got the opportunity to receive scholarships from the  University of Oklahoma   a lady named Marian Brown came to my high  school and she recruited me. I was torn between other universities  outside of the state, but my connection was my family. My grandparents  were older and at the time they were having health challenges. They  were a little bit more dependent on us, and they sacrificed so much for  us and so we made the choice to stay here. And going to OU was a  lifelong dream, and when Ms. Marian Brown came to Star Spencer High  School, it was the best thing for me to say    yes    to the academic honors  and even have some athletic opportunities to attend the University of  Oklahoma.  Then when I got there, I had too many options and I had to make some  choices. It was either gonna be academics or athletics, and I chose  academics. I had four scholarships in that area and now President Boren  and I, we joke. I used to have meetings in the Boyd House which is  where they live. They came back and restored the Boyd House, the  President   s House. We had presidential leadership classes and our  meetings were in that house. So I look back and look on the University  of Oklahoma   it was my training ground for what I do. As a freshman, I  was selected as a student delegate and I was able to travel for the  University of Oklahoma in student government. That was when it was a  Big VIII school and now it   s a Big XII school. It may continue to grow  but I traveled for the university, on black student government, with the  Black Students    Association, and it was great. I was a journalism major,  had a lot of beats to cover, had journalism scholarships, National Merit  scholarships   it was just great.  And then at some point you became a Senate staffer?  Yes.  You did some of the writing and research for that too?  Yes, and that opened great doors. Actually the connection came from  OU. I was still writing for the Oklahoma Daily even after I   d graduated.  I did a story on a local newspaper which was the Ebony Tribune, and I  did a research project on a local black-owned newspaper. It was edited  by Lecia Swain-Ross who later became a very good friend, very close  friend, but at the time that I was interviewing her I was still writing for  OU. She was the legislative assistant to Senator Angela Monson, and  that was my connection. So after I did the research project and did my  interview with Lecia and found out a lot of things that I knew but really  didn   t know that my family was connected to Lecia Swain and her  10  mother and father, Alice M. Swain and Robert Swain, Sr.  We began to talk and chat and after the project was over she said,    You  ought to come and write. Come in and do an internship here at the  Tribune.    And later she mentioned to Senator Monson,    I   ve got a  writer. You should meet her. You need to know her. We   d like for her to  come do an internship at the Oklahoma State Senate.    Well, lo and  behold, all of these ladies that I was now meeting again, I had met  earlier in my childhood because they were all musical students of my  grandfather, who was a jazz musician. And at the time, he traveled from  school to school and taught music to African-American students and  they were in photographs in a picture in his book. So the greater  inspirers for me were Angela Monson, Vicki Miles-LaGrange, the  Honorable Lecia Swain-Ross, even Senator Constance Johnson was his  student, as well. They all took music from my grandfather.  So when I met Angela again, I said,    I   d like to intern,    and she said,     Well, you should tell me these things because I know who you are.     Little did I know that the pictures I was looking at as a little girl, which I  thought was me, it was actually Senator Monson. She was taking flute  lessons from my grandfather and Vicki Miles-LaGrange was the senator  at the time that I was becoming interested in politics when I was 12 and  13, and even at 17 her, Senator Vicki Miles-LaGrange, her dad, Charles  Miles, was my principal at high school. So I received an award from  Senator Vicki Miles-LaGrange at 17 for being a    Kids Who Care.    That  confirmed my interest in politics because she was the first African-  American female elected  to the Senate . So that says,    It could be done.  The doors are open.     Then when I got closer to the dream, the person who really opened the  door and said,    Come on in,    was Senator Angela Monson. And that   s  how I got to the State Senate as a media intern. I began writing news  columns, press releases, wrote releases, all of those things for all of the  Senate really, all of the various senators that were there at the time, like  Senator Paul Muegge and Ben Robinson and Dave Herbert. So I had a  lot of great leaders, like Penny Williams   but Senator Monson made it  possible, she sponsored me. And after a year of being a media intern, she  came to me and said,    Would you like to learn the legislative process?     Well, I told her,    Yes.     I had a mentor there who I always went and spoke to. It was Enoch  Kelly Haney who was also a senator, and he was an artist. His office was  at the bottom of the stairs, so every time I came down from media, his  office was the first office that I could go to when I was delivering the  mail clips and the things that we wrote. I would go in and say,    Senator  Haney, what do you feel about this? How do you think about that?    He  11  said,    What do you want to do next?    I said,    I want to go to law  school.    He said,    Well, if you   re gonna stay here and learn the  legislative process, law school   s a great place to go.    He was someone  that I confided in and talked to and Senator Monson encouraged me and  opened some doors.  Senator Haney encouraged me to go to law school here at the Oklahoma  City University (OCU) because he was there. He sat on the  Appropriations Board and he sat on a board at OCU and said,    Don   t go  to OU. Go to OCU.    I tried it for a little bit but I couldn   t balance the  work and the workload from my family. My grandmother was ill, and I  just said,    Well, there   s gonna be plenty of time for that.    Plus I was a  parent as well, so just entering in the legislative process was the best  thing that I could have done because I was able to get training. I was  able to learn the legislative process, stayed there, did it for an additional  six years.  I was able to travel with Senator Monson to the National Conference of  State Legislators (NCSL). I was able to receive scholarships from NCSL  to attend health seminars and trainings and those types of things. And as  I worked on committee staff, I was able to be exposed to the work that     the legislative writer was Connie Johnson. So just a rich history of  watching what she did in Health and Human Services, able to share her  workload and learn and not only just work in that area, but I worked in  various areas. I worked as a clerk, as an administrative assistant. I  worked in enrollment and engrossing and filing bills and re-doing files. I  worked in the Senate post office   wherever I could help out.  I was a troubleshooter, and I was very flexible so I learned everything  that I could and in the process of learning and just being present. Bill  Toms was a great writer and he was one of the first writers I encountered  on legislative committee staff. Suzanne Broadbant, an attorney, great  attorney, worked on that floor. Brenda Price   just people that I worked  with   Tom Walls, Caroline Dennis, even Connie Irby was there when I  was there and gave me opportunities to work in different areas. And  through that, I met lobbyists. I met people who represented different  organizations. I met the governmental liaisons for the health department  and the different areas that I worked in. I was able to participate in bill  drafting and short-title writing and began to just be flourished with  information and opportunities.  But it just   the timing   it was not there. As the turnover began to  occur, term limits began to limit our senators. Constance Johnson was  able to capitalize on the term limits of Angela Monson. So after being in  the legislature for seven years   a little over   when the space became  available when House District 99   Representative Opio Toure was term  12  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  limited, then I resigned. I resigned and said,    I   m gonna run for office.     No hesitation?  Well, there   s hesitation in the background. (Laughs) It   s a balance to  juggle your family and politics, but I had a great support system. I had  great community service and connections. As a writer, you   re able to use  those credentials to go into various areas of your community and tell  their story. When you   re the eyes and ears of the public, they trust you,  and when they see their story, it validates what they do. It encourages  them in their purpose, and you begin to sharpen your skills. The more  you write, the better you get. I was able to spread that rich history     writing from cheerleaders to foreign currency. Everything that I was able  to learn at the University of Oklahoma, I was able to capitalize on it.  Then my specialty grew after I had a child because I wanted to educate  her and learn more things, and so I went back to school and got a  master   s in Urban Education. That also created a platform for me to  know more people and be engaged in the community in various ways.  Did you have a campaign manager or were you it?  No, I had a campaign manager. I had great people who had been in  politics. I had participated in politics. At the time, Lecia Swain-Ross,  who was the editor of the Ebony Tribune   she was also the legislative  assistant to Angela Monson   but she, at the time, was the co-chairperson  of the democratic party on the county level. So I was able to  enter into some grassroots learning, find out what they did in the private  sector of registering people to vote, understanding the value of  organization.  And I met a friend through Lecia Swain at the newspaper because we  not only wrote the newspaper, we folded it and we distributed it. We did  everything in-house. I met a lady who would come every Friday and fold  papers. She was the president of A. Philip Randolph Institute and they  networked in different communities on certain political issues to get  people to vote. Her name is Theresa Hill   Theresa R. Hill   and she  would always say,    Lecia   s gonna run for office. You should, too.    And  Lecia and I, we talked about going to college, going to law school  together. We sat down and we mapped out a plan, and ten years later it  came to fruition.  Theresa Hill was one of the grassroots persons. She was my senior  advisor. She couldn   t be my campaign manager at the time because she  was an outreach coordinator for the National Democratic Committee  (NDC). She was an employee of the DNC so she couldn   t really foster a  campaign but she could advise us and tell us what should be done. We  13  have been friends for ten years. We   d lost touch. She   d see me in public.  She   d say,    Are you ready? Are you gonna run?    I said,    Well, I   m in  school. I   m working on a master   s. Not now.    And two years later, she   d  see me again and she   d say,    Are you ready?    I said,    Theresa, I have a  kid. You know, my focus is my family. We   re moving around. Her dad   s  a coach so he   s moving around.    And she said,    I   m gonna help you run  for office whenever you   re ready.    I said,    Why don   t you run first?     And she said,    No, I   m a behind-the-scenes person and I help get people  elected, that   s what I do, and I want to help elect someone that I   m  proud of.     Lecia and I, we talked about it. Theresa and I, we talked about it. And I  just had great motivators. They mostly were females, of course, but  when it came time to make the decision to quit my job, I   d already  talked with my family a year ahead of time. I   d talked to them in    94  because I was working on Representative Toure   s campaign and we  were doing our last mail-out and one of the things that honed in with me  is that he said,    This is it, guys. This is our last campaign,    because he  was going to be term-limited. And my daughter and I were putting  stamps on envelopes and I was like,    Oh, god,    you know,    What are we  gonna do? Our representation may be gone.    My grandmother said,     Well, there will be people who will seek that office.    Never in my life  did I think that I would have the opportunity that I did and the  background knowledge that I had.  And so I had a campaign manager. His name was Garland Pruett, and he  was a good friend of Theresa   s, and it was just like a family reunion. I  had a new person, Ms. Trina Bias, who was from my church, and she  worked on various ministries. I worked on various ministries and we  were always at church, even after church hours. Finally my pastor,  Arnelius Crenshaw, put us together on a committee of four ladies   very  wonderful ladies   as administration for our chorus, for our church choir  because we worked on special projects. I worked on black history  programs, Christmas programs, homecoming was my specialty. He put  us together and we had a team of four ladies   one was a computer tech,  one was the president, I was the vice president. Ms. Trina was the  administrative glue, and her level of expertise was phenomenal. Never in  my life did I think that such a quiet person who didn   t talk but was very  skilled would say,    I   ll work for you, I   ll help you.    What better way, to  be surrounded by your spiritual family, too.  So you have your nucleus of family, you have your legislative family,  you   ve got a community-based family and then you   ve got a spiritual  core. My support system and timing was phenomenal. There was no way  I could do it any other way. So I had Theresa Hill, Garland Pruett, Trina  Bias, myself   my daughter had made the decision that she was gonna  14  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  help and then two more ladies from my church. One of them was on the  first committee of four, which was my computer person, and she came  on board and later became my bodyguard and then     You had to have a bodyguard?  Well, it   s just what we called her. They were two ladies, they were in the  military and they were very, very strict and very stern. At the time we  needed the structure and the discipline to kind of corral our volunteers,  to have that work ethic that you need in a campaign to where you have  an understanding family that will carry on without you. Those ladies  were phenomenal. I couldn   t replace them. They made it happen. They  were there at my swearing-in ceremony, and I made sure that those  ladies became my employees, too.  Did you knock on every door, or most of them?  Yes. Yes. Not only did we knock on every door, we knocked on every  door twice. And we touched them four times, two mail-outs and two  sweeps of the district and then we made robo-calls. We called for  fundraisers, we sent out fliers and mailers, and we had some help. We  had some endorsements that really made the difference because we had a  very tough primary race with four other candidates.  Male or female?  All male. I was the only female. And we were the top vote-getter in the  primary, but we didn   t reach the 51  so we had a run-off. That was  more work, more money and a short amount of time to get there. We  raised the money and we did the work and we were the top vote-getter  and became the democratic nominee. And then in fall, we had a general  election. So we jelled. We tried not to kill each other. We made some  decisions and sometimes those decisions weren   t always in the best  interest of everyone, they were in the best interest of time. When you   re  running out of time, you   ve got to have a plan. We were fortunate to  have a plan and we were also fortunate enough to understand media.  There are so many components of a campaign. You   ve got to have  someone who just focuses on fundraising. You   ve got to have someone  who just opens your mail and keeps your schedule. You   ve got to have  someone who coordinates your volunteers. You   ve got to have someone  who encourages you to sharpen your issues and keep you abreast of the  current events and then you   ve got to have a motivator. You   ve got to  have somebody that encourages you when you get tired.  And who was that?  15  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  And, man, there are various people for me.  At different times?  At different times. They were really the ladies of my Sunday school  class at church. They were a lot older and they were like,    I   m retired,  baby. What do you need?    and they would bring us food. They would  come by and put labels and stickers on. I had a community network that  was awesome, too. I was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. I  had sorority sisters that came by and made phone calls to our  constituents. They encouraged me. They wrote letters for me to other  sorority members. I had people that would call me at night and pray with  me and pray for me, and call me early in the morning and make sure I  was awake and pray for me again. So for me it wasn   t one particular  person. It was a cluster of motivators, educators, and even some of our  leaders, our current leaders, they would call and say,    You know what?  I   m proud of you. I like the way you ran your campaign. It was with  grace. It was with poise. It was with character. It was with dignity.     And that   s hard to do when people are tearing down your signs or  making assassinations on your character. I really didn   t have that  problem until we got to the general election and there was one article     and it was published by the Black Chronicle. It said something like,     Candidates for District 99 have 22 cases with the law,    or    22 run-ins  with the law    and 20 of them were all about my opponent and then two  of them were regarding to me. And one was about me taking some  roommates to court for moving out without paying the rent, and the  other one was me filing for child support for my daughter and people  would call me and say,    That wasn   t anything bad.    I said,    Well, you  know, it   s just a part of the 22 cases I guess.     They didn   t know that my daughter and her dad, we have such a great  network. We co-parent. At the time when we had our daughter, we were  young, we had just gotten out of college and we just decided that we  weren   t gonna get married at the time. The more we moved around and  the more we worked together   when people see us together, they  automatically think that we   re married and it feels like it, but we  weren   t, and we do everything together. We go on vacations together.  We talk. We do whatever we need to do. We make decisions on her  future together.  It was just awesome because he was coaching in another state and when  I got ready to quit my job I said,    Hey, I need you to come home. I need  you to be here to do this.    And he said,    I   m there,    and moved. He  said,    How much time do I have?    So he finished out that semester there  and moved back to Oklahoma, and I think he was settled in by March. I  16  Finchum  Pittman  quit in May and we made it through. So nine months without a job is a  challenge in itself. Like I said, I had family members, a great support  system, and the timing was good. I never ran against an incumbent. So  we waited our turn, we waited our turn.  Talk a little bit about election day, the last election day.  The last election day was a good day, and we worked. We started off     actually we never went to bed the night before. You kind of map out  where you   re gonna go. You map out what   s gonna be your priority  areas. By then you   ve got a feel of who votes, who doesn   t vote, and  how you   re gonna get your voters to the polls   that   s the most important  thing. Sometimes on election days, candidates   they really feel like  their job is done and they have a hard time on election day. They  struggle because everybody   s at work. Everybody   s busy, and you find  yourself looking for things to do. Well, not the Pittman campaign   not  so. We prepared the night before. We had a group of kids, a group of  volunteers, people who took off work and they came to the campaign  office and we camped out. And we had a lot of other volunteers because  some of the other campaigns were over and they kind of joined our  campaign, which was great.  It was great that it was a big election where other people were gonna be  on the ballot. That was hopeful to us because people were gonna come  out and vote anyway. So in the general election we camped out. We  ordered pizza and chicken and we put our little,    Get out to vote,     information pieces together. We let the kids stay up till about midnight  and then we started blowing up air mattresses so they could stay in the  campaign office   literally not go home. We issued out t-shirts. We  issued out locations of where we wanted our people to go to help give  rides to our elderly, make phone calls to remind people. Everybody got  an assignment the night before.  So on election day, people came from our community at five o   clock in  the morning to have coffee and doughnuts. We opened up our campaign  office early, and at six o   clock we took to the streets and we made sure  that the signs were up and out because we didn   t want to put them out  the night before just so somebody could take the signs by the next  morning. Because the polls open at seven o   clock and people could vote,  we needed people strategically located on the corners with the t-shirts  and the signs   kind of like a flood, if you will. So people had their  respective areas to go to, and they rotated every two hours. They would  come in and we   d send a different group out. So if you went out from  6:00 to 8:00 and held up a sign or put signs out in strategically-located  places so that the city wouldn   t pick them up as well, you did your duty  and you came back. And some people came back and whatever area they  17  Finchum  Pittman  worked in from 6:00 to 8:00, they may have gone to a different area  from 8:00 to 10:00 and then they came back.  Everybody met back at the office at noon. We had lunch together, and  we rotated people back out for that afternoon. We just created visibility,  and we worked on getting our people to the polls. It was a work day, and  I mean we worked up until 7:00 PM whereas some of my colleagues,  they were planning their watch-party and they were decorating   well,  we had a decorating committee. We had a team who did those things,  and Denise Williams led that team. Whenever I had a fundraiser, that  was one of the military ladies from church who said,    I   m gonna get  these helium tanks, and me and my people   at 4:00 we   re gonna go set  up the watch party. We   re gonna make sure you have everything that  you need,    balloons and streamers and cameras and a place for my  grandmother who was in a wheelchair. And my aunt, a retired educator,  moved home from Chicago to help me care for my grandmother while I  ran for office. That was her mom, and I said,    Look, I need some help,     and my mom wasn   t able to come and help me through that process, but  she was and like I said, it was about timing. It was about our season, and  we were trying to walk in purpose and we did.  You have to do it again this next summer?  Yes, I do. Yes, I do, and it   ll be so much easier. It   s not an open seat. We  are the incumbent. We do great incumbent protection, so we really touch  our constituents. We really stay in contact with our community. I have a  radio talk show every Friday. It   s a live show,    The Anastasia Pittman  Show,    and my constituents are able to call in, ask questions about any  topic. We have guests that come in the studio and share with the  community to keep them informed. I mail out a newsletter every week,  of 500 a week, and I do that whether we   re in the office or out of the  office. That   s where my executive assistant is empowered to make  decisions on my behalf when I   m not there. And it   s real unique, it   s real  unique because I   m a people person. I like to spend time with people,  love to hug, love to smile and love to talk. So for me staying on task was  a challenge.  My legislative assistant is sequential. She   s time-oriented. She   s  conscious of where you need to be, when you need to be there, what  information you need to have while you   re on your way. That was very  helpful to me, and I never thought I   d meet anybody like that. I never  even thought I would need someone like that until we worked together  on some various church projects, and it was wonderful. I   d never met  her before then, and I met her   able to work with her six years prior  to   I knew her six years, but we really worked closely together two  years prior to me getting ready to run for office. She was like,    You   re  18  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  gonna quit your job,    and it was great. She said,    I   ll be there.     All the pieces of the puzzle came together.  At the right time. I never had anything before I needed it. The only thing  that I laid before them when people met me was the groundwork. The  foundation was laid, the community connection was there, the primary  relationships with people in the legislature, people who wrote policy,  people who   that was their arena, they came. And fortunately I was able  to say,    Good morning,    to all of them for seven years, and so it wasn   t  hard. And I had great opponents. I had great candidates, highly qualified  candidates   some older, some younger, and then some with a little less  experience, but they had name recognition which is generally all you  need. The candidates with name recognition were the ones who maybe  were less experienced in legislative stuff, but their family had a nucleus  in the community as well and you   re talking about struggling, dividing  our community. People knew both of us and people knew both of our  parents and grandparents and it was hard for them to make a decision.  Based on the information provided, which Ms. Trina, my legislative  assistant, was my graphics designer, she was able to do the PowerPoint  presentations that I need. She designed my literature and my walk cards.  We didn   t have the money to do that because when you   re in a very  competitive primary, most democrats pull their hands and then it   s  whoever comes out of the primary victorious that then we all jump on  board to assist. But during that time when you don   t have the  endorsement of the incumbent   I didn   t have the endorsement of the  incumbent   he was my friend and I worked on his campaign, but when  it came down to it, one of the guys running against me was his Little  League baseball player. He had to make a decision and so he chose to  support him, and he called me and he let know and I said,    No problem.     And we ran a great campaign. We just outworked them. We didn   t  always have the money to do certain things, but when we made the  design of what we had, it was very professional. There were no mistakes  and it was very colorful. So we strategically utilized our money and a lot  of sweat equity. We walked a lot, so it was great.  In the hot sun, I   m sure.  It was great.  Once you were elected, let   s move forward a little bit. The swearing-in  day, was your grandmother there?  Yes. Yes. Man, just proud as ever. A dream come true for her. She had  never graduated high school. She worked. She was a nurse, and she was  19  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  our Sunday school teacher and she just kind of loved on the community.  Everybody loved Granny, and that   s what she was called. Even when  she wasn   t your granny, that   s what you called her and she was there  front-row, front and center. My family was there. My brother and his  family were there. Everybody   my church family   even the leaders in  the community that I had worked for   my NAACP president was there.  The black caucus members were there. My pastors in the community  that supported me were there. Senator Angela Monson was there and on  the program. I just love her so much because she   s genuine. She   s highly  respected in the area, and for her to be the first African-American female  president of the National Conference of State Legislators, and the first  Oklahoman. It was great to have been under her leadership and for her to  watch me grow and for her to watch me develop. It was great.  The only person that was absent was the Honorable Vicki Miles-  LaGrange, and she sent a letter. She couldn   t be present, but she made  her presence known, and the letter was read and it was great   and we  just   it was a great day. I had a private swearing-in prior to all of the  other elected officials. I wanted to do a private ceremony because so  many people had worked so hard to get me there. When I found out that  we were going to be limited to two guests   how do you tell your  significant other,    Well, it   s either you or my mom   ? We flew my mom  down here from California. My dad   s present. My brothers and sisters  are present. My daughter, my son   s present. My grandmother   s there. So  there was no way I was gonna be able to choose from my sorority  sisters, my Sunday school class ladies who helped make phone calls and  encouraged me, my community friends and family, people that my  family have touched and they watched me grow up so they were proud,  too. Former educators, different people that I have worked with, a school  that I used to teach at   I had all my schools there. Learner   s Academy  was a school I used to teach Spanish at. Kip Reach College Preparatory,  I invited those kids because I was the PTA president for four years there.  Marcus Garvey Leadership Academy played the African drums for me.  We had a very moving ceremony at 10:00 that morning and     Here? Or at the     At the Capitol, in the House chambers   no one else was there, it was  just my private ceremony. My best friend   very close friend, who   s also  a judge   Judge Tammy Bass-Lesure was my swearing-in magistrate and  her daughter was my god-daughter and her daughter was able to hold the  Bible for me. She was four so she was just small enough to hold the  Bible. It was just very moving, very intimate for me. Great day. Great  day in history, great day in history.  Which two did you pick to go for the official   the big one?  20  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  The big one?  Was there anyone else?  I   m trying to think of who was there. I took my daughter, because I  brought her on the floor, and I think her dad was in the gallery because  my grandparents were tired. They were still there but they needed to go  and eat because I think we had to be out of the chamber at noon and  back at 1:30 to be sworn in. I think those are the only two that were with  me at the time. So it was great, it was great, it was great.  Okay, we   ll move further ahead then and talk about the first bill you  presented on the floor.  One of my first bills was in education and it was about teacher  certifications and being nationally-certified versus just the regular  certification giving them some type of incentive to become nationally-certified.  We had so many at-risk schools, and to give them a certain  percentage because it costs so much money to go and be nationally-certified,  but to give them a break on that. I love education. I love health.  Some of the committees that I served on I was able to introduce some  bills in those areas.  Some of my more controversial bills were trying to develop a minority  task force for HIV and AIDS. At the time, after celebrating 25 years of  the epidemic   25, 26 years, the national rate for African American  females was increasing. Fifty   of all the new cases were African  Americans and three-to-one, it was females to males. I couldn   t figure  out what the new epidemic was, what the new phenomenon was,  because it was perceived in the African-American community as an off-type  of disease. It was not in the African-American community. It was  related to homophobia. It was related to gay male disease. Twenty-five  years later, children were being infected, and not just African-Americans  but all of the minorities   Native Americans, Hispanics   they were  increasing, and I couldn   t figure out why.  I had wanted to do research on it to find out if it was accessibility to  health care or   which some of the things I did find out, they had  partners who were in prison and the ex-offenders when they were  released had more than one partner. So if you   ve got three females to  each male, that would explain some of the behavior because it was  unheard of for African-American female women to have such an  increasing and alarming rate nationwide. It wasn   t just in Oklahoma, it  was nationwide. And promiscuity is just not that prominent in the  African-American community. These women thought that they were in  heterosexual, monogamous relationships and they were not. They were  21  all being infected. So it was unfortunate, and I wanted to bring that to  the forefront, bring some light to it.  We weren   t able to get the urgency there because after 25 years with  prevention and treatment and all those things available, it just wasn   t a  priority. Then when you have to find things that accommodate both rural  and urban legislators, that   s your primary challenge. You have to find  things that are non-partisan in legislative agenda items, and that   s  sometimes difficult to do because you are the voice of your constituents.  You have to represent the people that elected you. Now fortunately for  me, I have a very diverse constituency base. I have some in poverty. I  have some that are affluent. I have a good diverse population that vote,  so it   s easy for me to attack some of our senior issues, educational  issues.  One of the things we   re most proud of is funding the OHLAP   Oklahoma Higher Leaning Access Program  program for education and  that   s Oklahoma   s promise to our greatest resource and that   s our  children, that   s our future, and I love it. And even one of my greatest  challenges in the legislature during my first session was voting for an  education bill. It was authored by one of my colleagues, Representative  Jabar Shumate. We often tell people we are a match made in the House.  We both attended the University of Oklahoma and so we have a  network, a very good base. He   s from Tulsa and I   m from Oklahoma  City, but he introduced a bill that would allow charter schools to be  developed in Tulsa County and Oklahoma County. You can do four  different schools per year and almost any agency could open up a  school. It was too broad for me. It was too open.  Public education was a priority for me, even though both of my children  were in charter schools. They were in my district, and Kipp Reach was a  national program that we were all proud of. Tracy McDaniel was the  principal and my daughter was there. I was the PTA president, and it  was an enterprise school at the time she entered which later progressed  into a charter school. I wasn   t going to remove her because they were  still governed by the Oklahoma Board of Education. So it wasn   t a full-fledged  charter school at the time and it was still being governed and  regulated by the public school system. But this particular bill would  allow other higher institutions   like other universities, maybe a hospital,  another company   to open up four new schools per year every year,  which means that the funding that we   re so limited on in the state was  going to be disenfranchised by the money following the child.  Now granted, he had a very serious problem in Tulsa and the Tulsa local  officials could not handle that problem. It became a state issue for him.  And I wanted to vote for the bill. I even debated the bill and said,    I   m  22  Finchum  for charter schools, love them all the way. I   ve got 13 in my district,  don   t have a problem.    But at the time, it was not just affecting him, the  bill was affecting Oklahoma County, which we did not have the  problem. So my struggle in that decision-making process was voting for  something that I believed in, voting for a colleague that I supported, but  standing firmly for the voices of those who are unheard, and those are  the parents and grandparents of the children who don   t have a choice.  They must go to public schools. And even for public schools who cannot  choose their children. They get the best and they get the worst, and they  have to educate them both with what little we appropriate because we  don   t always keep our promises in the legislature.  So that was my greatest struggle, to have children in a charter school and  not vote for a charter school bill   to stand for children in public schools  for Oklahoma County. If it had just been a Tulsa bill only, then I would  have voted for it hands-down, but it was just too broad. It was going to  take the money that was designed to educate a public educational system  and it was going to allow any agency to develop a new school. That  money was gonna go to that school if the children left that school  district   and it didn   t cap it. I mean, if you could create something four  times in a year, 20 years from now what would you have? You   d have a  variety and   which, I think choice is great, I don   t think public schools  are the answer for everybody.  I certainly am a product of public schools, loved it, did well in it, and  that   s because I believed in my teachers and they believed in relevant  teaching. They believed in applying curriculum. They believed in  scaffolding. They took children where they were, whether you were poor  or rich or whether you had all the basic skills or not, and they made you  learn and you wanted to learn. Well, now we struggle with the  challenges of diversity, language barriers. We have so many socio-economic  backgrounds. We have different levels of certifications. We  have so many teachers who still teach, but they   re uncertified.  We have teachers who get stuck with at-risk schools, and they   re two  years away from retirement. So it   s not as vibrant, and then you get new  teachers who really don   t have basic people skills or classroom  managerial skills. They don   t have their objectives and their goals  developed yet. They   re just on-fire to teach, but then when you put them  in an at-risk school, they have disciplinary problems and the children are  not learning. It is not because they won   t but because they feel the  teacher   s not prepared or she   s been intimidated by someone   s parents.  Well back then, parents were partners and if you got in trouble at school,  by golly you got in trouble at home.  You did.  23  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  And counselors were able to call. They knew you and they knew your  siblings. After my brother went through before me and even had adopted  families   you know, my step-sisters went before me   by the time I got  to school, they knew exactly who I was. I had to be able to hold my own  and say,    No. Don   t pigeon-hole me. I am a good student. I   m a leader  in my own right.    I did what I was told to do and they made provisions  for me. But it wasn   t because of me. It was because I had educators in  my family. When you can look back on Oklahoma   s history and say,     Well, I remember your uncle, Delbert Burnett, was the principal at  Moon Middle School.    So if you   re at another middle school and your  uncle is the principal over here, people know who you are. If your  grandfather   s the musician who   s teaching at all the fifth-year centers  and you just came out of fifth grade, people know.    I can call your  grandpa,    you know, you   re gonna obey. My aunt was the shorthand  teacher at Douglas. My father   s mother, my grandmother, was home  economics teacher, so we couldn   t stray too far from the straight and  narrow. We had to make our own way. We had to say,    Hey, you don   t  have to call anybody for me. I   m ready. I   m here and I   m ready to  learn.     You brought that same mentality into the House, too, I   d say and you  were here to learn a little bit, too, even though you knew a lot coming  in?  Yes, but I was here to learn.  Once you were here, did you have a mentor?  Yes. Yes. When I got here, I   m still able to call Representative Toure  and ask questions and meet with him, still able to call Senator Angela  Monson, ask questions on direction and leadership. But sometimes my  colleagues, we collaborate because we have a new way of thinking in the  legislature. So I   ve had mentors. Danny Morgan who was my  democratic leader   he   s always been available to me, but I still have  people who have lobbied and their parents were lobbyists, so we kind of  grew. People like Gary Huddleston   just sweet, sweet man   but his dad  was a lobbyist and he was a staffer with the Senate before he became a  lobbyist. Those were relationships that we developed, and we can call  various lobbyists. I can still call my past legislators who were my  representatives. I still call on Representative Kevin Cox for leadership  goals and ideas.  But the mindset is different now. There   s a paradigm shift, and for me  being term-limited gives us a unique way of leading. We   ve got to hit  the ground running. You   d better elect officials who are already in-tune  with the issue, the process. Don   t send anybody new who doesn   t have  24  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  any of that background because they   ll get hammered on the floor. Even  when you have the background knowledge, you can get shut down, shut  out, hammered on the floor. You   ve got to make primary relationships,  and you   ve got to work across the aisle. You have to know how to  communicate, articulate and have some integrity, honesty, keep your  word.  People often ask me,    You   re a Christian. Why are you in politics? All  they do is this or all they do is that.    And I let them know that, well then,  it   s time for Christians to possess the land. If God says you are chosen,  then why won   t you take the leadership rein? Why won   t you keep your  promise, be honest? Don   t say,    Well, a deal is a deal until a better deal  comes along.    That   s usually how people function because they   re  trying to move their agenda and sometimes it   s with timing, and I  believe in timing. I believe in seasons, and sometimes if it   s not your  turn, it   s not your turn but communicate that effectively to your  constituents because they may send you to be the voice for a particular  issue and you can be that voice all day long. It doesn   t mean your bills  are gonna get heard. They may not make it through committee, but you  made their presence known. You made your other colleagues aware, and  you have to be able to do that within 12 years, if you stay the entire 12  years. You may have two election cycles and then have an opponent  that   s phenomenal.  Some of our candidates have opponents every two years and I don   t  know if that says they   re looking for somebody to do a better job or if  that just simply says the person that they elected at the time doesn   t  represent their voice. So we   ve got 12 years   that   s it. It   s unfortunate  because the people who laid the groundwork for me, the legislators prior  to me   the Hannah Atkins   , the Freddye Williams   , the Don Ross    and  Maxine Horners   , the Vicki Miles La-Grange, the Angela Monsons        all of those people had time, if you will. You know, Kevin Cox was in  the legislature for 23 years and then term limits kicked in which capped  him out at 23 years. Opio Toure had 13 years before term limits put a lid  on it. But what would have happened if Angela  Monson  could have  been in office for 30 or 40 years? We no longer have that ability, so  we   ve got to really be connected. We really have to be in touch with the  things we want to accomplish and know it ahead of time, know who you  need to talk to get those things done.  What were some of the things that you wanted to     To accomplish? I had a very successful first session.  You did?  25  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Yes, I enjoyed it   a lot of things I was able to accomplish. Some of  them are not always legislative accomplishments. There are things that  you can accomplish just through budget, just through networking, just  through bringing agencies together to talk because they   ve been in  rivalry for so long fighting over the same amount of appropriations.     Well, this particular state agency hasn   t had a budget increase in 11 or  12 years. This one gets an increase every year. Well, what   s the  significance of their work and how are they articulating their needs?    So  sometimes we progress.  I like to support children   s issues. Childhood obesity is just everywhere.  I think kids and the new wave technology   we   re building muscles in  our thumbs, but when I was a kid, kids were made to go outside. Recess  was a part of our daily process, and now recess is optional, P.E. is  optional, and so we   re suffering for it. Our lifestyles, our livelihood, is  telling you that our children watch too much TV or they   re not in tune  with national happenings and things that are going on. I like educational  issues. For me, being a champion in education and being a champion for  children   I often ask myself when I look in the mirror   because of the  people who have paved the way for me, I stand on the shoulders of  giants. And the eyes of the children, the eyes of the future look at us as if  we can see beyond our time.  One of the things I frequently ask myself is,    Who   s for kids and who   s  just kidding?    because I cannot afford to not make the decisions that  affect other people not count. It   s kind of like playing chess. You don   t  make a move if it   s not going to count, and so my first session, I think  we did very well. I was able to raise awareness for the things that I felt  were important. I was able to keep my promise on the issues that I was  going to support   quality education, public safety for seniors, health  care, accessible and affordable health care. I was able to co-author the     All Kids Act,    Senate Bill 424, and was very excited about the  governor signing that bill. That was one of my first bills that he signed,  and to receive the pen from the governor and be standing next to Jari  Askins, a phenomenal woman, the lieutenant governor   just, you know,  it was a beautiful thing. Even to have the lieutenant governor come to  church with me. We were both in our run-off election and I asked her to  come to church with me and she did. People were able to put a face with  who they voted for and they were ready to vote again, and they did and  we were successful.  What has been one of your biggest struggles or have you had one?  Well, I have had a struggle and that was the HIV bill that did not,  unfortunately, get an interim study.  26  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  This year.  This year. So we may raise the awareness again because we   re always  going to be at the Capitol testing the availability of testing nationwide.  We deal with AIDS in Africa, but to have people with health care     affordable health care   being accessible to health care. Fifty   of all the  new cases should not be people who are already educated, having access  to information, but getting our spiritual leaders to move past endorsing  best practices or endorsing education and information. Abstinence is a  great thing. I think abstinence worked for us. It worked for me. We  made it through college. We didn   t have a lot of high school teenage  pregnancies.  We have to say that the core and the nucleus of education begins at  home   it begins at home. And if no one   s talking about it   I want to see  my daughter and my son grow and flourish. I want to see my  grandchildren not have to worry about,    Oh, my god.    You know,    I  want to marry this person. I   m in love with this person, but they won   t  get tested. I need to know.    I don   t want that to be at the forefront of a  conversation 25 years later. Fifty years after this epidemic has been  introduced to our society and our world, we should have a better way of  addressing health disparities. That is a challenge for me   health  disparities.  On the other side of that   of the cultural social aspects of the House     have you noticed any differences or was it what you expected it to be?  Well, yes and more. It was what I expected and more. It   s been a breath  of fresh air because not everyone sets a goal and reaches it and lives to  breathe it and embrace it. It   s been wonderful for me. I now serve on the  Native American caucus. I am the secretary of the Native American  caucus, which is a fairly newly-formed caucus. I think it was introduced  two years prior to me being elected. I think 2004 is when they began to  start formulating a non-partisan body that could work together on  common goals and issues. I serve as the freshman caucus and one of the  things that startled me in 2007 is I   m the only African-American female  in the House of Representatives, and I never thought about it before until  someone else brought it to my attention. There are four elected African-  Americans in the legislature, and I   m the only female, so people listen to  you. People wait to see what you   re gonna vote on.  People come and they say,    Well, she is not really the new kid on the  block. She   s just a fresh face on the floor. She really has a grasp on her  community, a historical background with educators and entrepreneurs  and medical people. She   s got a legislative resume. She   s got a political  resume. What is her take on it?    And so I   ve been fortunate enough to  27  Finchum  Pittman  have people come and ask me what my opinion is, and even ask me to  run for a different office, ask me what my goals are in the legislature        What do you want to do?       Well, let me think about it,    because I  haven   t really sat down and penned it out, you know. After that last ten  years and being here, I need to sit down and do it again.  Run for the Senate?  Run for the Senate. And if term limits will allow me to do that, I   m  certainly gonna look forward to looking at that as an option. If it   s not  gonna benefit me, then why not stay where you are? Because it will  allow you to finish out your term, but if you in mid-term have an off-season  election   sure, go for it. Why not? Because then you don   t have  to resign your current seat to run. But if you   ve got to cut off your  current position that you   re effective in and you   re at the end of your  tenure   well don   t cut off your nose to spite your face. Hold your  position and stay there and be effective.  If it is in store for me to be the Senator, I certainly would embrace that. I  would certainly embrace being a candidate for Congress or the U.S.  House of Representatives, a U.S. Senate candidate or as an elected  official on a higher level. I would love to be an ambassador to another  country. There   s just so many things we can do, and that   s why being a  legislator to me is so important because it   s more than just supporting or  opposing policy. You have the voice of the community. You can  mobilize voters, and you can actually be that bridge that makes the  connection between people and politics. If you put people before  politics, you most often will promote public progress every time. And  that   s what   s beneficial to me, to walk in that purpose, in that light,  make a difference for the short time that God has allowed you to be  there   change some lives. You really have the power to do that.  I don   t know what happens to people who lose focus. I don   t know what  discourages them or what roadblocks they   ve had, but to me barriers are  not boundaries. You can overcome every obstacle. There are so many  different venues. There   s room for everybody to lead, but with that  comes responsibility, accountability, accessibility, and sometimes you  have to take action. One of my challenges was to stand when the  Cherokee nation decided they were going to dis-enroll Cherokee  Freedman. I didn   t have that problem in my tribe, but we certainly  endured that prior to the Cherokee Nation doing that. Making the  decision to vote out Cherokee Freedman was historical. How could you  not adhere to a treaty in 1866   if that   s the date   to say,    These people  are not Native American   ? Well, when the treaty says,    By marriage, by  adoption or by blood,    then why do you focus on blood quantity only if  it can be by marriage or adoption? And then when you can trace your  28  Finchum  Pittman  ancestry back to the Dawes Rolls, which there were two categories of  Dawes Rolls, where you had people who, from the government, decided  who was Native American and who weren   t based on the way they  looked.  And then you had a Freedman Roll only specifically for African-  Americans, and if you ever go back to any African-American ancestry,  they most often always cross the bloodline of Native Americans. It   s  very rare that you don   t, because my family had a unique position. When  I was at the University of Oklahoma, one of the interviews that was done  was,    Why does Anastasia Pittman have on a black arm band?    And  they didn   t know that my family didn   t celebrate the Land Run of    89  because my grandmother is Cherokee and Seminole and my grandfather  is Seminole and African-American. And so they didn   t realize that when  you are slaves of a tribe that are freed within the tribe because you have  found sanctuary in that tribe from another form of slavery, you begin to  integrate and marry and bear children. When you can trace your ancestry  back to a Native American chief and then later on somebody comes  along and they look at you and they say,    Well, I just don   t see Native  American.    And then you   re compared to someone who   s sitting next to  you who has blond hair and blue eyes and they   re able to benefit from  the Native American reservations, the health care, the educational  scholarships, the housing, and you   re thinking,    They look more as  though they have pure European blood.    But if I brought you my  grandmother you would say,    Wow. Look at the features. Her hair, the  braids.    When she was a little girl, she could wrap braids around her  head and still have the length of her hair, and her facial features. I   ll  bring you a picture. I   ve got a four-generation picture     That would be great.     of my grandmother, my mother, myself and my daughter. It   s the  most unique picture in our family because the Seminole women are the  teachers in the family. My mother looks so much like my grandmother  and then if you look at me and my mother, we have similarities. Then  my daughter and I have similarities, and for me to embrace that culture  and embrace that heritage, that   s my bloodline. I can   t change that, but  to have someone reject you again and again whether it   s in race or  culture or society or politics or religion or education   it   s a constant  struggle, it   s a constant battle. I think my family has done a great job of  developing a platform that says,    Challenges will always be there. Have  the character and the courage to obtain your goal, and when you do that,  you never know what you may accomplish.     My great-grandfather on my dad   s side is Irish, and he was African-  American and Irish and my grandmother, my dad   s mother, has fiery red  29  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  hair and green eyes with freckles. So I have a red grandma and I have a  white grandma, but she married my grandfather, who is African-  American, and so my dad has fair skin and freckles. My mother, being a  little darker and being Native American and African American   and  then I have African American and Irish, and we merge. People often  play with my daughter   s hair and they wonder,    Wow, how   d you do  this? How   d you make this work?    But it   s unique. It   s a unique history,  and I   m looking forward to an extraordinary future.  My great-grandfather on my dad   s side was an entrepreneur. He was in  the Tulsa Race Riots, and he wasn   t recorded because he had fair skin.  He had different color eyes. So he received a phone call and was able to  leave Tulsa with his family. My grandmother, Juanita Burnett at the  time   and his name was Abner Burnett   he owned a Tulsa grocery  store in Greenwood   and he was told,    You better get out. Get your  family.    And they moved to California when my grandmother was two  and they moved back to Oklahoma City. He opened up grocery stores all  over Oklahoma. He even had a grocery store down in Deep Deuce, what  we now call Bricktown. He owned a grocery store there   Burnett   s  Grocery Store down on First and Central, or Second and Central.  There   s nothing there to this day because he had a 100 year lease, and so  that 100 years will be up soon and someone will own that property.  He had a grocery store in Taft. He had a grocery store in Tulsa. He had a  grocery store in Boley. He had a grocery store in another city besides  Oklahoma City and my uncle, Delbert Burnett, ran the store. My uncle,  Fay Burnett, ran the store   which was his son, his two sons, my  grandmother   s brothers   and even my dad worked as a grocer and a  sacker at a family grocery store. And people were able to come across  town. The handmaids that worked for people who lived in Nichols Hills  came because they could get groceries on their signature and pay later  and keep their houses stocked. So I   ve just had such a phenomenal  background.  That would be of great use on the floor, I would think.  Man, and it has been, and it has been. And it   s also empowered me. It  has given me courage. It has given me flexibility, understanding. They  don   t know what I   m going to decide, so they really have to pay  attention to my votes and to my voice. I don   t speak very often, but  when I do it   s a very strong and passionate type of presentation. All my  bills on the floor, I haven   t had any voted down, so I   m thankful for that.  Now let   s hope that we will continue that success during my tenure but  we   ve be challenged.  To change gears just a little bit   have you noticed any gender  30  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  differences?  Not toward me, and that   s probably because I choose not to see certain  things. They   re there. We certainly have a long way to go. We   ve come  a long way, but there are still some of my colleagues on the republican  side of the aisle   and I watch them talk to their female colleagues and  their officials   same   and they were elected the same way the male  colleagues were, but they   re not treated the same. And I haven   t had the  misfortune of being mistreated, so I haven   t had that. Maybe it   s because  my approach is a little different too. Some women are kind of brash and  harsh and sometimes they   ve been there for quite some time and they   re  just at the point where they say whatever they think. That may be the  way to go when I get older but right now, I   m a team player.  I listen. I look, listen and learn, and those are the things that I want to do  because once you   ve established that rapport and they understand who  you are, what you stand for, your values, your mission, your  objectives   all those things come into play as to what people will  approach you with. It   s kind of like having blood on the doorpost. Some  people just pass me by. They know I   m not for it, don   t talk to me about  it, it   s a moot point. And you may want to spend the rest of your time in  a significant way by asking people who are really interested or haven   t  really made a firm decision on their beliefs.  Well, describe a typical day for you. During session, how early do you  get here and how late do you stay?  Wow. Now, I do stay a long time. Now when I get there, we have to be  at work at 8:30   typical day   so sometimes we have a 7:30 breakfast  meeting at the Capitol hosted by a state agency or a local lobbyist.  Something like that will get us there on time. Anytime you feed us, we  can make it, but we   re there probably at 7:30 for a breakfast. At 8:30,  we   re in our offices. We   ve already got a stack of phone calls to return.  You come in, you grab your mail and you look at that stack and you put  it in your computer bag so that you can check it when you have a break  on the floor. Most often times, you won   t get a break because you have  bills. Thank God we   ve gone to an electronic version of looking at bills,  so we use less paper, but most of the times when technology, as it will  do, won   t allow you to make the corrections or receive the last drafted  version of a bill or proposed legislation. You have to have that hard copy  on your desk.  So coming in at 8:30   at 9:00 when you hear that bell ring, that   s your  roll call and to see those pages go up and down the floor saying,    House  roll call,    that   s to let you know to get all your bills, get all your mail,  get all your phone messages, get downstairs to your desk so you can  31  Finchum  Pittman  check in. Once you   re at your desk and you check in, then session  begins. They close the doors, the Sergeant at Arms are behind the doors  where you can   t enter in and out, unless you   re a legislator. They shut  sometimes the pages out if they   re not already in   and we pray to open  up and we introduce our doctor of the day. We introduce our chaplain of  the day. We have our announcements. We introduce people who are  sitting in the gallery. We may have visitors that come to the Capitol that  day, and we introduce them. Now after all of the introductions of your  family and friends or agencies that are visiting you for whatever their  legislative day is at the Capitol, then you begin the floor agenda.  Now the floor calendar has various bills on it. You may get through all  those bills that day, you may not, and depending on the debate on that  bill   whether it   s a rural or urban issue or whether it   s a power struggle  of whose bills. If it   s the Speaker   s bills, you   re gonna hear most of  them. If it   s someone else   s bills, a different colleague   s bills, it depends.  We are in a historical state, a state that we   ve never been in before in the  legislature, where the republicans have control and because of that, the  order of the bills can be any way they decide. As with the democrats  being in control, what passes through committee, it   s gonna be the  majority of their bills. So even you may have great ideas and you may  have a great stance on it. You may even have all the votes to pass it     but if it   s not heard or not called up on the floor calendar, you won   t get  it through that day. And it depends, because we draft about twice or  three times as many legislative pieces than we actually hear and pass,  so     A lot of reading.  A lot of reading. A lot of reading   and you stay up late, because even  after session is over you may have a dinner engagement right after  session so you leave everything there because it   s a legislative dinner  engagement. It   s not with your family or your friends, it   s an  organization that   s trying to inform you or empower you regarding their  issues, their budget, their request   certain things. They keep you  abreast, they keep you educated. And in addition to that, you come back  to work because you still have phone calls that you made in between and  those people called you back and it   s a constant   it   s not exhausting, but  there   s no downtime. If you feel like you have downtime, there   s  something that you could be doing, whether it   s reading bills for the next  day, preparing for your committee meetings that you sit on, preparing  letters to your constituents that need to go out to keep them informed,  just simply writing thank-you notes to the people that support you, the  people that keep you abreast, the people that bring you little gifts that  brighten your day.  32  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  You never know what people are going through during the day, and to  get a gift basket that says,    Hey,    and it   s this big yellow happy face that  says,    You   re doing a great job.    It kind of breaks the ice because  tensions flair when you see other members of your caucus upset or either  angry with each other because both of them have the same bill   who   s  gonna close out a bill? Or they should co-author on each bill, but one  legislator didn   t ask the other one, or you   ve got different caucuses  within your caucus, and those people may not agree with the leader. So a  typical day, you may have two meetings that are your committee  meetings. You   ll be in session. After session, you will have a couple of  additional engagements to go to, so even though we have to be there at  8:30, my day really starts at 9:00 and it doesn   t end sometimes even  after 9:00 at night. You   re a public servant.  Who takes care of your children when you   re     Well, they   re big. Now my children are self-sufficient.  That helps.  My children are self-sufficient. My son   s 19 and he   s in the Navy, and  my daughter   s 14   and that   s what I have a lifestyle manager for. My  legislative assistant after hours becomes my lifestyle manager. She will  take my grandmother to the grocery store. She will pick my daughter up  from school or make sure my dog gets a haircut   just some personal  things that I need done. I have some ladies who really support that. Even  my daughter   s dad will do whatever you ask him to do, he   ll do it, but  you   ve got to catch him because his schedule   s just as busy as mine and  that   s how we are able to get things on the go. He   ll say,    Well, I   ll pick  her up. I   ll drop her off to do this and you pick her up from there, and  we   ll get it done.     A support system as a legislator is the most important thing, and I can   t  imagine when people lose their spouse or a child during session   a  loved one is most often always difficult, but a parent    I   ve been so  blessed. I   ve been so fortunate to have both parents living, both  grandmothers living. My grandfathers have passed on, but they left such  history that when people see me they say,    You   re Earl Pittman   s  granddaughter. You   re the musician   s granddaughter.       Yes, I am.     They   re like,    Man, he taught me so much,    and it   s just refreshing to  hear those stories. It   s just refreshing.  Any advice you would give other women thinking about running?  Absolutely, absolutely. Send them to me. Maybe I   ll write a book or  something that will help them. But balance is the most important thing.  33  Finchum  Pittman  Balance your brain, balance your body, balance your beauty   but  you   ve got to balance the challenges of the legislature. And most often  times, it   s a natural ability. Women are innately equipped to deal with  problems, issues. They   ve been doing it all their lives. But you   ve got to  know when to let go. You   ve got to know when to say,    This battle is  not mine. It   s personal for whoever   s bringing it to the table. If I can  help them, I will, but if I can   t, don   t allow it to consume you. Don   t  take it home. You   ve got to separate it,    because I promise you   my  children could care less about me being a legislator. I   ve always been  busy and at home, they expect dinner. They expect you to help them  with their homework, and they still get in the bed with you. You know,  my son   s very large   he   s tall, and he hangs off the edge of the bed and  my daughter   s in the middle. It   s like,    God, don   t I get any privacy?     No, because they haven   t seen you. But take a moment for you, take a  moment to refresh, revive yourself, rejuvenate, have a moment of  silence, meditate. If you need to get up 30 minutes earlier so that you   re  up before everyone else. Exercise   that always keeps your stamina,  your endurance   people ask me often,    How do you run so much and  never get tired?    You get     And your answer is?     you get tired, but you get a second wind when you   re doing the right  thing. How can you sleep when you know you   re the deciding vote?  When you   ve got to make the last decision or they   re waiting on your  letter of approval, they   re waiting on your letter of support, they   re  waiting on you to document what occurred. They may have everyone  else   s version, but,    I wonder what Representative Pittman thinks?     That   s humbling to me, and I don   t take the mandate that God has on my  life lightly, so I don   t go to sleep, and we will work all night.  But you   ve got to have someone who   s with you who   s understanding  who will allow you to do that. He doesn   t complain. He doesn   t   he  says,    I   m going to bed,    and will go to bed. (Laughs) To balance that  physically, emotionally and spiritually, you   ve got to do it, because  politically it can consume you.  And you will have that drive. You   ve got to have that fire in the belly.  You   ve got to be willing to go the extra mile, and you   ve got to be  willing to work when your opponents won   t work. You know, people  ask me,    God, you   re the only lady in this race   what are you gonna  do?    And I say,    They   ve got to out-work me.    If they want it, they   ve  got to come and get it because the title I   m reaching for, and I   m not  gonna look back   I   m gonna move forward   and to run a campaign,  you really need all the components filled because you can   t run a great  campaign without money.  34  It   s unfortunate that the stakes are so high now that we have to raise so  much money and there   s no cap and all that. Some states have caps,  some states don   t. They have caps as you go higher, but to run a  50,000  dollar campaign   and we had to inch by inch raise that money. That   s  nothing compared to people who have to raise a million dollars before  they can even get into the race. It shouldn   t be about the money that you  raise. It should be about the issues that you   re going to champion  because the people   s voice most often times gets lost in the shuffle when  you become a stickler for      I   m gonna run a perfect campaign.    Then  you forget about the people you serve.  Then when you get in the legislature and you say,    I   m gonna do great  bills,    but the ideas come from the people. I teach classes on  representative democracy. I go to local high schools. I go to middle  schools and share with children that there is a significance to your vote  and your voice, but how do you display your ideas? How do you  compromise? Because they may often view political officials as sell-outs     they didn   t do what they said they were gonna do, they didn   t  keep their promise or they didn   t do it to the full extent. But sometimes  in a strong position   and you feel very strongly and passionately about a  position   someone else may have the same idea across the aisle, but  they   ve got a different spin to it that you never thought about that may  be a good spin and it   s a compromise. If you said no to the idea   or the     friendly amendment    is what we call it   you may very well blow the  whole idea because theirs is gonna prevail. Or that friendly amendment  may sound great to everybody else. It even sounds great to you but  because you were a stickler by saying,    No, my constituents only want  this,    they don   t get anything because you didn   t balance the issue. You  didn   t use discretion. You were only hard-core. You were a bulldog, and  now they have nothing. How do you explain that to them? How do you  go back to your constituents and say,    We lost, but I represented your  voice. I   m gonna continue to represent your voice,    but what are we  accomplishing? Are we moving Oklahoma forward?  We stand here on the shoulders of our forefathers. People in my family  remember when they could not vote at all, so voting became a priority.  In my family, voting became like driving cars   at 16, you wanted a  driver   s license, but at 18 my family, we   re going to the election board  with you and you   re gonna fill out this card that says you   re gonna vote  because we still have people living who couldn   t. To have four or five  generations in your family, it   s awesome to sit at your elder   s feet. It   s  not often always pleasant because sometimes they   re eating food while  they   re talking to you or they may pause and go somewhere and come  back and you   ve got to be still to get the whole story. They   re oral, they  don   t write anything down and that   s difficult because some of the  things you don   t have to repeat when you learn lessons in life and  35  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  lessons in history, and they were great historians.  So for me, voting and empowering other people to vote and helping  them understand the political process, embracing them by teaching  representative democracy is so important to me. I don   t want people to  think they can   t do what we do. And Senator Monson is the one that  brought that home for me. I had my little life mapped out and said,    I   m  gonna go to law school. I   m gonna do this. I   m gonna do that,    and she  just said,    Anastasia, you know me. You don   t have to be an attorney to  do what I do,    and that was my wake-up call. That was   you know, get  off of the honing in on,    I must do well in this, I must do well in this.     You can be an elected official, and it   s not always gonna be easy, but  we   re paving the way for it to get better. What I hope to bring to the  table is fresh ideas to continue to walk in purpose and to fight for  Oklahoma people, to work for Oklahoma progress, and make Oklahoma  proud. That   s what I hope to do in the legislature during my tenure.  I have a very unique position. Being elected in 2006 gives me the  opportunity to look at our past elected officials and even serve in the  first century of the history of this state, and then take that leadership into  the second century. I don   t know how many people will embrace that.  They   ve had one foot in the first 100 years and their second foot is in the  second 100 years. We   ve got a unique ability to change the face of  Oklahoma, change the face of politics. Females are now included, and it  took a female to do it when it wasn   t so popular and so that   s why I take  my daughter to legislative luncheons and breakfasts. She says that she  doesn   t like politics, but she   s certainly good at it. And they use your  ability to network at home   decisions are already made before you got  there. They use their ability to lobby for what they want. They use their  ability to debate, and I listen to her and I listen to him and then we make  a decision together on how we   re gonna deal with it. So it certainly  worked out for my family, certainly worked out.  Is there anything that I need to ask that I haven   t?  I don   t know.  We   ve covered a lot.  Some of the things that I most often share with people is my love for  people. I   ve been a public servant even when I wasn   t in public office. I  made my skills, my ability, my energy, my time, my talent, my resources  available. At church, I was the ministry leader for an    anaideia    ministry  and it   s a Greek word for importunity. It means to avoid shame on the  body of Christ, and when you make sure that your guests at your church  are made to be significant, their stay is appropriate, things that they like  36  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  are at their fingertips   it   s hospitality, and you   ll find that in Oklahoma.  Oklahoma people are unique because you go to any other state   Florida,  California, Chicago, New York   people don   t always talk to you, but in  Oklahoma, you can touch a person that you don   t know and tell them  they look good or stand next to them in line and they   ll tell you their life  story, and I have those stories.  The Clara Luper   s of Oklahoma, the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher   s of  Oklahoma, the Nancy Randolph Davis    of Oklahoma   just being in the  presence of the Honorable Vicki Miles-LaGrange is significant to me.  One of the slogans that I used in my political quest was,    Service is my  signature,    and when you got me, you   ve got my signature because I   m  not gonna sign my name on the dotted line if I don   t mean it. But if you  got me in person, you   ve got my service, and so as a person, things that I  like personally   poetry, languages, a lover of music, all kinds of music.  Do you play?  Yes.  Your grandfather taught you to play?  Yes, and actually, I had an encounter in the fifth grade. They lined us up  where they wanted us, and I was in the violin and viola section and we  had to have posture and stand up straight and the teacher was new. My  grandfather had just retired or he would have been my fifth grade  teacher. He was my teacher at home, and he played the piano for me and  we sat and spent time together. So I played a little bit of that and my dad  bought me a little piano and I practiced and all that stuff. But in the fifth  grade one of   I never knew who I was as a person until this lady began  to act as though I was really, really royal. Never knew what a feeling of  royalty was like until she started going down the line asking kids who  they were, and I was in the viola section and she said,    Is everybody  happy? Is everybody where they want to be?    I raised my little hand and  I said,    No, I don   t want to play this.    And she said,    Really? Why not?     I said,    Because I really would prefer to play the cello.    She said,     Okay, why would you want to play the cello?    I said,    Well, it looks  like a small bass, and my granddaddy plays the bass at home.    She said,     Well, really? You have a grandfather that plays the bass at home?    I  said,    Yes, ma   am.    And she said,    Who is your grandfather?    I said     Cornelius Earl Pittman,    and you would have thought I said Alexander  the Great (Laughs) and she said,    What is your name?    I said,     Anastasia Pittman,    and she said,    You   re kidding      She then began to maneuver kids and she asked if there was someone  who would like to play the viola or switch with me, and there was  37  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  another little girl and she said,    Yes, this is too big and it   s  uncomfortable,    and it really worked out. And she just   every day just  kind of catered to me and all I knew is that I said he was my grandfather.  But he wasn   t my only inspiration in music. He helped me play the  piano and helped me play the cello and, yes, we went to concerts and  stuff together, but one of my greatest inspirations came from Evelyn  LaRue Pittman who was a singer, and she was my hero.  I started finding all these old books in my home and I started reading  and then I had the privilege of sitting down and talking to Uncle Isaac  Kimbro. Evelyn LaRue was an international choir director, she sang and  she put choruses together, and I found myself doing that in high school  and in college, putting together special projects. And when people say,     Man, we   ve got an award that Black Incorporated, Inc., they present an  award in honor of Evelyn LaRue Pittman and they said,    Man, this is  where you came from. This is what they do for you and the whole family  is musically inclined.    Now we still have members of our family playing  music. My brother   s a disc jockey on the weekends and then I have  some distant cousins who still have a live band and it   s phenomenal to  watch them play. It all started with these musicians, and my grandfather  played with Duke Ellington. They wrote the    A-Train    together. They  played in the Charlie Christian International Jazz Festival. My  grandfather started the Y Circus where he allowed people to come in and  play different things. He played 12 different musical instruments. And to  have the prominent leaders of our community today be some of his  students   my music teachers in high school were my grandfather   s  students, or they had the ability to sing in Evelyn   s choir.  It just warms my heart to see people that were touched by people before  me and yet still we act the same. My whole family, they   re still loving,  they   re gonna hug and kiss on you. If you come, you   re gonna have to  sit down and eat dinner with us. The hospitality is still there and that   s  what   s fortunate. That   s what   s blessed me and carried me through all  the times that I didn   t think I could make it. I look back and say,     They   ve accomplished so much, even when it wasn   t popular, even  when racism was prevalent or prejudices kept you from doing certain  things. They loved everybody and they were successful. So I enjoy it. I  enjoy it.  Oklahoma   s lucky that you decided to move back.  I   m here. Didn   t really have a choice   came as a kid.  Brought the sunshine with you.  Yes, and my daddy says that, and I just find myself apologizing  38  Finchum  Pittman  Finchum  Pittman  sometimes for my smile. People ask me going and coming out of the  Capitol   a lady named Terri, she   s was a local broadcaster here, she  now works at the Capitol, she worked for Channel Five, a local news  station   and she says,    Anastasia, do you always smile? Do you  always   I see you and your daughter, and you guys are always engaged  and always smiling.    And I said,    Yes, ma   am, and I   ve had to  apologize for it.    She said,    Why?    I said,    Well, a gentleman asked me,  he said,    Are you smiling at me?    and I said,    Let me just tell you I   m  sorry now. My teeth are just big. They just hang out and I   m gonna  smile at you tomorrow, so if you   re offended I want to say I   m sorry.        And she said,    I love it because I know when I see you I   m gonna feel  better,    and that makes it all worth it.  And then when I have best friends like the judges that I   ve had because  my ultimate goal was to be a judge. After becoming an attorney, I  wanted to be a judge, and politics was just something to do along the  way, and then I found that politics was on purpose. (Laughs) If I have  the opportunity to go to law school, I will, and if I become a judge then I  will certainly walk in the shoes of Lieutenant Governor Jari Askins. I  love her. She   s a great woman, and she   s had the opportunity to serve in  all branches of government. She was an elected official, she was a judge  in Duncan, and now she   s our lieutenant governor. If I had a role model  today it would be all of the ladies who paved the way before me.  There will be some that come after you that will thank you for keeping it  going.  I hope so. We want to pass the baton of leadership on, and hopefully  we   ll have some ambassadors of Oklahoma that will stay in Oklahoma  and make a difference. I ask people all the time,    Be a part of the change  that you want to see.    Ghandi said it a long time ago. Martin Luther  King had a dream, but are you a keeper of that dream? And Lecia Swain  most often did a banquet and it was titled,    Keepers of the Dream,    and I  miss her. She was a motivator, an encourager. Without the A. Philip  Randolph president Theresa Hill, I wouldn   t be successful in the  grassroots campaign efforts. I   ve had a great story, a great story.  I appreciate you sharing it with us today.  Thank you so very much.  --- ---
