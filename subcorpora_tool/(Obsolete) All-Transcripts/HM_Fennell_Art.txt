Story_ID: 671186
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that only require a short answer; they're sort of a warm up.  The first one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Pause) Not really.  I like--I like most soul food.  I love most Asian food and most seafood, not in any particular order or not any particular one over another.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Springtime.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my favorite time of the year because I dislike winter so much, I always look forward to spring.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: All right, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 1: I love going to Africa.  I love the Caribbean, and in country I love the West Coast, and I love the South.
Speaker 2: Okay, now the last question is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: No, don't have a favorite phrase or saying, although on my phone message I used to have I hope the good news is yours.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, that'll suffice as sort of one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope the good news is yours.
Story_ID: 671187
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --your mother's side of the family and your father's [James Fennell] side, but separately, and then we'll try to put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's full name, Sarah, S-A-R-A-H, Ellen, E-L-L-E-N, Fennell; maiden name was McLeod, M-C-L-E-O-D [Sarah McLeod Fennell].
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Clio, C-L-I-O, South Carolina, in 1918.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How--I mean in terms of how, how far back can you trace them, and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Okay, we are all descendants of a former slave whose name was Killis Wright, K-I-L-L-I-S, W-R-I-G-H-T, who had been a slave.  He was born into slavery.  And the story goes that Killis Wright, as a young man, was rebellious.  And through some conflict that we've never, ever been able to get to the bottom, the story is, is that he killed a man.  And as a result of that, he was going to be lynched.  Having grown up on a plantation, the Wright plantation in rural South Carolina, there was a childhood friend of the master of the plantation who was very fond of Killis, who saw that Killis was going to be lynched at this point and stepped in and interceded, and took Killis back to his new--they were adults at this point obviously.  And from that point, Killis became the overseer of the--of the plantation and sired most of the, the, the descendants on that plantation, which my family was part of those descendants.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what time period is this?  Is this during slavery itself or?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is in the 1800s.  My grandparents [Mary McLeod and Fred McLeod] were born just outside of slavery, just outside of slavery.
Speaker 1: So Killis Wright was enslaved.  And he killed someone who was on the verge of being lynched.  Now was this a white person he killed?
Speaker 2: The story is it was a white person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I've had rebellious ancestry.  But again, it's har- very hard, as you imagine, to, to get the full story of what happened there.  But we do know where he was raised from the time that he was a very young man until the time that he died as a--as a--as an elderly person.
Speaker 1: And, and so the person that stepped in and preventedhis lynching and then took him into his service would have to be a very powerful white man to, to--
Speaker 2: Yes, they were the, the Wrights, which owned the plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And his father had been the--and again, at his point I don't know if his father was still alive at that point or, or whatever.  But we do know that the--that Killis went on to, to go into the service of the younger man, whose name I don't know.
Speaker 1: And Killis is right--his, his name is spelled K-I-L-L--
Speaker 2: K-I-L-L-I-S.  I actually have a, a photograph of his--of his headstone.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting story.  And so it takes places during, during slavery itself.
Story_ID: 671188
Speaker 1: So did the descendants of Killis Wright use the last name Wright?
Speaker 2: Some of 'em do.  Here's what's very interesting.  Killis Wright sired families, various families, in that community.  It was called Dunbar [South Carolina] community.  It's still there--and helped found the church there, which is called Asbury [Asbury United Methodist Church, Clio, South Carolina].  It's the church that we grew up in.  It's a little church in the--down the end of a dirt road in the middle of a field.  But through these various families, technically we're all descendants of the same person but with different last names.
Speaker 1: Now this is an interesting chapter in American history when the Af- African slave trade was banned in 18--around 1830s or so.  Slavery was still legal.  You just couldn't bring them from Africa anymore.  But you--but many en- enterprising slave owners, you know, invented ways to sire the slaves they wanted.  You know, they, they really took it as a science.  Get the biggest, strongest guy and make him the father of everybody.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and, and to some degree, that's, that's exactly what Killis was.  My [maternal] grandmother, who was born I think in 1886, I think, thereabouts, close to there, recalls--no, she was born later than 1886 but clearly born in the 1800s--but recalls being a, a, a little girl and living in the house with Killis Wright, you know, when she--when she was very little.  She had stories of him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard other such stories.  We have a couple in the collection of stories--similar stories, some--some that actually really did happen so.  But that's a--so this story comes, um-hm--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and by the way, the McLeod--our McLeod part of our family the, the family history has it that we are descendants and related, albeit probably distant, to Mary McLeod Bethune.  And my grandmother's name was Mary Liza McLeod [Mary McLeod] as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they spell it--now she spelled hers in a very strange kind of way.  It's almost (pronunciation) McLeod or something the way she spells it.  But it's--but they--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --pronounced it McLeod, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's pronounced McLeod, but this is spelled M-C-L-E-O-D.
Speaker 1: Oh, E-O-D?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That is the way she--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Mary McLeod spells it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, M-C-L-E-O-D, McLeod.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah, so--yeah, it's very likely, 'cause of that spelling that's--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, again, we've, we've grown up with this story all of our lives, so I don't see any point in changing it now.
Story_ID: 671189
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any other stories?  Seems like you had some good stories on that side of the family.  What about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, this is--my family on both sides--this is rural South Carolina, a very poor, very depressed, and still is, sharecropper country where you, you got along with not much, and you learned to live just fine.  We had big families.  My [maternal] grandmother, that I speak of, Mary Liza McLeod [Mary McLeod], had twelve children, and my mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell] had twelve children.  So that, that, that makes for a lot of siblings and a lot of uncles and, and aunts.  So it's a big family, always very close knit.  Early on, particularly on my grandfather's side--my grandmother--my grandfather's name was Fred McLeod--and, and, and, and it's interesting, they all carried firearms all the time and were not afraid to use them.  So there are a lot of stories of shootings and the like, no more of anyone getting killed.  But everyone knew that the McLeod men walked softly and carried a big stick, in this case, a loaded gun, and, and they would not hesitate to use it if need be.  So that was always the family reputation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but nobody had--there are no stories of them having had to actually use (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No stories that got out anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this, this is--again, they, they were all young men in the--in the 1910--19--you know, through I'd say 1930s and '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: Now this is a horrible time for black people in the South.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And South Carolina is a lot of repression simply because there are so many black people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's one of the two states in those days where the black population outnumbered the white.
Speaker 2: Yeah, cotton and tobacco country.  Most of all of the, the farm work was cotton and tobacco, or working in the sawmills.  And in the summers you, you cropped tobacco.  And in the fall you picked cotton, and, and you planted your crops, your vegetables; and most, most of the food that, that you and your family ate was, was grown locally and by your own hands.  And trips to the store were--if you went, it was going to be on Saturday, and you only bought provisions that you couldn't make yourself.  And it was gonna be a very small amount that wasn't gonna cost you very much 'cause no one there--no one in my family ever had money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So things like flour, sugar maybe--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, just that kind of provisions and stuff, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) syrup.  I don't--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those would be the kinds of things that they would buy--didn't even necessarily have to buy their own soap.  They use lye soap to wash the clothes, you know, and anything else that could come from the farm animals; you know, raised cows, and pigs, and chickens, and goats, and--you know, and, and, and, and fruits were plentiful.  Strawberries, and grapes, and plums, and apples, and pears, and figs all grew all around you all the time.  Just find the nearest tree and--if it was in season--and eat your fill.
Story_ID: 671190
Speaker 1: So was this--did your mother's pa- parents sharecrop or did they have their own place?
Speaker 2: No, they did, they sharecropped.  My granddaddy, Fred, did some sharecropping.  My father [James Fennell] became a very good sharecropper, in that he used to run the crews and so forth much later on.  My grandfather on my mother's side mostly worked in the mills--in the sawmill.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandfather, Fred McLeod--
Speaker 2: Fred McLeod.
Speaker 1: --he worked, worked in the sawmills?
Speaker 2: He worked in the sawmills.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: Had lost part of two fingers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, safety regulations in those days were very--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) lax.
Speaker 2: --was around back then.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right, very lax.  There were people that did, you know, try to bring it to the pub- public notice, you know.  But that was a typical practice for a company to fire you after you lost a hand.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  But you know, you, you, you have to--you have to go back and try and see the picture of what life was for, for my grandparents.  You lived in a little wooden house with no indoor plumbing, with a pump for your water or a well.  Typically, this little wooden house would have the, the woodpile out back so that you could stay warm in the winter.  And it was typically down a dirt road, or in the middle of a field, or in the woods.  But everybody knew how to get to everybody's house through the various paths that would cut through the fields or the paths that would cut through the woods and so forth; or you'd see company coming up the dirt road.  And, and that was--that was life for them.  For them, they, they traveled mostly on horseback or mules because couldn't afford a car.  And then later, as they got older when they could afford cars, it would be an older model of the older cars of that day.  But, you know, even for myself, as a little boy, I still remember being transported on a--on ba- board wagon, you know, being pulled by a mule or a horse.  You know, this was, you know, to, to go from one side of the field to the other, but it was still--it was still there.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I'm the youngest of the twelve, so my older brothers and sisters have stories way better than mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now tell me something, what did your mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell] say about growing up there in--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --did, did she grow--did she grow up in Clio [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, grew up there all of her life.  They later moved to Bennettsville [South Carolina] when they were much older.  But she enjoyed her childhood.  She'd often speak of it.  She'd speak of the times that they'd have playing in the fields and working around the house, a very close knit family.  She had a lot of sisters.  They were a singing family, and they were constantly in songs, very spiritual, very fier- spiritual.  My grandmother [Mary McLeod] ruled that part of it with an iron fist.  And she insisted that on Sunday you would be in church, and that you would know the Bible, and that you would know the songs.  Because that side of the family was blessed with song and still is.  So they had a good childhood.  She later would become a nurse.  Part of that came from the fact that my grandmother had been a midwife.  Because this part of the country where they--where they grew up the nearest hospital would have been far too far to get to.  And so mid- midwives did most of the labors and deliveries.  And so I think with that background, she later went into nursing and worked in a hospital--
Speaker 1: Okay so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) later in life.
Story_ID: 671191
Speaker 1: She was able to finish--did she finish school in that area?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or did she--
Speaker 2: She did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, she finished high school.  Yes, she finished a little local school there--
Speaker 1: Okay and probably a--
Speaker 2: --which was a one room schoolhouse.  My, my father [James Fennell] did not, 'cause he was working in the fields.  But yes, she did finish in the little one room schoolhouse.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so did she go to nursing school in another--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --cit- city?
Speaker 2: Y- you get your training and get a certificate, but no, no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay, so there was a local health facility that she--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And I'm sure it was segregated, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, yeah, yeah, everything was segregated back then.  But then later--but then later she was able to work in the--well, well, well, let me back up.  My mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell] also worked in the fields.  We all did.  So the--I would say the majority of her life was spent on the farm as well.  The, the nursing didn't come until much later.  I would--I would--I don't know the exact days, but I would say that she would--she probably was fifty by the time she actually started working in a hospital.  And it wasn't segregated at that point.
Story_ID: 671192
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James Arthur Fennell [James Fennell].  My, my grandfather's name was Arthur Fennell [Arthur Fennell II] as well.  And he was born and raised in Philadelphia and later moved to the Wilmington, North Carolina region where he met my grandmother, whose name was Mary Addie Brown [Mary Fennell], and they married.  They had one son, who was my father, James Arthur.  And then they moved as well down near the Dunbar area of South Carolina that I've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now let me--
Speaker 2: --been speaking of.
Speaker 1: --I didn't--I neglected to ask you his date of birth--
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: --and place of birth.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: October 6th, 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1917.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in rural South Carolina.  I think the community was called Judson, South Carolina, a little--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just a small little community--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --born to a midwife.
Speaker 1: So (unclear) question again--now what can you tell us--how far back can you trace your father's side?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, who was very, very fair complected, Mary Addie Fennell, her, her mother was also the product of slavery, and had had relations with the slave owner, which is why, you know, she was so fair complected.  And she was one of--she had three sisters, no brothers, and one child, as I said, my, my, my, my father.  She worked various jobs, as I understand it, when--as, as she was growing up, and this was in the Wilmington, North Carolina region, mostly in servitude in houses, taking care of white folk's homes and their children, and then later taking care of my father's many children, who are her grandchildren, and then tending to the house, and then working on the farm.  She had a notorious reputation as being--and as a small lady, a very small lady, but she could pick three hundred pounds of cotton a day.  That--that's a lot of picking, and, and most people couldn't give you a three hundred pound day of cotton picking.  My grandma Addie could.  And so she worked hard.  She was a very stern lady, very serious, did not suffer fools lightly.  And so we grew up under her, and we got some of that discipline from my grandmother on my father's side, Mary Addie.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's not the size of the cotton picker, but the skill I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah th- they had those--the, the, the skill of the picker and the heart of the picker, because you have imagine cotton picking work is, is hard work.  And the sun is bearing down.  You're talking about a South Carolina sun.  And you're talking very little food--whatever you brought to the field with you that morning--to be able to turn in that kind of work during the day?  You're under those kinds of conditions and then often maybe with a crying baby on a blanket somewhere that you'd have to go and tend to as well, and still be focused enough with bloody hands from sticking your hands into that cotton boll all day and getting it all pricked up; that was very brutal work.  The--I, I don't know if the history lessons and the, the movies we see on TV really paint the, the vivid picture that the reality of cotton picking really was.  You know, I, I dealt with that just a little bit, but it was more of a novelty by the time I came along.  But for my ancestors this was a, a daily way of life, and certainly for my grandmother.
Story_ID: 671193
Speaker 1: So your [paternal] grandfather's name was Arthur Fennell [Arthur Fennell II]--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) as well, and he was--so he was a farmer too as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and he worked in the--in the sawmill as well.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear)--
Speaker 2: He passed away before I was born, had diabetes, and was wheelchair stricken in the later part of his life. And so he, he did not work through most of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now so your father [James Fennell], did he grow up--he grew up there out in rural Judson--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was in Dillon County, South Carolina [sic.].
Speaker 1: Did he have any stories he shared with you about growing up?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, well, again, the stories are all the, the, the, the, the same.  They all come together.  It's all about growing up in the sticks or in the woods, and working the farm, and, and, and, and moving up.  By the time my father was in his forties, he had work crews that were, were under him.  He was a sharecropper.  He worked the farm of Mr. Lawrence Smith [ph.].  And he worked the, the fields, gathered the crews, hired the crews.  And as a result, we were afforded a little house in the middle of the field, and monies from the crops, and the crops that you could grow.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--that was how he was paid.
Story_ID: 671194
Speaker 1: So did your dad get a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: He did not--sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After the sixth grade, it was time to get to work.  School was a luxury.  And a lot of his--of his friends didn't, didn't finish that, but he at least finished the sixth grade.  He was a very capable man.  He later, later became one of the foremost butchers and chefs--country chefs--in our area--wasn't uncommon that on, on most days someone from somewhere was seeking my father to come and, and do a stew for them, or to help them kill a hog.  He made a lot of money helping with the hog killing season.  He was very good at that, and as a butcher, processing the meats and so forth, you know.  That was a, a community event.  When it was hog killing day for someone, everyone turned out to help, because in turn, they were gonna need your help when they were ready to kill their hog.  And, and oftentimes, they would share some of the meats between families, depending on, on how a certain family was doing and so forth.  And my father, until his death, was the guy that they called, and said, "We've gotta get Mr. James Arthur [James Fennell] over here to help with this hog killing and, and to--and if we're lucky, he'll put something in the pot."  You know, he, he could always be found around an old iron black pot, because that's where the good cooking was being done, and that's where the good stories were being told, always around that old pot with the bricks and the fire out in the backyard.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did, did your--was your father drafted for World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: He was not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was not.  In fact, [U.S.] military service somehow it skipped over my family.  I don't--I can't tell you how that happened and what the circumstances were.  Obviously it was long before my time, but nor on my mother's side or on my father's side are there--are there war veterans.  I, I--and I don't know the reason for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now so it was a move you said that, that put your parents in proximity, right?  They--
Speaker 2: They--yes, (unclear)--well, when my, my [paternal] grandfather, Arthur [Arthur Fennell II], and my grandma, Addie [Mary Fennell], they moved from the Wilmington [North Carolina] area to Dillon County, South Carolina.  And that's where my father met my mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell], which is that same area, although Dunbar is in Marlboro County [South Carolina].  But Marlboro County and Dillon County are side by side and not very far apart.
Story_ID: 671195
Speaker 1: Yeah, you--you were mentioning off camera ghost stories.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So this is part of our history and culture of course.  And what kind of ghost stories would they--would your father [James Fennell] tell then?
Speaker 2: Well, my father, my mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell], my grandparents.  You didn't have to look far to hear some great story of, of, of spirits and ghosts and, and, and, and, and so forth.  They all insisted it was because there wasn't a lot of electricity.  Families, you know, lit their homes with lanterns still back then, during their childhood.  There's one story of, of the light, that many people told, that would appear in the woods or in the backyard at certain times.  And no one could ever chase--trace--the origin of the light, and that the light would move.  And, and the, the folklore went that the light was trying to, to guide whoever was bold enough to follow it to a treasure that had been hidden by someone a long time ago.  But no one ever found the treasure, and no one--although many people insisted that they saw the light on many occasions, they, they, they never found the treasure.  My grandfather tells a great story of coming home from the local tavern one night and walking down a lonely dirt road.  Of course it's dark, and he had his dog with him as they were walking home together.  And he'd had a few drinks that night.  And he could hear a bustling sound and a faint image on the road coming towards him.  And as the image got closer, he could see that it was a lady who was dressed in a--in a, a dress with a bustle with rustled as she walked, he said.  And as she approached, the dog began to act funny and then stopped, and then actually started walking behind my grandfather.  And as my grandfather approached the lady, he tipped his hat, which was the custom.  He said she did not acknowledge it; she never looked at him; and she continued past, and so did he.  Well, curiously, less than a minute later, she was coming again from the same direction.  The same sequence happened all over again, the same person.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's--that, that--that's just one of many.  There's the story of my mother going to, to the pump to, to fetch the water for that night to take into the house, and it was just about dark.  And as she went to the porch, there as a, a, a little man, as she described it, that was sitting by the porch.  And it startled her.  And as she looked at it, he jumped up and, and ran underneath the house, never to be seen again.  There's another story.  And I've got a million of 'em.  When my grandfather lost one of his brothers, and he said he was sitting on the porch and just relaxing, smoking his pipe, and his brother came up and sat on the porch beside him.  And he spoke to him, and then he said, you know, I'm--, "How are you?  You know, why are your clothes wet?  What have you been doing?"  He said his brother never responded, never said a word, and then later got off the porch and, and walked away.  Turns out his brother had just drowned.  Now these are very spooky stories, and there were a million of 'em.  So we'd hear these stories as we'd be sitting around the house at night either to a fire burning in the stove, a wood fire, to warm us up--and, and typically, back when I was very small, with lanterns used for our electricity.  Or sometimes if we had electricity, they'd--they didn't want you to keep it on all night because you had to pay that bill.  So the houses were usually dimly lit.  And sitting around and listening to these stories, I'm here to tell you there's stuff that you don't forget.
Speaker 1: That make, make it hard to sleep?
Speaker 2: It could make it hard to sleep at night.  But it was just such a common way of life back then and hearing these stories.  And you know it was--it was our version of a campfire, you know, sitting around and listening to these spooky stories around the campfire.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the stories on the porch.
Speaker 2: Yeah, stories on the porch.
Story_ID: 671196
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No, don't have a story about how they met; have photos of them meeting.  And, and we can figure that they were eighteen and nineteen at the time, very young.  My father [James Fennell] was--was a--was a handsome man.  My, my mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell] was a fetching lady.  And my father used to tell the one story when he went to court my mother at, at the house--and my mother was one of the younger daughters of Fred McLeod--that Fred McLeod greeted him with his shotgun, and told him to come in and have a seat.  Now this is--these are the notorious stories you hear about today where, you know, fathers try to ruffle you up.  But, but I told you earlier that the McLeod men carried guns and weren't afraid to use 'em, and they meant it.  And he sat across from my father, and he told him--he says, "Look, this is my daughter," he says, "and I don't wanna have any trouble with you and my daughter."  And my father said he assured him there wouldn't be any.  And they later became best friends, my father and my grandfather, because he could see my father wasn't afraid of 'em, and he treated my mother right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they did meet.  And did they get married shortly thereafter (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --eighteen--
Speaker 2: --it wasn't a very long courtship period.  I think back then there wasn't a whole lot of long courtship periods.  People tended to--you know, as I understand there wasn't a whole lot to do.  So if you were married, you were at least--you, you had a house, and you could start a family.  And starting a family could be fun work.  And, and, and so it wasn't long courtship periods from, from any of the, the, the stories of the people that I knew growing up with.
Speaker 1: So they, they got married around 1935, '36 [1936]?
Speaker 2: Right around in there, that's about right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, and they, they stayed there in Cliso [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --stayed, stayed right there until their pass--later moved to Bennettsville [South Carolina], which is--which is where, where I was born.  But that came much later.
Story_ID: 671197
Speaker 1: Okay, so most of your brothers and sisters were born in Cliso [sic.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Clio [South Carolina]--
Speaker 1: Clio, Clio, okay. I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and in the Judson [South Carolina] area.  Yes, because typically, my father [James Fennell] would, would move from house to house, depending on if he could find a house that was in better shape than the one that he had previously been in, or if it was nearer to the farmland that they would be attending to that upcoming season, or depending on if Mr.--you know, Mr. Lawrence Smith [ph.] would have a better property for him, that kind of thing.  So--
Speaker 1: So he would--
Speaker 2: --they would typically move, not--
Speaker 1: Did he generally work for Mr. Lawrence Smith most of the time?
Speaker 2: Most of the time that I knew of.  I'm sure he worked for others as well growing up.  But Mr. Lawrence Smith was one of the bigger farmers in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lawrence--yeah, Lawrence Smith and, and the Nortons [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now of course he left their service when he moved to Bennettsville [South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what did he do in Bennettsville?
Speaker 2: He did various things.  As I say, he was a butcher, did, did a lot of chef work in the community, and, and then he'd also do work on the side with one of his good friends who was an undertaker.  And he would help him in, in--various times with, with funeral work.
Story_ID: 671198
Speaker 1: Now when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their talents, what they're--what they were interested in, what they look like, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I have some of both.  My father [James Fennell] was not a spiritual man.  He would go to church on special occasions or if the--if the mood hit him.  But that was not going to be his first inclination on Sunday morning, but was a very popular man, very, bare--very well respected among everyone who knew him, everyone in the community, very well liked, very comfortable in a group setting and all that.  I think I take some of that from him.  But my mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell] was like that as well, also very comfortable in a group setting and loved to tell stories.  My mother was a great storyte- most of the ghost stories came from her, so I'm sure I have some of those traits from my mother.  She kept us in the church.  You know, the, the, the church has never been not a part a part of our family.
Speaker 1: So what was the church--the name of the church in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Asbury--
Speaker 1: --Clio [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: --Asbury United Methodist Church.  And my father was one of the--was one of the early deacons in Ebenezer Baptist Church [Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church] in Clio.  Those two churches are about four miles apart.
Speaker 1: Okay, and in Bennettsville [South Carolina] where did--where did your family go?
Speaker 2: Oh, we still went to the same churches.  I mean it was just that we, we still drove to church in Clio--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and Asbury.
Speaker 1: --Clio is very close to--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very close, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's nine miles.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, nine miles--
Speaker 1: Okay so you're right there, so.
Story_ID: 671199
Speaker 1: Tell me about your brothers.  You've got twelve--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --siblings.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and--
Speaker 2: Well, had twelve.  I've lost a few.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, start with the oldest one and tell me what they--what they did for, you know, a living, a little something about each one.
Speaker 2: Something about each one--oldest brother was Nathaniel [Nathaniel Fennell].  Everyone called him Nate.  Nate spent most of his life in Elizabeth, New Jersey as a supervisor for, for the parks division of Elizabeth; took care of the a lot of the, the parks there; and planted the sceneries; and ran the crews, and so forth and so on.  And they, they have a dedication to him in a park upon his passing in Elizabeth, New Jersey even now.  Next to him was my brother, Jeremiah [Jeremiah Fennell]--these great biblical names.  We all came him Jerry or Rev.  He was an ordained holy, holy, holy minister, had a big church in Brooklyn, New York, a daycare--was very prominent up there, and founded a church.  And the church is still in service today run by my sister-in-law, who now pastors that church, so that was Jeremiah.  My oldest sister's name--only two girls, by the way.  My oldest sister's name is Mamie [Mamie Fennell], and she is an evangelist in my brother, Jerry's, church in New York and has been doing the evangelistic ministry for, for many, many, many years.  Next to her is my brother, Johnny [John Fennell], who's still in South Carolina.  He's a builder and continues to, to build and do various contracting jobs now.  After Johnny, there is James [James Fennell]--my brother James, who is a bus driver in Brooklyn, New York, then my sister, Peggy [Peggy Fennell], who has worked various jobs through the year.  But she's pretty much a homemaker in Farmingdale, New York.  My other brother is Charleton [Charleton Fennell], who works--he's worked various jobs in contracting and so forth.  But he lives in Rochester, New York.  My brother Abraham [Abraham Fennell] was also a builder.  Abraham passed away.  My brother, Nate, passed away, and my brother, Jeremiah, has passed away.  But after Abraham was my brother Tommy Lee [Tommy Fennell], who's in South Carolina, who most of his life has been a truck driver.  My brother, Jeffrey [Jeffrey Fennell], after that, who was also a truck driver for a good part of his life, and he passed away.  And then there is my brother, Dennis [Dennis Fennell], and myself.  Dennis is--Dennis is an engineer--does not work as an engineer, but he can tinker with and fix most things.  And people call him to, to do those kinds of jobs.  He lives in South Carolina even now.  And then I've been in media, the only one in my family in media.  And I've been in the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] area for some twenty plus years.
Speaker 1: And you're the youngest?
Speaker 2: I hope I--and I'm the youngest.  I'm the baby, as they--as we call it back there.  And I hope I didn't leave anybody out.  Was that twelve?
Speaker 1: Let's see here.  I see one, two, three, four, five, six, seven--no, there's somebody--seems like there's somebody left out.  Let's see, Jeremiah, Mamie, Johnny--
Speaker 2: Did you get Nathanial--Nate was the first one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nate, Jeremiah, Mamie, Johnny, James, Peggy, Charleton, Abraham, Tommy Lee, Jeffrey, Dennis, and you.
Speaker 2: And that's--
Speaker 1: (Counting) Yeah, that's twelve.  That is twelve (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's twelve.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's twelve.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Either your math or mine was wrong, but--
Speaker 1: I, it was mine.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm--that's been my Achilles' heel--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all my life.
Story_ID: 671200
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  Well, there's, there's an earliest memory, and then there's the most vivid--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --childhood memory.
Speaker 1: Well, let's do 'em both.  Why not?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, the earliest childhood memory, and I don't know why I remember this, but I do.  I was sitting out in the yard, in the grass and, and we lived in a little wooden house in the middle of the cotton field down the dirt road.  And I was sitting out in the grass, and I was wearing a diaper sitting on the gra- I think must have been around two maybe.  And I remember the pin.  Somehow it came a loose or whatever, and I began to play with it.  And I, I, I, I pricked myself with it.  And I remember how it hurt, and I started crying.  There is a picture of that.  I don't know who happened to just be conveniently standing by with a camera, but there is a picture of that.  And then the most vivid memory (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that--is that the black and white--upstairs--you're kind of like turning (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's, that's that same day.  What are the chances of that?  But I remember that.
Story_ID: 671201
Speaker 1: The most vivid childhood memory came in April of 1969 I think it was.  It may have been '68 [1968] or--I think it was '68 [1968] or '69 [1969].  We had just gotten off the school bus coming home from school.  And the weather was ominous, and it was just starting to rain very lightly.  And me and my brother Dennis [Dennis Fennell] were the only ones on the bus.  My other brothers--they had done an experiment.  And I won't digress too far with this, away from the story, but they were doing an experiment back then in, in, in Bennettsville [South Carolina] and Blenheim [South Carolina], another small town, where they wanted to test integrating the schools.  But for that year, they were asking for volunteers from families, to volunteer children to see if this would work in rural South Carolina.  So my next two brothers, Jeffrey [Jeffrey Fennell] and Tommy Lee [Tommy Fennell], were volunteered by my parents [Sarah McLeod Fennell and James Fennell], because they were bigger and older, and they could probably deal with it better than Dennis and myself, who were much younger.  So we were still in the segregated school.  We were coming home from, from, from school this day, Dennis and I.  We get off the bus, and we're walking down the dirt road.  And it was this--clouds were getting a little dark.  And as we got to the house, my mother was taking in the clothes, 'cause it was obviously just starting to rain.  And she said, "Children, help me with these clothes to get 'em off the clothesline, because bad weather is coming."  And as we were taking in those clothes, the winds began to pick up more and more and more.  And, and it, it became fun for me and my brother because this was an adventure.  But I remember going out on probably the last trip to the clothesline.  And I looked across the cotton field, and I saw a tornado coming.  It was as clear as day, and it was happening now, and it was coming right for us.  And so we gathered the last bit of clothes, and we rushed into the house.  And as we closed the door, because the winds were very strong, it took all three of us by the way to push and close that door from the force of the wind.  But we did close it.  And it stayed closed for about five to ten seconds before it exploded open, because at this point the tornado was right on top of us, and we couldn't close that door again.  Windows began to explode, and air was all through the house.  The tornado was on top of us.  And so my mother grabbed me and my brother.  And on a, a small little sofa--and I have a picture of us on this small sofa, and it was in the corner of the room by the stove--and she huddled us together like a mother hen gathering her biddies.  And she said, "Pray children pray."  And we started praying while that tornado sat down upon us.  It destroyed our whole house.  When it was over, there was nothing left in the house.  The roof was gone.  All of the other furnishings in the house were gone.  The wall behind us was still there, but on the other side of the wall was nothing. But that sofa with myself, my brother, and my mother was still intact with us on it.  And I remember looking up at as small boy, and I could see the sky.  And I looked around, and we were in a daze, but we were unharmed, not a scratch.  So I knew right then about the miracle of God.  Because we were there praying and--you know, small children, you know, we were praying.  But I was peeping, 'cause I wanted to see this phenomenon happening around us.  But we were un- we were unhurt.  And so that was--that was a very vivid moment for me, for everyone.  The community--once the story had passed, people were rushing to our aid to see if we were okay, if anyone had been harmed, and to see how they could help, 'cause that's what communities do in those types of times.
Speaker 2: That's quite a story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean--did you close your eyes while it was going?  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Some of the time.  I have to admit I was peeping.  I remember peeping.  But we had an old iron stove that was no more than five feet away from where I was.  That was where we put the, the wood in and you know to warm the house.  And I saw that old iron stove with the, the tin pipe that went up to the chimney started to bounce and rock as it was sitting there.  It bounced like this, 'cause I was praying and peeping.  And then I saw that stove lift off.  I've never seen that stove again.  It was five feet from me.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: So, yeah, I think after I saw that, I, I started praying harder than ever because I, I didn't wanna follow the direction of where that, that--where that stove had gone.
Story_ID: 671202
Speaker 1: I wouldn't guess anything that would happen in childhood would be--would be more memorable than that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean I--that is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --quite the--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was a--it was--it's the kind of thing that you ever--don't ever, ever forget.  And there were others.  Our house wasn't the only one hit.  There were--there were a couple of others right in there that were, were, were demolished as well.  And I recently shared a story with a very good childhood friend of mine, who, who lived in the other house right across the field.  And their house was destroyed as well.  It was just her and her grandmother there.  Her name is Liz Bridges [ph.], and she's a minister now.  And the same type of thing; she grabbed her elderly grandmother and literally held her down.  Their whole house was destroyed.  At least we had a basic part of a shell and one way.  They had nothing.  They, they were--when the storm passed, they were in a field.  They were in a field.
Speaker 1: So, how old were you?
Speaker 2: Eight years old.
Speaker 1: About eight?  Okay, that's a pretty good age.  But--and so your family ever--did you rebuild on that same site?
Speaker 2: Well, just as it turns out, were in the process of building a house right across the road in a cornfield--what had--what had been a cornfield.  The house was up.  We were due to move in I think within the next two weeks.  We moved in early because obviously we, we had nowhere else to go.  But luckily that house was already erected, and we were able to just go over--they wouldn't have any possessions left.  Everything in the house was gone, but--
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So.
Story_ID: 671203
Speaker 1: The next one seems anticlimactic now.  But, but, but we always ask this, this story--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --about growing up.  What were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up [in South Carolina]?  You've already given us a big chunk of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the farm animals for sure.  Our alarm clock was the rooster, okay.  There were a couple of things you were going to do before you were going to go to school and that is you were going to have breakfast.  My father [James Fennell] always cooked breakfast.  And depending on whose time it was, you were going to, to slop the hogs.  The key was try not to get some of that hog slop on your school clothes before you went to school.  There were many times where we went to school I'm sure with some remnants of that slop on our shoes or at the bottom of our, our--of our pants with the patches on the knees and so forth.  But I remember all of those smells and sounds very vividly, particularly the roosters crowing, and the chickens, and, and the--and the cow, the freshly cut grass, which I still enjoy even now.  I still enjoy going out and cutting grass, and getting my hands working in the soil and so forth, and planting the crops, the vegetable garden and all of those types of things.  I remember the smell of coffee in the morning, which just signified the beginning of the day--oh, and the bacon cooking in the griddle.  'Cause you have to understand, for us any part of the pig was gonna be part of our diet.  And so good bacon, or fresh sausage, or pudding, or ham from, from, from our pig that we'd slaughter, that was going to feed us for a good long time.  So it made for good eating.  Now we think about it now, and then you know, you try to get away from pork.  A lot of people don't touch pork and so forth, but the, the, the pig was always good to us.  Now, now at this stage in my life, I still eat pork.  I don't eat that stuff nearly as much as I once did, but I still appreciate it.
Story_ID: 671204
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  What was your first school?
Speaker 2: I went to school--in--there's another small, little town just outside of Bennettsville [South Carolina] called Blenheim [South Carolina], B-L-E-N-H-E-I-M, which is where we, we pretty much were born and raised in that--in that little community and in that little school, all of my brothers and sisters, except for my older brothers, who had gone to Wright High School [ph.], W-R-I-G-H-T, which was--
Speaker 1: Named for the same--
Speaker 2: --which, which, which--well, there's a lot of Wrights and so forth down there.  But this Wright was the father of [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman, who's also from Bennettsville.  And so it was Wright High School.  And so my older brothers and sisters attended Wright High School.  By the time we came along we were--we went to Blenheim--Blenheim High School [Blenheim, South Carolina].  So I grew up in that--in that school, very small school.  My high school graduating class consisted of thirty-two people.
Speaker 1: Now, so you--did, did Blenheim go from, from grade school through high school?
Speaker 2: It did.  It doesn't anymore.  They've since integrated all of the small schools from all those small communities.  But at the time it did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's confusing to a lot of people from the North when they hear that 'cause they assume that the high school--if it was high school, it wouldn't incur- incorporate their grade, grade school as well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so--but, but it often is the case down south in small areas--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --where--
Speaker 2: Well, there were a lot of things that were different for us growing up there.  I tell you that my high school graduating class consisted of thirty-two people.  I was the president of the class, and I was one of the bus drivers for the school.  A lot of people are, are, are amazed when I tell them that at the young age of seventeen I was a bus driver.  But back then the students drove the buses.  You had to be certified of course, and you went through your training, and obviously you had to have a driver's license.  You could get your driver's license at fifteen in, in, in South Carolina.  But you had a route; you picked up the, the kids; you kept the, the bus parked in your yard.  And we were good, had a great safety record, great safety record.  Of course the buses would only go thirty-five miles an hour.  They had a governor on them and for good reason, because if it would have gone faster, we would have driven it faster.  But yeah, I was a high school bus driver.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah I, yeah, this is a story that has popped up in a couple interviews too.  But this is interesting, yeah, yeah, high school bus driver.
Story_ID: 671205
Speaker 1: So Blenheim [South Carolina] is just the community that the school [Blenheim High School] was in--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) didn't really sig- signify anybody important.
Speaker 2: It's a--it's a, a caution light community.  There's no town.  As you're driving through, there is a caution light that says you're in Blenheim.  At least give us the courtesy of slowing down as you pass through.  Okay, and, and then little school there is mostly known for its ginger ales.  It makes--and there was a, a little plant--when I say plant, a little factory--in the middle of the woods that you'd never find if you weren't from there.  There is a mineral spring that runs through Blenheim.  And the legend goes that a Civil War soldier who was trying to find his way back home had, had stepped into this puddle, and it turned out to be a spring, which was a mineral spring, which is still there.  People come from miles around to get some of that mineral water.  And the Blenheim soda factory was built right there by that spring, just a tiny, little brick building, you know, no bigger than--no bigger than someone's small house.  But they made ginger ales out of there, and I would say probably one of the best ginger ales you'll ever taste, very strong.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was the water carbonated out of the spring or, or--
Speaker 2: No, just regular mineral water (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just re- regular wa--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --oh, min--
Speaker 2: --coming, coming straight from--
Speaker 1: Mineral water.
Speaker 2: --the spring.  Yeah, mineral water, yes.
Speaker 1: But they--did they use that water to--
Speaker 2: They used that water, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So these--
Speaker 2: You know--you know, growing up, I wish I could tell you that I had this great childhood where we never did anything wrong.  But I was on the basketball team.  And me and a couple of my buddies, we would--after practice occasionally, we would go back to the--to the Blenheim ginger ale factory.  And we knew how to get in the back window.  And we would go in there, and we would lift a couple of sodas.  You know, you put two in your pocket, and you drink one.  And we'd sit back in the woods and drink ginger ale, and then we'd go home (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Maybe we should have gone back and left them some money one of these after all those years, but we never did.
Speaker 1: So this ginger ale sold all over South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's all over.  It's, it's becoming marketed now.  And it, it--it's--you can--you can find it in various places.  But it is a very good ginger ale, very strong.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Strong ginger flavor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a very strong ginger flavor.  It is not Canada Dry, I can tell you that.
Story_ID: 671206
Speaker 1: Now did you have any special teachers or mentors at Blenheim High School [Blenheim, South Carolina] at any of the grades--le- levels.
Speaker 2: Always had good teachers.  From, from the, the, the time I was very young, teachers somehow took a liking to me.  I told my daughter this story just recently that when I was in the third grade, one of my teachers saw something in me and spoke to other teachers, and then they later went to the principal, whose name was Mr. Prince, Wade "Hamp" Prince, very strong disciplinarian and a pillar in that community, as most principals were.
Speaker 1: Wade "Hamp"--
Speaker 2: Wade "Hamp" Prince.
Speaker 1: Now it sounds like he's name after the infamous Wade Hampton [Wade Hampton III], who was the richest man in South Carolina after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Well, that is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --probably the case.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Probably the case (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wade Hampton was governor I think after the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after--during--at the end of Reconstruction.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's probably where that name came from--
Speaker 1: Wade "Hamp".
Speaker 2: --'cause it's too odd to, to, to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --have been random.
Speaker 1: Wade "Hamp"--what's his last name?
Speaker 2: Prince.
Speaker 1: Prince, okay.
Speaker 2: Mr. Prince.  And they promoted me--promoted me earlier to the fourth grade, and, anyways, which was quite intimidating at that time because remember, they were just integrating the schools.  And I remember--I remember the first day attending an integrated school.
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Now you're born in '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--(unclear) when, when you're fifteen, it's 1976 I guess--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, well, they integrated those schools I was telling you in the late '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're right.
Speaker 2: And it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were--oh yeah, we were in elementary school.  But, but I just remembered the significance of that.  It was very scary.  It was scary for, for us.  It was also scary for the white people as well I would imagine because we were curious to each other.  We'd see people around, we had never studied with them.  We didn't know if they were smarter than us, if they did things differently from us, if they ate the same foods as us, you know.  Obviously, this all seems silly now, but back then it wasn't so silly.  And then there was--there was conflict as well.  They--the, the, the, the white boys our age wanted to show us that, that they were stronger than us, better athletes than us.  And we were determined that we were gonna show them that we weren't afraid of them, and we weren't, and that we were better than them in sports.  So it was this whole rivalry thing until all of that was later worked out.  But the early days, that was a big part of it.  I remember one day going to, to, to school, and my bus arrived early before some of the other buses had gotten there, which meant that a lot of my friends weren't there yet.  And about five guys grabbed me.  And I'm a small guy, and I was very small then.  And they took me 'round the back of the school.  And you know, they were, you know, rousting me about and so forth.  And I was trying to figure out how in the world am I gonna get out of this predicament.  And I had an Afro pick.  I had an Afro back then.  This was the, the Michael Jackson era.  And one of the guys picked it up, and he says, "Look at this thing."  He says, "What in the world is this?"  He said, "This thing looks like a pitchfork," because you know with the, the black fist on the bottom of it, and the pick and so forth.  And I'm trying to tell 'em, "Guys, no, no, you know, that's my--that's called a pick," this and that, this and that.  As it turns out, one of the--one of the white guys came to my rescue.  His name is Carl Freeman [ph.]--became a good friend of mine throughout the rest of our days in school--and entered, entered--got in the way and said, "Guys, you know what--let's, let's, let's, let Arthur [HistoryMaker Art Fennell] go; he's all right; he's in my class."  And they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, there were times when we'd have fights.  But that day, luckily for me, wasn't one of 'em because I was greatly outnumbered, and I wouldn't've stand a--stood a chance.
Speaker 1: Now this is at the, the big school they finally created to--
Speaker 2: No, no, no--
Speaker 1: This was at--
Speaker 2: --this was--
Speaker 1: --small Blenheim--
Speaker 2: --this was--this was at the small subsidiary school, which was called Marlboro--
Speaker 1: Marlboro.
Speaker 2: --but was still all part of the Blenheim school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If that makes any sense.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's where the--that was called the primary at that time.  The primary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 671207
Speaker 1: Now what were you interested in?  We know what your career has been.  Was, was there any sign that you'd be doing what you're doing today in those days?
Speaker 2: No, no, there wasn't.  I always had a heavy voice, which was just a subject of mockery.  All of my friends and family would, would, would pick at me and, and always say, "Listen to him, listen, listen at that, that big old heavy voice coming from that little small guy," which would make me mad and, and so forth.  And I'd get in fights about it.  And I, I don't know why, but I just felt a need to defend myself.  I was never afraid to defend myself.  And--you know, but yeah--and it--it was not refined.  It was--it was deep, and lazy, and very, very country sounding.
Speaker 1: So, so how would you sound in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, gosh, it was--I was--(adopts accent) I was Arthur Fennell [HistoryMaker Art Fennell] from South Carolina back then.  Overtime, you know you lose that with culture and so forth and so, and it's still there.  As people listen to me talk, it's pretty clear that they'll say, "Wait a minute, you're--am I hearing something?  You're from the South, aren't you?"  And says, "Yes, I am, very proud of it."  But I was an artist--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you liked to--
Speaker 2: --in my early days.
Speaker 1: --draw (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I liked to draw--thought I was pretty good at it--draw--drew a lot of the, the, the school emblems for the school.  And, and I found out early on that I could write.  I was a pretty good writer, made good grades as a writer, was, was writing some early poetry back then, which was very elementary and, and, and dumb now.  But at the time, people thought it was pretty good.  I was good in sports, was always very good in sports.
Speaker 1: So you, you played basketball.
Speaker 2: Played basketball and was the captain of our basketball team--
Speaker 1: Were you point--
Speaker 2: --a co-captain.
Speaker 1: --point guard?
Speaker 2: Point guard--went from point guard to shooting guard; played football, baseball, ran track.  So did a little, little of everything.  Later in life, after I left school, started playing tennis; now I play golf.  But I was always very good athletically and particularly in basketball.  I was always very good.  So those were the things that interest me.  Beyond that, journalism had, had no part in any of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did you have a television out there?
Speaker 2: We had a--we had a TV.  We had three channels, and it was a little--the early days--a little black and white with the (gesture) rabbit ears and the pliers, you know, because after the knob would finally--
Speaker 1: Break off.
Speaker 2: --break off, you had to get the pliers to, to turn the channel.  But what's interesting about that, later growing up, and starting to really take an interest in TV, we found out that Bennettsville [South Carolina] is situated in an area where we got--several different television markets could be seen from there.  We could get TV in Florence, South Carolina.  We could get TV in Columbia, South Carolina.  We could get TV in Wilmington, North Carolina, and we could get TV in Charlotte, North Carolina.  And so when I later began to get into news and all of that, could watch all of those different stations and see how they did things differently and so forth, and I, I just thought that was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Did you get into news while you were in high school [Blenheim High School, Blenheim, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Just outside of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By the time I went to college, and I went to South Carolina State College [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now wait a minute.  Let me put the brakes--for just a second--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I want you to tell us like how you got to college.  That's always an important story.
Story_ID: 671208
Speaker 1: What were you thinking about in school?  Did you think that you were gonna go to college?  And what kind of counseling and advice are you getting?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a--that's, that's one of the stories that I tell most when I speak with young people about my upbringing.  Coming from this small school, Blenheim [Blenheim High School, Blenheim, South Carolina], and again, a graduating class of thirty-two people, let me impress that upon you--thirty-two people--out of the thirty-two, four of us went to college, four of these--we were all poor; we didn't have any money.  And so the university in South Carolina is the University of South Carolina [Columbia, South Carolina].  My other three friends, Anthony [ph.], Gloria [ph.], and Pearleen [ph.], went to the University of South Carolina.  I did not.  One, is because I knew that I wouldn't be able to afford it, 'cause I was gonna have to try and find a way to pay for it; and two, I was slightly intimidated, coming from this small school in Blenheim [South Carolina].  And I decided to go to South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  Now, just making that decision took so doing because most of my other friends were telling me that the farms were hiring.  And the farms were--you know, were--was dependable work.  It was work that we knew how to do, where you could get a job on the tractor or, or something of that like, but that you could get work and on the farm.  Right out of high school I started working in a factory.  I did that the summer before I went to college.  I was working in a factory.  That factory was paying good money.  It was a factory job.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so, what, what kind of factory was it?
Speaker 2: It was called Klopman Mills, and it, it was a printing factory that printed materials on linen like bedspreads and the like.  It was a third shift job that you--I worked the overnight graveyard shift.  But I was young and strong and just out of high school, and I was eager to make money, and it was work.  Typically our summers growing up we worked in the fields, you know, for a few dollars.  And, and then in the summer, we were four shades darker than we started the summer.  So get the job working in a factory--was good work, and it was paying me good money.  So I could've stayed and done that.  Because there were people who were trying to get that job with all they had, to get a job in that factory.  And I was just doing it just for a short period of time so I could move on to college.  And so I went on to college after that.
Story_ID: 671209
Speaker 1: South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University] is in Orangeburg, correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Orangeburg, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Right, historic Orangeburg, South Carolina.  In 19--this is--you're there in 1979--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-eight [1978]--went in as an undecided student, didn't know what I wanted to do, what my major would be, and didn't know how I was going to pay for it.  I, I knew that I had some initial assistance.  At the time there was a--what was called a BEOG grant, Basic Education Opportunity Grant [sic. Basic Educational Opportunity Grant], which was given to most of the, the poor families from the region where we from.  Had it not been for the BEOG, there's no way in hell that I would have been able to begin this college process, 'cause the little money I made from that factory [Klopman Mills] wouldn't have gotten me through one semester.  But that grant at least got me in the door, and then from there, I found a job.  I started working the audiovisual center at South Carolina State, which was a foray for me into media.  And then one of the guidance counselors at the university said to me one day that, "You know, you've got a pretty good voice.  Have you ever thought about radio, 'cause there's a job at a local radio station [WDIX Radio; WTCB Radio, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  It's just a part-time job.  You should go and try."  And I went and tried, and they hired me--took some doing though.  Would you like to hear why?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, this job called for experienced applicants only.  Obviously I had no experience.  So I went for the interview, put on my one good suit, which is all I had back then as a young college student, and was doing the interview.  And the, the news director at the, the, the radio station asked me--he said--says, "Do you have any experience doing this?"  Well, I know if I say no, that probably means the door is this way.  And I said, "Well, well, yes, I do."  I said, "I've been talking to people all of my life.  I said, "I've been communicating with people every day."  I said, "I--I've, I've spoken at my church [Asbury United Methodist Church, Clio, South Carolina].  I've, I've spoken in my classes.  Yeah, I've got experience.  I've got the personality, and I can do this job."  And I remember his reaction.  His name is Bob Snowden [Robert Snowden].  He sat back and he smiled, because he knew that I was just blowing smoke.  And he said, "I'm gonna give you a chance."  And I got that job, and that got me in the door in radio.  Once I got in the door in radio, the bug bit me.  And my media career took off from there and later started working in TV, and I've never looked back since.
Story_ID: 671210
Speaker 1: This station in Orangeburg [South Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --this is--
Speaker 2: WDIX Radio [WTCB Radio].
Speaker 1: WDIX.  And what was the format of this station?
Speaker 2: It was a country--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --radio station, which after about a year of working there, I talked them into letting me play some R and B on the weekends.  Took some doing to get 'em to go along with it, but they allowed me to do it.  And my show became wildly popular (laughter).  Who knew?
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean normally, was there any black music accessible on the radio there in Orange- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, there was.  There was a radio station called Quickie, WQKI [WQKI Radio], which was in town, which was across town in Orangeburg.  And that's what most of the, the people listen to.  So if they hear black music coming from a different station, particularly a country and western station, at least on the weekends, was a big deal at the time.  Now Monday through Friday it was back to its country western format.  But on Sundays and Saturdays they'd let me--they'd let me spin my own stuff--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --typically music that I'd borrowed from my, my roommate's music library, because the ra- the radio station didn't have the music.  I had to take my own stuff in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so WDIX--so you're doing this and, and going to school?
Speaker 2: And going to school [at South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: And is your major now what?
Speaker 2: My major now is communications.  I'm stayin- I'm studying a lot of English, public speaking, writing, all of the basic courses.  My freshman and a part of my sophomore year, I was taking artistic classes.  I thought maybe I'd be some type of creative art--creative artist, you know, something where I could draw something or whatever.  But I was not very interested in that.  I just didn't know what else I wanted to do, and like I said, until the, until the media bug hit me.  After the media bug hit me, I--it was clear that this is where I wanted to go, and what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 671211
Speaker 1: Now did you have any heroes?  I think during that time, Max Robinson was new on ABC News.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.  He was brand new.  In fact, I remember Max Robinson came to our university and, and spoke to us.  And you know, this was a big deal.  You know, this guy is on 'ABC World News Tonight.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first African American anchor on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --it had a profound--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --impact on me.  I was already--I got a chance to meet him--was already a budding journalism student--media student.  But it was a big deal, having an opportunity to meet him for the first time, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did you have a chance to tit- sit, sit down with him and talk to him?
Speaker 2: I spoke with him a little that day in school, because he did a brief meeting with a couple of us media students who were there.  But his assembly was for the whole university, for the whole college.  It was South Carolina State College [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] then.  And then there was another time later when I started doing news in Savannah, Georgia.  One night after the six o'clock newscast that I'd just anchored, the phone rang.  And it was from Max Robinson, who was in town visiting a buddy of his, said he'd just watched me, and told me I had a lot of potential and so forth and so on.  And I was able to go and spend time with him.  They said, "You know, if you have a few moments, come and share a meal with us afterwards and so forth, and we can sit and talk," and I did.  It was a great time to be able to do that, you know, sitting--come on.  Breaking bread and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's gotta be--
Speaker 2: --sitting down with the great, late Max Robinson back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did--so that had to be really inspirational for a student who wants to go into the media, to have Max Robinson come to the campus and speak.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Yeah, as I said, it was a big deal.   And--
Speaker 1: I don't know.  Had Ed Bradley started '60 Minutes' at that point?
Speaker 2: No, oh no, he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) okay--
Speaker 2: --he was far--he was far from--well, I'm not, not--I'm not so sure about that.
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], now he might have--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--no, no--
Speaker 1: --been--oh yeah, he might--
Speaker 2: --because I remember some of his earlier stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was doing the, the, the war stuff, you know.  He did a lot of war correspondent work.  And he may have been at '60 Minutes' at that point.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like in or around there at some point (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it would have been close if he wasn't there.  It would have been close to that.
Story_ID: 671212
Speaker 1: Did you have any other heroes in the media, I mean other than the black ones?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, you know, I grew up in the Walter Cronkite era, you know, "And that's the way it is."
Speaker 1: I was just gonna remind you of that (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, that's the way it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you said that I said that, "And that's the way it is."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But he was the guy we watched.  You know, Roger Mudd was on, and Frank Reynolds, and those type of guys, but it was always Cronkite.  Cronkite was, was the man.  We all watched Cronkite--
Speaker 1: I thought it was--
Speaker 2: --'CBS Evening News.'
Speaker 1: --interesting after the Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] assassination, the emergence of Dan Rather, who actually had a southern accent.  He was first of the major news anchors to have a southern accent.  He had a Texas accent (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a Texas accent.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, then from later Bill Moyers too, had a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You could detect his Texas accent.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I've, I've, I've tried to refine my accent so that it's not distracting for anyone.  And people often comment on, on how I sound and how I say what I say.  But again, my southern accent is part of my roots.  I can't fully get rid of it, nor do I do try.  I don't always hear it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well it's not as--I, I don't really--you know, having come in here, I don't--I mean I knew you were from South Carolina, but I couldn't hear--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina.
Speaker 2: If you give me five minutes back at home in the country in Bennettsville [South Carolina] with my buddies, who I'm still very close with from high school [Blenheim High School, Blenheim, South Carolina] and the like, it's a whole different animal.
Speaker 1: Okay, well now another oratorical hero in those day was Barbara Jordan, because--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of her appearance on the Watergate--she was known for almost over pronouncing her words.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was she seen as a hero at, at, at, at--in, in Orangeburg [South Carolina] at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University] in term--terms of being able to speak clearly and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And, and, and, and, and, and here's what was interesting about this.  For me in particular, and for a lot of others that, I'd, I'd, I'd hear them--I'm a speak of this--it was important to enunciate the king's language properly.  And so I'm sure that we overdid it in those early days, because we wanted to show and to prove to others that we're not some poor, dumb, country bumpkins, you know.  Because I'm black doesn't mean that I'm not learned, that I'm not a learned man, that I cannot communicate with you effectively.  I excelled at South Carolina State in all of my communications classes, excelled in all of my speeches.  The school would have me to, to give the, the, the, the big speeches for the entire school during some of the assemblies.  I'd, I'd--I became the man when it came--which was--did wonders for my confidence.  And I'm sure that had it not been for that, I wouldn't have gotten on the path as fast as I did.  I graduated from South Carolina State on a Sunday, Mother's Day.  I went to work at a TV station [SCE-TV] Monday morning.  That's unheard of today.
Story_ID: 671213
Speaker 1: So just before we get you out of there, were there any special teachers at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I alluded to this earlier.  There were always important teachers throughout my educational process, and that includes elementary school with Mrs. Humphrey [ph.] and Mrs. Kelly [ph.], and Mrs. Kane [ph.], and Mr. Prince [Wade Prince], and Mr. Roberts [ph.], so and so on.  And it was the same at, at, at South Carolina State.  But I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Dr. Eloise Belcher [Eloise Usher Belcher].  Dr. Eloise Belcher was a very, very refined and very proper young lady I say, because she wasn't that young, but she carried herself very young.  She had also been a teacher of Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And here she was teaching me at South Carolina State much later in life, but still very spry, always with an upbeat personality.  She, she taught dramatic arts, and she was perfect for the job.  But more than that, I had fallen behind.  Even though I had been a dean's list student at South Carolina State, there was one course that I needed that did not come around on the curriculum for me to take until after my graduation period.  So in other words, I had missed taking it earlier.  And I could have taken it like the year before, but I didn't.  And so it was not going to be offered again until the next semester after my graduation.  And I couldn't graduate without it, and I couldn't--I, I had two problems: one, the course wasn't offered; and two, even if I had taken it, I would have had to get an overload because I was already maxed out trying to get out of there.  So I had to go to the dean to get special permission: one, if he would allow me to take it, if it could be worked out.  But that the only way it could be worked it, Dr. Eloise Belcher came to my work study job, which I couldn't afford to leave because I needed the money, which was helping to pay my bills, and she tutored me personally in this one class that I needed so that she could certify me for graduation.  Now that's unheard of in a major university where an instructor, a professor, will take from their personal time to come to my job and tutor me, and that my supervisor on that job, whose name was Dr. Charlie Roberts [Charles Roberts], allowed it to happen so that I could still continue in the work study process, and continue to get paid, and that Dr. Belcher could come to my workplace and tutor me on the side so that I could get a grade to graduate on time; couldn't have done it without her.
Story_ID: 671214
Speaker 1: You know, being in school with guys coming back from World War II [WWII], you know, they're grown men now, in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, yeah.
Speaker 1: --he's, he's almost like a kid.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she'd [Eloise Usher Belcher] speak of him.  She'd, she'd often speak of the young Martin King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], who was one of her students.  And she'd oh, back then certainly--and she had very proper way of speaking, "He wasn't the big star," (gesture), "that of course we all later became to know and that he would go on to become, but he was a very quiet young man back then.  But I could still see his brilliance, even then.  You know, you knew that there was something about him."  And she--her--she'd light up when she spoke of him, which was fascinating to us, because obviously Martin Luther King was legendary, and to know that she had been one of the people that helped to shape his early life, made us feel special that she was teaching us.
Story_ID: 671215
Speaker 1: One thing more about South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] before we get you out of there, did you take any photography courses in college?
Speaker 2: I did not, although the, the shutterbug has always been a big part of my life.  I used to walk around with a camera even at South Carolina State, and I'd take pictures of flowers and so forth.  It wasn't good photography, but it was photography.  And I'd, I'd use it to try and take pictures of pretty girls (laughter).  If I'd see a pretty girl, I'd say, "Hey, would you mind if I took your picture" or, or, or whatever.  And sometimes, they'd, they'd let me, and sometimes they wouldn't.  And then when they'd see the result, the--they were good photographers who were on the campus.  I wasn't one of 'em, not at that time.  So--but I--but I had the camera even then.  I've always been very, very interested in photography.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  You were shooting 35 [35mm film] then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thirty-five millimeter, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, that's some serious--
Speaker 2: And, and 16mm film.
Speaker 1: In, in college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in college, it was 16mm where you had to run it and splice it together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that in, in, in your department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was in my department.  Yes, I was--certainly wasn't doing it professionally.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that, that was--
Speaker 2: But we were learning to splice film and so forth.
Speaker 1: I guess that'll be an essential part of if you got a job in news, 'cause people were shooting news on 16mm film.
Speaker 2: That's right.  But although, by the time I got into news, they had already moved on to the--to big cassettes after that.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Shooting the, the big Beta [Betamax] tapes.
Speaker 2: The big--those giant tapes by then.  And I started out--one of my very first jobs was as a news photographer, not, not as a news reporter or news anchor.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the job that's waiting for you upon graduation from--I didn't ask you--now did you pledge a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Which one?
Speaker 2: Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which was also Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] fraternity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I pledged in the fall of 1980.  That's called old school today.  And I am still in contact with every member of my fraternal line and several other brothers who were at the school at, at that same time, still in touch with them even now, talk to 'em all the time.
Story_ID: 671216
Speaker 1: Just one more question about South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  Now, the--with so much drama having gone on in Orangeburg [South Carolina] previous--in previous decades to, to your arrival, did they talk about the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --struggle in the Orangeburg--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --civil rights struggle--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and the Orangeburg Massacre, and all--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --all--
Speaker 2: The Orangeburg Massacre is a huge part of that school even today.  Well, for starters, the gymnasium is called SHM [Smith-Hammond-Middleton Memorial Center, Orangeburg, South Carolina], which stands for Smith [Henry Smith], Hammond [Samuel Hammond], Middleton [Delano Middleton], which were the three young students who were slain in the Orangeburg Massacre.  It's a clear part of the--of the history in Orangeburg, of how in 1968, I think it was, when the, the students were rebelling.  And they had been done to the bowling alley, and things started to go south at the--at the bowling alley, and violence began to erupt.  And by the end of the day, there were troopers and, and, and police officers with guns trying to quell a riot.  Of course, these were college students.  College is the time of rebellion, the time that you begin to, to find yourself in, in social realms and so forth and--but there had been other rebellions.  We all know about Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio], which had happened.  But what happened in Orangeburg at that time with, with Smith, Hammond and Middleton, wasn't as widely publicized, but the memorial on the campus--there is a memorial in addition to the gym.  And it would often come up during Founders' Day and, and so forth.  So they make sure that it's impressed upon the students who attend there.  It's a big, big part of it.
Story_ID: 671217
Speaker 1: So let's go on to the--what, what was your--the job that, that was waiting for you when you graduated [from South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I started working at the South Carolina educational television network, South Carolina ETV [SCE-TV].  It was a program that I was able to get into that was--that was state sponsored, where they were looking at that time for young journalists to, to see how they could acclimate them.  And they had taken four students from various places in the state.  I think one had come from Greenville, South Carolina, and there one, I think, from Charleston [South Carolina] (background noise) and somewhere else.  I can't exactly remember where the other one's from, but--and I was the lone African American student.  And so--
Speaker 1: So is this--is this 1982?
Speaker 2: This is in 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: And, and I started working there, covered the statehouse.  I was still learning, you know.  I was fresh out of school with, with an Afro and mutton chop sideburns, and learning, and learning.  But, but, but it, it gave me a foray into political life because we covered the statehouse.  We did a show called 'Open Line' statehouse week, where we reported on the, the weekly activities at the South Carolina State House [Columbia, South Carolina].  And that was my--that was my first working job in journalism.
Story_ID: 671218
Speaker 1: Were there any black members of the South--South Carolina State House [Columbia, South Carolina] in those days?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  There may have been one--no one--well, we had Jim Clyburn [HistoryMaker James Clyburn], obviously, who we all know the legend of Jim Clyburn.  But, but, now we had local legislators and that type of thing, but not a lot that I can recall.  No one is jumping, jumping out be- be- besides Clyburn.
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting because, as we stated before, South Carolina's population--if the black population was not greater than the white, it was certainly almost in, in--by 1980, '81 [1981] or so.  If it wasn't more, it was all--it was almost equal.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, no representation means that you are not--you're being--you're being had (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, yeah.  Yeah, there were no--there were no local politicians that I can recall that was there at that time.  And if they had--if there had been, I don't remember them (unclear)--I could research it, but, but no one is coming, coming to mind.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you have a show about the statehouse ['Open Line'], and you can't remember any of--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black people.
Speaker 2: --no, I don't, no.
Speaker 1: That's, that's pretty--
Speaker 2: Well, that's pretty telling, isn't it?
Speaker 1: --signif- yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and for me, I mean it wasn't so much about the statehouse, it was just for me.  I was just trying to get my feet wet and learn how to cover a story, learn how to turn that story around on deadline, that kind of thing.  And it wasn't a--wasn't a hard daily deadline because we only did that show once a week [on SCE-TV].
Story_ID: 671219
Speaker 1: Another South Carolinian we interviewed who--he's older than you, but [HistoryMaker] Armstrong Williams (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Armstrong--Armstrong and I were college classmates.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Well, not classmates, but we were both there together.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was at--
Speaker 2: South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Armstrong's from Marion, South Carolina.  I grew up in Bennettsville [South Carolina], as I've been telling you, and they're about--I guess about twenty-eight miles apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew Armstrong very well in college.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right, all right, all right.  So I did--I thought he was somehow older than you, but--
Speaker 2: Well Armstrong was a grade ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a gre- he was a grade ahead of me.   But even still, we interacted, and he was a--he pledged Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity] and I pledged Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  But even then, we were--we were all colleagues, knew each other, and we all got along just fine.
Speaker 1: I know he was sponsored now some (unclear) by Jesse Helms, and he talks about that.
Speaker 2: Well, not Jesse Helms, Strom Thurmond.
Speaker 1: Strom Thurmond, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Strom Thurmond--
Speaker 1: Right, your right, your right.
Speaker 2: --was, was his clear mentor back in those--back in those early days, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, did, did you ever meet Strom Thurmond in those day?
Speaker 2: I did.  I did.  I was--you know, I, I guess I could respect the position.  But the legend of Strom Thurmond for me was not something that I was gonna be overly enthusiastic about.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you have a slightly different political--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --view.
Speaker 2: --Strom Thurmond's reputation and then there are those who might disagree with it now or, or, or whatever.  But, you know, I mean Strom Thurmond was a key stronghold during the, the racist South, and held that position for a good long time.  And I'm sure it was only later in his life that he began to embrace people of color and so forth and so on.  But, but the, the early legacy and the lasting legacy of Strom Thurmond, at least for me, growing up in that state, was not a good one.
Speaker 1: I think he'd embrace at least one before--
Speaker 2: That's right, who was--had been a student at South Carolina State.  He had fathered a child obviously many, many years ago.  But there.  But, you know, it's, it's, it's a story about Armstrong.  Armstrong had been elected as the president of the Student Government Association, and had invited Senator Strom Thurmond's young wife [Nancy Moore Thurmond] to, to come and be a speaker at the assembly.  And us students in the assembly we were not very kind to her.  They jeered her and you know, and booed her and all this kind of stuff.  And it was very upsetting for her, and she left the stage in tears.  And Armstrong consoled her, as he should have.  She was there on his invitation; he was the president of the SGA.  He did exactly what he was supposed to have done.  And then he came back out onto the stage, and he promptly told off the student body, that we should be ashamed of ourselves.  He was absolutely right about all that.  We were young kids and acting stupid and irresponsible.  Well, we can't know the details of what that conversation was like later that evening or that day when the young Mrs. Thurmond went and told her husband, the powerful senator, about the terrible time she'd had at South Carolina State that day.  But had it not been for the young Mr. Armstrong Williams who came to her aid, and comforted her, and so forth and so on, it would have been much worse.  Again, no one was there to hear that conversation.  But we do know that when Armstrong graduated, he was a presidential appointee to Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] and to the agricultural department [U.S. Department of Agriculture].  Strom Thurmond insisted that that happen to President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I'm glad I asked about it, you know.  I, I--
Speaker 2: It's a little known story.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I hadn't heard--he, he didn't even tell that story I don't think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little known story.
Speaker 1: When, when, when we interviewed him, he did not tell that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 671220
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at South Carolina pu- public--
Speaker 2: E-TV [SCE-TV] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) broadcasting.  Is this just, just--it's radio and television, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Just, just, just tel- television?
Speaker 2: It was the TV.
Speaker 1: TV, okay.
Speaker 2: TV.
Speaker 1: So there--at, at, at that time were there--ha- how many sta- did they have more than one station?
Speaker 2: No, they had one station, but it aired across the state.  It was the state run television, and so the signal was carried across the state.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it's carried by different stations--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in different parts of the state out of one source.  Okay, so you had an 'Open Line' and then like--so in 19--so you were there how long--from '82 [1982]--
Speaker 2: I didn't stay there long because, again, it was a state appointed position depending on state funding.  There wasn't a lot of state funding coming into South Carolina at that time.  And so I, I knew that it wasn't, wasn't going to be a place to last long.  I later moved on to WBTW [WBTW-TV] in Florence, South Carolina.  And how I got that job, which was in sports, was very interesting.  I had gone home one weekend from working at E-TV and I had seen the, the, the weekend newscast.  And the gentleman that they had doing the news was just not very good.  He was extremely nervous and it showed.  And I remember sitting there, as I'm at home leisurely for the weekend at my parents' [Sarah McLeod Fennell and James Fennell] house--I remember sitting there pulling for this guy--come on, you can do it; no, don't--and I thought at some point he was just going to stop and say guys, I can't do this.  I really thought that.
Speaker 1: Now was this a black man on this?
Speaker 2: It was a black man, but I won't call his name.  And I, I just said to myself you know what?  I don't think that's something that this guy's cut out for or that he's happy doing.  And that--because it shows.  I said and if that's the case, they've got to be looking for someone.  And so that Monday I called the station.  And I said to them, you know--I told 'em who I was and where I worked, told 'em that I was from Bennettsville [South Carolina] which was right around the corner, I was a homegrown guy, and I'd like for 'em to take a look at my tape.  That's all I said.  And they looked at it, and they called me.  He called me on Wednesday and he asked me, could I work that next Saturday, two days later because they said they'd had a conversation with the gentleman.  And he told him that look, this job's not for me; I'm not happy; I don't wanna do it anymore, so the timing was fortunate.  So I worked there, and I did that, and then later I moved on to Charleston, South Carolina, not on air.  But I tried to get a job there on air.  The news director liked me, but told me that the only position he had at that time was behind the camera as a photographer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was pretty good at it.  Yeah, I had done that kind of work.  I had training in it and was very comfortable as a photographer, videographer, and editor.  But he said that as soon as the on air position became available it was mine, that he just wanted to get me in the door first.  Well, I learned a valuable lesson from that.  And that is you can't take those kinds of promises, because it wasn't long after that that he had moved on to another job and a new news director came in.  And I went to that news director and told him that I am only here as a photographer and editor until the reporter's job becomes available because that was why I was brought here, that news director looked at me--and I'll never forget it-and he said, "As long as you're working here, you're gonna be a photographer.  You will not be on my air."  Well, I left that job soon after that because I knew that there was more that I could do.  Although I enjoyed being a photographer and behind the scenes, I knew that it wasn't my ultimate goal.
Speaker 1: So there were no blacks on the air there in--
Speaker 2: No, there was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Charleston?
Speaker 2: There was.
Speaker 1: On, on that station?
Speaker 2: There was--there, there were several--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, but none more prominent than Joan Mack--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was legendary on Charleston TV, and just a--
Speaker 1: WCBD [WCBD-TV, Charleston, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: WCBD--just a wonderful person.  She became an early mentor while I was there, and, and, and, and she had opened a lot of doors.
Story_ID: 671221
Speaker 1: And so I later left there and moved on to WSAV [WSAV-TV] in Savannah, Georgia and became the, the first black anchorman of their nightly newscast in, in Savannah, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Pause) Now that had to really excite the community there in Savannah.
Speaker 1: It was.  It was definitely a lot of pressure in that job because I knew so many people were, were, were counting on me to do well and to represent them well.  And there were just as many people--remember this is Georgia--that wanted me to fail and made it very clear.  I received numerous, numerous letters with death threats, of people telling me how I would meet a bad demise, that I should get out of town and get back to Africa, and all of these things.  But all that just motivated me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --motivated me because I said you know what?  This is a good job.  I'm not about to let it go.  I'd already come up in rural South Carolina.  I wasn't afraid of this, and I was already accustomed to it, and so I stayed.  And, and we did well.  And, and, and I knew that, that there were shoulders that I was standing on.  And I knew that there were people in that community who I was their like.  And I've since met people later in life who've told me about they were there in Savannah and remember those times, or they were young students at that time, and they were watching me on the nightly news, like I marveled about Max Robinson when I was a student at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina].  So I knew I was doing the right thing and that I'd been put in the--in that place at that time for the right reason.  And so I, I, I stayed on until I finally left to, to move on to a bigger station and a better job [at WAVY-TV , Portsmouth, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, but you--the way you, you said it was Georgia kind of indicated to me that, that you thought that Georgia was more--
Speaker 1: Not--
Speaker 2: --had, had more ra- racial animus than say South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Well, I wouldn't say more, but I would certainly say equal.
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'd certainly say equal, if, if, if not more.  The Ku Klux Klan [KKK] was still real, still marching in Forsyth, Georgia [Forsyth County, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Right, that's the county they chased all the blacks out.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.  So yeah--no--and, and, and I'll say that the most racial hostility that I faced was in Georgia rather than South Carolina, for me.  I can only speak for me.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that takes us to--now, now this--
Speaker 1: We're in the mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, WSAV in Savannah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: The mid-'80s [1980s]--so these jobs are like but one year a piece or something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, they're two--one to two years.  Because again, remember, these are the steppingstone days where you're working for experience, you do short contracts, and when you think you're ready, you move up to the next thing--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --something bigger, something better, something that's paying more money.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: By the way, when I worked that job in Florence, South Carolina [at WBTW-TV], although I was happy to get it, I was paid nine dollars a sound bite.  So in other words, as a reporter, when we'd go out and do a report that's gonna air on the nightly news that that night, if I interviewed three people, that was twenty-seven dollars, okay.  And then I'd get another nine dollars for shooting the B roll that went with that story, for writing it and shooting the B roll that would be another nine dollars.  So most days you made about thirty-five to forty dollars a day.  This is as a--and you shot your own material, and drove your own car, and set up your own stories.  So the--we were one man bands in the truest sense of the word.  So that's not the kind of job you wanna linger in too long, you understand (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I--
Speaker 1: So when you have an opportunity to move on to something bigger and better where you have photographers shooting for you and so forth, then you, you gotta take that.
Story_ID: 671222
Speaker 1: And you got a bigger job--finally a better job I guess with WAVI-TV [sic. WAVY-TV] in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Portsmouth [Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Virginia.
Speaker 2: WAVY-TV 10.
Speaker 1: WAVY in a--in a country--in a, a town dominated by the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh huge Navy town--
Speaker 1: --and so--yeah.
Speaker 2: --which was really good.  WAVY really for me was, was the truest form of journalism that I had done to date, not to diminish the early journalism, particularly in Savannah [WSAV-TV, Savannah, Georgia] where--one thing I neglected to tell you--I told you that in Charleston [WCBD-TV, Charleston, South Carolina], I'd been a photographer, but I also produced, and I also wrote, and I edited, and I anchored.  When I went to Savannah [Georgia], I produced and I anchored.  I didn't do much reporting there.  When I went to WAVY, I wrote, I produced, I reported, and I anchored, and I occasionally I would shoot stories.  So all of my training and all of the various facets of it was always in play for me, always helped to shape and to mold me because it gave me a better perspective.  I, I wasn't just the guy in the suit in the studio that knew nothing about what life out on the street is really like or, or didn't understand the complexities of what reporters deal with on a deadline, because I'd done that--been there and done that and was still doing it.  So I had more toys to play with.  We had helicopters and satellite trucks, and, and it was a bigger newsroom with more people doing more jobs.  And so it really gave me, for that period in time, a good sense of what big time journalism on a daily basis was like.  And it was a number one station.
Speaker 1: Now this--for those who've never been to the Hampton Roads area, you got Portsmouth, Chesapeake [Virginia], Hampton [Virginia] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Newport News [Virginia].
Speaker 1: --Newport News--
Speaker 2: Virginia Beach [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yeah--Norfolk [Virginia].  They're all kind of right there together.
Speaker 2: They're all right there together.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It's really, it's really like a five city cluster.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly, so--
Speaker 2: So it's a pretty, pretty nice area.
Speaker 1: Right, and you got a lot of black people there.
Speaker 2: A lot of black folk, a lot of culture, like you said, and a huge military influence, a lot of northern influence, a lot of tourism influence from the beaches and so forth and people who just came to that region.  So, you know, each place that I've--that I've worked has a different dynamic.  When I was in Savannah, Georgia and in Charleston [South Carolina], those were port cities right on the river, right near the ocean [Atlantic Ocean], tourism driven, industry driven, and--but yet culturally distinct from one another; same thing in, in the Hampton Roads area; same dynamics of tourism, and, and, and, and port cities and so forth, but dramatically different from life in Savannah, or life in Charleston, or life in Columbia [South Carolina], or life in Florence [South Carolina].  And so I would take in all of this from various places and use it and learn from it, because that helped me to become a better reporter, a better anchor, a better journalist.
Story_ID: 671223
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time, all these stations--bearing in mind, all of these, to this point--were there any mentors or pe- people that really--you really learned--I mean that took their time to try to, you know, really guide you in the right way?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, the--there were--there were people everywhere that I went that if you're attentive, you can learn something from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I mentioned Joan Mack in, in, in Charleston [South Carolina] who, who had--was--on a hands on, local basis, was really on the front line, the, the face of that town, and so was valuable.  My time interacting with her helped me to become the face in the town of Savannah [Georgia] and how to wear that, and how to be that, and how to treat it with respect, and, and so various places I've been.  By the time I got to, to, to WAVY [WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia], I became much more--and based on the experiences that I'd undergone in Savannah with the death threats, the TV critics would kill me.  You know, they had nothing favorable to say about me on the air.  And so that was just all part of the culture.  So by the time I got to WAVY and left Savannah, I was more industry inclined; you know, I was more about trying to create better change in the industry, and I was also interested in trying to open doors and, and to become a better role model for others coming behind me, because I had known what I had been through.  And so in, in Hampton Roads [Virginia], I was part of a, a group, a coalition of people.  We came together and we formed the Hampton Roads Black Media Professionals.
Speaker 1: Now this is what--1988--'89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: This was in 19--about 1986--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --eighty-seven [1987], somewhere in there--'87 [1987] I think--the Hampton Roads Black Media Professionals, and they elected me as the founding president--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was a chapter of the NABJ, the National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 1: Now was this your first interaction with NABJ?
Speaker 2: It was.  It was my first interaction with NABJ.  As I began to find out--I had--I had been familiar with it, not actively involved in it.  NABJ was still reasonably new at that point, reasonably new.  I remember [HistoryMaker] DeWayne Wickham was the national president at that time, and he ca- invited him to come to the TV station, and he did--and so began to get far more active with that.  Our chapter, the Hampton Roads Black Media Professionals, under my leadership team, went on to become the national chapter of the year.
Story_ID: 671224
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got some great stories about my early days with Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So '97 [1997], all right.  So, so NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists]--so you start with N--NABJ in 1987.  And, and you got a like a Hampton Roads Black Media Professionals group going.  About how, how many people in your group?
Speaker 2: We built that chapter.  I think we probably had forty to fifty members, which was--which was outstanding.  All of our meetings were packed.  We created some great programs.  We started a--an awards program that was modeled after the NABJ Salute to Excellence Awards, which became the biggest event in that city, our annual awards program.  Because one of the things I wanted to do was not make it just an awards program for journalists, but to also make it an awards program for members of the community.  And so we would honor community leaders for the works that they were doing, and celebrate them was--pulled in the entire community, rather than just the journalism community.  And they still do that program even now all these years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that area is so rich in talent, and over the years have been, you know, crucial to the black community in terms of just development--the Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] and all that, you know, Norfolk State [Norfolk State University, Norfolk, Virginia] and all that.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: This is there; the Norfolk Journal and Guide paper [New Journal and Guide] from way when.  You know, it's a--
Speaker 2: The Journal and Guide, sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so, any rate, so they're organized as a result.  And you, you were one of the--
Speaker 2: I was founding president.
Speaker 1: --founding president.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have a note here about something called the, the Colonial Parkway mur- murders. Is that--does that affect the black community at all in that area?
Speaker 1: The Colonial Parkway murders, I--I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll forget it then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 2: --'cause it's, it's, it's written in the outline, but I don't--I didn't know anything about it.  I thought maybe that it was pertinent to--
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh I'm not familiar with the Colonial--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Parkway murders at all.
Speaker 2: So you were at WAVY [WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia] 'til 1991?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990], okay.  And that's, that's when you came to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's when I came to Philadelphia.
Speaker 2: --WCAU [WCAU-TV].  Anything about WAVY we need to know before we take you to--
Speaker 1: No.  Like I said, the biggest thing there was--you know, I, I--that's when I had started to become, you know, active in the journalism community more than anything else.
Story_ID: 671225
Speaker 1: When you're a news anchor and everybody knows who you are, and in--back in those days, I think it was even more so than today.  I mean people really idolized anchors on tel- television and ca- you know.  And everywhere you would go, somebody would recognize you.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And so, so did that--how did you have to change your activities in life to be able to deal with all of that?
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting because by the time I got to WAVY [WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia] I was already acclimated to being in the spotlight and the public eye, from my days in Florence [South Carolina].  That was my hometown.  Everybody knew me; everyone watched.  The ratings skyrocketed because there was a--you know, "Arthur's [HistoryMaker Art Fennell] on; you can--you can watch him."  And I was speaking here, and speaking there, and come to this event, and come cut a ribbon here all the time.  Then when I went to Charleston [South Carolina] the same thing.  I, I was anchoring the weekend news [at WCBD-TV] in Charleston, it went to number one.  And everyone knew me when I--when I walked the streets.  That popularity helped to get me in Savannah [Georgia], to become the first black man to anchor a nightly newscast [at WSAV-TV] at six and eleven [o'clock], and certainly just walking around town.  And, and, and I was always interested--I always did community events, and tended programs, and went to churches and spoke at church, and all of those types of things which helped to let people put a personality with the, the face of the person on TV.  And so by the time I got to Virginia, I h- I was already well accustomed to the spotlight.  And, and I was always happy.  One of the things that I like about me is that I was raised right in that I never let that go to my head, never changed me, the core of who I am.  And so as a result of being humble about it rather than being arrogant about it, I think people like me more.  And it made--it, it, it, it helped me with my career, rather than hurting me with my career.  I never wore it as (air quotes) I'm a big media celebrity.  I just--I'm just a--I tell people all the time I'm just an old country boy from the sticks of South Carolina and--which is true, and I think they like that.
Speaker 1: But you have to kind of watch out though about what you do in public in a--in a situation like that because everybody knows you, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you learn.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You learn early that--
Speaker 1: You, you go to the grocery story, everybody knows you there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Everybody--you know, whatever you do (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and if you go anywhere, a, a suit is a uniform.  People are used to seeing you in a suit.  It would be somewhat easier if I had on a baseball cap and some blue jeans.  But even with that, people still know you.  And, and for me my voice always gave me away.  I've, I've, I've had stories where I've ordered a hamburger at McDonald's at the drive thru, and when I pulled up to the window, everyone is standing there saying I knew it was him because they heard the voice.  So, so to, to, to your point, yeah, you have to watch your walk, and the people that you associate with, and the things that you do, because it not only reflects on, on, on you as a person--because everybody's watching you; they're watching you even when you don't know they're watching you--but it also reflects on your, your--on your job and your TV station.  If you're doing something that you ought not be doing, or if you're getting into trouble or whatever, you know, there is a--the clause in there that says that, that you will present yourself in a certain way at all times.  You can't violate your contract.
Speaker 1: I've often thought it's like being a parent in some ways.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have set role models (laughter).
Speaker 2: It is.  It is.  So you do, you have to walk--watch what you do and how you do it, and you have to watch how you treat people.  But those are just tenements of life that you should be doing anyway, as far as I was concerned.

Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990] now, how, how did the op- opportunity come to--come to--come, come about to come to WCAU-TV in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was doing the news one night and I got a phone call.  And it was from a gentleman named Paul Gluck, who had been visiting his mother who lived in the Hampton Roads [Virginia] area.  Paul Gluck I didn't know from a can of paint, but he was the news director in Philadelphia.  And he said, "I've watched you; I, I like what I see; when is your contract over in Virginia [WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia]?"  It just so happens that my contract was coming to an end in the next couple of months, and I told him.  And so he said, "I'd like to bring you to Philadelphia to take a look around and to see what we do here, and to see if it's something that you and I can come to terms with."  And so I do, came to Philadelphia and, and loved it.  This was big time TV.  This was a completely different animal than anything that I had been accustomed to up until that point.  But at least for me by then I'd already worked in several other TV markets.  I was used to moving around.  I was used to starting from scratch, and so that experience helped me to, to get acclimated in Philadelphia early.  I was brought on as the, the five o'clock evening news anchor.  I was young, but didn't carry myself in a young way.  It became clear that I knew my way around a story in the field, and I knew my way around the anchor desk in the studio, 'cause I'd--by that point I was seasoned.  And I wasn't intimidated, but yet, again, I didn't present myself in an arrogant type of way.  One thing about Philadelphia that I learned very early, and it's--was true then, and it's true now.  In this town, if people like you they will let you know.  And if they don't like you, they will let you know.  And if they don't like you, you are not long for this city.  I'm fortunate that they like me, and so I was able to survive.  And as they say, the rest is history.  I've had a very good tenure here.
Story_ID: 671227
Speaker 1: WCAU [WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was affiliated with NBC then, right, Channel 10 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were CBS at first.
Speaker 1: CB- okay.
Speaker 2: At the time WCAU was--it was the first owned and operated television station in the country.  It was owned and operated by the CBS network.  And then I think it was 1996 or thereabouts, they changed over.  And they swapped network affiliations with KYW-TV [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], who was the NBC station.  And KYW-TV became CBS--no--yeah, became CBS, and WCAU became NBC.
Speaker 1: Now this--the dynamics of this is--cra- correct me if I'm wrong--CAU--C- CBS at one time was premier.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they had lost--back during the 'Gunsmoke,' Ed Sullivan ['The Ed Sullivan Show'] days--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and it lost its steam--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --in the '80s [1980s].  And 'Frasier' and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --'Seinfeld,' all this stuff on NBC--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is now big time--
Speaker 2: NBC was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and 'Tonight Show' ['The Tonight Show'] and all.
Speaker 2: Yes, NBC was on the uptick--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --had good programming, and was capturing a larger audience.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So it, it actually helped WCAU.  Because it went from WCAU-TV to becoming NBC 10--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --while I was there.  They started to brand the NBC name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they still do today.
Speaker 1: All right, so this is--you know, so stra- the dynamics are really the stronger 'tation- station takes the affiliation from a weaker (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, not always necessarily so, but in this case, that's the way it worked out.  And it was basically--it was a matter of signals in certain areas at certain times and strategically what was better and what was a disadvantage for both of those stations at that time.  It was a technical deal that made sense for KYW and for CAU to change network affiliations at that time.
Speaker 1: So was it--was CAU the leader in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, number two.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, two.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so WPVI [WPVI-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] has been a dominant number one here forever.  I think they're the longest running number one affiliate in the country and, and have been for quite some time.  They were number one certainly when I got here, a strong number one.  And NBC 10 was a strong number two.
Story_ID: 671228
Speaker 1: So you did all of the major functions here, reporting, anchoring, you know, you did some producing.
Speaker 2: Hosted it--hosted several talk shows.  They gave me a talk show over there called 'Family Focus,' which was the first talk show that I had done here.  I'd done--prior to that I'd done other talk shows.  And I did a talk show in WAVY [WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia] called 'The Bottom Line.'  I did a, a talk show back in, in South Carolina.  Now I can't remember what it was called now.  It was a long time ago.  But I've done--I'd done various talk shows and had produced those.  And that's why I'm saying my early training continued, continued to help me even while I was here, you know, and gave me an opportunity to, to highlight and to show that I could be more than just one thing, that I was multifaceted.
Story_ID: 671229
Speaker 1: Now the other thing that I was very proud of here is that by then--by this time, I was a regional director--had been a regional director with the NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], which put me on their national board of directors--traveled all over the country attending board meetings and functions and the like, and was also in the leadership in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists.  And it was about that time, while I was in Philadelphia, that I was approached by several colleagues.  And they said you're the person we want to run as the next national president of the NABJ.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is 1995?
Speaker 1: This is 1995.  I'd been in town at that point about four or five years and was doing well.  And this was an opportunity to, to, to put up or shut up.  You say you wanna lead, and you, you say there's more you wanna do.  Now, well, here's your time and here's the place.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, the way NABG--BJ works, from what, what I understand, they elect the president a year ahead of the time, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, during the election season they elect the entire board of directors, which at that time consisted of, I think, ten regions.  And each region had a regional director that sat on the national board.  And then as part of the national board, you had the regional directors, you had the parliamentary, and the secretary, the treasurer, the vice president of print, and the vice president of broadcast, and then the national president, and the immediate past president that consisted of the board directors.  And so I ran af- after serving as a successful two time regional director, raised a lot of money in my regions for my regional conference, and I think it did a lot of good in, in my region--had a big region obviously, the whole northeast corridor; it's a big region.  And I ran, which at that time was unusual because I didn't run from a leadership position on the executive board.  Most of the people who had elevated to national president had come from positions as vice president or as at least a national treasurer or secretary or something, but, but not from a regional director's position.  I ran from a regional director's position.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so, so you were elected--
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) pres- president, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And served from '95 [1995] to '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: It's a two year term, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, you succeeded Dorothy Butler Gilliam [HistoryMaker Dorothy B. Gilliam]--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --the columnist from Washington Post [The Washington Post].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so--
Speaker 1: Dorothy--one of the motivating factors for me that I wanted to run, that was a very tricky time in the dynamics of, of NABJ.  There were--there were a lot of issues going on.  And, and Dorothy had taken a lot of shots during her presidency.  I always regarded as a, a sound journalist, an accomplished journalist, at the forefront of her industry, an industry leader, a person who carried herself with dignity and pride, and who may have made mistakes in leadership, but who doesn't--that she was unfairly embattled by colleagues and by the industry.  I, I thought it was unfair, and I didn't like it.  And I thought I could help to clean some of that up.  I thought that, you know, NABJ's better than this.  There were times when it had gotten ugly, quite frankly.  There were some board meetings that, that we sat in on where it was just flat out ugly and disrespectful to her, and she didn't deserve that.  And so I knew what the issues were; I knew where, where, where I thought I could make a difference, not only internally, within the organization, but externally, through contacts and so forth that I had made, that I thought that I could make a difference; and so I agreed to run.  And you know, I can't remember exactly what my slogan said now, but in essence it said if a--if a man stands ready with a dedicated heart and a focused goal, if he stands willing, and if he stand capable and ready to serve, then let him lead.  And so they, they let me lead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so you, you actually won unopposed, right?  You--
Speaker 1: I ran unopposed--
Speaker 2: Ran unopposed.
Speaker 1: --which at the time was unprecedented.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: There were people who, who were going to run, and then when I placed my name forward, they decided that they would not run.  Either, either out of respect or either because they didn't feel that they could run a successful candidacy against me.  I had a good machine behind me at that time.  I had good supporters, and I was riding a good wave, and, and quite frankly, I would have been hard to beat.
Story_ID: 671230
Speaker 1: The speaker I think at the first--I mean at the time of your appointment, was Johnnie Cochran, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He spoke for NABJ--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: --during the time he was the hottest he was gonna be I guess.
Speaker 2: Johnnie Cochran was a huge draw.  The O.J. Simpson trial [People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson, 1995] had just concluded, and Johnnie Cochran was a rock star.  And he came and he addressed us on a couple of occasions.  And I have pictures even today with Johnnie Cochran from my, from my time as president, which was just--was just one of the more memorable things.  I also am proud to say that during my tenure was the first time that NABJ had a sitting national president of the United States to come and address the national convention.  We were going to, to be in Chicago, Illinois.  It was 1997, and, and, and Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was coming to speak.  He agreed to--at my invitation--to, to come and be our keynote address for our newsmakers luncheon, which was an event that almost never happened.  Because even after the White House security advance team agreed that they would have him in, the security detail that was required for the setup for the president meant that they would have to eliminate more than half of the seats in the grand ballroom where my members would be so that they could put in security details and platforms for security.  Well, that was unacceptable to me because--I said this is our convention; these are our national members; and I'm not going to kick them out of the room.  And so I remember we sat down--I sat down, myself, and my executive team, and my executive director--and she tells the story better than I do--where the [U.S.] Secret Service detail told me that if we were going to have this luncheon that those seats would be taken out.  And I said, "Oh, hell no, they won't be."  I said, "And if that means that the president will not be coming as a result of this, then you go back and explain it, and then we'll explain it from our end.  Remember, we're an organization of journalists.  We write and influence people for a living."  And I wouldn't back down from that.  And so they worked around that seating chart so that they did not throw my members out of that room, and they came anyway.  It did not happen easily.  It was very, very tense.  Now here I am this little kid from the sticks of South Carolina that grew up hearing ghost stories and all of this other stuff in an intense negotiation with the president's lead security team, but I was standing on behalf of the National Association of Black Journalists, and I won.  The president came in, we had a great time; it was a stellar event, and it really, quite frankly, elevated NABJ to a new level of national prominence and respect in our journalism industry, because people were saying, "Wow!  How in the world did you guys do that?"  Bill Clinton was extremely popular in 1997.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right.  That's before Monica Lewinsky (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yes, he was extremely popular.
Speaker 1: --after the Republican Revolution, but they--he had started to make a comeback against the Republican Revolution--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --at that point.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So now since then, President Bush [President George Walker Bush] came into office, and he came to the conference.  President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has been to--the presidents now come to our national conventions where once they didn't.
Speaker 1: That's groundbreaking--
Speaker 2: It was a groundbreaking moment.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And--but it's only fitting that they should come to the National Association of Black Journalists.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause if you played the power of the press--
Story_ID: 671231
Speaker 1: Here's a great story, one of the--one of the greatest moments in my life that I tell people.  So the president is, is due to arrive any--it's the day of the event.  We're in Chicago, Illinois at the--at the--at the hotel.  And I'm with the security team.  They're with me and they're telling me, "Mr. President," they were referring to me as Mr. President, "we'll need to escort you to the receiving area where the motorcade will be arriving.  Could you please come and walk with us?"  I said, "Why certainly, I will."  So we walk to this private area which was at the hotel, which was in the inside where private deliveries came through.  And we're standing there, and there's nothing but [U.S.] Secret Service people standing around, and there's nothing going on.  And the Secret Service guys are on their walkie talkies, and they're saying, "POTUS is on the move; POTUS is on the move; POTUS is--," and they'd give his location.  POTUS, obviously, is the president of the United States, POTUS.  So they're giving his, his--where his location is.  So finally, I hear one of the Secret Service people saying, "All standby; POTUS is arriving; POTUS is arriving."  And I'm standing there going, I don't see POTUS or modus or anybody else.  And then I start to hear a rumble.  And the rumble gets louder, and louder, and louder.  And then I see a motorcycle detail come roaring through.  And I'm standing--they tell me they want me to stand exactly right here.  I'm standing exactly right there, and a motorcycle passes, vroom, then another, vroom, then another, vroom; then a black suburban SUV passes me, vroom, and then another, vroom; and then a limo passes me, vroom; and then another limo comes up and stops right in front of me.  And before the wheels stopped rolling, the doors were opening, and Secret Service guys were getting--were exiting the vehicle.  And one stood to the front, one to--stood to the back, and another stood at the door, which by the way, the door was right here in front of me, and he stood there at attention.  And inside the door in the backseat the president was just looking down.  He was not--he was oblivious to everything around.  I mean he was just looking at notes.  And then when he was ready, he looked up to the Secret Service guy and did like that (gesture).  They opened the door.  He stepped out.  He stood right in front of me and he said, "Arthur [HistoryMaker Art Fennell], Mr. President, it's so nice to meet you."  He says, "I'm all yours; where would you have me go?"  And I went, "Wow!  Well, Mr. President, let's go this way," and we proceeded to the conference.
Speaker 2: Can't beat that.
Speaker 1: Couldn't beat that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This, this is, this is President Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton].
Speaker 1: That was President Bill Clinton.
Speaker 2: He was called the black president--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --by many who had--
Speaker 1: --the first black president.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you know, they talked about his charisma.  People we've talked to talk about how he makes people feel like he's only talking to them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's never looking to his next person.  He's talking to you.
Speaker 1: That's exactly right, and I've told people exactly that.  But I've, I've seen--I've seen him do that, but I've seen better.  Believe it or not, I've, I've been in the company of several presidents.  President Clinton was clearly a rock star in the room, clearly.  But President Clinton would engage you, but he was always aware of everybody else around him.  And there would be times when he would--you know, you could see--you could see him wander.  When I--when I interacted with President Bush [President George Walker Bush], I didn't get that, and I was surprised by it.  I thought that he'd be--but he was more locked in, and I--and I noticed it.  And I noticed it.  So I'd, I'd have to give him more points on that, at least in my experience of being in his presence--was, was--just seemed to be more.  But by far the biggest rock star out of all of 'em is President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  Oh, my goodness, I mean his presence just changes everything.  It was just, just phenomenal to see and to, to, to, to see that happen.
Story_ID: 671232
Speaker 1: As president of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], you bring in Johnnie Cochran, Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] and--
Speaker 2: And the Reverend Al--not re- [HistoryMaker] Minister Louis Farrakhan--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who did not at that time give a whole lot of speeches.  And remember the Million Man March had just happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In '95 [1995], yeah.
Speaker 2: And he was--he was wildly popular.  And he came and addressed us as well.  And we also had--before we had--before we had President Clinton to come in '97 [1997], in 1996, the vice president, Al Gore, came.  The president was supposed to come that year, but he didn't.  And so when Al Gore was addressing our conference with Bob Dole, because it was the election year--and I had a picture with Senator Bob Dole who was the Republican nominee--the two of us were on the front page of The New York Times, above the fold.  And that was unprecedented for NABJ at the time.  But while Al Gore was there addressing us, I asked him on stage with all of the cameras on us, and there must have been a hundred cameras on us, I said, "Mr. Vice President, I just have one question for you."  I said, "Where is your running mate?"  Because he had--was--President Clinton was supposed to be there, and he didn't.  And he then went on to--I saw him changing his notes.  He had his prepared remarks.  He's--I could see him on the podium shuffling his papers to find the appropriate answer that was scripted for him to say.  And then he went on to say that the president had other obligations and so forth and so on, whatever he said.  And then I followed up.  And this is in front of a room full of journalists and a national audience.  CNN was carrying it live.  I said, "Will the president be here next year should you win the election?"  And he said, "If he wins the election, the president will be here."  And I stuck out my hand, and I said, "Your word is your bond."  And this was all off script.  What was he going to do?  Was he going to refuse my hand?  He grabbed my hand, he held it, he looked me in the eye, and he said (gesture), "My word is my bond."  President Bill Clinton was there the next year.
Story_ID: 671233
Speaker 1: --And Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] White House (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well, that was a big thing, having someone in the room that could tell you look, don't do that.  You're about to make a mistake.
Speaker 1: Right.  So okay, so what was your agenda with NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists]?  Was your pri- what were your priorities, and what do you think you accomplished as president?
Speaker 2: Well, you have to remember that the Internet was brand new during this time.  It's certainly not what it is today.  And there was a great deal of discussion about the digital divide, that only the rich and the privileged had access to digital information.  We didn't believe that that was, was fair, one, and that everyone should have the opportunity to have access to information.  We're a journalism organization.  Diversity was extremely important, because we believe, and we could see on a daily basis in newsrooms all around the country, that not many of us, people of color, were in decision making capacity, and that major decisions were being made about coverage and about tone and style of coverage where they had no input from people who perhaps knew better because they had lived it and experienced it.  And so we wanted more inclusion.  These issues have never gone away by the way, but they were extremely critical during this period of time because the industry was about to move to a whole new level.  And so we helped to increase numbers, to get more people of, of color in the doors.  And now it's at the point where it's becoming more and more commonplace to make sure that we were at the table on important matters, and that when there are cultural issues of sensitivity that someone could be there to say, "Ah, hold on a minute, you may want to consider this," to have that kind of voice in the room.  And then I wanted to ensure that we were providing training for our people.  You know, we would go and do training elsewhere.  We'd go to Poynter [Poynter Institute for Media Studies], or we'd go to various other places and receive training from other--I said we are an industry of leaders.  I said we are qualified and capable to train this industry, to train young journalists, and to, to train ourselves, and to put in a mechanism where we can turn to ourselves and, and get the training and expertise as a source of what we need.  And so I help to found the Media Institute, the NABJ Media Institute, which was the vehicle to do that, to provide that type of training, and to, to, to have a building where, where people and staff could be housed where, where this type of training could take place.  It, it was--it was done; it still is in existence today; and it's still doing quite well; and it will be a lasting--a lasting legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the NA- NABJ Media Institute (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Media Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--all right, so, now you were succeeded by Vanessa Williams--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of The Washington Post.
Story_ID: 671234
Speaker 1: In terms of WCAU [WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], what were the more memorable stories and events that occurred at CAU?  And, and who else was there too, you know, when you were--
Speaker 2: People of color or just in general?
Speaker 1: Yeah, pe- people of--well, everybody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, people of color we had--Edie Huggins was there.  Edie Huggins had long been the face of WCAU, the--one of the first female African Americans on air in the City of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  She was there.  Harvey Clark had been there--the journalist, Harvey Clark.  John Blunt was there.  There, there were--there were--at WCAU, to their credit, they had equipped themselves with people of color who were capable and, and good in their jobs.  Gene Lothery was the general manager, the, the guy who had hired me to come in and, and, and to--and to anchor his newscast.  He had a basketball goal in his office.  And as we were negotiating my contract, we were at a point where we were at an impasse with some of the dollars.  And I looked over at the basketball, and I said, "I'll shoot you for it."  He liked that, and we shot for it.  Remember, I was the starting point guard of my high school team [at Blenheim High School, Blenheim, South Carolina] and, and, and did very well in scoring.  I got what I needed in the contract, but it was a fun way to do it and very different.  And we had a black news director later; [HistoryMaker] Drew Berry came through and was our news director.  So we had good African American representation, which made it easier in covering stories.  You asked us when the more memorable moments.  Covering the, the Somalia invasion where we traveled to Africa was a really big deal and a huge international story at the time, when the American forces stormed the beaches of Somalia, and all the journalists were there waiting for them with lights on.  Well, we were there.  We were--we were part of that.  It was my first time reporting internationally, and it was important that we do it right.  We won awards for our coverage of that.
Speaker 1: Now, now what, what year is this when the--
Speaker 2: This was in 1991 I think it was, maybe 1992 I think or somewhere right in there--yes, 1992.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Interviewing Nelson Mandela when he came to Philadelphia.  Because of my Africa contacts at that time, I was granted the only, the exclusive television interview with the late, great Nelson Mandela upon his time here when he was here to receive the Philadelphia Medal of Freedom--Liberty Medal award [Philadelphia Liberty Medal] with the great lion of Zion, the Reverend Leon Sullivan, and to be with them as the only journalist, and to ride in President Mandela's motorcade was just a fantastic exclusive moment that I think really helped to show people here that I was capable of doing big stories on a big level.
Speaker 1: So this was '92 [1992], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This would have been I think 1993--
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: --or '94 [1994]--
Speaker 1: Okay, '3 [1993] or '94 [1994].
Speaker 2: --somewhere in there when President Mandela was here--and, and just countless stories of covering this city from the grassroots level, of being in the neighborhoods when something's about to go down or as it's going down, or being in people's homes and sharing with them when they've just experienced a loss or a tragedy, or to the other side of the spectrum, when they've experienced some great triumph or, or some great joy.  You know, just to be able to see those stories, to feel it, to be a part of it, and then to report it, you know, I've, I've cherished all of that.  I, I think it's important, and that's something that I've always respected and never, ever took for granted.
Story_ID: 671235
Speaker 1: Now you founded Fennell consulting--
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: --in the '90s [1990s], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, we all go through a period of burnout.  By the late '90s [1990s] I was starting to hit a period of burnout where I had been running for a long time at that point without a break.  You know, I'd never been unemployed out from the--from the very first moment of graduating high school--I mean college [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina]--to that point.  I'd never been unemployed.  And so I was experiencing some burnout and thought it might be time for a change.  At the time I wasn't real happy with the direction in which the leadership of the TV station [WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was going during that period.  I thought it was becoming too much sensationalism and not enough solid journalism and solid reporting without bells and whizzle--whistles and sensationalizing the headlines.  I was never big in that.  And so I said well, this may be a teaching moment for me literally.  You know, I can step aside for a minute here and, and teach others, and train, provide consulting for people who have a need within the industry.  And I did, and I was able to successfully do that.  And I started that in 1999, and it continues today.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And--okay, so, so, so, so is it a major--is this, this the, the company out of which you pro- produce--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) programs and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I--at the time, when I'd stepped aside, I wasn't working.  I was doing that full time.  But then when I was taken on by Comcast [Comcast Corporation], which by the way initially was a client, because they were looking to get into the news business, and I was consulting them.  And then later they talked me into coming back on air to be the face of their, their operation.  And we launched CN8 News, which was the Comcast Network, which was aired on Channel 8.  So it became CN8 News.  We launched that from the ground up.  I helped create the format for it and hired--helped to hire the people that ran that operation.
Speaker 1: So this is local Comcast news.
Speaker 2: It was a regional--
Speaker 1: Regional, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) a regional newscast.  We aired throughout the entire State of Pennsylvania, from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] all the way in.  We were on as far south as Richmond, Virginia and as far northeast as Boston, Massachusetts and throughout Connecticut, and that--Rhode Island, that whole region.  So we were a regional network, not just a local TV station.  And so as such, we had a broader reach and, and breadth of what we covered, rather than just local Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] stories because someone on Boston doesn't care so much about a local Philadelphia story, although we covered local Philadelphia as well.  But we just did more than just that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and--
Speaker 2: And, and, and, and, I--and--as part of my contract, I, I, I was able to maintain my work with Fennell Media, my consulting company, because we, we started to do production work.  And we did long form journalism stories where we would travel and report on issues, or people, or places, things that were happening locally, or regionally, or nationally, or internationally.  And then later, when we shut down CN8 News in 2007, I launched 'Art Fennell Reports,' which was a, a news magazine show very similar to Anderson Cooper's 'AC 360' ['Anderson Cooper 360'] that you see on CNN every night, almost an identical format, which was done, which had my name on it.  And well we did that for many years.
Story_ID: 671236
Speaker 1: So you received an, an Emmy Award in 2006, right--or was it 2007 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I received an Emmy in 2006.
Speaker 1: As outstanding news anchor.
Speaker 2: Outstanding news anchor in the Mid-Atlantic region, which was very a fulfilling reward, very humbling to say that of all of the news anchors who were sitting at the news desk on a nightly basis and reporting, and telling people the news that was happening in, in their cities, not just Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], this is a regional award, a committee thought that I did it best.  So that was very good.  I've been honored with four Emmy Awards and several other industry awards and community service awards.  And at last count it was right at about 100 awards that I've received throughout my, my career.
Story_ID: 671237
Speaker 1: Let's go--let's go back to 'Art Fennell Reports.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just tell me about some of the shows, and what are you really focused on in terms of life in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, on a nightly basis we, we would focus on the news of the day, the hot story.  Whatever the hot story is, we'd focus on it.  And we'd provide alternative reporting to it, to try and take an angle that you're not gonna see on the, the, the 'NBC Nightly News' or, or something of that nature, and, and try to provide perspective to it with different interviews or panel discussions, if necessary, to a people who have opinions and insight on these matters.  But then we would also take the show on the road and report from the field.  I've reported from, from Africa multiple times, reported from all across the country, from Washington [D.C.] to New York [New York], to San Francisco [California], to the Mexico border, from Boston [Massachusetts] to New Orleans [Louisiana] after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina]--spent a lot of time in, in New Orleans after Katrina, one of the first journalists there afterwards, and won, won national awards for our coverage where the whole show is on location.  So we did a lot of that and then issues that people are talking about.  I did correspondent work as part of my work with 'Art Fennell Reports' for TV One--led TV One's national coverage of the national election, the history making election when President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] went into office the first time, to be on the front lines of that as that was happening.  So all of that was happening during this--during this span of time while I was doing this show.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, you do consumer reports as well(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, or we do consumer--there were various aspects of, of the programming wheel--consumer reporting--
Speaker 1: So, so, so--
Speaker 2: --health--
Speaker 1: --news magazine--
Speaker 2: --reporting.
Speaker 1: --show.
Speaker 2: It's a news--yeah, news magazine show.  But it all came secondary to the news of the day.  Like right now if we were doing it, we'd be doing a perspective on Bowe Bergdahl, you know, and the--you know, the, the, the hearings on whether or not will we cut a deal or not, and if a deal should have been cut, and if the two theories of whether or not we should negotiate with terrorists stands in a juxtaposition with you leave no soldier behind.  And these are the types of things that are the discussions that are playing out in the national media so this is exactly what we would be doing as well with a local panel of people of bringing local perspective to those types of issues, whatever the issues are, whatever they are for that particular day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you use your experts, and your commentators will be people from the--from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] al- area.
Speaker 2: Not always.
Speaker 1: Or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They could be--they could be satellite.  They could be--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --from Washington, or New York, or wherever they may be.  Whoever we could get is who we would--who we would talk to.  And we also had a correspondent in Washington.  April Ryan was our--she works for American Urban Radio Networks, who always provided our Washington perspective on this, on Washington matters.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's a feature called 'Good Stuff'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nightly cluster of offbeat, quirky stories.
Speaker 2: Yeah, which ironically was exactly what CNN is doing now, and it's called 'The Good Stuff.'  Well, we had ours first.  But 'The Good Stuff' was like a, a breather from the murder and mayhem that we're going to get on a nightly basis.  It, it never goes away in news.  But beyond all of that, there are things that people are doing that are fun, unusual, different, interesting, exciting, and in all of these types of that we would put together, just a small cluster, and we'd call it--and here now 'The Good Stuff,' you know, something that you may not have heard of, but we think that you'll have some fun getting to hear about it.  And we did; we'd have fun with it.  It wasn't all serious; we'd have fun too.
Story_ID: 671238
Speaker 1: Now in addition to, to t--to Comcast [Comcast Corporation], you served as a special assignments--on, on special assignments for T- TV One, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: We, we led--myself and Joe Madison, from satellite radio [XM Satellite Radio, Inc.; Sirius XM Radio, Inc.] in Washington [D.C.]--we, we led TV One's coverage.  You have to remember, President Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], when he was still Senator Barack Obama running for the presidency that was a huge story for the nation, as you will recall.  We were at the forefront of that, driving coverage for TV One, providing extensive coverage at the, the Democratic National Convention [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado], and then being in Chicago [Illinois], you know, in the park [Grant Park] on election night when the president was elected, to be there.  Tom Joyner was part of our coverage team and, and others--to be able to do that.  And then the inauguration day, where I got a mild case of hypothermia from being on a rooftop in Washington from four in the morning until nine o'clock at night, you know, in, in, in freezing temperatures covering this big story, which I knew would be one of the biggest stories of my lifetime.  So, you, you know, you, you, you take one for the team.  So we did that and other stories as well, like the Michael Jackson memorial--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --service, which was held in Los Angeles [California], providing live coverage of that and, and other stories.
Speaker 1: And the Democratic National Convention that year [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the inauguration.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Story_ID: 671239
Speaker 1: I mean, did you see I guess--just back to pres- pres- President Obama.  Did you see that, you know, reaching--I mean, did, did, did you see him becoming the president of the United States when he--
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, I did.  You know, because being that deep in the daily coverage and following the trends of, of the euphoria that was catching on, the, the organization that his candidacy had, the more he was in that spotlight--I'm talking about the early [HistoryMaker] President Barack Obama--the more he was excelling.  He wasn't making a lot of mistakes, although they were trying to get him from every angle.  And he was confident, and, and he was attracting more white people than it seemed than were black people.  And we knew that if he got the white vote, that he would be elected.  There's no doubt about it, because the black vote was an almost what we call a gimme.  But he was securing the white vote in record numbers.  And then he became the hot candidate after that, meaning that this is the candidate that's gonna do it; he's got the momentum.  Once he got that momentum he never turned it loose.  And then keep in mind he was running against John McCain, okay.  And so McCain, although a seasoned veteran politician, certainly didn't have the charisma that Obama had.  And so to offset that, he brings in Sarah Palin, who was supposed to be young, and energetic, and a new fresh look that would help him, but she turned out to be a disaster.  And so all of that, he, he cruised in, and I wasn't surprised quite frankly when it finally happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, but you were able to cover all the jubilation and all the--
Speaker 2: Not only did I cover it, I provided commentary, which I was very happy to do.  Because as part of my format, I had a segment called Words of Art [ph.], play on works of art obviously.  But this would be the part of the program at the end of the show where I told you how I saw it.  And I would often try and find that bit of material or information that you may not have heard or a different perspective on what you may have heard, but this is different from what you thought you knew.  And it was eye opening for people, for many of 'em.  And a lot of people disagreed with my point of view, which was fine because I would put their disagreements on.  I'd say, "I heard from Joe--Joe Smith who disagreed with my statement on this, and Joe writes," and then I would read Joe's email or correspondence.  And people I think appreciated that transparency that I don't have to be right.  I'm just telling you my opinion on it.  But more often than not, the, the letters were, were letters of support that told me that I was spot on.
Speaker 1: So it reveals on some level these--the response of the public reveals on some level a feeling that you're in touch with them.
Speaker 2: Exactly--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that you're in touch, that you're not coming out of left field, and that here is a different perspective that you may want to consider or that you may not have known.
Story_ID: 671240
Speaker 1: I did--I did that many times.  I did at another--I got the most response I ever had when I, I did a documentary--we won an award for it--called 'Murder in Memphis: Timeline to an Assassination,' where we traveled to, to Memphis, Tennessee, and traced the timeline of the assassination of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], you know, with a time chart on the screen, and interviewed people who were with him during these times.  These people are still alive, and well, and living in Memphis, Tennessee.  And then at the end of that program, I did a commentary concerning James Earl Ray in which I stood in the boardinghouse, and stood in the bathroom window where the shot was fired, showed and played the radio broadcast.  When I say radio, I'm talking about police radio when they were looking for him just minutes after the shots had been fired.  How could they have known who to look for?  They were calling his name--not, not his name, but they were giving his description on the radio--on the police radio.  And having grown up in the country, and used to go hunting all the time, and was a pretty good shot with a rifle, I said that to make that shot from that balcony window--from the boardinghouse window to the balcony of the Lorraine [Lorraine Motel, Memphis, Tennessee] was not a far shot.  It's not nearly as far as I thought it was until I got there.  And it wasn't a difficult shot.  And I said that a marksman could make that shot easily.  And his gun had a scope on it.  And I told him I believe James Earl Ray did it; I believe he had help; and I believe he was caught as a result of it, and I stood by that even though the King family later said that they forgave him and believe that he didn't do it.  I still believe he did, but he clearly had help.  They caught him in London [England] remember?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Somebody--
Speaker 1: --he, he, he wasn't smart enough to figure all that out.  He had to have help.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so again, my, my whole point was I gave that type of commentary and public opinion to that, and the response was overwhelming.
Story_ID: 671241
Speaker 1: Now, Comcast [Comcast Corporation] changed again in 2009, became the Comcast Network, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Well, yeah, then Comcast gobbles up NBC [NBC Universal].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So how does--how has that affected your, your, your--
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--it was a--it was a great move for Comcast, a phenomenal move, because it really positioned them as a industry leader, not just a cable leader.  They had had a failed attempt to try and get ABC, Disney [Disney ABC Television Group] some, some, some years earlier.  The NBC acquisition just made a lot of sense.  The way it impacted us is that NBC knows how to run programming.  They know how to run a news operation and to run progr- .  Comcast had subsidiaries that could do it.  But Comcast was always very clear that at the end of the day, our bread and butter is still cable and Internet service.  We provide cable into your home and Internet service, and we wanna bundle you up, and put you in a package that pays for your phone, and unit, and so forth.  They can't go far from that because that's their bread and butter.  So by bringing on NBC to handle the program- and NBC's the best at it--to handle the programming part of it, was huge for them.  It also meant that a lot of those decisions for programming were now coming out of New York [New York], not Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And it was a whole new team of people and, and, and different people.  And a lot of people had to move, or they were positioned out, or so forth and so on.  But it was a big move for, for, for Comcast and a big change.  It made sense from a business standpoint.
Story_ID: 671242
Speaker 1: So in, in 2014, Comcast [Comcast Corporation] cancels the 'Art Fennell Reports' show.  And so what are the dynamics of that?  What, what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, they restructured the network.  As, as I was saying, all of the programming was now coming out of, of New York [New York], the programming decisions.  Comcast was always using the Comcast Network to do two things.  One was to create a, a vehicle for the types of shows that we were providing.  There were--we were doing six original shows out of our--out of our studio.  There was 'Net Impact,' there was 'Art Fennell Reports,' there was 'It's Your Call with Lynn Doyle', there was 'Voice of Reason,' Larry Kane, and there was 'State of the Union,' and I think one, one or two others.  All those shows were coming out of that--out of the network.  In addition to that, it was used for overflow programming for sports, particularly that Comcast, you know, owns the, the Philadelphia Phillies.  And there would be times when Comcast would be running--say for example, the Stanley Cup playoffs are on the, the Comcast SportsNet, which was their other channel.  And then they would put the, the Phillies or, or the, the 76ers [Philadelphia 76ers] on the Comcast Network.  So it gave them a room for overflow programming.  When Comcast acquired the Phillies, it gave them an opportunity to do more sports programming on that network.  And we knew for quite some time that at some point they would reposition the programming on our network, and that they those shows would all likely be discontinued to make room for more sports programming.  And that's essentially what happened.  It wasn't personal for 'Art Fennell Reports' at all.  In fact, they had been in constant contact b- and communication with me about this, that this was gonna happen eventually.  But it was a--it was strictly a network repurposing, and that--and that's what it was.
Story_ID: 671243
Speaker 1: NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], your, your colleagues were--expressed their disappointment in a letter to Comcast [Comcast Corporation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--but, but when you look forward, do you see another Art Fennell show or something--
Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: --like it somewhere else?
Speaker 2: I don't know as, as I sit here what I will do next or where I'll do it.  I know that journalism is part of me, media is part of me, and I wanna still be involved in it.  I think I still have plenty to offer ideas wise, experience wise, talent wise.  But I don't know exactly, as I--as I'm sitting here.  You know, the, the media industry is cyclical.  It goes around; it comes around.  And you just never know what may be around the next bend.  I'd love to do something on a national level.  I'd love to do something that is perhaps southern based because South is my home and my roots, and I'm never far from that.  But I don't know exactly what the next turn of events will be for me, but I'm looking forward to finding out--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know.  I mean I'm, I'm, I'm a journalist.  I can't stop being what I am and doing what I do.  There's still good programming to be had, there's still good stories to be told.  I'm a storyteller; I love telling stories, so I wanna keep telling stories.
Story_ID: 671244
Speaker 1: Now 2011, just to backtrack a little bit in time, the organization Art Sanctuary [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] hosted 'The People of Maasai Mara,' an exhibits featuring twenty-five photos shot by you during your visits to East Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--and we've seen some of the photos.  They're down here in, in--on the walls, and they are in, in coffee table books.  These are beautiful photographs.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: So you've--did you--there, there, there's an evolution to your photography I guess from the time when you were shooting the coeds.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well, you know I'm--there--there's two parts of that.  I mentioned early on I used to be a videographer.  I was a news photographer.  That helped to develop my eye for shot making.  I could always see the shot, and that's a big part of photography, to see the shot, to get the angle, to, to set up an interview like this one, and to, to see the background, and to see the look you're going for and then to make it happen.  It's the same thing with still photography.  You have to see the shot, then you have to be able to get it, to capture that shot.  Now I've been fortunate, and it's called the eye.  He's got the eye.  And I know people, good photographers that have been mentors of mine who have the eye.  So I've been fortunate that I was always able to get the shot, okay.  And then I know enough about cameras that I can get the shot.  But now the technology's gotten so good where you don't have to know as much as you used to because the technology is so damn good.  And so I, I love it; it's a passion of mine; I love capturing images.  You know, I have a, a, a full--a photographer's motto that I created about photography.  And it is: an image may be fleeting and only there for an instant, but a picture can capture it forever, shoot well.  Okay, so I love shooting wildlife and nature.  I shoot people too.  And I, I--I'm okay shooting people.  I'm--that's not my forte.  I know people who are really excellent portrait photographers.  But I enjoy going out and capturing that sunrise, seeing a bee pollinating a flower, to see a horizon with trees and, and, and a sunscape, you know, over the ocean or wherever it may be. And, and I, I--I'm, I'm moved by that, and, and I like shooting it.  And, and, and I, I--you know, if I could--if I could make a living, I'd do it all the time.
Speaker 1: You got some beautiful prints down here.  And yeah, you, you got a photo of your first customer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --upstairs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But, yeah, you, you got some (unclear).
Speaker 2: The, the shots down here are of my shots on safari.  I've been on a lot of game drives in Africa.  I'm always looking for the next better shot, you know, something that's different, or unusual, or captivating.  And I do freelance writing work occasionally on some of my travels.  But, you know, it, it tells you what kind of nerve and chutzpah you've got when you are ten feet from a full grown male lion who's hunting for his next meal, or you're being stared down by a bull elephant before he charges, which is pretty damn scary, you know.  But to be able to get that shot, you know, when things are happening, you know, it takes some skill, and it takes some nerves, and it takes--you know, you gotta put yourself in position, and then you gotta know how to--how to--how to get that shot.  And I enjoy that.  It's a--it's a--it's a great fun, it's great challenge.
Speaker 1: Did you ever imagine being able to do that as a youth in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Never, never, you know, not even just traveling to the places I've been around the world.  I mentioned African, but from the Great Wall of China, to Africa, to the Leaning Tower [Leaning Tower of Pisa, Pisa, Italy], to the--to the coliseums in Rome [Italy], and to, to see all of these places, and to stand there and to be there.  You know, I keep pinching myself.  Look, I'm, I'm, I'm still the kid from, from the sticks down in Bennettsville [South Carolina].  You know, I didn't get on an airplane until I was in my twenties, you know, and I was terrified, you know, because that just wasn't part of our culture, something that we did.  So I, I--I'm very fortunate, and I never take it for granted, to have seen what I've seen, and to have done what I've done, and to have interviewed the people that I've interviewed, and to, to be able to see these images and then capture it with a camera, well, that's even better.
Story_ID: 671245
Speaker 1: Tell me this, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any- is there anything major that you would do different if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: There were--I don't know.  I made decisions that I'm glad I made, probably a few that I regret, but there, there had been a few times in my career where I was young enough and hot enough--when I say, talking about industry hot--that I had offers from the networks and for one reason or another didn't take 'em.  The, the last one that came, the reason I didn't take it is because I had small children.  My--I have two daughters [Sarah Fennell and Alexis Fennell], and they were at the time very young.  And I said you know, at this point in my life, my place is here with them rather than I'm on the road every week in a different place, and I'm never gonna be home to raise them.  I just believe that's too important not to--not to spend that time with them.  So I don't regret at all.  You know--you know, earlier on in my career, you, you know, I, I, I moved more frequently.  You could make a case that later I hung around much, much longer.  I've been here [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] now for some twenty--I could have left before and perhaps moved on.  I knew people who were tracking, that were just looking for the next thing, but I decided to stay.  I was comfortable here, and I don't necessarily regret that.  Career wise, who knows what could have happened if I'd maybe made another move and moved on to a network somewhere or there and became the national face that I am--more of a national presence.  But I don't regret that, I don't regret my time that I spent in the community and that I've spent with people, and my, my commitment to mentoring.  I don't regret any of that.  I enjoy people; I enjoy being around them.  I always said that I've got a couple of books in me.  I haven't pinned them yet.  Maybe that's a regret, because then I could be Arthur [HistoryMaker Art Fennell], the author, you know.  But that hasn't happened yet.  But other than that, I don't have a whole lot of regrets about my career.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, you mentioned mentoring.  Now, do, do you mo- do most of your mentoring through the NABJ Media In- Institute [NABJ Media Institute]?
Speaker 2: A good, good, good deal of it, but not necessarily.  I mean just people either that I know or that have been referred to me, or know of me that seek me out and ask for my help.  I'd be hard pressed not to give it, particularly if it's advice, or if it's a young journalist that wants to shadow me on an assignment or, or something of that nature.  And I still get a lot of that.  In the local chapter of NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], every year I sponsor several young students so that they can have a membership and get acclimated and get to know more people and more things about their industry, that kind of thing.  I mean I, I still do that, still believe in it, and I enjoy it.
Story_ID: 671246
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  You have two daughters, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  I have two daughters.  They're both in college, Sarah Austyn [Sarah Fennell] and Alexis [Alexis Fennell].  One, the--Sarah Austyn's the oldest.  She's a student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte [Charlotte, North Carolina].  And Alexis is a student at the University of Richmond [Richmond, Virginia]. S- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sarah's named after your mother [Sarah McLeod Fennell]?
Speaker 2: Yes, named after--I named her after my mother, and, and named both of them with the letter A names like their dad, you know.  So they're--all they're initials are A-F, A-F, A-F.  But, you know, I, I always believed, you know, as--particularly for a, a large part of their lives has been a single father, that it was important to be there because children need their parents.  And I am just a firm believer that young girls need a solid role model in their life and a father figure, and, and young boys do too.  I'm not making a distinction of one over the other, but in my case it's girls.  And so I have just--in coming from a big family that I came from, you know, always believed in, in, in being there for them.  That was always nonnegotiable for me.  And I'm, I'm, I'm happy and proud that they're doing well, that they are well adjusted, they're smart, and the future's in front of them.  The future's in front of 'em.  You know, you can't live your life for your kids.  You can only help set them up for it, but it's their job to live it.
Story_ID: 671247
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm still disturbed by our crabs in the barrel mentality that we still possess far too prevalently.  And for folks who don't know what the crabs in the barrel syndrome is, is when you have a barrel of crab, and one is trying to get out, and another is grabbing it to pull it back down because they're hoping that they can get out.  I still see too much jealousy, too much envy, and too much hatred.  Black on black crime is as rampant as it's ever been.  We still kill each other too easily and, and, and care too little about it.  I still wish that our children had more role models, people that they can see and touch and feel, and that can be there for them and to be a beacon for them, that more--that more children had their parents in the home, particularly in the, the urban areas, and not just the urban areas, but particularly in the urban areas where young men never knew a father, young ladies never knew a father or a mother, or, or they had parents who were strung out on drugs or, or whatever the case may be.  Because those images and that life that they know early is gonna stay with them, unless there is some change agent to make a difference and to, to get them out of that.  I wish that, that people didn't struggle as much as they do, and that will never change.  I realize that.  There're still people who are catching hell in America, who are struggling, who are living good lives and doing their best, but still can't make ends meet, still can't find a way or to know how they can get to the end of next week.  You know, these are the things that you think of; these are the things that you, you, you pray for for people.  I'd like to see those who are doing well care more about the ones who aren't and to offer them something, either by way of a helping hand, or a dollar bill, or expertise, or insight, or something.  And oftentimes we don't, because now that we've made it, we're too busy and too important to reach back.  I'd like to see some of that change.  We are a strong and vibrant people.  We are battle tested, and we've endured despite the odds.  But they'll always be room to help the ones who aren't doing as well as the others.  And after all at the end of the day, we're always our brother's keeper.

Speaker 1: Once again, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional legacy?  You know, I've, I've, I've, I've thought on that.  I think, and, and I would hope, that people who know me and people who don't, or people who know me in person and on a personal level, and people who've only known me through media and through TV, or from a public persona, I would hope that I've been able to show them something that they've been able to see that was real, that they have seen me and see me as a man of principles, and ideals, and of integrity, and as a journalist, as a person who helps to shape public opinion, and who writes stories and projects stories on TV, that I'm a person that you've been able to trust, that you can say, "I believe Art [HistoryMaker Art Fennell] when he tells me this story."  'Cause if I can't do that, if I haven't done that at the end of the day, I've failed, because credibility is the real key here.  And if you don't have it, and certainly at this point, you're never going to get it.  So I would hope that they've been able to see that, and they would always be able to say that, (gesture) "Art always kept it real, wasn't fake, wasn't phony.  He told it like it was, and I believed him."

Speaker 1: Is there anything we have not mentioned that we need to talk about before I ask my last question--
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I mean that we can think of.
Speaker 2: I think you've been very, very thorough.  I can't think of anything you've missed.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy--professional legacy--but a little bit different.  It's more personal.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: It's pretty much as you say.  I would hope that people would remember me as a solid journalist, a good brother, a good family man, good Christian, a person who cared about other people, who reached out to help other people, who was at the forefront of news that happened all around us, and who put himself in a position to tell the story.  I would hope people would remember my personality, and what I believed in, and what I didn't, what I tolerated, and what I wouldn't, and at the end of the day, how I lived my life, because your obituary is lived every day.  It's not written on a piece of paper at your death.
Speaker 1: All right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: All right.
