Speaker 1: All right.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is Thomas Jefferson, Kenya Brooks [ph.], and Kaylen Brooks [ph.], and perhaps Jeff Cullers [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] (laughter).

Speaker 2: Marian, M-A-R-I-A-N, B as in boy, Cullers, C-U-L-L-E-R-S [HistoryMaker Marian Cullers].

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I told Jeff to tell you I don't give that out (laughter).  I was born in December, but what year, I don't know.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Well, all right.  Born in December.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, and put a question mark.  And where did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But to be as old as he is, it was some long time ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  About what--where were you born?
Speaker 2: Where I was born?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Urbana, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And, ma'am, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, besides being part owner of the business, my job was--when I first started out with Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] was as a receptionist.  And then I went from that into production and then into personnel.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you retired.
Speaker 2: And financial.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had the financial part of it until it got big.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Cullers Adver- it's officially called Vince Cullers Advertising agency?
Speaker 2: It was called Vince Cullers Advertising when we first started out.  And then our lawyer told us we should incorporate, which we did.  And we incorporated, I guess, about four or five years after we started the business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it became Vince Culler--
Speaker 2: So it became Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc. [Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is May the 28th, 200--I mean 2010, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Two, one, ten [2010], yeah.
Speaker 1: And, where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: You're in my house (laughter).  2020 East 91st [91st Street, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: This is for the benefit of others (laughter), not--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that management compels me to ask of everyone, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: The first question is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, golly.  Let me see.  What would be my favorite food?  I, I can't think of any right now that outnumbers anything else that I like.  I like fish.
Speaker 1: So you say fish?
Speaker 2: Fish, uh-huh.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pink and blue.  Both of them run neck and neck.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I love autumn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which we don't have any more, but I love it.
Speaker 1: You have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I've been to so many places that I really couldn't tell you which one was a favorite.  I, I did go back to Hawaii.  I had been there twice and then I went back again.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the last question is: do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying.  Does it make any difference if it's religious?  Everything is in divine order and God is in charge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Everything is in divine order, and God is in charge.
Story_ID: 625123
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Elliott Barnett] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Her full name is Edna, E-D-N-A, Ruth; you want the maiden name?  Glover, and the married name, of course, was Barnett [Edna Glover Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have to laugh.  And you think I'm pulling your leg, I'm pulling your leg on my birthdate, but I can't remember all those folks' birthdays.  I know my mom lived to be seventy-eight years old.  And she died in 1987, I think.  And my dad--well, you're not on my dad yet, okay.  Okay. Still with my mother, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And where was she born?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: She was born in Monticello, Georgia.  And the family moved to Champaign [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Monticello, Georgia, and the family moved to Champaign.  Okay.  So, well, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace your mother's family in history?
Speaker 2: We were--I just came from my cousin's house yesterday and my cousin was there from Champaign, and we were trying to remember some of the things that we had heard the family talk about.  We made the mistake of not recording my grandmother and my grandfather.  And my grandmother lived to be ninety-five years old.  My grandfather died earlier, but--
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Emma Peacock Glover.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your grandfather?
Speaker 2: And my grandfather was, as far as we know of, Samuel Glover.  I never knew a middle name--oh, I think it was Eugene [ph.], if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that as far back as you can go with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As I said, that we always regretted that we did not, you know.  Well, all we knew was what we heard from the family which is what you're saying to me now, we want you to tell what you know about your family.  And my family, they were part of that group that jumped the IC [Illinois Central Railroad] train and rode as far as they could go and they got off along the way from, let's say, Carbondale [Illinois], Mattoon [Illinois], Champaign; those who had enough money went on out further.  But lots of them stopped in Champaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, that's the Illinois Central runs down through Georgia and into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Illinois Central, the City of New Orleans; it went all through there.  And as I said, Gene [ph.] and I were talking yesterday saying how some of them didn't have money enough to come, and they would go out and jump the freight trains at night and ride on in to wherever they figured they could, you know, make a settlement.
Story_ID: 625124
Speaker 1: Is there any, any stories about your family in Georgia, what they were doing in Georgia, or--?
Speaker 2: Well, my [maternal] grandfather [Samuel Glover] was, I guess, what do you call that, what kind of farmer?  I don't know about farming.
Speaker 1: A, a sharecropper?
Speaker 2: Sharecropper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had a farm or he worked on a farm, you know.  And they had seven children, five survived.  So they didn't own the property.  We were just talking about that yesterday, that probably at one time Gene [ph.] thought that we had some land down there, and when he went down to investigate it, he ran into a stone wall and never got any further than that.  He and his wife drove to Atlanta [Georgia].  And Monticello [Georgia] is, in fact, Kenya's [Kenya Brooks (ph.)] family, I think, is from that part of the country, and they got as much information as they could, which was not a whole lot.  You know, all of a sudden, you know, with us it goes blank, you know.  If you say, "Well, my family owned a farm down here," or "My family did this, that, and the other," you don't get too much cooperation or you didn't then, because this has been about thirty years before they were down there--I mean, when they were down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So your mother [Edna Glover Johnson], she was born in Georgia and--
Speaker 2: The whole family.
Speaker 1: The whole family moved (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of the sisters and brothers were born there and they moved to Champaign [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now, how old was she about when she moved to Champaign?
Speaker 2: They were in school.  They were--because they finished school in Champaign.  And so, I would say--now, whether or not they graduated, that's something--again, we didn't ask questions.  My grandsons are asking questions like mad.  But I don't think we asked as many questions as they are asking me or her family, Jeff's [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] mother-in-law.  But, they were in--they went to grade school in Champaign, and whether they went to high school there or not, I don't know.  But, I wish I could remember that, but I don't remember seeing anything of where they said they went to Champaign High [Champaign High School; Champaign Central High School, Champaign, Illinois] or where, you know.
Speaker 1: So you don't know if your mother went to high school or not?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And she--but she moved to Urbana [Illinois], which is next door to Champaign, right, at some point?
Speaker 2: She--my grandmother [Emma Peacock Glover] and grandfather owned a house down in Cham- in Urbana.  In fact, I was born at home in their house.  And her oldest daughter had the house next door, and her son was born at home.  I don't think they stayed in Urbana that long.  They moved on over into Champaign because of the working, where they had to walk to work or, you know, maybe didn't have the money to--for, you know, public transportation.  There again, I get kind of vague because I never heard them talk too much about stuff like that.  I do know that they went into different areas of trying to earn a living because, you know, Champaign is a university town, and either you worked on campus or you didn't work.  My grandfather worked for the Illinois Central Railroad, though, for years.    And he would  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, what did he do?  What did he--do you know?
Speaker 2: He worked on the tracks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that what they call a brakeman or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's something like that, because they, they would have to go out and check, you know, the equipment and what have you, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's a brakeman. Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For the IC.
Story_ID: 625125
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Edna Glover Johnson] have any stories about growing up that she shared with you about what life was like in, growing up in Urbana [Illinois] and Champaign [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I can't remember Mother talking, you know, too much about that.  She was very devoted and attentive to, you know.  I was telling Kenya [Kenya Brooks (ph.)], you know, that my mother combed my hair fifty times a day.  She never wanted my hair to be out of order, and I had real long hair, had real thick hair.  And I had a brother [Elliott B. Barnett], and she lost that child when he was about a year and a half old.  And so, between the two of us, you know, that was mainly--besides her working.  She didn't talk too much about--
Speaker 1: She didn't talk about growing up or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh.  But the family was a close knit family.  Even until today.  That's where I was yesterday, out in Calumet Park [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a--okay--relatives on your mother's side in Calumet Park?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have cousins out there, and I have cousins here on my dad's side down in Bronzeville [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, she had no stories about when she was a little girl going to school or nothing?
Speaker 2: No.  You know.  I mean, you know, she--I can't remember anything.  I don't know whether Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] would or not.  He was very close to her because she was crazy about her, her grandsons, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's--you would have to ask him.  But I don't remember Mother talking too much about anything about her growing up, you know.
Speaker 1: You said she was very attentive and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was.  She was a good mother.
Speaker 1: What else about her?  What else do you remember about her?  She was a good mother and--
Speaker 2: What else do I remember about my mother except the combing my hair and being very attentive, and I can't think of anything, you know, that would be significant, you know, except that, as I said, that we were a close knit family, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have any problem with my mom or my dad [Elliott Barnett].
Story_ID: 625126
Speaker 1: Let me go to your fa- your father's side. Ca-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Elliott James Barnett [Elliott Barnett], and E-L-L-I-O-T-T.  And--
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I keep telling you (laughter), I don't know. You talking about going back almost a hundred years (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he was--well, was he born in the 1890s or--?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Dad was--in fact, he lived to see his great-grandchild which is Jeff's oldest boy.  And I think he was eighty-five when he died.  And Bryan [Bryan Cullers] was three years old.  We took him out to New York [New York].  So three years from--in 1985 and Dad was eighty-five then, so you would add from eighty-five to--up to now.  Well, not up to now because he's been dead several--quite a few years.
Speaker 1: When, when did he pass?  What year did he pass?
Speaker 2: That's a good question too.  I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do know he was eighty-five years old when he passed.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, were there any stories from his side of the family about the ancestors on that side?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Where was he born?  I didn't ask that.
Speaker 2: He was born in Mattoon, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Born in Mattoon.
Speaker 2: And he went to Mattoon High School [Mattoon, Illinois].  I can tell you that.  And then he married--he and my mother [Edna Glover Johnson] married quite young, and my dad went back to school when he was twenty-three or twenty-four to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And he graduated with a degree in journalism.  And there, again, but during that period of time, blacks did not get a job in journalism.  And he came up here and he went to the Defender [Chicago Defender], he went to all the different newspapers, and you know what happened to the other newspapers, said, "Don't call us, we'll call you."  So then he left here and he went then to New York and he couldn't find anything there.  So he came back, and he ran on the road with a degree and a master's waiting tables.  That's the history of us, you know.  Hello (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have to pause here.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): No.  Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers], I can see you in the background there (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh, okay.  All right.  So he had a master's degree?
Speaker 2: He had a master's degree.  Then he had two master's.  He went back to school when he was in his fifties and got another master's.  And during this time, he was doing some transition.  He went from working on the railroad [Illinois Central Railroad] to Chanute Field [Chanute Air Force Base, Champaign County, Illinois].  And he worked with the Tuskegee Airmen who were stationed, part of them, stationed up there.  And when they transferred to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], he was also transferred, and he taught down there for several years.  And when he left there he taught where I went to school in Jefferson City, Missouri, at Lincoln University.  In fact, my dad was one of the first professors at the journalism school down there.  And he didn't like teaching, and I must have inherited it because I don't like teaching either.  But he left there and that's when he went back and got that second master's.  And they moved to Connecticut.
Speaker 1: Your mother and father moved to Connecticut?
Speaker 2: No.  My dad and my mother separated and divorced when I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I didn't know.
Speaker 2: --I was sixteen or seventeen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he got a degree in social work and got a job in Connecticut, and he lived in Connecticut for several years.  From Connecticut he moved then to New York.  And that's where he stayed until he died.
Speaker 1: Well, he had really a busy life, didn't he?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He did.  And we were--his favorite child was Jeff (laughter).  I think my dad would have died did Jeffery became a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] (unclear).  My father was a Kappa up until the day he died.  And I think for his greatest thing was that he, he was proud.  He came out here to see Jeff when he was down at the University of Illinois.  And, oh, he, he was real proud.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 625127
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit and, is there a story about how your parents met or courted?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  All I know is that, I'll say something that Dad [Elliott Barnett] used to tell me all the time, that even though he and my mom [Edna Glover Johnson], you know, broke up, he and I were always very, very close.  And believe it or not they were too.  And so, he said, I had some relatives who dropped off in Decatur, Illinois.  That was his brother, my dad's brother and his family, and, of course, my dad and mom were in Champaign [Illinois].  And so, my dad said, "We married some of the prettiest girls in central Illinois, and that was your mother," and my uncle's wife.  She was from a well known family down in Decatur.  So, they met in school, you know, high school.  And that's the reason I say I don't know whether she graduated, but I know he did.
Speaker 1: But she, she was in high school, was she?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was in high school, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.  So.  Okay.  So did she attend the Mattoon High School [Mattoon, Illinois], too?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Champaign [Champaign High School; Champaign Central High School, Champaign, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Champaign, okay.
Speaker 2: See, they--they moved from Mattoon [Illinois].
Story_ID: 625128
Speaker 1: You know, Mattoon [Illinois] was famous for having a sign up there about not--you, you not being caught outside after dark.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, there's a book that was published about three years ago called 'Sundown Towns' ['Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism,' James W. Loewen].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: About a guy here in Illinois, a Jewish guy wrote a book about all the towns in Illinois--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --that required black people to be out of town by sundown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that Mattoon was one of them.  They had a sign up down there.  I saw it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and a whistle would blow.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And if you weren't out of town when the whistle blew, you were subject to arrest.
Speaker 1: You were in trouble.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And he thought at first there was about six towns like that, and then discovered there was over sixty of them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well, I know my dad [Elliott Barnett], that family moved from Mattoon into Champaign [Illinois] after my grandfather [James Barnett] died.  I didn't know my grandfather.  He knew me, but, I mean, I was too young when he died.  And when he died, there was no work in Mattoon.  I think he worked for the railroad [Illinois Central Railroad], too.  I'm not sure.  But my dad's mother [Ava Barnett] moved to Champaign and got a job on campus as a cook.  And so she raised her--she had three children and she raised those children in Champaign.  And my--all of them were graduates of the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And they--Uncle Emo [ph.] didn't live in Champaign.  He went on back to Decatur [Illinois].  But my mother [Edna Glover Johnson] stayed there, and my dad until he, you know, made his move to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Story_ID: 625129
Speaker 1: When he moved, did they--do you think they, they broke up because of him going to these other towns to seek work or did they break up and then he moved?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea?
Speaker 2: Now, you know you men.  You can't go away and leave men (laughter).  I really couldn't tell you, but I know that Mom [Edna Glover Johnson], my mama, the family kept telling her, "You ought to move to Jefferson--," I mean Tuskegee [Alabama], "with Elliott [Cullers' father, Elliott Barnett]." And she wouldn't go.  And you keep on doing that, you're in trouble sometimes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's kind of hard to maintain a long distance--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's hard to maintain a relationship.
Speaker 1: And probably especially in those days when travel was--it took so long.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  So, I, I don't know whether that was the cause of it or what.  But, as I said, they remained friends.  They would call each other.  When he would come in town, she'd come out here, right in this very house [in Chicago, Illinois], you know.  And they remained friendly because she said, "That's your father," and he would tell me, "That's your mom."  So we had a good relationship as far as being, you know, close that way.
Speaker 1: So when was it that your parents broke up?  How old were you when they broke up?
Speaker 2: I think I was sixteen or seventeen years--I was in college.  I went off to college at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it surprised me, you know.  Dad had just left there because, as I said, he was working at the school of journalism and, of course, being a kid that wanted to get away--see, I didn't want to go to school in Champaign [Illinois].  The family was there.  So I got accepted at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri] to get away from home--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --like most kids do.
Story_ID: 625130
Speaker 1: I want to ask you this que- question now: when you think about your parents' personalities and their talents and their dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] always told me that I was a good writer.  And my dad was an excellent writer and, in fact, Vince wanted him when he opened up that office on North Michigan [Avenue].  He wanted my father to come here and work for him [at the Vince Cullers Advertising Agency, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois], and Dad wouldn't do it because he would read my father's writings, and he said, "Elliott [Elliott Barnett], you know, you got a talent, you know, for writing."  So I think I inherited part of that.  I'll have people now, even down to thank you notes and what have you say, "Well, you write a heck of a note."  So I think that I took that after him.  I think I took the family relationship and the love that both my mom [Edna Glover Johnson] and dad gave me from both of them, because I didn't--they never talked against each other.  I never heard one say a word against the other one.  And, you know, sometimes that's not an easy thing to do.
Speaker 1: That is remarkable.
Story_ID: 625131
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I had a brother and he died.  And I, I don't even remember him because I was about two or three years old when he died.  And the cousin I saw yesterday, all three of us were raised, as long as my brother was alive, in Champaign [Illinois].  And Bertell [Elliott B. Barnett], that was his name--Bertell was my brother and, as I said, I don't, you know, he--I don't remember that much about him, I was too young.  I have pictures of him, you know, but I don't remember anything or, you know, that much about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, so is--you were basically raised with both your parents [Edna Glover Johnson and Elliott Barnett] in the house, right?
Speaker 2: Well, and now we go back to another funny story about how black families unite and help each other.  The whole family united and helped my dad through school [at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  He worked at the country club in Champaign, but he also had whatever financial help the family could give him, which wasn't much.  But I know his sister was a school teacher in Carbondale [Illinois] and she would send him money.  And I think that, in my case when I got ready to go away to school [at Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri], my whole family sent a truck of clothes, and I got money from all of them the whole time--the first two years I was away at school, I got money from all of them.
Story_ID: 625132
Speaker 1: So your father [Elliott Barnett] spent a lot of time in school.  What did your mother [Edna Glover Johnson] do for a living, I mean, while he was--?
Speaker 2: I think Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] put her down, you know, as she did catering.  She would earn, and she helped my dad.  Now, that's something I really want to a give a black woman some credit, because the whole time he was in school [at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], she was supporting him too with whatever money she could make.  She not only held a regular job, but she also did baking, you know, and selling the bakery goods.  And he wanted her at his graduation because he knew she had helped him, you know.  So, other than that, as I said, and then later on she remarried and came up here, and she helped me raise Jeff.
Story_ID: 625133
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Like what?
Speaker 1: The first thing you ever remember as a--is there any such thing as that?  If not, well, I'll just ask you for some early ones.
Speaker 2: I remember trying to tap dance (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No (laughter).  They sent me to--they said I was a very shy person when I was a young kid.  And when my dad [Elliott Barnett] went back to school [at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], his sister and her husband took me to their house, and I lived there in the winter and went to school, and I think Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] put down Webster Groves, Missouri.  And my uncle was the first black principal in Webster Groves, and so I was raised with an English teacher and a principal.
Speaker 1: Now, now, about how old were you when this happened?
Speaker 2: When I went to Webster Groves?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Four.  Four years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Webster Groves.
Speaker 2: I can remember that.
Speaker 1: Webster Groves, Missouri.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is that very far from Champaign [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: That's about a good two, three hour trip to Champaign.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: A good five hour trip, although Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] made it in two and a half (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you driving a sports car?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  Exactly.
Speaker 1: I remember that.  Yeah.  Okay. Webster Groves, Missouri, you know.  Okay.  So, you were about four years old?
Speaker 2: I was four years old when they took me.  And when I was going back to where they said I was a very shy person, why, I had to--why, they gave me dancing; they gave me dancing, they gave me speech.  My uncle would drive me into St. Louis [Missouri] to a place down there that handled, you know, children with what I had, and that was, I didn't have anything that bad, but just to bring me out of myself.  And it really was a big help.  And until I die, I will appreciate it.
Speaker 1: Was it like a charm school or something or a (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.  It wasn't a charm school.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was trying to think of what they--I had speech, I had dancing; just all the things I guess you would try to give a child to make them well rounded.  And they were able to afford to pay for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So.  Well, so how long were you there with them?
Speaker 2: In Webster?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, I graduated at sixteen [from Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri], and I left Webster and went into Jefferson City, Missouri, to Lincoln University.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were there twelve years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So you were basically raised in Webster.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was raised there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in Champaign in the summer and for all holidays.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They shared me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: My aunt couldn't have children, and so, they shared me.
Speaker 1: So basically you were raised by your aunt then, right or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I can't give her all the credit, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah.
Speaker 1: But you saw your mother [Edna Glover Johnson] in the summer.
Speaker 2: I think they both cooperated together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My, my aunt and my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 625134
Speaker 1: Well can you describe for us, you know, the house you lived in growing up.
Speaker 2: In Webster [Webster Groves, Missouri]?
Speaker 1: In Webster, yes, and--well, you can describe the one also in Champaign [Illinois], but I want you to describe it in terms of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, okay?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where do you want me to start, Webster or Champaign?
Speaker 1: Well, you started in Champaign, so let's start you there and then--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  In Champaign, by the time that I was up, you know, before I went in to live in Webster, my mom [Edna Glover Johnson] and dad [Elliott Barnett] lived--at one time, I guess, to give you a little part of this story was that when Vince [Vince Cullers] and I got married and I had a reception down there and one up here [Chicago, Illinois], and so, Vince said to me, "You're related to everybody in this town."  And it was almost that way because my grandmother [Ava Barnett] came from a family of twelve on my dad's side.  Then my mother had all these people on her side that lived down there.  The house that I lived in with Mom and Dad the first time, we lived with a great aunt of his.  And, Aunt Cora [ph.] and Uncle Fat [ph.], and they were very nice to me, you know.  I enjoyed being around them.  I can't remember all of her brothers and sisters.  She had two brothers--my grandmother.  This is my dad's mother.  Twelve, all twelve of those children lived in Champaign.  And so, I got a chance to go around to all of them.  I was never lonely.  And they all had children, too.  So that was Champaign.  Then later on, my mother moved next door to my aunt down near the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  And when I transferred into Illinois, I could walk to school from her house out to the campus.  They had--my uncle was a contractor.  He had to come up here to get his license to be a plastering contractor, because Champaign wouldn't issue them.  And he ran a business down there for about twenty years.  In fact, lots of the buildings at Chanute Field [Chanute Air Force Base, Champaign County, Illinois] were part of his work.  Did I finish with Webster (laughter)?
Story_ID: 625135
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I was asking you about the sights and sounds.  Sights and sounds--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and smells--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --of growing up in Champaign [Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What kind of smells?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  What do you remember smelling in--
Speaker 2: Not the Boneyard [Boneyard Creek] for God's sake (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that--did you--
Speaker 2: Because the Boneyard ran through Champaign.
Speaker 1: What did that do?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything about the Boneyard.  I just remember seeing the Boneyard.
Speaker 1: Now what's the Boneyard?
Speaker 2: Well, the Boneyard carried trash, the waste out of Champaign.  And my family didn't live near the Boneyard, you know, so I didn't have to, you know, contend with that.  But we had family gatherings and all that kind of stuff, you know, that most people have.  We had a bunch of good cooks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I could remember that.  I don't know what else I could tell you.
Speaker 1: I'm asking, like, what was your household situation?  Now if I visited you, go up to your house, what would I see?  What kind of house would I see?  Who would be living there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, with the, with my--you're asking me to describe a whole lots of people.  My mother's sister that she lived next to had a two story house.  They bought their own home, and a very nice house, on White Street.  It's still standing down there.  It hasn't been sold.  So lots of the people in Champaign kept students.  That's the way the blacks made money by, because they couldn't stay on campus--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they had to stay in the homes of the people in the town.  And lots of the people that I know from up here, some of them stayed with my family (background noise). Uh-oh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We got to let that stop.  Okay.  So, you can go ahead.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You can go ahead.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: They stayed with my family.  As I said, that was the way lots of them made their ends meet.  But not only that, the students were close to the campus.  And when you stop and think about the main street that runs through the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], which is not the same now, because the University of Illinois has expanded so.  When I go down there, I hardly know where I am.  But, Green Street was a dividing street down there.  And most of my family lived near Green Street.  So they always were able to get students, because the students could walk to the campus.  They didn't have to ride a bus or a car or a bicycle, although bicycles are quite popular down there.
Story_ID: 625136
Speaker 1: Well, de- describe where you stayed in, in Missouri, in Webster Grove [sic.].
Speaker 2: Webster Groves, Missouri.  I was supposed to be going to my homecoming, but I don't think I'll make it.  But that's going to be the first of Jan- the first part of June.  Webster was--is hilly.  We--I went to an all-black high school; grade school, all-black grade school [Frederick Douglass School; Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri]; and I lived--you say describe the house?  I lived on the top of the hill.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my uncle, as I said, was able to provide us with a nice home because he was the principal of the school.  And my [paternal] aunt, as I said, was teaching.  And I have lots of happy memories from both places as far as that's concerned.  And I know as a kid we used to love the hills out there.  We'd get on slays--sleds, rather, and go down the hill.  Get on bicycles and go down the hill or come up the hill, whichever way you want to put it.  We would have to walk up to the town, which was a good distance from where I lived.  And where they're having the reunion this year is way out in the suburbs somewhere.  I don't know why they're going out there, but anyway, they're going out there for their high school reunion.  There's no more black high school.  They--in nineteen fifty--what, '7 [1957]--what was that?  Fifty-seven [1957] or '50 [1950] when the integration came in?
Speaker 1: Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-four [1954].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, my school kept on going until '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they made it into an apartment building.  It's called Douglass Manor [Douglass Manor Apartments, Webster Groves, Missouri].  The school was Douglass School.  And so, there's no more of that in Webster.  In fact, when I went to the homecoming two years ago, I was shocked because what we used to call--my high school was the first high school, black high school, to win a state championship in football.  And we had--we didn't have a football stadium.  We had what they called the bottoms.  And the bottoms was where you went to the football games.  And when they took me there about two years ago, Larry [Larry Crowe], you wouldn't believe it.  Them folks--those folks have homes down there that are mansions in the bottoms.  That's how much it's changed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's beautiful.  I was happy to see it.
Speaker 1: Now, now, Douglass High School, was that named for Frederick Douglass?
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass, uh-huh.  Yeah.  I have a platter over there on it (unclear).
Speaker 1: All right.  We've got to change the spelling of it on our research, because they had it down as with one S.  So I thought it maybe was Stephen Douglas [Stephen A. Douglas] (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Frederick Douglass.  Frederick Douglass (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Frederick Douglass has got two S's in his name, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: We've got to change the spelling.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So Douglass.  Frederick Douglass High School [Webster Groves, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Frederick Douglass High School.
Speaker 1: Right, all right.
Speaker 2: And this picture you see on the television all the time is the same one that was in the principal's office (laughter).
Story_ID: 625137
Speaker 1: Where did you go to grade school?  What was your grade school called?
Speaker 2: Douglass [Frederick Douglass School; Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Douglass too. Same, same school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  We were combined.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had--the high school and the grade school were combined.  And, as I said, until 1956 or '57 [1957], and when the Brown versus Brown [sic. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], we did not dissolve then, you know.  It was a couple of years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was long gone from there then.
Speaker 1: So were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: I was on the honor roll.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I knew it was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you--
Speaker 2: I was queen of the high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri] (laughter).
Speaker 1: And the queen as well.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Oh, boy.  So that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite teachers that you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I loved my history teacher.  I like history, and I think my grandson has inherited that part of that from me.  But, yeah, I loved history.
Speaker 1: Who was your history teacher?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Mr. Bolden [ph.].
Speaker 1: Mr. Bolden.  Okay.  Did they teach any black history in those days?
Speaker 2: That's where I got my black history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised at so many key people that started--
Speaker 2: I know, and it really surprised me because all I heard--all I heard was black history, you know, from the high school teachers that I had.  And they really stressed that.  And they stressed the pride and everything else along with it, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, okay.
Speaker 2: When I went to the high school reunion about ten years ago, there were about four of my teachers there.  And you know as old as I am, they had to be pretty old.  But they were there.
Speaker 1: Now you were in high school in the '40s [1940s], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I don't know if you want to give us the year you graduated, but, you know--
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: But, you know, we can assume that it was a (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can.  You can do that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  All right.  This is for history.  That's the only reason why we ask.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  I know, I know.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it this way; Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] and I came almost out at the same time.  He was up here.  I didn't know him then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So were you the valedictorian of the class or were you the--?
Speaker 2: I think I was.  I think I had to make a speech at my graduation, which, there again goes back to the help my [paternal] aunt and uncle gave me.  I never had any trouble making speeches.  I still get nervous now when I have to make a speech, but I'll get up there and make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in high school, I guess, during the war; is that true?  World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had--was I in high school or I'd just started high school?  But, well, that's how--Vince was overseas with my cousin.  That's how I met Vince, uh-huh.  So yeah.  It was during that period.
Story_ID: 625138
Speaker 1: You were a good student, valedictorian, you're the queen [at Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri]; how, how--what did you see yourself doing for a living at that point?
Speaker 2: Did you go to college?  When you started out, did you start with one thing and then ended up with two or three other things?  Okay.  That's me (laughter).  I started out saying I wanted to be a librarian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I changed that in less than six months.  And then I went into sociology.  I wanted to be a social worker.  I wanted to be everything but--I don't know why I had this thing against teaching.  I guess my family is still full of teachers.  And I just didn't want it.  But, you know, Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] used to tell me, again, all the time: "Well, you're teaching people down here at the office, you know.  That's the same thing."  But, maybe it was the being restricted, you know, with the having to do some of the things that teachers have to do that I didn't want to be bothered with.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I think pretty much black women in those days, they get to only be a teacher almost as a profession.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, Larry [Larry Crowe], the--when I first started, you know, about the second year in school [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] when they start telling you to begin to think about what you want to be, and I always remember them saying, "You could be a teacher, a doctor or a preacher."  And my thing was I didn't want to be a teacher, and I sure wasn't gonna to be no preacher.  And I, you know, went on and took the courses that I had to take in sociology.
Story_ID: 625139
Speaker 1: Speaking of being a preacher, was church important when you were growing up--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--it wasn't forced on me though. The--in Champaign [Illinois], I attended the Bethel A.M.E. Church, which is still down there.  And in Webster Groves [Missouri], I attended the Methodist Episcopalian church, which my uncle attended.  And my [paternal] aunt attended--they were married and all that stuff, but she went to the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and he went to the Episcopalian.  So I went between them.  And, but in Champaign it was the A.M.E. church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when I moved up here [Chicago, Illinois], there was a period, and I can always understand college students.  When I first went off to school [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri], I said, "I'm never going to go to a church again," you know, because I had--I wasn't forced to go to church, but it was just the idea of getting up every Sunday morning going to church.  And so, for about a year or two there I didn't mess around with a church too much.  But then I began to go out on campus and I started attending--God, I can't think of the name of that church.  It wasn't Methodist and it wasn't Baptist.  Unitarian.  Unitarian.
Speaker 1: Oh, Unitarian church.
Speaker 2: I attended a Unitarian church out there.  Then when I got in Champaign, I went to Bethel and, of course, that's where the family went to church.  Yeah, church was important and still is, as far as I'm concerned, you know, because when I had that hiatus, I did finally go back to church and even got Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] to go.  He wouldn't go all the time, but he went sometimes.  And he and I both became very active after we got married at the Park Manor Congregational Church [Congregational Church of Park Manor, Chicago, Illinois].  And then when we left there and we moved into Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], we became Presbyterians.  And both he and I became elders.  And he became a deacon first and then an elder.  Then I became an elder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I got a whole lots of church history.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: You don't want me to start talking about that (laughter).
Story_ID: 625140
Speaker 1: You went to Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And ma- majored in sociology.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now who, who was at Lincoln--who was the president of Lincoln when you got there?
Speaker 2: Scruggs [Sherman D. Scruggs].
Speaker 1: Scruggs.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I knew his daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now, I've heard that a lot of the people that became head of African countries were at Lincoln University at one time or another.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.  Do you mean in Jefferson City or Pennsylvania [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Jefferson City, Missouri?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Well, some were too as well as some in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But who was in school, I mean, of all of--I mean were any notable students in school with you when you were there?
Speaker 2: Any normal?
Speaker 1: No, notable (laughter).
Speaker 2: I didn't--
Speaker 1: Notable.
Speaker 2: Oh, notable.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Sorry.  People that we would know, whose names we might know today, or who were the people that impressed you there, you know?
Speaker 2: There was--after I got out of Lincoln, the Mercedes (Unclear), I guess her mother was doctor up here, and she went to school there.
Speaker 1: But when you were there, who was on campus?
Speaker 2: She was there.  She was ahead of me.  She was three years ahead of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was trying to think of who else was there.  When you go start going back this far, it's hard for me to remember, but any way.
Speaker 1: But who were your friends at Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Well, I had several who went to high school with me [at Frederick Douglass High School, Webster Groves, Missouri] that went to Lincoln.  And, of course, you always make new friends, you know, when you, you know, get away.  And so, I had made new friends.  At the time that I went there, it was all black, but I understand now it's integrated.  You know, Lincoln is not just an all-black college [HBCU] anymore.  And I had--oh, just recently a couple of them died who lived up here who went to Lincoln when I went there.  And I kept in touch with them while, you know, from--while, you know, living here.  But I don't know.  You know, I'm not too much of a--what should I say--a, a visiting person or anything like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A social, a social person or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 625141
Speaker 1: What did you like to do at Lincoln?  Did you, did you enjoy being on the campus away from living at home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  It was great.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it was great. And--
Speaker 1: Did you join a sorority or anything?
Speaker 2: I pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  The whole family's AKA and Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  And so, yeah.  I was into that.  And then I did lots of reading, and still when I find the time, I still like to do it.  I don't have the time all the time.  But I belonged to book clubs, you know, and what have you.  Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] and I, mainly most of our activities were associated with the business [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois], you know.  So that I didn't have too much time for anything else.  We were trying to keep that business going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I'm still at college.  I still got you in college (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're kidding.
Speaker 1: At Lincoln, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: You're right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So, all right.
Speaker 2: Well, good.
Speaker 1: So, at Lincoln, now, did you--were you an honor student at Lincoln too?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't make that (laughter).  No. Unh-uh.  I didn't make the honor--not honor roll, but the honor student at Lincoln University [Jefferson City, Missouri].  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I knew lots of the teachers there who had come from some of the schools in St. Louis [Missouri] that my [paternal] uncle knew and I knew from him.  And, oh, golly.  I was trying to think of what else I did, you know.  It's funny how you forget all that stuff.
Speaker 1: Did you do any writing at Lincoln for the school paper or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  Unh-uh.  I had to write to keep those grades going.  No, I didn't do any writing, not for them.  And, as I said, I don't remember being active in anything except the book clubs and the sororities and what--you know, things like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What kind of books did you like to read?
Speaker 2: You see them all around here.  Yeah, you know, we have a whole library downstairs of black history.
Speaker 1: And, but what were you reading in Lincoln when you were a student?  What kind of books were you reading then?
Speaker 2: School books (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I didn't have too much time to read anything else.  I was trying to make it.
Speaker 1: Did--were there any speakers that came to campus to talk to the students that you remember hearing, or?
Speaker 2: I can't remember anybody, and I know that they were there because Lincoln was a well known school.  But I just can't remember their names right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you kind of activity there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  We had that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the guest speakers and what have you.
Story_ID: 625142
Speaker 1: Well, how were the relationships between the students and the townspeople and Lincoln [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri]?  Now, was there--it, was that in, located in a mostly white town or was it--
Speaker 2: Mostly white.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know the prison is up there, the state prison.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Missouri State prison [Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri] is up there.  Our favorite thing on Sundays was going up to the state prison and sitting up on the wall watching the Missouri River.  And there were a whole lots of places that we couldn't go.  So we had to make up our own, you know, form of entertainment or whatever you want to call it.  But there was a big wall, I never will forget that, built around the prison.  And the Missouri River ran right alongside of the prison.  And, as you know, Missouri is good for tornadoes and all that kind of stuff, and I remember seeing houses float down the river whenever there was a big storm up that way.  But, the university, that's one time it was good to be segregated.  It sat up on a hill.  So we didn't have to worry.
Speaker 1: But the people down below did (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  Exactly (laughter).
Story_ID: 625143
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite professor there or, or, or, or professors?
Speaker 2: I had a favorite English teacher, and I can't think of his name.  And do you know that man moved up here when Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] and I moved over at 8213 South Indiana [Indiana Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and I can't think of his name.  He moved up here and lived on the next street over from me, and I was so surprised one day when I was out walking to run into him.  But he was one of my English teachers at Lincoln [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri].  Mr. Collins [ph.] was another one.  I had a geography teacher.  I had geography in college.  I liked her.  She was an older woman, but very compassionate, you know, and very nice.  And I was trying to think of who else I remember there.  Mr. Taylor [ph.], I didn't have him.  He, he was from Webster Groves [Missouri], but I didn't have him in any classes.  I can't remember any others.
Story_ID: 625144
Speaker 1: When you were getting ready to graduate, had you--did you have a job lined up or did you have any ideas?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I, I lined up Vince [Vince Cullers].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you and Vince meet?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My--he was in the [U.S. military] service with my cousin.  And I had sent my cousin a picture of me, and Vince said--only he could tell this story.  When he said when Gene [ph.] showed him the picture, he said, "I got to meet her."  And when he came home on leave, I didn't know him.  And my grandmother [Ava Barnett] who lived with my [paternal] aunt in Webster [Webster Groves, Missouri], she said, "Some man keeps calling you up."  You know how older people are.  They'd get into a discussion like that, and she said, "I keep telling him that you are away at school [at Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] and you're not going to be in until such and such a time," you know, what have you.  But he was persistent.  He kept calling until--.  I mean, he'd called back when she told him to, which was several--because I would go home lots.  Missouri Pacific [Missouri Pacific Railroad] ran from Jefferson City [Missouri] into St. Louis [Missouri], and that's what I would catch going home to spend time.  And I went home quite often, because it wasn't but about an hour and something's ride from Jefferson City.  And so, I looked up one day and there stood a man in a raincoat and that was Vince.  He tracked me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what did you say to him and what did he say to you?
Speaker 2: I don't know (laughter).  I guess hello.  But it wasn't a--I was still in school, so, you know, he didn't stay down there that long.  And then there was a hiatus in there, and then I transferred into Champaign, and--
Speaker 1: To the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I looked up and one day when I came home, my mother [Edna Glover Johnson] said, "There's a man who's been calling you and he wants to come by here."  And I said, "What kind of man," you know, "Who?"  You know, "What?"  Because I was dating then.  And so, she knew his name and she called it.  So he did call me, and he came by, you know, to see me.  And he was just down there for a day in Champaign [Illinois].  And after that, you know, he kept in touch until we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, you kept in touch until you (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't happen that fast (laughter).  Don't get me wrong. But that's the way--you said, "How did you meet?"
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And that's how we met.  And, of course, over a period of time, you know, we became fond of each other and then married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what day did you--when did you all get married?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: We got married in March the 1st in '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six [1946].
Story_ID: 625145
Speaker 1: Now, what did you like about Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers]?
Speaker 2: Like about Vince?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: He was fun.  And I enjoyed talking with him.  I never dated anybody that I couldn't have a--I guess that came from being around all those school teachers and what have you, that I couldn't have a conversation with.  In other words, to me, a person or a relationship should have something else to it beside--I know, you like the person because they're nice looking or sex or whatever or what have you.  But you also, as far as I was concerned, had to have something to talk to me about.  I just didn't want to sit up there and be a nut or you be a nut.  And we hit it off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, as time went on, he was telling me, at the time, he was trying to get situated in the art world.  And, again, it became one of those things like my father [Elliott Barnett], you know.  "Don't call me, we'll call you."  And he finally got a job working at Kling Studios [Kling Studios, Inc.] which, at the time, was one of the biggest studios, art studios here in Chicago [Illinois].  And--
Speaker 1: Did you think that being an artist was not going to be--he wasn't going to make enough money being an artist to--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --support?
Speaker 2: You don't think about that when you're that young, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.  I didn't rather.  But he was determined.  I guess that it was something about him.  I liked his determination, and I guess that's one reason why we stayed together for so long, because him, when he went after something, he went after it.
Story_ID: 625146
Speaker 1: So Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] is--he found a job with, with one of the art (unclear)--
Speaker 2: With the art--at that time--it still is hard.  It's hard for the--for us to break into the advertising business.  And--
Speaker 1: So, did he get out with a--did he have a degree in advertising?
Speaker 2: He--yeah, from the--Vince went to the art institute, and then he went to the--oh, god--an art school downtown.  I can't think of the name of the school.  It's not a large school.  But that's where he went to school after he left the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And--
Speaker 1: And so he's working at (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You have to do an apprenticeship.  It's like a doctor.  You have to do an apprenticeship in that business in order to get into any of the agencies--you used to.  I don't know what it's like now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, Vince grew up here in Chicago [Illinois] and went to--
Speaker 2: He was born in here.
Speaker 1: --went to DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the University of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he started working at Kling Studios [Kling Studios, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: K-L-I-N-G.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is one of the sixth largest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what got him interested in advertising, because he used to do fine art.  In fact, I have some of his work downstairs.
Speaker 1: There's a picture of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] he painted that hung (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's over here.  He did that after he was--after he was in the business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was at Kling.  How long was he at Kling and how were things going there at Kling?
Speaker 2: I don't think he stayed there any longer than he had to, you know, because he was trying to break into the field of advertising.
Story_ID: 625147
Speaker 1: By that do you mean was he trying to get a job with Foote, Cone and Belding or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Burnett, Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Burnett.  He had a friend at Burnett who was--thought he could get Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] on there, and--but he couldn't.  They just--the doors just weren't open to us in advertising then.  And that's what prompted him to say, "Okay, you know, then I'm going to see, you know, if, if--."  Well, let's back up.  He worked for Ebony for about two or three years, and he had--Temple, I think, was still at Ebony.
Speaker 1: Herb Temple [Herbert Temple].
Speaker 2: Herb Temple.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was the art director there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And Vince was an art director there.  And when we had our fortieth anniversary, it was a big funny deal.  Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] can tell you about that.  But it was a choice between John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] and [HistoryMaker] George Johnson.  And Vince chose George Johnson because that was the first large account that we got.  The first million dollar account we got was from Afro Sheen, you know. Wantu Wazuri and all that kind of stuff.  And so, he stayed at Ebony even after he opened up his office at 520 [520 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], because he had to have money.
Speaker 1: Okay, why--
Speaker 2: And we didn't have enough money.
Story_ID: 625148
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the beginning, the early days.  Now, did, did, did Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] know or did you know Mr. LeRoy Winbush [HistoryMaker LeRoy Winbush]?
Speaker 2: Very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Very, but LeRoy was a friend of Vince's.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because he was sort of a pre-ad agency, wasn't he sort of?
Speaker 2: No.  He, he--you know, that's a difference that we find.  One of the things that we had said that when we retired, we were going to conduct workshops in the black community.  We were amazed at blacks who didn't know what advertising was.  And still don't, you know.  So, Winbush was in to doing backgrounds, you know--what am I trying to say?
Speaker 1: He was a sign painter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A scenic painter (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was not in advertising.  There's a difference between advertising and that.  And he wasn't in advertising--
Speaker 1: What's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But he and Vince were good friends.
Speaker 1: But what's the difference in--he, he used to do signs and ads for people.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And sometimes, you know, sometimes print ads, and the posters for the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Lots of the displays for Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: But so, what's the difference between what Mr. Winbush was doing and what Vince was doing?
Speaker 2: You make more money if you get in there good.  Number one, our business [at Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] was based on commissions and retainers.  And LeRoy's business was based on what he did for somebody then, and he got paid for it.  Vince was after contracts.  And by the time we moved to 520 North Michigan [Avenue] and been in there for a while, I think Time magazine and Newsweek did a story on Vince.  We were the first black agency to go over $3 million, because we had the contracts, and they just kept coming in at that particular time.  And we finally worked it up to something like about $5 million-
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --before we went down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let me see if I got this right.  LeRoy Winbush would do a job for somebody and get paid.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where Vince would do a--
Speaker 2: Campaign (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) contract for a--
Speaker 2: Campaign.  You had to have a campaign.
Speaker 1: An ad campaign.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You did a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You had to design that campaign, you know.  You didn't--just didn't come in and say, "Draw a picture."  You had to present to your client what are you going to do for the next ten or twelve months.  So he had to lay out--and Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] has some of the storyboards upstairs--he had to lay out what he was going to do, and then sell it.  And this is where Jeff came in handy after he came out of school.  Jeff was a heck of a salesman.  And Vince was a heck of a salesman.  But the difference between LeRoy, please.  And I love LeRoy, but he was not in advertising.  He was into display work, you know.  And that is a whole lot different than advertising.
Speaker 1: So he's someone that you might use as an artist to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's an artist.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --facilitate advertising, but he wasn't into--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Unh-uh.  Advertising, for instance, I never knew how many different fields there were in advertising until I got hooked up with Vince.  You got copyrighters, you got marketing research people, you got artists, you know.  That's a--it's a whole line of work in there.  And he had gotten so, like, when we would go--he and I had been invited to speak to Northern Illinois [Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois], you know; Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], he spoke at Northwestern.  He spoke down at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I did too.  And we would tell them, you know, here, you got many fields you can go into in advertising; you know, areas, not fields--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but areas in advertising.  As I said, most people, most of our people think that it's just a matter of drawing a picture (gesture) and that's advertising.
Story_ID: 625149
Speaker 1: I want to go back.  I want to take whoever is watching this tape to know how you got started, and to--I want them to understand how you got your first--how, how Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers], you and Vince, worked on his first--how he got his first contract [at Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] and what that was, and what you had to do (unclear).
Speaker 2: Afro Sheen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was your first advertisement?
Speaker 2: That was the first major advertising account.  We had small--
Speaker 1: This is a black, black business?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had small accounts.
Speaker 1: And what year is this when Afro Sheen came in?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty--what, '58 [1958] or '59 [1959], somewhere through there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is [HistoryMaker] George Johnson.
Speaker 2: George Johnson.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: And George was coming in to it and he gave us business.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Scott [ph.] has--and three Johnsons what I understand (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: George, the ad for the Afro Sheen.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] the publishing agency [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Cadillac [Al Johnson Cadillac].
Speaker 2: Al.
Speaker 1: Al Johnson [HistoryMaker Albert W. Johnson].
Speaker 2: Al Johnson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: We had that for a while.
Speaker 1: You had the Cadillac dealership.
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, so, okay.  So those are the three Johnsons here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so how did--so George Johnson got--already got a black business.  So was it hard to get him as a client or was it--?
Speaker 2: Nah.  I don't think--.  You know, Vince--when Vince went after you, he, you know, he had a strategy.  And somehow or another it worked.
Speaker 1: Did George already have an ad agency working with him at the time?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether George had an ad agency when Vince first approached him, but whatever Vince said or did, and what he--when he took his work in there, we got the account.
Story_ID: 625150
Speaker 1: Well, let's put it this way then. Were ther- were there any other black ad agencies in Chicago [Illinois] before Vince [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group]?
Speaker 2: Are you kidding?
Speaker 1: No.  I'm asking because--I, I, I'm asking this in an innocent way because this video is going to be viewed by people that don't know anything about Vince [Culler's husband, Vince Cullers].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, that's why I'm saying, I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Well, you may edit some of what I'm going to say.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay?  Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] claims to be the first advertising agency [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group] in Chicago or in the world.  Burrell wasn't even around when we started.  We opened the doors for Burrell and Barbara Proctor [Proctor and Gardner Advertising, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  They opened up in 1971 and 1973.  And we opened up in 1956.  Figure that out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she and he both went on to get other accounts.  I'm not taking that away from them, because one of the things that Vince said when--you remember Jorie Lueloff of Channel Five [WMAQ-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Jorie Lueloff, yeah.
Speaker 2: She came in and interviewed Vince and I in the office down at 520 North Michigan [Avenue].  And she asked Vince a pointed question, which in a way if he had answered in a certain way, it would have seemed as though he was trying to stab them in the back.  But his answer to her was, "There's enough business out here for all of us, and I don't need to talk down on Burrell nor Barbara [Barbara Gardner Proctor].  If we got the business of the black market or the money that blacks spent in the black market, it's enough for all of us and even more."  So no.  Burrell and Barbara were nowhere near us when we first started out.  They passed us up.  And I will admit to that.  But we had a good business for a long time.
Speaker 1: I think there was an organization in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I think it was the first one in the country they say, but.
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: I know that somebody named Fox [ph.] wrote a book, and I forget who called our attention to it, but in there he mentions Vince.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Here's a note here.  It says somebody named Jesse J. Lewis and Associates [Jesse J. Lewis and Associates, Inc.] in Birmingham [Alabama] claim to be the first in 1952, but I don't know who they were, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I think that in writing about us and in writing about them, you got to stop and think how many national accounts did they have?  I think we were among the first to get, you know, some of the national accounts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which opened the door.  Again, I go back.  It opened the door for some of the others to do it.  And, as I said, Vince said, you know, "There's enough out here for all of us."
Story_ID: 625151
Speaker 1: My notes says that your first office was at 432 South Dearborn [Street].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that true?
Speaker 2: The old Manhattan Building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The Manhattan Building.  Okay.  It's in the South Loop [Chicago, Illinois], and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Now, that's when we had what we call local accounts.  We had Service Federal [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois].  Vince had 'Songs from Service Federal,' which was on WMAQ [WMAQ Radio, Chicago, Illinois], one of the first black gospel on a major station playing gospel music.
Speaker 1: Now, this is before [HistoryMaker] George Johnson, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That's before George.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm trying to get to the first, the earliest ones.  So the earliest ones were the local ones (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's what I thought, right.
Speaker 2: The earliest ones were local.
Speaker 1: Service Federal, and then he had a gospel show called 'Songs from'--
Speaker 2: 'Songs from Service Federal.'
Speaker 1: --'from Service Federal.'
Speaker 2: And one of them, I don't know.  You all are kind of young, but Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir] was one that he featured all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So these are black--once again, these are black radio stations then.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: What kind of advertising format--or was these jingles, I mean, radio ads commercials?
Speaker 2: Commercials.
Speaker 1: Commercials (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You got to have a good copywriter.  You know that, you know.  Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] couldn't do everything so he had to hire copywriters.  And when the copywriter would bring the copy back in, well, he had to take it to the clients and get an okay on that before we could even produce it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I see that two things are going on here I hear.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You got ads for Service Federal.  You've also got a show, a whole show sponsored by Service Federal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you all produce the show too?
Speaker 2: Yep. Ken Vallis [ph.].  I don't know whether you knew him, but he was our emcee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so this show appeared on what?
Speaker 2: WMAQ.
Speaker 1: WMAQ.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Now, this proceeded (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All these--all that other stuff that we've been talking about.
Speaker 1: And also, this show was on as a black show on a, you know, a majority controlled station, white controlled station before WVO--I mean, not WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: WVON, WGCI [WGCI Radio, Chicago, Illinois], WBEE [WBEE Radio, Harvey, Illinois], oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All of them.  Before them.
Speaker 1: WVON didn't come in (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't know how Vince sold that thing to WMAQ, but he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because WVON doesn't come along 'til '64 [1964] there or so.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  He just died, you know that, [HistoryMaker] Wesley South.
Speaker 1: Wesley South was his name.
Speaker 2: And, of course, he only had part-time.  You know, he had had it for what? Twelve to midnight or something. I forget the hour.
Speaker 1: He shared the station with (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  He shared--with a Polish organization.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But all this was before what we call major accounts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, these are local accounts and you were producing shows.  Did things pick up when WVON opened up?  Did you have--?
Speaker 2: Pick up with who?
Speaker 1: For the Cullers [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].  Did Cullers have more--sell more ads once WVON opened up and black people started listening to that so much?
Speaker 2: I would have to have the demographics on that, you know.  We have demographics that shows how your show is doing or your ad is doing; whichever way, you know.  And I would have to have that in front of me before I could answer that.
Speaker 1: Well, I'm just asking in a general sense, did you get any more business because there was a black station at that point.
Speaker 2: I really couldn't tell you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, whether we did or not.  But it didn't keep him from going after more business, I'll tell you that.  He never stopped going after business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 625152
Speaker 1: The first big account was--the biggest account was [HistoryMaker] George Johnson.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Afro Sheen.
Speaker 1: And, and wh- the Afro Sheen campaign was the Wantu Wazuri campaign, the, "Beautiful People Use Afro Sheen"?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What was it?
Speaker 2: It, it, it covered a whole a lots of different areas.
Speaker 1: Well, would you explain to us what it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, you had--Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] did a series on black inventors, you know, which was sponsored by Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company].  The commercials were written and geared towards that.  I'm trying to think of what else he did for Johnson.  But it sold the Afro Sheen hair oil and what have you.  We got good results on that, whenever had to give a report, you know.  And we did have to submit a report.
Speaker 1: I remember first seeing those Afro Sheen ads and--well, the print ads in Jet and Ebony.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the TV ads and the radio ads.  I mean the TV ads were on--Johnson sponsored, sponsored 'Soul Train.'  So you'd see them on 'Soul Train.'
Speaker 2: That's because of Vince.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And he--I used to, being a wife, even though I was in the business [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois], "Why do you have go to California and stay so long?"  And he says, "Well, the next time I go," when I complained, "so next time I go, I'm going to take you with me."  And so I went with him.  And after getting up at five in the morning getting ready for the shoots and what have you, I never asked to go again.
Speaker 1: It was a lot of work, hard work.
Speaker 2: Hey, that's a whole lot of work.  People don't know what it takes to do a commercial or, you know, a campaign.  They don't even know what it is to do a campaign.
Speaker 1: What does a campaign consist of?  I mean, what all kinds of things (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, you've got to have your--you got to have your copy, you got to have your layouts, you got to be able to have a marketing research program; all of that, you know.  It's just not one specific thing.  It's a lots of things to make up a campaign.
Speaker 1: Then does he have hire the talent for the commercials and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We have to--we had to hire talent for the commercials.  Vince had--.  I don't know whether you remembered Lorillard [Lorillard Tobacco Company], but the man in the blue dashiki [Brother in the Blue Dashiki].
Speaker 1: Now that was one that he talked about.  Now, I had a conversation with him about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He said that was a big one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That  was a big one.  And then we had True cigarettes [R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 625153
Speaker 1: Let's go back to man in a blue dashiki [Brother in the Blue Dashiki].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the, the, the, the--what was that--what happened in that commercial [for Lorillard Tobacco Company]?
Speaker 2: Well, he [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] had a theory that not only was--did he want to make money and to have good advertising, but he also wanted to make sure that we had racial pride.  That was in the back of his mind and everything that he did.  And that's what he stressed the whole time.  And he did it the whole time he was alive.  Even up to the time he died almost.  So, yeah, the blue dashiki man was just, we would go over to the amphitheatre [International Amphitheatre, Chicago, Illinois] and we have the man over there in the blue dashiki.  That was just one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But what happened in the commercial, the man in the blue dashiki?  There's a whole story there somewhere (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he, you know.  There was a song--I can't even think of the song now.  But there was a song that went with that.  And he was dressed in a blue dashiki and with his big Afro.  And we changed as time changed, you know.  There came a time when the Afro was no longer in style.  It's coming back now though.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's come back a couple of times (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).  Exactly.
Speaker 1: My son had a big one in high school.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, so did Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers].  You couldn't see Jeff, you know, hardly.
Story_ID: 625154
Speaker 1: The black expo [Black Business Exposition] was one of the things that he tried to get his clients to participate in.  Even Illinois Bell [Illinois Bell Telephone Company] took a booth over there.
Speaker 2: Now, this doesn't occur until about 1970 or so, right, with the--now, what, what year was the--
Speaker 1: Black expo?
Speaker 2: No.  [HistoryMaker] George Johnson's contract with--the contract with George Johnson for Afro Sheen?  What year was that?
Speaker 1: Now, you're going to have ask Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] on that because he was good.  We were interviewed about two weeks ago, and he corrected me on several dates that I had gotten confused about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Well, we have a date here, 1968.  Does that sound right?
Speaker 1: That sounds--that sounds like it.
Speaker 2: And the Lorillard [Lorillard Tobacco Company]--
Speaker 1: Lorillard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the man in the blue dashiki [Brother in the Blue Dashiki], I think is '68 [1968] as well.  Now, let me just kind of frame this and you tell me if it makes sense.  After Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination, there were riots all over the United States.  The theme, as I remember, the man in the blue dashiki, was to be cool.
Speaker 1: To be cool?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That doesn't ring a bell with me.
Speaker 2: It doesn't?  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: When Dr. King got killed, Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] had been calling on Lorillard before Dr. King got killed.  And when he got killed, they sent in the brand of--the main head of advertising at Lorillard out of New York [New York], which we later found out he was a psychiatrist for Lorillard, and he came in to interview Vince.  And evidently Vince passed the test, because about a few months later, we got the contract.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He liked what he heard, liked what he saw, and he gave him the contract.  That was our next big account.  They were right after Afro Sheen.  And so, you see it's beginning to climb up, you know, financially, when Lorillard came in.
Speaker 2: Lorillard, was that the first white company that contracted with Vince?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.  Yeah, it was.  Then we got Gossard [H.W. Gossard Company].  We got Pizza Hut.  I was trying to think of who he used in Pizza Hut.  He used--what's her name?  She was on television for a while.  I can't think of her name now.  But anyway, they're--all that stuff is in the book that Jeff is going to give you or going to show you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: The ads.
Speaker 2: I know that Cullers [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] advertised the Sears ads.
Speaker 1: Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.]?  We had Sears, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: There were black ad--ads for Se- Sears (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: --that featured black people.
Speaker 1: Which was unusual for Sears.  But they gave us the whole campaign, you know.  And it lasted for several years.
Story_ID: 625155
Speaker 1: Illinois Bell [Illinois Bell Telephone Company], as I said.  Then Illinois Bell let us go into the Spanish market.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, let's not jump too fast over Illinois Bell.  Illinois Bell, I remember one of the things that you produced for Illinois Bell was 'Lu's Notebook.'
Speaker 1: Exactly.  That's was Vince's [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] concept of--
Speaker 2: Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II].
Speaker 1: --having a black commentator do the news and give a viewpoint.  It raised a whole lots of ruckus, believe me.  But they bought it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, 'Lu's Notebook' was really a big deal in Chicago [Illinois].  It was on all the black radio stations, twice, maybe three times a day.  And he gave a critique of what--of local politics and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: --national politics.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And for--when did it start?  In--do you remember when they started?
Speaker 1: I don't remember.  There again is where Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] comes in handy.
Speaker 2: Oh, all right.
Speaker 1: He remembers those dates.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I think it went on maybe ten years [sic.], didn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It went on for a long time.
Speaker 2: And it was recorded right there in your studios, right?  Or was it?
Speaker 1: No. No, no.
Speaker 2: You didn't record it there?
Speaker 1: You have to--there again is where I say that Vince and I had decided when we retired, that we would try to conduct some workshops on what is advertising, how do you do this, how do you do that.  This is something that, as I said, we don't know enough about.  He and I did, you know, and I'm sure Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] does too and Barbara [Barbara Gardner Proctor].  Carol Williams [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams], I understand, is doing very well here.  Do you know her?
Speaker 2: No.  But I don't want to get away from Lu Palmer until we talk about the Harold Washington campaign.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Because I think that's--Lu Palmer in '83 [1983], and when '82 [1982] started calling for a black mayor in the City of Chicago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: --from the pages of 'Lu's Notebook' on the radio.  Right.  And do you remember what happened after Harold decided to run?
Speaker 1: I know he came to my church (laughter).  He was one--that was one of the churches he came to.
Speaker 2: Well, I--.  Let me see if anything would refresh your memory then.  The show was taken off the air by Illinois Bell, right?
Speaker 1: I don't remember that part.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I don't know why, because Vince was fighting to keep it on the air, you know.  And for some reason, you know, they did take it off.  And I don't know whether it was on Harold Washington or not.
Speaker 2: It was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can't verify that.
Speaker 2: It was right after he was elected it was taken off the air, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You probably have the details on that.  If you do, then feel free to use them.
Speaker 2: Well (laughter).  I was hoping you could tell me something about it that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Unh-uh, no, unh-uh.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.  Jeff is saying yes (laughter). Right there. He's saying, yes, by all means, yes, that's what happened.  Okay, so--
Story_ID: 625156
Speaker 1: You were saying earlier, the--Barbara Proctor [Barbara Gardner Proctor] and Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] got involved in the early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you all had already kind of paved the way at that point, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--from 1956 to 1971.  You count that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you know Tom Burrell and Barbara Proctor prior to them opening up the ad agency (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] probably did.  But I, I, I don't have--I knew of Tom Burrell and of Barbara Proctor.  I was in the Women's Advertising Club of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and Barbara was, I think, one of the first blacks to be nominated as president of that group.  I belonged to it, but she also was named president.  And Carol Williams [HistoryMaker Carol H. Williams] also became president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But no.  I didn't--Vince (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But they hadn't worked for you all--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: They hadn't worked for you or anything like that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  They worked for white agencies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't--until they started their own agencies, they worked for all-white agencies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't work for any black agencies.
Story_ID: 625157
Speaker 1: My recollection is that, and it's been written too, that you did a lot of the, the financial and business operations of, of Cullers Advertising [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].  Just, just give us an idea of what you did for the organization.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My number one, I was very popular with the staff on payday (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Because I did the payroll (laughter).  And I did that as long as the staff was small.  But when we grew, I couldn't handle that anymore because, see, you got to file with the federal government, the state government, the corporation, you know, taxes.  We had a good lawyer at that particular time, and so, we hired a payroll firm to take over that part of my job so I didn't have to have it.  It was killing me, because I couldn't handle twenty-five or thirty people and make out checks, run them through, pass them out, and still keep up with whatever else I had to do.  And in a way part of my job was to run track behind Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers], you know, to see what he was doing, if he was doing it.  And I don't mean artistic, because I'm not artistic; he was the artist.  He was the creative person in the agency.  But, yeah, that's when I gave it up.  And then my part became taking care of the personnel records, you know, that sort of thing, because our office had grown.  That's when we moved over to 676 St. Clair [Street].  And the office was quite big, and if you ran track around that office, you did pretty good.  So that ended that part.  But for years that's what I was doing.  And, as I said, I finally had to give it up.  It was time to give it up and let somebody handle it that could take care of all those details.
Story_ID: 625158
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be, I guess the, you know, the most important milestone in the history of the, of Vince Cullers Advertising [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: What would be what?
Speaker 1: The most important milestone or the most important thing that happened when, you know, when you all had the agency?
Speaker 2: I think every time we got an account it was a milestone, you know.  A big milestone for us.  We--I, I think after a while, each time Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] would get new business, they would put it in, you know, the national newspapers.  I had to quit giving out this address here, our started--I gave out the address and they broke in my house.
Speaker 1: Did they?
Speaker 2: And the police told me, said, "Don't ever give out your address," you know.  Just say I live in the South Shore area [Chicago, Illinois].  But, I think each one of those was important to me, because we had struggled for so long.  It wasn't an overnight thing, you know.  Far be it.  And so, as we grew, that became another milestone, you know, in our business.  So, I can't say.  I think one of the most beautiful times was our fortieth anniversary that Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] and them--that he, he started that.  And he got a team of people working with him, and it was a magnificent affair, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this would be in 1996, I guess, or so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 625159
Speaker 1: What was the biggest account you, you ever--you, you landed with the--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Any time, all of them were big [for Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].  Anytime you start hitting a million dollars or $2 million, or $3 million or whatever it is, they're big.  They were big to us.  The only thing that I, I questioned Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] on was that, there's a magazine in the advertising industry called Advertising Age, and as you go down and you see where so and so got a new account.  Hey, our 1 million or 2 million or 3 million was a drop in the bucket compared to what they were getting.  But it helped us, you know.  And now that was the most important thing.
Story_ID: 625160
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-five [1975] you're a finalist for Chicago Advertising Woman of the Year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I ran against five other women, and I had to get letters of--not recommendation.  What do you call it?  Well, I had to get letters.
Speaker 1: Endorsements or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the woman who finally won it was from McCann Erickson [McCann Erickson, Inc.].  That's like David and Goliath, right?  So I attended the banquet and all that kind of stuff and got the publicity and what have you, but I did not win the award.  I was just one of the finalists.
Story_ID: 625161
Speaker 1: What would you consider the, the ad campaign that--or which one did you like the most of all the ads you did (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You didn't have one you liked any better than any other?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't really think, you know, of one that I--I think I was proud of the Afro Sheen, where they were stressing racial pride, you know, along with trying to sell the, the client's product.  But as far as putting it ahead of all the rest of them, I, I don't think I can say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not really.
Story_ID: 625162
Speaker 1: It's always seemed to me that, and I don't--correct me if I'm wrong, it seems as though Cullers Advertising [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] influenced the other black advertising agencies and, or maybe--or especially, I think Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] and maybe a few others that--the groups that formed CEBA [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How was that formed?  What role did Cullers play in forming CEBA, and what were the principles that were involved in it?
Speaker 2: You're going to see that when you look at that book up there.  That's a CEBA book.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What does CEBA stand for?
Speaker 2: When he, when you turn off the machine, Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] can tell you what it stands for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But--
Speaker 1: That's a black--it's an organization of black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's an organization.  Well, it started out as blacks producing excellent advertising.  And that just wasn't us, you know.  That was, as you say, Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] and Barbara [Barbara Gardner Proctor], [HistoryMaker] Byron Lewis in New York [New York], and, you know, the different ones in different cities.  There's one in Detroit [GlobalHue, Detroit, Michigan].  And after a while, though, it became integrated.  And I think soon after that or not too soon after that, it was dissolved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But it was a grand occasion.  You know, all of us would descend on New York.  And you or your artwork would be, or your campaigns would be judged, and whether you came out number one, number two, number three; whatever.  But there were awards that were given.  And it was quite a nice thing.
Story_ID: 625163
Speaker 1: You all make a conscious effort in Cullers Advertising [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] to--well, you already said that you did, but I, I notice when I'd see ads that Cullers would do, and Burrell [Burrell Advertising Agency; Burrell Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois] especially, I would see black women with natural hair.  I'd see images of Africa.  I'd see positive images of black people.  Did you have some kind of a special, I mean, a code that you would--I mean of what you wanted to portray, how you wanted to portray black folks on--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  His whole thing was that he was stressing black pride, and along with trying to make a living.  And he never gave up on that.  He continued to do it.  And I don't know what Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] had to do with it.  I think Burrell, you know, copied after us, Barbara [Barbara Gardner Proctor] too.  After we got started with it, you know, and they saw that it was taking hold, then they started doing, you know, the same thing.  Not only did they start doing it, but the white agencies started doing it.  And this is where they began to hire blacks by the droves at that time.  And at one time, you couldn't put your foot in the door.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So it's some kind--at some point there's a recognition of the black dollar being spent and advertising, advertising's trying to make sure that they went after the black--
Speaker 2: Who was making sure?
Speaker 1: I guess the advertisers were trying to attract black consumers or going after the black consuming public, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, though only that I can only speak from Vince's [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] side of it.  He went after the accounts.  So he was trying to earn a living and, as I said, as well as stressing the pride issue along with it.  You can't live off of pride, you got to have something else.  And he did stress that, but he also knew that he had to produce.  And they finally honored him last year.  Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] and I went to New York [New York], you know, 'cause they honored Vince as being a pioneer in that, you know, direction.
Story_ID: 625164
Speaker 1: What happened to the--to the Cullers agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] and--I mean it, it's no long exists.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  What led to the decline?
Speaker 2: Well, you got another interview then coming up, you know, to see what happened.  We dissolved, and Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] has a offshoot of, perhaps you're maybe saying that it's part of an influence of the Cullers agency upon him trying to keep this business going, his business.  His father's not here.  It's up to him now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, so--
Speaker 2: Every now and then he'll ask me a question or two.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Well, so, but Cullers as such is no longer in business?
Speaker 2: No.  We, we have kept, you know, some of the things as Jeff said, some of the things that Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] did, you know.  He had a legacy, and I don't think anybody will ever destroy that, you know, because he had certain things, as I said, that he wanted to keep going.  And I think if Jeff is successful, he'll be able to keep that also going.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I imagine, now, he hasn't--he and I haven't sat down and talked about this, you know, too much, but I imagine he will include his father in some of it.  But he, he gave a beautiful speech in, in New York [New York] about his dad and the influence that it had had--had upon him.
Story_ID: 625165
Speaker 1: How would you describe the legacy of Vince Cullers Advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] today?
Speaker 2: Well, he set an example that you had to be thorough.  He did not accept half work.  He would send work back in a minute.  He, again, as I--I keep stressing this thing that he had in the back of his mind that it had to be something that was beneficial to all of the race; not just him and me or our agency.  But that it had to be beneficial to every--to all of us.  And I think he left that here.  When--that church was packed when he died.  People came in from over the country, you know.  And I don't know.  I'm going to ask Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] does he know about these people you're talking about.  I don't know about them.  I only know that a friend of mine called and told me about this guy Fox [ph.] who wrote the book on advertising, and that he had named Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] in there.  But, no, I don't anything about these other people.  And I'm not saying that they don't exist.  There was a man in--with McCann Erickson [McCann Erickson, Inc.] that Vince admired.  He was a black guy.  And when they fired him, he almost died.  He worked for them for years and they finally fired him.  And I think he did die or he got sick, one of the two, soon after that.  I can't think of his name now.  I'm going to look it up because I need to keep that in my head.  But, that's the only one that I know that Vince kind of looked up to in the business.  He didn't look up to any of the rest of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  No way.
Story_ID: 625166
Speaker 1: Now, you've done a lot of volunteer work; you and Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] volunteered for a lot of organizations.  I, I particularly remember the Kuumba Theater [Kuumba Theater Company].  You were both on the board of Kuumba.
Speaker 2: Yes, we were.
Speaker 1: You know, and--well, tell us about your involvement with Kuumba.
Speaker 2: Well, there again, and you would be surprised at some of the people who belong to that, who were actors and became some of our models or they were models.  Vince didn't always go to a modeling agency.  He would see somebody out there on the street.  And one of the biggest jokes that I have is that I used to wonder why he would take me with me on different things.  And he would always turn and he'd see a good looking girl, and he said, "Hello.  I'm Vince Cullers," you know.  "Here's my card.  Do you do modeling?"  Okay.  And, "Oh, yeah.  Here's my wife."  You know.  In other words, that took him off the hook of trying to flirt with this girl (laughter).  And it took me the longest time to catch on to that.  But most of--lots of 'em, later on he began to use some of the models from the advertising industry.  But, Larry [Larry Crowe], you got to realize it.  Not too many of us could get into the modeling business.  And I don't think it's overflowing now.  Now, they use us on television and in some of the ads, but it's not--compared to the dollars that we spend.  You know, the black market is a big market.
Speaker 1: So would you say that Cullers [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois] kind of opened the door for a lot of talent that had--would not have been discovered otherwise?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I would say it.  I don't know whether anybody else would agree with it, but I would say it, you know.  They didn't have any other way of getting in there.  And they--some of them came through us.  We used to laugh and say we have the biggest alumni association in the world.  The guy who's on television, he and his wife [HistoryMaker Daphne Maxwell Reid] used to do modeling for us.  [HistoryMaker] Tim Reid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of them.  You know.  Those are old Vince Cullers people.  And there's quite a few of them out here.  And the girl that did the Illinois Bell commercial [Illinois Bell Telephone Company], she's on television now in some of the plays and things, and the soap operas and what have you.  So, yeah, we figured that we laid some kind of a trail.  It's out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if some of them would--some of them have acknowledged us since then and said, "Yeah, I started out with Vince Cullers."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's all you can ask.  We don't go around saying, "Wave.  Wave a banner."  You know.  "Look what the Cullers did."  We never have done that.  And I'm proud of him for that and proud of myself.  I know who's out there, and I know how they got there.  So, it's a thing that--just like when I saw you today.  I said, "Oh, my god," you know, "I know him," you know.  So, I keep running into people that I know as old as I am, you know.  So, I hope that there will be many more doors opened up for our people, you know.  But we got to learn how to respect one another and quit shooting one another.  I don't want to get into that.  But anyway, that's, that's something that I'm sure if Vince was alive, he would try to have a campaign on that.
Story_ID: 625167
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that leads to a question we always ask.  We, we always ask the question: what are some of your--what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?  And you, you partially--you started answering it, so go on (laughter).  What others?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, that would be one of them, you know.  There should be a way that we can devise some sort of a program that would stop us from being brutal, and brutal towards, you know, one another.  I think in the back of his mind, that's what he was trying to do, you know.  Be proud of yourself, you know.  You don't have to be on the ground because you're black or what have you, you know.  Be very, very, very proud of what you are and who you are.  And like he [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] told Jorie Lueloff, "I try to help other people.  I don't try to destroy them.  I try to help them."  So that would be, yeah, what I'm after if I was--I'm not going to be here forever, and I know that.  But I hope that Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] and his children will, you know, also have that same kind of attitude.
Story_ID: 625168
Speaker 1: In that same vein like, can you tell us something about children and your, and your, your extended family today?
Speaker 2: My children?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, it's--I don't know quite how to explain it.  We've been a family that--we used to get teased all the time, even down there at the building at 520 [520 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  When Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] got married, and his wife [Carmelita Rivera Cullers] used to work for us too, and when Bryan [Cullers' grandson, Bryan Cullers] was born, we brought Bryan in and sat him in Vince's [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] chair.  We've been a family that has worked together all these years, and until, you know, Vince passed.  And as I said, now the ball's in the other court back there laying on the floor.  And I'm hoping that he will be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he started his own business too?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether he will describe it as that, but it's not Vince Cullers [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] as you know Vince Cullers.  But it still has a Vince Cullers touch to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what's the name of it?
Speaker 2: He has lots of the things in his mind that he does, I know.
Speaker 1: You're talking about Jeff Cullers?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I'm talking about Jeff Cullers.
Speaker 1: And he was very instrumental in Vince Cullers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was.
Speaker 1: --for many years.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he has another business now called--what's it called now?
Speaker 2: Vince Cullers Group [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Vince Cullers Group.  Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So see he's carrying the name, but he doesn't try to put that off as Vince Cullers.  He's saying Vince Cullers Group, and he might want to add something to that after I, you know, you get through with me.  But, that's what he's doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You've got another son, Terry Cullers, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And Terry's an actor and does some other things.  What, can you talk about him a little bit?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I think that if Terry had come along when the universities--at one time, when he was with--he graduated from Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] too, and I think if he had come along when drama was part of the curriculum at most colleges, he would have been a whole lots better off.  I don't think that Terry had ever the enthusiasm, and I hate to compare my children, but I have to say to be truthful, that I think Jeff had more enthusiasm about the business.  Terry was acting.  He lived for acting.  And when he didn't succeed in doing as much as he wanted, I think he kind of, you know, got, you know, upset about it.  He has many good traits about him.  But I don't think that he was cut out for this business.  I'm surprised that I fell into it like I did, but then I had to work with Vince.  And either I supported him or I got out of it.  And I chose to support him.
Story_ID: 625169
Speaker 1: Now, your, your, your parents (background noise) have passed away and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My dad [Elliott Barnett] and mom [Edna Glover Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay (background noise). What did they think about the business [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois]?  Were they proud of you?
Speaker 2: I think my dad was.  I think he understood what advertising was.  Here I go back to that again, that I don't think that in our community we understand what advertising is.  But I think Dad, see Dad was journalism, newspapers, you know, all that kind of stuff.  My mother was proud, and we would try to include her in a lots of things that we were involved in that were social, and that where she could go and see Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] get an award and what have you.  But they didn't try to discourage me.  They supported me and supported Vince.  So, I think that was fully understood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had no problem, you know, with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My [paternal] uncle had a fit, you know.  He's an old time school teacher, right?  "What are you all doing in that business?  You ain't going to make no businessman--no money there."  You know, but he did.  And he--and my aunt supported us.  So he had to eat his words (background noise).  Whose--oh, okay.  Because the business was successful.  He didn't think it was going to be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You probably surprised a lot of people (unclear).
Speaker 2: We probably did (laughter).  Exactly.  Yeah.  We probably did.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 625170
Speaker 1: It says--as you were saying, you're right, very few people know what it even entails (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, listen.  I had the hardest time when I would go out somewhere, and just like you're talking to me now, and they would say, "Well, what do you do?"  "Well, I work in a advertising agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois]," you know, "my husband's [Vince Cullers] advertising agency."  "What is advertising?"  That's the question I would get all the time.  And so I got to go through this long tirade of what advertising is.  I think it's a little more understood now than it was when he and I were young, you know.  But, we just didn't--we just didn't understand it.  Not we, but I mean the average person in the community.  If you go up and down this street right now, you're going to find a whole lots of teachers.  You're not going to find too many people in many other fields.  We're getting people now who, and I'm glad to see that, who are going into science, which is good, you know, and some of the other fields.  But we were never encouraged to do that.  As I told you, I named the three things that we were encouraged to do, and that was teach, preach--what'd I say, teach, preach and--
Speaker 1: You could be a doctor.
Speaker 2: And be a doctor.  Okay.  Or a nurse, you know, or whichever way you want to put it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think now it's beginning to change.  You have people who are coming along, like--I was trying to think of somebody I could name.  A talent research--a search person, you know, a person in the field who would provide the models and what have you.  Most of those are white agencies.  They were not black.  So, hopefully, we'll start improving.

Speaker 1: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  And Vince Cullers Group [Chicago, Illinois], Larry [Larry Crowe], is the, the successor company to Vince Cullers Advertising [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.  It's not a separate co- okay.
Speaker 1: (JEFFERY CULELRS):  (Unclear) advertising, marketing and TV production.  So it's--it has evolved into more multifaceted.  But it, it is the successor company, because we've kept everything the same from tax I.D. to everything else.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  I'll say that.
Speaker 1: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.  I just didn't--
Speaker 1: He was explaining to you what CEBA was.
Speaker 2: No, he was explaining that Vince Cullers--
Speaker 1: No.  He's--
Speaker 2: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  She was talking about earlier.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  That you didn't know what CEBA meant.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  Communications Excellence in Black Advertising [sic. Communications Excellence to Black Audiences].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Communication--
Speaker 2: CEBA.
Speaker 1: --Excellence in Black Advertising.
Speaker 2: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  Black Advertising.
Speaker 1: Advertising is what CEBA stands for.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: C-E-B-A.  Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (JEFFERY CULLERS):  And that was formed out of New York [New York] too, Larry.  The Chicago [Illinois] people didn't have a lot to do with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the current Cullers agency is a continuation of what was founded before and not a separate company.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I just want to clarified that.  And I just have two more questions.
Speaker 2: Oh, really (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.  I only have two more questions, and the first question is very easy, and it's--
Speaker 2: You want me to move?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: No.  I saw him looking over there (laughter).
Speaker 1: The first question is: is there anything in the world that I have not asked you that you think we need to talk about before I ask the last question?  That the first question (laughter).
Speaker 2: You asked me a question and this may not have anything to do with what you're saying now.  What was I most proud of in my advertising, you know, in, in, in the field.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think the thing I'm the most proud of was my husband.  He did so much that people don't realize that opened up many doors.  And I, for one, will never get through praising him for that.  He devoted himself to making a living; he took care of his family; he didn't neglect us in any way.  And he, I think, and he had started it with his grandchildren, to have pride in who you are.  I think Bryan [Bryan Cullers] told me, that's Jeff's [Jeffery Cullers] oldest son, "Daddy Vince [Vince Cullers] said to always be proud of yourself."  So what can I say?  Now, that's one I have.  I mean, the campaigns are great, you know, and I couldn't have done without him.  I wouldn't be where I am today--I don't know whether I want to be here, but I mean, you know, moving ahead in the field or in life.  I'm not in the field anymore, but in life.  I have many pleasant things to remember.  I remember some hard times also.
Story_ID: 625172
Speaker 1: And I remember when, and I'm going back now, but you can add it in if you feel like it, is that when we moved in one building, we had a petition signed against us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, okay.  Now, so they were trying to keep a black company [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group] out of the building?  This is something I didn't ask you.  Now, that's true.  That's in an age when there were restricted housing covenants, you know, that would keep black people of certain neighborhoods.  You all moved into the Loop [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I don't know if you all were the first company to do that or--because I know Johnson [Johnson Publishing Company] was on the South Loop [Chicago, Illinois], kind of on the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he built--he built that building.
Speaker 2: He built his building in the South Loop.  But you all were at 542 North Michigan [Avenue].
Speaker 1: 520.
Speaker 2: 520 North Michigan.  520 on Michigan.  That's pretty much, you know, that's right in the heart of the--
Speaker 1: In the middle of it.
Speaker 2: --of the white business district--in the mainstream business district of Chicago [Illinois].  Yeah.  So there was resistance to, you're saying to--
Speaker 1: We didn't have that much resistance there as we did at 431 South Dearborn [Street] where they signed a petition against us and asked that we be moved out of the building, and--
Speaker 2: Well, what happened?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: They couldn't get it honored.  By that time, Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers]--I don't know whether you remember Lafontant or not.  Jewel Lafontant's husband [HistoryMaker John Rogers, Sr.].
Speaker 2: Jewel Lafontant [HistoryMaker Jewel Lafontant-MANkarious]. Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He became our lawyer, and he went to court on that, and they couldn't get us out of there.  Okay.  But, no.  We didn't have--the only thing we got at 520 North Michigan was ignored.  And I guess we were so busy trying to make it that we didn't--being ignored didn't bother us at that time.
Speaker 2: Ignored in the sense that--?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, that you--that no one would speak to you or talk with you or what have you, when we first moved in there.  Later on it became different.  But when we first moved in there, that's what happened.  So, what's your last question?
Speaker 2: All right.  Well, good.  I'm glad you raised that, because that's an important-
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --aspect of this that I didn't ask about.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 625173
Speaker 1: The last question--are you sure you're ready for it? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I may not answer it if I'm not (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is there anything--is there anything else that I haven't asked?  Because there might be something else.  You even said that's a good one.  That's a good one.
Speaker 2: As I said, the other thing was that I was so proud of Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers], the way he handled Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] at the 4A's [American Association of Advertising Agencies].  That's the biggest organization in America as far as the advertising industry.  And it took them a while to recognize Vince, but I was--that night, I was busting out, you know.  And that's only been about two years ago.  But other than that, there's nothing else that I've--I think we just about covered everything, unless Jeff can think of something.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It must be special to be able to pass along a business to your children.  That's successful.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It--I think so.  To see them, yeah, move ahead, if they're going to move ahead, it would be.  Yeah.  But all we can do is offer it, you know.  I can't force anybody, you know, to say, "Here," you know, "you got to do this, you got to do that."  They're grown.  And if they haven't learned from us, then they have to do it on their own.
Story_ID: 625174
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --similar to legacy, but it's a little bit different.  Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy (laughter).  Okay.  How would I like to be remembered?  I would like to be remembered as--I don't know whether I can put all that into just one sentence or not.  As a caring person, a loving person; that I did what I could to help somebody else, you know, would be part of mine, and I know I'm not saying everything that's on my mind, but that would be part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that, I didn't think that I would be able to last.  It took me almost two years to get over Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] being dead, because we were--we were a team.  And that stays in my mind.  I don't think I'll ever, you know, forget that.  So that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you so much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You're welcome.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 625175
Speaker 1: That's Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers].  That's me and Vince at the office.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, next one please. (Unclear) just as you see it, you can go ahead and talk.
Speaker 1: Though close as Jeff [Cullers' son, Jeffery Cullers] and I became, we used to go to Greenbrier, West Virginia [The Greenbrier Resort, White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia], for the national advertising convention every year, and that's where I think that is, because it was real nice down there, real pretty.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next one.  Okay.  Can you see that one?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's the early years of the receptionist, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next one.
Speaker 1: And that's when Jeff first--at the very beginning of when he first started with the agency [Vince Cullers Advertising, Inc.; Vince Cullers Group, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next.
Speaker 1: I can't see that very well.
Speaker 2: That's a WBMX [WBMX Radio, Chicago, Illinois] in the supermarket.  They're advertising for WBMX in the supermarket, looks like.
Speaker 1: Is that crunchy potato chips or do you know?
Speaker 2: Could be.  Can you see?  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is that crunchy potato chips?
Speaker 1: The package is.  I'm trying to see what's on the packages.  It doesn't show up in this one.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can't really tell in the other one either.
Speaker 1: If we could (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Should we move on, it doesn't seem--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is it that really that significant?
Speaker 1: Yeah (unclear). Does it say crunchy?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah (unclear).  Can we do another one in the meantime?  We're still rolling.  Okay, ma'am, can you see this one?
Speaker 1: That's not part of the agency.  That's my cousin and Terry [Cullers' son, Terry Cullers].  And that's here in the house.  So that's not part of the agency.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Your cousin who?
Speaker 1: Hm?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Who was that?
Speaker 1: My cousin.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Are there any others over, Tom [Thomas Jefferson]?
Speaker 1: What else do you have there?  There's plenty more.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I put it sideways on purpose, so don't be alarmed.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):   Let us turn it around, Photoshop.  Okay.  What were you doing when this photo was taken?
Speaker 1: That was one of the pictures that they took when I was elected--you know, one of the five finalists in the Advertising Woman of the Year [Chicago Advertising Woman of the Year].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You remember when that was?
Speaker 1: I would have to look through the book, you know, to, yeah, see.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, all right.  Next one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this little--this is a plaque, and it seems to be something--.  It's the Marian [HistoryMaker Marian Cullers] and Vince Cullers something.  You know what that is?  It looks like a significant company.  Must be in a building someplace.
Speaker 2: Where is the magnifying glass?  I was trying to see what it said beneath year.
Speaker 1: Here you go.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm still rolling.  (Unclear).  We should probably do things like this before we start rolling, determining what's (unclear).
Speaker 1: Nah, I can't see that.  That's [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers and Vince.
Speaker 2: Looks like in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Did you get it?  You got it, right?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So now this is Vince and it's Project 75 doctors--
Speaker 1: That was Bristol-Myers [Bristol-Myers Squibb].  We had them as a client too, and he had a doctors' program that benefitted black doctors.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Next one.
Speaker 1: All right.  This is a float in a parade.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were always in the Bud Billiken Parade [Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic], which--sometimes we'd have two or three clients.  Other times, it'll be one client, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There's Vince with someone (unclear).
Speaker 2: Who is that?  I'm trying to see.  Let me see who the person--looks like a football player.
Speaker 1: Now, this is some actress.  I don't know who it is, but she (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  That's--that was one of our television commercials.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) Afro Sheen commercial?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Afro Sheen commercial.
Speaker 1: Watu Wazuri (unclear).  Here's you and Vince walking down--no.  I don't know.  Who is it?
Speaker 2: Who is this?
Speaker 1: A couple (unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  It's Grand Park boulevard.  It's in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: I'm trying to see who the girl is.
Speaker 2: Can't tell by looking at it?
Speaker 1: No, that's too small.
Speaker 2: There's no legend on the back of it.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Somebody put one in this box?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably from an Afro Sheen ad.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's an Afro Sheen ad.
Speaker 2: This is 'Soul Train.'  This is part of 'Soul Train.'  I know that.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's, well, you know, where they shot the dancers when they were dancing.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  Next.
Speaker 2: This is Mahalia Jackson a couple (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, that--that was one of our local accounts.  It really wasn't local because Mahalia had chicken places [Mahalia Jackson Chicken System, Inc.] in the South, and Vince was hired to do her advertising.  I forgot about her.  I really did.  And that's--who's the guy who just died down there in Memphis [Tennessee]?  He was on that board.
Speaker 2: Oh, Hooks.  That's Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Benjamin Hooks.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And this one I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well he was also part of Mahalia's board.

Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.  And tell us about this one.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Dr. King.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's really weird.  I cannot find anywhere--don't get glare on it.
Speaker 1: Really.  Would it help if I do this?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Tilt it.  Yeah.  I got it keystoned (unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 1: Got it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's a painting your husband did?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He did that.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Was that 1968 or so?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It probably was.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's when everybody got inspired to paint one of Dr. King's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I had one, too.  Everybody.
Speaker 2: I know that guy and I can't call his name.

Speaker 2: Hm, all right.
Speaker 1: That's one on me.
Story_ID: 625176
Speaker 1: All of this is, I think, Service Federal [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: That's Joe Louis.

Speaker 2: Joe Louis, Jesse Jackson and an unknown person standing in the background.
Speaker 1: Vince [Cullers' husband, Vince Cullers] and Brock Peters.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He did some work for Vince.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: I think he was a voiceover on one of the commercials.
Speaker 1: Undoubtedly (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember he did the voice of a robot at my son's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: He used to say, "I will disassemble you."  (Laughter) I used to tell my son, "If you don't hurry up, I'll disassemble you."  How about Brock Peters.

Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I was just letting you know we're still rolling.
Speaker 1: Say what?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I was just saying we're still rolling here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Here's one here.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) I think that might just do it.  We don't have a lot of family ones we could get a hold of now.
Speaker 2: That was Amoco [Amoco Corporation; BP Corporation North America Inc.].  Yeah.  The commercials at--TV commercial that we did for Amoco.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What can you tell us about the recording?  Can you just tell us about this one, just describe it for us?
Speaker 1: Vince, he created that himself, you know.  Just, you know, blackball, you know, this, that, and the other.  It's not that original.  But it's original, but not--and he was using it as a promo piece.  I wish I knew who this is.  This looks like one of the football players.  And I don't know which one.
