Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Gordon Jones].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name was Mildred Jean Jones, M-I-L-D-R-E-D, J-E-A-N, J-O-N-E-S.  Her maiden name was Weaver, W-E-A-V-E-R.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was 10, October 10, 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know?  If, and, oh?  Where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Newark, Ohio also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: I can tr--trace the ancestors fairly far back.  We lived with my grandmother whose name was Bessie Weaver [Bessie Norman Weaver], my grandfather, whose name was George Weaver, died at a fairly early age from an accident at his work when he fell off a truck.  Beyond that, I know the names of, of my, I'm just trying to remember these, I actually brought some--the, I did some family history, I got all the names of the people, so I, I may draw a blank.  Would it be better if I got that to--
Speaker 1: No, not necessarily, it's, it's the stories are--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --are what you know about 'em is, is maybe more, more important than--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the names of all of them.
Speaker 2: Do, do you want me to talk about each of these or just give you the names for right now?
Speaker 1: No, well no.  If, if you know a good story about your ancestors and, and, well where, where di--were your ancestors from someplace other than Ohio?  I mean can you go further back?
Speaker 2: They're mainly from Ohio.  But I can, you know, I can go, I can go back fairly far with, with on my mom's and my dad's side, I think.  My, you want me to just kind of continue?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  My, my grandfather, I'm sorry, my grandmother who was a Weaver, she was a, she was born as a Norman, her father, her father's name was, was, shoot, ah shoot what was his first name?
Speaker 1: But he was a Norman, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: His name was, his name was Norman.
Speaker 1: Was he from Newark as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, he was, he was from Newark, Ohio.  He and, he and his wife--
Story_ID: 306585
Speaker 1: Right now, you know, we're just talking about your mother's [Mildred Weaver Jones] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  Okay, I, I, I think I know enough to, at least--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --recall some of that.
Speaker 1: So you were talking about your, your--
Speaker 2: Okay, you want me to just go ahead and start?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  On my mother's side, her mother's name was Bessie Weaver [Bessie Norman Weaver] and she was, she was married to George Weaver, again George died from an accident at his work where he fell off of a truck.  As it turns out, my grandmother, her family was named Norman, her father was named Norman, last name Norman, her mother's last name was Ransom.  As it turns out, the same thing was the case on my grandfather's side.  On my grandfather's side his father was named Weaver, but his mother also was named Ransom.
Speaker 1: Now they--now I'm asking this question here, kind of fishing but, are they any kin to the Reverend Reverdy Ransom [Reverdy C. Ransom]?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Thanks, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, they're, they're--so my family is very closely tied to the rans--to Reverend Reverdy Ransom, my grandmother used to always tell the stories of her very favorite cousin, they were very close, that was Reverdy Ransom.  In fact my grandmother went to Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], where Reverdy Ransom was the, at that time, he was the, he was the president of the board of trustees, he actually talked her into going to Wilberforce University, my mother also graduated from Wilberforce University, as did, as did her mother and ultimately as did a couple of my nephews, sons of my, of my brother [Brent Jones].  So we have a very close connection with Reverdy Ransom and on the Ransom on my mother's side, of the mother's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Now on the Norman side, are there any relatives in Zanesville [Ohio]?  I'm just fishing again.
Speaker 2: No, I really did not have any relatives in Zanes- in Zanesville.
Speaker 1: I know the town historian, I mean the black historian in Zanesville is a Norman.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  Yeah, you know we've done, we've done a lot of, I did a lot research, I did a tremendous amount of family history res- research and actually went, actually got back to almost 1820s well before the Civil War.  None of the Normans at that time were from Zanesville, mostly from Newark [Ohio] and then ultimately kind of southern Ohio, St. Clairsville [Ohio], and some of the other places like that.  But again (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is--okay.
Speaker 2: At least in my family, particularly on my mother's side, they were all educated.  My mother was a teacher, again educated at Wilberforce, my grandmother actually in the research that I did, I actually was able to get a copy of her transcripts from when she attended Wilberforce University.
Story_ID: 306586
Speaker 1: Okay now, I just wonder now, is the family tradition that the roots of the family are in Virginia or someplace like that?  I would, it seems like there's a pattern in Ohio, or som--
Speaker 2: On, on my father's [Gordon Jones] side.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father's side--
Speaker 1: Now on your mother's [Mildred Weaver Jones] side--
Speaker 2: --it goes to back to Virginia, on my mother's side does, does not, does not go back to Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does it go back to any other place in the South that you know of?
Speaker 2: It go--it goes pretty far back to Ohio, I'm gonna take a, I know I'm not supposed to do this but, as, as I recall, on my mother's side, as far back as I got, was all in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, so around the turn of the 19th cent--century?  You know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because the 1800--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of--
Speaker 2: They were even in Ohio, at least as far back as I could see, they were in Ohio, even pre-Civil War.
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like the 1800?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in, in--
Speaker 1: You start to see a lot of blacks migrating into Ohio--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from, and a lot of them are from Virginia--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from this plantation.
Speaker 2: That certainly happened on my father's side--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, I was able to, I was able to find that on my father's side.  From my mother's side, as far back as we got, they were in Ohio even pre-Civil War.
Speaker 1: So these are, these are, there are no slaves on that side, they're free blacks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From what we--
Speaker 1: --living in Ohio?
Speaker 2: --from what we could find, we didn't find on my mother's side, we did on my father's side, but we didn't find connection to slavery, now if we got further back, we'd perhaps would have found that, but we did not find that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are, are there any stories from, from, passed down from your, that side of the family about life in Ohio in those early days as a, as a black family?
Speaker 2: You know my, my, my family in Ohio, on my mother's side again was a pretty prominent family.  At that time, they would be very much considered middle class, probably, at that time, considered probably upper class in the African American community.  Very much religious people and--
Speaker 1: The A.M.E. church [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. church, my grandmother [Bessie Norman Weaver] used to tell us how there, the church that we all went to in town, there's only one A.M.E. church in town, was actually built by my grandfather [George Weaver].  He was a brick layer and a contractor and sh--in fact she has told me that if you ultimately find the corner stone of the church, in that cornerstone of the church he has left a, he has left, some memorabilia and letter in the cornerstone.  Now, we've never been able to get to the cornerstone, you know, of the, of the church, but she said there are things there that, when he built that church, that he decided to leave.  So it's always been the, you know, a bit of a mystery to us exactly what that, what we might find there.  But we have a great history with the church there in, in Ohio because he was so involved in building that church.  And my family, including myself, was all very involved in that church.
Speaker 1: That's something.  Well, what's the name of the church?
Speaker 2: It's Trinity A.M.E. Church [Newark, Ohio].
Story_ID: 306587
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Mildred Weaver Jones] have, did she ever talk about, what, what did she tell you about growing up in, in Newark [Ohio], what it was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: She was one of six children and, you know, she talked a lot about, for them, how difficult it was to grow up because their, her father [George Weaver], my grandfather died when she was, I think it was nine years old.  And, but my grandmother [Bessie Norman Weaver] was educated and she started out as a teacher and she ultimately, she ultimately became very involved in the community doing a number of, a number of different things and she ultimately retired as a, as a teacher as my, as my mother did in the community.  And so, she talked a lot about, a lot about living in this community in Newark, Ohio, that while experiencing racial prejudice, as we did in every community, it was mainly an integrated community and they lived, they lived on the side of town that was predominately, predominately white.  And she talked a lot about the growing up, but the growing up mainly with her brothers and sisters and the things that they did, you know, as a, as a family and trying to keep the family going after the death of my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said she went to Wilberforce College [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and became a teacher in, in Newark I take it?
Speaker 2: Who my grandmother or my mother?
Speaker 1: Your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  She, well my mother, who's--it's interesting, she went to college at Wilberforce, but when she came back to Newark, she couldn't find a teaching job at that stage and for most of my years growing up, my mother worked in the homes of some fairly prominent white families cleaning houses.  And even though she was a college graduate and she did that most of my life growing up.  And it wasn't until I was in high school [Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] that she finally decided that she wanted to teach and, and really tried seriously to find a teaching job and she did and she ultimately became a teacher and she taught in the, in what was called the Starlight School system and she taught mainly mentally disadvantaged kids.
Speaker 1: In, in Newark?
Speaker 2: In Newark.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so she taught there for about, excuse me, another dozen years and then ultimately retired there as a, as a teacher in the mentally retarded school system.
Story_ID: 306588
Speaker 1: Now, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  His name is Gordon, G-O-R-D-O-N, Lewis, L-E-W-I-S, Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Excuse me, his date of birth was January 26, 1927.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about in, in Newark [Ohio] too right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  What can you tell us about his side of the family, how far back can you trace him?
Speaker 2: My day, my dad's father, whose name was Chester Jones, was divorced from his mother at an early age, never really in my dad's life, although my dad would tell me he, he would come, excuse me, I've got something caught in my throat here.  But my dad, but my dad would tell me that he would come from time to time and visit, bring him a gift and come to see them maybe once a year sometimes.  So, he didn't really have a relationship with his dad, he was very close to his mother, my grandmother's name was Virginia Jones [Virginia Smith Jones], and she raised three kids, my dad, his brother and his sister and raised them alone in Newark.  She mainly also, was a house cleaner and sh--she cleaned a number of homes to take care of, take care of, of her kids in town.  My dad was, by his own description, a very a very gregarious, yet in some ways kind of angry young man, often involved in fights and those sort of things in the, in the neighborhood, but was well liked around there.  And so he grew up, he grew up really admiring his uncle, my grandmother's brother, whose name was Norwood Jones [sic. Norwood Smith], Uncle Nordy as we knew him, was a professional fighter and he had, he had about seventy professional fights, he was a light heavyweight fighter and my dad grew up admiring him and ultimately, when my dad left and joined the [U.S.] Coast Guard.  In the Coast Guard, he became a fighter and he was the bantamweight champion for the Coast Guard and, and that's when he got in a little bit of trouble.  He, he, according to him, was quick to jump in the middle of a fight with anyone, he's also, my dad was also a very proud person and he wouldn't, he very much had the courage of his convictions and he would not allow people to in anyway degrade him or others.  He wouldn't, did not take to at all, racial prejudice at that time or people who were willing to call him or other's names, and very quick to jump into those kinds of things.  And that happened to him shortly after he left the Coast Guard, he was in Detroit [Michigan] and someone, someone called him a name and he ultimately got in a fight with this person and ultimately was stabbed sixteen times and 'til, to today, he does not have the use of his, his right arm, he was stabbed in the shoulder and upper arm at that time.  But, you know, he was a, he was a very determined uneducated man, he did not finish high school at that time and he ultimately came back and went to work in Ohio, in Newark in the pow--at the power company, Ohio Power Company and he worked there for thirty-six years and when he came back from the war [World War II, WWII], he  married my mother [Mildred Weaver Jones] and they had two children, my, my brother [Brent Jones] and myself and they raised us on his income as a utility man for the power company and ultimately, on my mother's income as house cleaner and then ultimately, you know, as a, as a teacher.  That was something that always bother him, not finishing high school.  Again, my mother's side was very educated and I'm very proud of him, because in his forties he ultimately decided to go back and get his GED [General Educational Development] certificate and he ultimately went back and got his, got his high school education.
Story_ID: 306589
Speaker 1: But, again, he [Jones' father, Gordon Jones] was, he was very proud, and he really instilled in both my brother [Brent Jones] and I, something that I think we both carry today, a couple of things that we both carry today.  Number one, he had an incredible work ethic, when we were growing up as kids, my dad, I can't remember him ever having less than maybe four jobs at one time.  So, he worked at the power company [Ohio Power Company], but at night he would go and he would clean businesses around town [Newark, Ohio], usually three or four of them and he ultimately had my brother and I work with him and we were just young at that time, we had to go and we emptied waste baskets, that was our primary job and you know, do a few other, do a few other things.  Well, he instilled this incredible work ethic, he and both my mother [Mildred Weaver Jones] really instilled in us the, the, the, the sense that we really needed to help other people, that we really needed to, as we, and if we were successful, that we really had to reach back and help other people.  Both of my parents felt strongly about that that came very strongly from my mother's side of the family, from the Ransom side, that, as I said, my grandmother [Bessie Norman Weaver], very close to Reverdy Ransom [Reverdy C. Ransom], and the things that he accomplished, she accomplished tremendous things too, particularly for a woman of that age.  There were a lot of African American women at her age that were college graduates and she was very community spirit and very community involved.  And she used to tell us all the time that, that it was our responsibility to help other people.  She used to tell us all the time, and probably the thing that I most remember from my grandmother, was something that she said to me that I've never forgotten.  And in fact, I do use this phrase often with my other people, with the people who work for me, she used to talk to us a lot about opportunity, that we had this incredible opportunity and she talked about, you know, how difficult it was for her coming up, but yet, she went to college [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and her father encouraged her to not just go to college but take advantage of the opportunities that are out there.  And she used to talk to my brother and I all the time, we had, she had a little plate that, that was on, that hung on the wall, and the plate actually was given to her by, by her father, who ultimately got it, I forget from where, but on that plate it said, it said, now let me see if I get this, if I get this right, I ultimately have this plate in my office, in my home office today.  It says, "Opportunities are never lost, they're just taken by others," and, and so, she ra- she raised my brother and I, along with my parents because she lived with us throughout my entire childhood life.  And she was a very wise, she was a very wise old woman and she talked to us a lot about the great opportunities that we had, that we needed to take advantage of, and she used to always use that phrase that opportunities are never lost, they're just taken by others.
Story_ID: 306590
Speaker 1: What personality traits do you think you take from your parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones] and who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I take a little bit, you know, I take a little bit from both of my parents, I guess as everybody does.  You know, my father was a, he, he was kind of a strict taskmaster, he was, he was, you know, quick to,  quick to admonish us, he was quick to discipline us, he insisted that we always work hard and as I said, I think I got that work ethic.  Growing up, we always had to have a job, we were either cutting somebodies grass or either working with him, we were doing things because he felt like you're gonna have to be able to support yourself.  And so, I really, I think got a lot of that from him.  From my mother, my mother and, and his person, my dad's personality is a very, is a very aggressive, you know, kind of personality.  I didn't get that as much from him, my personality's a little more laid back, it's kind of like my mom.  My mom had, you know, a much more of a kind of a laid back philosophical personality and, and she even, because of her upbringing, you know, she was the one who often talked about, you've got to be willing to help others and she was always very involved like her mother [Bessie Norman Weaver] was, in the community and doing things to help other people and that's why she became a teacher.  And, and I think I got a lot of, I got a lot of her personality in that regard and I think, in terms of the things that I do to help others, I think that really kind of ethic came from my, from my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: I have one brother [Brent Jones], just the two of us.
Speaker 1: Now are you the oldest or?
Speaker 2: He's an older brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 306591
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, I have a, I have a lot of early childhood memories (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well the earliest.
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood, the earliest childhood memory I have, I think the very earliest childhood memory I have that I can think of goes back to when I was about seven or eight years old.  We were a, we were a very close family, particularly on my mom's [Mildred Weaver Jones] side, as I said, my mom had five brothers and sisters and we always got together as a family and we got together, I would spend times with them in the summers, particularly one sister who lived in Mount Vernon, Ohio.  And, and I was, I remember an incident that happened that really impacted me.  We were going to go get a dog in Mount Vernon and my cousin, female cousin, her name is Sharon [ph.], she and her mother, my aunt [Hazel Weaver Chancellor], were going to get a dog and that was gonna be my dog, but we were gonna get it in Mount Vernon, I was about seven, Sharon was like eight and we went to the dog pound to get a dog and I remember going to, in there and I saw a dog that I liked, it was a little black dog, I think it may have been a Labrador, I don't know.  But I remember the guy at the dog pound said, "Yeah, here's a great dog, this little black dog, we call this dog nigger," and, and, you know I, of course, understood that but, you know, I was only seven years, seven years old, and he continued to talk about that, you know, "Here's nigger, yeah just be a good dog for your house," and I remember my aunt then made a real fuss about that, you know, "You can't," you know, that, "That's disrespectful," and so forth.  But at any rate, we ended up taking the dog and my uncle [Charles V. Chancellor, Jr.] came home that same afternoon and she told the story to him and I remember he grabbed me and my cousin by the hand, put us in the car, took us back to the dog pound, took the dog back, gave the dog back to its owner of the dog pound and just literally, I lit into him and, and, and, and the, and almost threatened him because he had disgraced this family and, and so forth and so that, that was something I guess I remember--
Story_ID: 306592
Speaker 1: Okay now, this, with this dog, this dog story, do you think that the, the proprietor of the pound was really trying to insult you?
Speaker 2: You know, I think he knew what he was saying when he said it and I think it was kind of his subtle way of sort of putting us down or putting us in our place and so, you know, I think he was certainly cautious of what or conscious of what it was he was saying for sure.  And so, you know whether or not, I, I don't know what his intentions were, but I would assume (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How?
Speaker 2: --that he was very conscious of that.
Speaker 1: How did he react to your uncle?
Speaker 2: Oh, when my uncle, when my uncle went back and gave that to him, of course he apologized, he said, "I didn't, I didn't mean to insult you, that's just what we call the dog," and so forth and so.  He actually, he, he, he actually was taken aback that my uncle was so aggressive and that made him take the dog back and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Wa--was this the--
Speaker 2: --and he did apologize.
Speaker 1: --uncle that was the boxer or?
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: Was this the uncle who?
Speaker 2: No, no.  This was the unc--this was an uncle on my fa--on my mother's [Mildred Weaver Jones] side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was an uncle on my mother's side.  He actually owned his own business.  Again, a few African Americans that owned his own business, he owned a tire shop [City Tire, Mount Vernon, Ohio] in--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Charles Chancellor [Charles V. Chancellor, Jr.].  And Uncle Charles owned a tire shop for many years, became a very prominent citizen in Mount Vernon, Ohio, and ultimately was a member of the school board there and did a--very well known in, in Mount Vernon, Ohio.
Story_ID: 306593
Speaker 1: Any other, now you, you were talking there are other incidents, kind of racial incidents in Newark [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Well there were a lot of things, you know, growing up. Newark, was in some ways, you know, a very integrated town, and we lived in more of the white community, there was a very defined black community in Newark, and it was called the east side and so, most blacks lived on the east side of town.  We lived on the west, on the west side of town because we lived, we had a very big home that was built by my gran--[maternal] grandfather [George Weaver].  And, and so we lived in a large home on the west, on the west side of town, but it was very clear that, it was very clear that there were some dividing lines, as a, as a young person growing up, when I was six, seven, eight years old, we were only allowed to sit in the balcony of the movie theater as an example and, and frankly didn't think that much about that, it's just kind of the way it was.  We all loved to skate and probably the biggest, probably the biggest social, the biggest social activity for blacks in Newark was roller skating and everybody in town loved to roller skate and so every Thursday night was our night to go roller skating and that was the only night that blacks were allowed to skate in the rink.  It came to be known by white kids in town as nigger night, and so you weren't, they didn't go and we were the only ones that could skate on Thursday night.  I remember one time my brother [Brent Jones], my brother's a lot like my dad [Gordon Jones], he was very, he was very aggressive, he was always willing to push things, and my brother actually took me and two other friends to the skating rink one Saturday, said, "We're gonna go skating at the skating rink."  Well we got to the skating rink and they said, "No, you're not allowed to skate," and I remember that, I remember feeling very embarrassed about that and, but they denied us.  But as it turns out, my uncle, now this is on my mother's [Mildred Weaver Jones] side, one of my mother's brother's, Uncle Bob [Robert Weaver] was an attorney in town, in Newark, a very prominent attorney, ultimately became a judge as well as a city councilman and attorney.  And--
Speaker 1: Bob, what would be his last name?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: What's his last name?
Speaker 2: What was his last name?
Speaker 1: Uncle Bob.
Speaker 2: Robert Weaver.
Speaker 1: Robert Weaver?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And so, Uncle Bob went to the skating rink, threatened to sue them and ultimately they allowed us to come in and skate.  The same thing actually happened at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  We were not, they did not allow blacks to be members of the YMCA.  My brother who wanted to be in the YMCA, my parents decided they were going to push the YMCA so he could be a member.  My brother actually is the one who, who integrated the YMCA because he went to join, they told him he couldn't join, they went back with my uncle, and ultimately he, you know, he became the first member of, of the YMCA.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, there are a lot of incidents like that.  There was a, they built a brand new swimming pool in town called the Oak Park Swimming Pool [ph.], and I just remember we all liked to swim and there was one swimming pool where we could go to out on the other side of town.  We wanted to go to this new swimming pool with some of our friends, we had a lot of white friends at that, you know, in Newark.  Again, it was an integrated community and among the kids, you know, many of us kind of co-mingled and did things together.  But we decided to, to call, but to show you how things were, we decided to call the swimming pool and say, "Yeah we want to come to the swimming pool, can we come and swim and we're black kids."  And I remember the guy said, "Hell no," and hung up, and that's, and so that of course--
Speaker 1: How old were you at the?
Speaker 2: Then I was probably about fifteen at that time.
Speaker 1: That's pretty far, that's 1964, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean Newark, again in many ways, integrated but in other ways not.

Speaker 1: My wife [Helen Thompson Jones] and I got married in 1968, and when we got married of course we needed to have an apartment and I was working at State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] at the time.  I was working with a young lady who sat right next to me at State Farm and she, she and her fiance actually were getting married the exact same day that we were getting married, April 6, 1968.  And so, of course we're starting to look for apartments and we went out to look for an apartment which was right next to this Oak Park Swimming Pool [ph.] and, and we went out, my wife to be and I went out and they said, "Well, we're going to put you on the waiting list, it's gonna take probably a while for you on the wait list to get off the waiting list."  The next day I went into the office, I talked to this young lady and, and I, and I said, she, she said, "We just got an apartment," I said, Where?"  Or she said, "We're looking for an apartment," and I said, "Where?"  And she told me the same place, I said, "So they put you on the waiting list I guess for while?"  She said, "What waiting list?  You know we, they got, we got an apartment right away."  And so, you know, we, we found that we went to at least a dozen different places in Newark [Ohio] and then I was working for State Farm which was a highly recognized company in town and every place we went that we would call of course, you've heard the stories and people would say, "Oh, I'm sorry we just rented it just before you got here," and we'd go back and we'd call them and they would say, not knowing it's us, "Oh yeah, we have an apartment, you know, for rent."  And, and so, we went through that at least a dozen times and I, I remember the place we finally end up renting which was the bottom floor of a house, 'cause we were so exasperated by all of this, I called, there's an arti- there's an ad and I called and, and a white lady answered and I said, "Look, we're a black couple we need to find an apartment, do you rent to black people?"  And I remember her putting the phone down and calling out to her husband, their last name was Kelly [ph.] and she called her husband Kelly, she said, "Kelly, do you want to rent to colored people?"  And I remember, I could hear him yelling in the phone, he said, "I don't give a damn as long as they pay the rent," and that's where we ended up renting an apartment.  And they actually became very good friends of ours, in fact there were times when we couldn't even pay the rent, that they kind of let it slide for a month or so, so, a lot of those kinds of experiences, you know growing up in, you know, in this, this town which was a little bit of, it, it was a little bit deceptive in terms of how it looked versus how it really was.
Speaker 2: Now, how many people live in Newark?
Speaker 1: About fifty thousand.  It's, it's not a small, a real small town.  But, you know, on the other side of it is, you know, the school system there was great, I can't honestly recall ever being treated badly in the, in the schools we, we got a great education (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I wanna talk about school.  Le--let me go back a little bit further.
Story_ID: 306595
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask.  What were--can you describe the house?  You said it's a big house right and on the west side of Newark [Ohio]?  Can you describe, you know, kind of what it looks like and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we lived, you know, we lived at that time in a white neighborhood on Buckingham Street, a very friendly neighborhood, all of our neighbors were white, there were no other black couples in the neighborhood.  My best friend lived two doors down the street, his name is mal--his name is Mullenix, his dad was a minister and we were best friends, as kids we did everything together growing up and--
Speaker 1: This is a white kid?
Speaker 2: He's a white kid.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Larry Mullenix, and--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Mullenix?
Speaker 2: M-U-L-L-E-N-I-X.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but you know?  We lived in a community and this, this was a beautiful street with large trees, sidewalks, we lived in a large house, it was a, probably a eight room house, it had one, two, it had four, it's a four bedroom house, big house, it had a big yard, both front and backyard, it had a big front porch.  I remember spending many, many nights just sitting on the porch with my [maternal] grandmother [Bessie Norman Weaver] in a swing, you know, she'd talk to me and read stories, or we'd just talk and sat on the, sat on the porch on a, on a hot summer night, you know, often.  And so, that's kind of was my life, was in and around that neighborhood and as kids we grew up playing wiffle ball with our, with the kids, where I was always very big and very good in sports and, we never really thought, you know a whole lot, a whole lot about it.  One of our neighbors, it was again interesting, because one of our neighbors, his name was Athen, A-T-H-E-N, and one of my best friends, his name was Dean Athen, okay, we also went to school with and hung out with, his dad owned a restaurant in town which is still there today.  And, and growing up, my parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones] said it's just known that blacks are not welcome in that restaurant, no black ever went in that restaurant.  And an interesting story, and I knew that all growing up, never in my life, went into that restaurant.  About ten years ago, it's kind of interesting, a TV station did, that they did a national TV program called, it think it was called, 'Excellence In Education,' and they went with me, they spent a lot of time with me here, we also went back to Newark.  I was telling them that story and, and for the first time in my life, ten years ago I decided to go in that restaurant and I even felt kind of funny going in the restaurant then knowing that there was kind of known that that was not a pl- it was known that that was not a place that blacks were welcome in.  And I went in that restaurant and who's running the restaurant today?  Dean Athen.  And of course, you know, he hadn't seen me in years and of course welcomed us and you know, we hugged and we talked and I told him why I was in that restaurant.  And, and because it was always assumed that we couldn't come in there and he said, "You know, I, I honestly don't know if that is true, he said obviously you and I were friends growing up," and, and he said, "It could have been true, he said, "I, I don't know."  But, but that's just the kind of experience that, you know, that we had, you know, around our town but we, you know, I grew up in a very normal kind of a childhood.  On the one hand, it was really kind of a, kind of a, really kind of two elements to it, the people that I grew up with, the kids that I was always friends with, many of which were white because we lived in a white neighborhood, but yeah many of our friends on the other side were black because, in fact, I was friends with my wife [Helen Thompson Jones] when I was ten years old.  Now, her family also lived on the west, on the west side of town as well, but you know, when we had parties and so forth, when we got to be in our early teens, we weren't invited to white parties even though we were all friends, but we were invited to black parties and so, you know, we had house parties at that time, all black kids and so forth and so, but at the same time we went to school with others and we did, you know, we did things, we played sports together with, you know, all the kids in the community then.  And so it was a great neighborhood that I lived in, everybody knew each other, it's like the neighborhood you think from the past, everybody knew each other, everybody kind of looked out for each other. The Mullenixes who were two doors down from us were great friends.  As it turns out, three weeks ago, I called for the first time probably in thirty years, I called Mrs. Mullenix [Mary Baker Mullenix], three weeks ago on a Sunday because her husband Joe [Reverend Joseph Mullenix] just died.  And my dad told me, and, and so I called Mrs., Mrs. Mullenix, Mary, and, and she just was thrilled to hear from me and I said to her, you know, "I just feel like I was kind of part of your family," 'cause they, you know, helped raise me and she said, you know, "Gregory [HistoryMaker Gregory Wayne Jones]," as they all called me back there, she said, "We felt like you were a part of our family too."  And so, that's just kind of, you know, the way, you know the way it was, you know, in the neighborhood and so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was very interesting because, you know, we were kind of multi-dimensional, I guess in one way, you know, we had that sort of a black community that we associated with, went to church with [at Trinity A.M.E. Church, Newark, Ohio], so forth, and then we had the white community that was the neighborhood community that we also, you know associated with and, then but for me too--much of what we did revolved around family, particularly my mom's side of the family we did a lot on my mom's side of the family much more than my dad's side of the family.
Story_ID: 306596
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself growing up?  What was your personality like and, you know, what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: You know, growing up, I was a bit rambunctious, I was a bit, you know, I, I was a kind of kid who never was in trouble but was always around trouble, you know, I was a kind of kid that fell into, you know, prob--doing things that maybe I shouldn't do that, you know, not were necessarily bad things, you know, certainly by today's standards, but, but you know, I was, you know, I, I was always kind of on the edge of, on the edge of trouble, you know.  I remember as a kid, you know we, we broke into a school one time, not to steal anything, we broke into the school because we wanted to play basketball and we couldn't find a place to play basketball so we broke into school at night and we, and the police got us and took us home to our parents and so, you know that, you know that kind of kid.  I, I was--
Speaker 1: How old were you when that happened?
Speaker 2: I was about twelve.  I was always very athletic and so I was involved in a lot of athlete, athletics and I played baseball, I loved playing baseball, I played football, I played basketball, and, and much, my parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones] were close and my dad was my coach, my dad coached me and through most of the things that I did, you know, as a, as a kid.  So, most of the stuff we did evolved, you know, revolved kind of around sports or revolved kind of around family, but at the same time, you know, I was, you know, I was the kid that, you know, got a, you know found mischief, you know a lot and probably more, that's better a description, you know more mischievous, you know than, you know, than anything.  But I was a kid who was I, I, I knew I was a very smart, I knew I was very bright kid, my brother [Brent Jones] as, as well, 'cause I knew things came kind of easy to me, but I also was not a very motivated, you know at that.  I was not a good student in school, not because I couldn't have been because I really just weren't all, wasn't all that interested in it and so, so you know, I went to school and I got kind of okay grades, my mother of course, who was educated was always, always on me about working harder in school and so forth, I was, you know, I, I just was not greatly motivated, my interest was playing sports and playing outside and doing things that I like to do.
Story_ID: 306597
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to grade school?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I went to grade school at a little school called Woodside Elementary School [Newark, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Was this on the north side of [Newark, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: It was on, it was on the west side--
Speaker 1: On the west side--
Speaker 2: We lived on--
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: --We lived on the west side.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Uptown, a school that was 95 percent white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably higher than that actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you said in grade school you weren't that interested in, in school?
Speaker 2: Nah, nah, nah just, you know, I, I did okay. I passed every year, but you know, I didn't work that hard at it.  And so, you know I just, I wasn't that interested in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wh--did you have a favorite subject at all?
Speaker 2: Not really back then, you know, you know like I said, I, my favorite subject was gym class you know, 'cause I liked, 'cause I liked athletic sort of things.  And so, I could hardly wait until gym class rolled around, you know by, by then.
Speaker 1: What were you best at?
Speaker 2: In sports?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was best in baseball, I was, I was a very good baseball player, something that came natural to me and I, and I played a lot.
Speaker 1: Did you have any baseball heroes that you admired in those days that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah two of them, you know I always played from the, every time from the time I was very little played center field and I loved Mickey Mantle and I loved Willie Mays and they kind of became my, you know, two heroes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have any favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know I don't, can't say I had favorite teachers, well you know, I had a teacher by the name of Miss Woodard [ph.] that I'd know, always remembered, not because she was a any great teacher but 'cause she was so good looking and, and I used to just, you know really like her 'cause she was nice to me and she was very, very attractive.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of us had a teacher that.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so you went, you went all eight years in grade school too at--
Speaker 2: Yeah well at that time, at that time you went one through six--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then it went to junior, what was called junior high school, went to Central, Central Junior High School [Newark, Ohio], which was kind of downtown Newark, but still walking distance where we lived, it was more on the west side of town and, so I went, so I went there and I played sports and was an average student and my wife [Helen Thompson Jones], my now wife went there as well, we went there together not as boyfriend and girlfriend so much at that time or two, but we knew each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now, in, in high school you went to Newark High School [Newark, Ohio] right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, was there more than one high school in Newark?
Speaker 2: No there's, there was only one then and there's only one today.  It's one of the few towns of its size that only has one high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a fairly large school I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a large high school, we had a graduating class of, of, well it's a high school that had gosh, probably three thousand students, we had a graduating class of almost seven hundred, so pretty good sized high school.
Story_ID: 306598
Speaker 1: Was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Church was a very big influence on my life, you know, my, my parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones], grandparents, great-grandparents all grew up in the same church, Trinity A.M.E. Church [Newark, Ohio].  We of course went to Sunday school every Sunday without fail, sometimes went to church but mainly went to Sunday school.  And a lot of things that we did were involved around the church, you know?  The church did a lot of things back in those days, we used to go on hay rides and we used to have picnics and we used to go to summer conferences and you know, those kinds of things.  So, the church played a big part in, in all of our lives and my [maternal] grandmother [Bessie Norman Weaver] was a very prominent member of the church and sat at the same pew from the time I was born 'til the time she died and my dad is very active in the church today.
Speaker 1: So your grandmother's father [sic. grandmother's husband, George Weaver] actually built the church you was--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's something and that's, that would be, that would be in the, what do you think?  In the 1880s (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that--
Speaker 1: --or something?
Speaker 2: --was--
Speaker 1: Eighteen seventies [1870s] or '80s [1880s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, yeah that was around 18, shortly after the Civil War so, 18--
Speaker 1: Sixties [1860s]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it might have been 1870s.
Speaker 1: Seventies [1870s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, might have been the 1870s, I forget the exact date that that church was built but it's an old church and my family's been prominent in that church for many, many years.
Story_ID: 306599
Speaker 1: Now in high school did, did you get involved in, now did you play high school sports [at Newark High School, Newark, Ohio] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played high school baseball and I also got involved and I played high school basketball for a couple of years and, and I was a high school wrestler, probably one of the things that influenced me most to kind of turn things around, when I was a sophomore, you know, getting back then you went to ninth grade, junior high [at Central Junior High School, Newark, Ohio] and then you go to tenth grade in high school, unlike today.  I was a very good basketball player, I was an all-city basketball player and, and I wanted to play at the high school and so I went, but Huckworst [ph.] basketball didn't start 'til the, 'til about the winter, so I had the first semester of, of high school at, in the tenth grade and so it was time for tryouts and they told me, "You can't tryout 'cause your grades are too bad."  And so, I wasn't able to tryout because I had bad grades and, and I think I was flunking at least one, maybe two subjects, and the coach came and said, "Sorry, you can't tryout," and, and I never did, so I never played basketba- I never tried out after that but it did kind of force me to get a little more serious about my grades, I kind of got in, my brother [Brent Jones] was a high school wrestler and he, kind of, he was a very good wrestler and he kind of got me interested in that and so, I just said well, I'll just wrestle, so I got my grades better and I just wrestled and of course my primary sport was baseball and so I played baseball in the spring and I wrestled, you know, in the, in the winter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 306600
Speaker 1: So your grades got better you said?
Speaker 2: My grades got better.
Speaker 1: Did you become more interested in any particular subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know I got, there was a teacher that had a great influence on me, his name was Mr. Jones [ph.] as well, white teacher and he taught government and for some reason, you know we just had this connection, he sparked you know an interest in me and, and I was taking government class and he got in me, he got me, you know pretty excited about his class and ultimately then kind of other classes and I started doing better in school.  And probably the thing that maybe changed for me is, in the spring of my senior year, or my junior year, I'm sorry, the spring of my junior year [at Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], I was taking Government II and he, we were going to, kids from the high school were going to take over city government for the day, so it was going to be government for the day, we're actually were gonna go down to city hall and kind of run the city for a day and he convinced me to run for mayor of the town and so, you know, I though well, okay.  So, and I was running against probably the most popular kid in school, his name was Ray Hub [ph.] and he was a great athlete, very popular, very well known in school.  But anyway, I decided to run for mayor and we had a little campaign, as it turns out, I won and I became mayor for the day and I actually went down and I actually you know was in the, work, worked with the mayor and sat in his chair and all of that and that was my first recollection of saying, I really can do some, I really can do some, some important things and that was kind of a turning point, it was kind of a turning point for me in terms of really getting more serious about my education and really getting involved in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well did you f--
Speaker 2: --things other than just sports.
Speaker 1: Did you find out you were more popular than you thought you were or?
Speaker 2: You know, I, yeah, I did that, although I was always a pretty popular kid at school, I knew that and I was always fairly popular too.  But, beyond that it really, it really helped me realize that, you know, maybe I have a greater capability than I think.  And what I really came to realize is that sometimes, people see more in you than you see in, in your--yourself and that's clearly I think was an example for me that, that this teacher saw more in me than I saw in myself.
Speaker 1: Now wh--when you were in school did you have black teachers in, in Newark [Ohio] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No black teachers, there's no black teachers in the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that we went to.  High school was 90 percent white and the, 'cause the town is 90 percent white and, but they were all very nurturing they, you know, they, it, it's amazing, there was a, I wish, in fact I probably do have this where, in fact I know I do have it.  In my, in my office here, they did an article in the local newspaper about seven or eight years ago, which is really kind of amazing, a town of fifty thousand people in Newark, Ohio, the number of prominent African Americans that have come out of that school, doctors and lawyers like my [maternal] uncle [Robert Weaver], teachers, executives like myself, my, I have a very good friend who's up at Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] who was a professor and, and ultimately was the president of Amnesty International [Amnesty International USA].
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Charles Henry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, but the number of the people that have African Americans that have found suc--enormous success is amazing for a town the size of, you know, of Newark.  And, and it's because number one the education is so good there, the education was so good there and it was really an environment that, you know, there was an expectation of all of us, whether you were black or white that you learn and that you do well, you know and that you succeed.
Story_ID: 306601
Speaker 1: In high school [Newark High School, Newark, Ohio], so you were elected mayor of, the situation in your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I was elected, I was elected mayor of the town [Newark, Ohio], mayor for a day of the town.
Speaker 1: And, anything else significant from, from high school?  How was?  Wh--when you, did you think in high school that you were going to go to college or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know I, you know, I thought at that time that I would probably be a professional baseball player, you know I was probably that good, I was that good.
Speaker 1: Did scouts come out to check out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes scouts did and I, you know, I, I did a couple of tryouts, I ended up, I ended up having to short circuit a baseball career because of a baby.  But ultimately in high school I played high school baseball, I was an all-state baseball player, I thought I was going to, I thought I was going to maybe go to college, play baseball, ultimately I was offered a chance to do that at the University of Toledo [Toledo, Ohio], but foolishly decided I didn't want to go to Toledo, nobody else would offer me a scholarship 'cause my grades weren't good, they weren't good enough and so, so I ended my, you know hi--you know, high school career and, and my grades really were only good enough--Ohio State [The Ohio State University] had a bra--they, they had a system of branch campuses and still do until this day.  That's really the only place that I really couldn't kind of get into because my grades, my history, all of my grades had gotten much better after my senior, my history grades were not all that good, I was able to get into Ohio State because every in state student, assuming, you know, you've got a C average could get into Ohio State, that was the way it was at that time.  So I was able to get in, I was able to get in there and, but they didn't have a baseball team so--
Speaker 1: So, so when you graduated from high school in '66 [1966]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-seven, '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven, '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Six--sixty-seven, '67 [1967].  The most significant thing of course, in high school, was that, you know, my wife [Helen Thompson Jones] and I began dating our senior year, we were named the cutest couple back then, we dated for a couple of years, you know we had known each other, we'd, we had actually know each other since we were seven years old.  But never really dated, kind of, well we dated a little bit when we were in junior high, but not a lot, we went to the same church [Trinity A.M.E. Church, Newark, Ohio], we, you know, we were friends and, but then we became boyfriend, girlfriend in high school at, when we were juniors in high school and, and my wife was very smart and she could go on to really a lot of schools, she chose mainly for financial reasons, to also go to the branch campus of Ohio State.  So, we both went there together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the, the--
Speaker 2: What's that?
Speaker 1: What was the name of that branch?
Speaker 2: It was called Ohio State University Newark [The Ohio State University at Newark, Newark, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they have, Ohio State has a, 'cause it's such a large school system of, of branch campuses all over the state.  So, it was Ohio State University, but it wasn't at the main campus.
Speaker 1: Okay so, OSU Newark?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I played--
Speaker 1: So, you went there--
Speaker 2: --basketball there I was a good athlete and I played basketball for OSU Newark.
Speaker 1: This is in '67 [1967], right?  Okay.  So how long did you stay at the branch campus?
Speaker 2: I stayed there for about a year and a half.
Story_ID: 306602
Speaker 1: As it turned out, my wife [Helen Thompson Jones], she wasn't my wife then, got pregnant, and so we decided, 1968, that was in 1968, we decided to get married. Now we kept going to school [at The Ohio State University at Newark, Newark, Ohio] a little bit after that.  But, I needed to have a job to support my new son [Brian Jones] and my now family and so I, my wife as it turns out, was able to get a job a State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] before I did.  And she called one day and said, well I, I have to back up, she, she actually was working for State Farm before we got married and, and, is that right?  I think she got mar- I think she was working for State Farm before we got married.  Anyway, she called me one day and said, "You know they're looking for some black people over here at State Farm," because I was working for a car dealer at the time, "And you ought to come over here and apply."  And we actually weren't married then, and, 'cause that was in about February of 1968 that I first went to State Farm.  And so I went and applied and got a job and so I started st- I started at State Farm, so both of us worked at, both of us worked at State Farm at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what did you do when you started at State Farm--
Speaker 1: When I started, you know, I was like a records clerk, working in, in, in file, you know, I was a file clerk essentially.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Wasn't, wasn't, you know, I was kind of dabbling around in school, but I again was not all that motivated, you know, and I was just interested in nothing, plus we had a son and, you know, a new son and all that--

Speaker 1: Probably the one event that changed my life the most happened about three years after that.  My wife [Helen Thompson Jones] worked for State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] also, and sh--at State Farm we had several divisions so, she worked in what was called the West Virginia Division and they did business for the State of West Virginia, well the West Virginia Division decided they were going to move from Newark, Ohio, to Frederick, Maryland, and, and they wanted to know did people want to come to Frederick, Maryland, because they needed employees in Frederick, Maryland, and asked people who wanted to go.
Speaker 2: And there's an obvious question here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Why would, why didn't the West Virginia branch have its offices in West Virginia (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Because we didn't have, you know, we didn't have, at that time, the offices served multiple states as they do today and so at that time we served Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, and so we served a number--
Speaker 2: And so it was a regional office?
Speaker 1: So it was a regional office, right.  It was called the Ohio Regional Office.  And, and so anyway, they asked people, who's interested in going to Frederick, Maryland?  We had already hardly ever left Ohio, but w- we were married now and she said, you know?  We talked about it and said let's try it, you know?  It may be good to get out of Newark, we spent our whole life in Newark.
Speaker 2: So that, this is what year?
Speaker 1: This was in 1971.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we said okay.  So they, they gathered all the employees could sign up, anybody was interested in going to Frederick, Maryland, you go there and you get there on, "Oh you can go over the weekend if you want, you know there's gonna be a big meeting on Monday, where the executives of the Frederick, Maryland office are going to meet with the prospective employees and talk about, you know, how great this place was and do you want to come," and this, that and the other.  So, and they gave us a car, you know, a State Farm car, so they gave us a car and they said, you drive over to Maryland which is about an eight hour drive, see if you like it.  So we decided we'd go over on Friday and kind of check this place out.  So we dr- get in the car, we drive to Frederick, Maryland and we get there and we went to a Holiday Inn and we said, "We need to have a room," well there were no cars in the parking lot really, the guy at the Holiday Inn said, "We don't have any rooms, we're full."  We said, "Okay," so we didn't think too much about it, we went to another hotel across the street, called the Red Horse Inn [Comfort Inn Red Horse, Frederick, Maryland], we said, "We need to have a room," the guys said, "We don't have any rooms, we're all full."  We went to a third hotel, same thing happened.  And I think we went to a fourth, and same thing happened, we didn't know what to do, we were in a place we had never been, we never, again, left Ohio, they did--all gave us a name and a phone number of an executive who was in Maryland who was going to be meeting us.  Not knowing what to do, and being young and foolish enough not to know that, you know, I probably shouldn't call the executive on the weekend, I ge- I said, "Well I've got this guy's number, his name is Charl--Charlie Snyder [Charles Snyder], I'll call him up."  So, I get on a pay phone and I call this Charlie Snyder, I said, "Mr. Snyder, my name is Greg Jones [HistoryMaker Gregory Wayne Jones], I know you don't know me, my wife and I are here to, you know, come to the office on Monday," I think this was actually Saturday, "Come to the office on Monday, and meet you but we can't find a hotel room or, we can't seem to get a place rented."  And Charlie Snyder, who's an old southern gentleman, he came from Virginia, southern Virginia, and he said, "Well, where are you?"  And we told him.  He said, "You stay right where you are." About fifteen minutes later, up comes this yellow Cadillac and it's Mr. Snyder, he introduced his self, "I apologize for that, get in the car with me."  So, we get in the car, he takes us to a hotel downtown, it's called the Francis Scott Key Hotel [Francis Scott Key Apartments, Frederick, Maryland]. It's there today, Frederick, Maryland.  And he says, "These, these people need a room," the guy at Francis Scott Key Hotel says, "Sorry sir we don't have any rooms," and he said, "No, you don't understand, I, I'm State Farm executive, these people are State Farm, they need a room," the guys said, "Sir, we do not have any rooms."  And so, he kind of huffed and said, "Come on with me," I remember we walked, I'll never forget this, this little janitor in there, he was mopping the floor as we walk, 'cause it was getting late now, as we walked by him, he said, "They don't rent rooms to colored people in here," (laughter).
Speaker 2: This was a black guy?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, it was a black guy.  And, so we get in the car and we go to this little strip kind of, kind of a motel that, you know, just has a door, about four or five doors, facing outside and we go up there and he says, "These guys need a room," and they, they let us have a room, so we got a room.  So ultimately he said, "Look, I apologize for that, it's not what our town should be." He said, "Because you guys went through all this, I want, tell you what I wanna do, I want you to come in tomorrow," which is Sunday, "and I'll meet with you before all these other people come in and we'll talk a little bit."
Story_ID: 306604
Speaker 1: So my wife [Helen Thompson Jones] and I, we went in there Sunday, we met him [Charles Snyder] and he takes us in his office, we sat in his office, and I thought it was the biggest office I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never seen anything like that, you know?  As it seemed to be at that time.  And so he started talking to us and he said, "You're, you know, you're interested in working here," and we said, "Yeah, we came this way, we'd like to get a job."  And I remember he--and my wife was with the division that was moving, so she was gonna get a job, so I, you know, I, I needed to have some kind of a job, I needed, I worked in a different department and he asked me, he said, "Well, and you want a job here too?"  I said, "Yes sir."  He said, "What kind of job do you want?  Do you want a stand up job or a sit down job?  Because I have a stand up job filing," I said, "Well, I want a sit down job," and he said, "Okay."  So, he said, "Let's, let me show you around this office here," so he gets up, shows us around the office, he comes back, he sits down and he says, "I've been thinking about this while we were doing this walking," and he said, "I've decided," and then he, you know, he'd asked us all about our self and, you know, and yet he knew, you know, we hadn't finished, I hadn't finished college and, and he knew a lot about us, because we spent about two hours before we went for this walk.  And he brings us back in there and, I'll never forget he said, he said, "I'll tell you what," he said, "I'm not gonna give you a job here," and of course we were shocked, you know?  'Cause we really, we'd gotten to the point, we thought yeah, we want to do this, he said, "No, I'm not gonna give you a job here, I'm not--I don't think that's the right thing."  He said, "Let me tell you," he says, he looked at me and he said, "You're a bright young man, I can tell that," he says, "I think you could have a future in this company if you just got serious and went back to school and got your education."  And I said, "Oh."  "That's what I want you, I want you to do yourself and me a favor, go back and do that and get serious," and so, we were devastated, we got in the car and we drive eight hours back to Ohio and, you know, feeling like, hell, he's just like all the rest of the people in this town [Frederick, Maryland], you know, he didn't wanna give us a job, just because we're black I guess.  And so, you know, we drove all the way back, we got back and, you know, I was steaming for a couple of days, my wife, being as wise as she is, she said, "You know?  He was right," she said, "If we are ever gonna have a future, if we are ever gonna do, you know, anything in, in our lives and get out of Newark [Ohio]," said, "You've gotta go finish your education and get serious and all that."  And of course we had our son at that time, she said, "I'll take care of Brian [Brian Jones]," who's our youngest, our oldest son, our only son at that time, "You go back and finish school."  And so, reluctantly I said, "Okay."  Ohio State [The Ohio State University at Newark, Newark, Ohio] where we both had gone really didn't quite work because they didn't have an evening com--program because I still had to work.  I talked to the people at State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] and unbeknownst to me, he had talked to the people at State Farm in Ohio and told them that, you know, I'm somebody he thought might have a future.  State Farm said, "Look, you work full time, which I did, and we'll pay for you to go to school at night if you're willing to do it."  So there was a new university, it actually was the ol- it started out as a part of Ohio State, and it was designed for, it was designed for adult students and they initially called it, you know, a university within a university, they ultimately split it off to be a private university called, Franklin University [Columbus, Ohio], and, and that's the school that offered what I needed.  They offered school at night, on the weekends, while you were working, 'cause it was kind of for adults.  So, I went there and I went to work, I worked full time, five days a week every day, and I went to school three nights a week from seven to ten o'clock at night and all day on Saturday and Sunday for three years.  And to get my, you know, to get my education.  And so, ultimately I did, I graduated summa cum laude from, from Franklin University in 1975, and about two weeks after I graduated, State Farm came and said, "We have a job for you in our headquarters in Bloomington, Illinois, we'd like you to consider taking," in--
Speaker 2: What was your degree in, I mean?
Speaker 1: My, my degree was in business.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Story_ID: 306605
Speaker 1: And so that was--kind of started my career.  They offered me a job in Bloomington [Illinois], our headquarters, in our human resource department, they wanted me to help start a minority intern program for State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, Bloomington, Illinois] that we'd recruit students from all over the country to come to State Farm, black students.  And so, I literally, within a month after I graduated [from Franklin University, Columbus, Ohio], moved to Bloomington, my family actually followed me later.  And then my seconds, before I, before they moved my second son [Derek Jones] was born.  And so, I did that and I was there for about a year and a half and my boss came and said, said, "This kind of comes from out of the air, I don't know how this happens." But he says, "They are, they want you to take a job, a promotion in Frederick, Maryland, and there's a man there by the name of Charlie Snyder [Charles Snyder], who wants you to come and work for him."  And so, I found out that it was through all these year--I didn't know this at the time, through all those years, he kind of followed me and he kind of followed what I was doing and when the opportunity came, he brought me to Frederick, Maryland and I worked for him and that's sort of where my whole career started.  And, and he was, you know, he was, was my mentor, you know at that time, and he was the person that really kind of, you know helped me get on the, on the right track at State Farm and, and I'm where I am today in large part because of him.  All because I told people, you know, not only did he change, you know, a career really changed my life, because you know, had it not been for that, I doubt that I would have gone back and you done the things that I did.  So, that was probably the, a life changing event, you know, for me because of, because of him.
Speaker 2: And that's a remarkable story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Snyder?
Speaker 1: S--S-N-Y-D-E-R.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: S-N-Y-D-E-R.
Speaker 2: I just asked, 'cause there's two ways (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he's still around, he's, he's moved, in fact I just found out he moved to Virginia and, you know, one of the things I've said I'm gonna do a 100 times, is most, because I did talk to him from time to time, mostly lately is, again call him and talk to him and tell him thank you but, you know, as I, he always kind of followed me and, and when I became, when I got the title of president and CEO of State Farm [State Farm General Insurance Company], which was about four years ago, you know, Charlie Snyder is eighty-four years old now, I got a, I got a little note card from him, and o- only thing he said in this notecard was, "I'm not surprised," Charlie Snyder.  And so, you know, he's somebody that even through, I mean he's been retired from State Farm for many years, even through the years, he's just kind of, somehow sort of looked over my shoulder.
Speaker 2: Well you made a good impression, if, if you had not called him on that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --which in retrospect, you think is in--inappropriate but--
Speaker 1: Well I mean, I think, you know, I, I thought, you know, in retrospect I thought, you know, I, I didn't know th- he certainly didn't think it was inappropriate, but, you know in retrospect, gosh, you know somebody that was kind of a nobody in the company and just calling this important vice president, you know out of the blue, to say, you know, I need your help.  But that, you know, that impression on me and, that's you know, that, that has impacted me not just in my career but it really has impacted me in terms of things that I do in, in and out of State Farm.
Story_ID: 306606
Speaker 1: Before we started the interview, we were looking at photos, and there was one shot of State Farm executives and I kind of jokingly said, which one is you and (laughter) you're the only one with an afro, the only black one there.  Now, you've and you've said that that was the case most of the time right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was really, you know, as one of the articles that I showed you said, you know, I was probably the first black everything at State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company].  You know when I came on board in 1968, there weren't a whole lot of blacks there and more and more came on after that but, I became the first black division manager which is a senior management person in State Farm, I became the first black executive at State Farm, which at that time, and it's the same job that Charlie Snyder [Charles Snyder] had, called deputy regional vice president which was the number two person in the region, the number two executive, I became the first black deputy regional vice president in State Farm back in 1988, I became the first regional vice president, which is the number one job in State Farm back in 1993, I became the first, I became the first and only still president and CEO of any of State Farm's affiliates.  We have, State Farm is a parent company, we have four affiliate companies such that they are separate companies from the parent, one in Florida [State Farm Florida Insurance Company], one in California [State Farm General Insurance Company], one in Texas [State Farm County Mutual Insurance Company of Texas] and one in New Jersey [State Farm Indemnity Company].  State Farm, California is by far the biggest of our affiliates and it's the biggest market in State Farm.  And, and back in 19-, when I became regional vice president in the 1993, we actually had three regional offices in California for many years, one in northern California, where I was the deputy regional vice president, one in this area and one further south in, in Southern California.  So we had those, we had three regional vice presidents, and when I became regional vice president in '93 [1993], I was one of three.  In 1998, our chairman, CEO decided we needed to have a single leadership in California, we needed to have a one California, one person running all of California, although it was by far our biggest market and it's by far our biggest, you know, we have, it's, it's, it's really almost about one fifth of State Farm, California.  But at any rate, 1998, he asked me to assume that responsibility, at that time, they were calling me vice president dash California, but essentially what I was doing is, because at that time we had twenty-five regional vice presidents around the country that ran regions and so to kind of distinguish me from that, in 1998, I took over all of California as vice president of California.  Then we, about 1990, we started the process in '98 [1998], and in '99 [1999], we made California kind of a separate company, and when we made California a separate company, then I assumed the title of president and CEO of the California company which is called, State Farm General Insurance Company.
Story_ID: 306607
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Has it been, difficult, you know being the only one, or has it been fairly--
Speaker 2: You I, I, I frankly, I've not, you know, I've experienced same things, you know, I guess that everybody experiences, you know, some prejudices I guess and biases, some subtle, not subtle, but, not to the extent frankly that I ever really felt like it held me back and not to the extent that I ever thought about it a lot.  You know, I always just kind of felt like the, you know, as my parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones] told me, "You've got to be the best at what you do," you know, when I came up, I came up in an era where, probably most black parents told their kids, you know, "You've got to be better, you've got to be twice as good as the white, as the white guys," that's what they told me constantly.  "You have to be twice as good as the white kids if you're going to succeed," and that may not have been true, but what it doe- did do is, is instill this, you know, work ethic that you, you know, that you, you've got work twice as hard as everybody else and I probably did that, you know?  I spent a lot of my time working and I, you know, what I've said to myself, I'm never, what I say to other people when they ask me, the key to success, and there's lots of them I guess, but I always said to myself, I'm never going to let State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] tell me, that I can't do something because I didn't work hard enough or I can't do something because, because I didn't do the things I needed to do, you know to succeed, I'm, I, I wanna do everything I need to do and more, you know?  And if I don't succeed then it's not gonna be for those reasons, it's gonna be for some other, some other reason.  That's and that's kind of what I've always sort of tried to do.
Story_ID: 306608
Speaker 1: How has the climate changed at State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] in terms of black employees?  Are there many more now than there were percentage wise (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, I mean, I, I give State Farm a tremendous amount of credit because State Farm just like the industry in general, and like many fortune 500 companies in general, they're ver- very conservative company.  When I started at State Farm, State Farm was very conservative, there was a point in State Farm just where we wouldn't even insure black people much less hire them.  That, that's a sad fact, but it, it is a fact.  But I would say that, you know, State Farm, sometimes awkwardly, sometimes awkwardly but, but realize even as far back as the '60s [1960s], that we needed to, we needed to be a different kind of a company and back in the '60s [1960s], began really seeking out African Americans and that time it was primarily African Americans, you know to join the company and, and be a little more reflective of, you know, of this country.  And so, State Farm in some ways was progressive and some ways awkwardly, I remember when I went back to Bloomington [Illinois], to build this minority intern program [Summer Minority Intern Program], we started a program and I was one of the three people that taught a program, it was actually developed by some other guy, two other black guys were brought on, they were, they, one came out of Rutgers University [The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey], and another came out of the University of Minnesota [Minneapolis, Minnesota], and they wanted, State Farm wanted to develop a program to sensitize all these primarily white people about the presence of black people in the organization.  So we could, they created a program and three of us went all over the country, and every State Farm employee was required to take this program, every State Farm management person was required to take this program, this program is called, Managing the Minority Employee.  Now, when I show people that today, they are aghast, you mean we have a program called, Managing the Minority Employee and you know, even when I go back and look at it today, you know, I, you know, I you know, I look at it with some amusement, because I remember, you know, it was, it was, an attempt to really get people to understand, you know, African Americans and their cultures different now, this would change the environment and this that and the other.  I remember as an example, you know they had, they had a little glossary of terms that we gave people and it had black terms in it, you know?  It'd say things like, I remember one of them saying crib dash house, (laughter) you know, so that people knew, presumably what black people are, how they're going to be talking, and things like that.  And it had some quizzes in it and this, this sort of thing and it started out, the first thing we did, we'd, we'd get in front of a group of people and this was the first thing you would say, "Good morning, my name's Greg Jones [HistoryMaker Gregory Wayne Jones], and I'm a nigger."  That's how it started.  Now the intent of that was to get people's attention, number one and then to say, now let's analyze what I just said.  And then you go into all that: why do people use this term and why, you know, why is that degrading and that, that whole kind of thing, you look back on it, now you kind of flinch, you know, like you just did.  But it was State Farm's first attempt to really begin to sensitize people that this organization was going to be different.
Speaker 1: That kind of follows a pattern that, [HistoryMaker] Timuel Black, who interviewed, he's a historian of Chicago [Illinois], he talks about when he was in the [U.S.] Army at World War II [WWII]. There was a manual his commander was reading called, 'How to'--'How to Manage the Negro Officer' [ph.] or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've got the book back in my credenza, I'll show it to you, it's, it's very, it's very interesting.
Story_ID: 306609
Speaker 1: State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, Bloomington, Illinois] now, one of your jobs in the, at State Farm was to help recruit the minorities (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Was to create a, we actually created the first minority intern program at any major corporation becau- and I know that because we were asked by a number of corporations.  I went to Bank of America, I went to, I went to, what was the name of that company?  It's not even around, T.W--not T.W., shoot the airlines that went out--
Speaker 1: TWA [Trans World Airlines]?
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Pan Am [Pan American World Airways]?
Speaker 2: Pan Am.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And several others, we went to, to ha- to show them how we created a minority intern program [Summer Minority Intern Program] and we created this program and we went and we recruited at about thirty-five black colleges [HBCUs] all over the country and brought students into Bloomington, Illinois, in the summer as minority interns and with the hopes of them coming back and working full time with State Farm and, and then having a career at State Farm.  In fact, one of those people that I recruited is one of my vice presidents today, and she came out of Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], she's up in Northern California.
Speaker 1: That's something.  So you can look back and see the, a trail of success.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, there are a number of those people that still work for, still work for State Farm today.
Speaker 1: Now, having, you know pioneered that program, like what, and looking back at it from this, the vantage point you have now, like what works best in terms of recruiting?
Speaker 2: Who were the what?
Speaker 1: What works best in terms of recruiting?
Speaker 2: You know I, I think what we found, what works the best is really, at that time, you know when you, we went on the black college campuses, it wasn't, it, it was difficult in one sense but not difficult in another sense of it.  It, it was difficult because we were trying to take these kids in the South, they were Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Southern [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Grambling [Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] and Mississippi st--, the Alabama--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) State?
Speaker 2: --A & M [Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University, Normal, Alabama], and yeah, Alcorn State [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] and all those places, we were trying to convince them to come to Bloomington, Illinois in the Midwest, small town, all though that many of them from small towns as well and that was difficult to get people to, they qu-, "Why would I wanna go way up to, north, up to the Midwest?"  It wasn't, it was easy in a way that, you know when we went on the campus, and they looked at us, we were the successful black men, we were all men at that time, successful black men wearing nice clothes and had jobs and, you know worked for a big corporation and people just gravitated, you know, to that.  And so, you know, I think what we were able to sell really was, we worked for a, what we felt at that time, was a progressive organization, probably wasn't as progressive as we would've liked to think that it was, I know that it wasn't but, but you know, it was an organization that was reaching out to black kids.  They did a big article in, I'll never forget, in The Black Collegian magazine, which still exist today, about State Farm and how it's progressive in attracting black students to come to their intern program and so it be, we got to be very well known on the college campuses and we came to town, we typically had more people to interview than we had time to interview.  And so, you know our reputation preceded us somewhat, we got some validation from a magazine like, Black Collegian magazine, and we had something to sell, we had, we had jobs and potential careers, even though they happened to be in Bloomington, Illinois.
Story_ID: 306610
Speaker 1: And today now, the position you hold today is, I mean, what are your responsibilities, sir?
Speaker 2: You know, I hold two titles of course, I hold a title with the parent company [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, Bloomington, Illinois] and I have some responsibilities to the parent company, and my primary responsibility is to, is, is as any CEO responsibilities to run this company in California.  If, if, if State Farm General Insurance Company were a stand-alone company, we're kind of a stand-alone company but we're under the umbrella of the State Farm parent company, we'd be about the seventh largest insurance company in the United States.  So, we're not a small, this is not a small company, this is essentially, you know a very big company and, and we're a big company that at one time when I first started had almost ten thousand employees and agents.  Today, because we've done some downsizing and re-organizing, we're at about seventy-five hundred employees and, employees and agents.  But you know, my responsibilities, just like any other CEO and that is to, to create success, profit and growth for our organization.
Story_ID: 306611
Speaker 1: What are some of the highlights, I guess, of your career here, I guess?
Speaker 2: You know, I've had a lot, I guess a lot of highlights in my career, everything back to, you know, one of the things that I just talked about I'm most proud of is creating this minority intern program [Summer Minority Intern Program] which has legacy to it because, you know, it was so many people, a number of people in State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, Bloomington, Illinois] today, came through our minority intern program, many of them have risen to very high ranks in the company.  And so, that's something that, you know I'm very proud of and something that's, you know, clearly was, was a highlight in my career.  When I came to California in 1988, I really came, you know trying to create something, trying to create a model, this was kind of, sort of post, in a way, kind of post affirmative action, at least focus on affirmative action, I really came to try to really create a climate at State Farm [State Farm General Insurance Company] and certainly in California, again I was at the number two job at that time where I tried to create a climate where everybody had an equal opportunity to succeed.  And, and frankly where a lot of people weren't advantaged or disadvantaged, and tried to figure out a way, is there a way that we can kind of create a level playing field so that no one can say, but for I am this, I would be able to succeed.  I can't succeed because I'm black, I can't succeed because I'm a woman, I can't succeed because I'm a white male.  You know, what I tried to do is really create an environment where, if you are willing to do the things that need to be done to succeed, then you have an equal opportunity to succeed as a person sitting on either side of you and that's easier said than done obviously, 'cause it wasn't always a level playing field.  You had to work at kind of seeing if we could do to make this a level playing field and, and, and make sure that as, as we created opportunities that people were in fact getting equal consideration, you know, for opportunities and that sort of thing (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 306612
Speaker 1: Are cultural differences still a big issue?  Now you were talking about, you know, the glossary being passed around, so that sort of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is that still an issue?
Speaker 2: I think cultural differences are always gonna be an issue, I don't think they're certainly nearly as big an issue as they once were and I think California is a different kind of a climate.  I'm not sure we could have created in Ohio what we, I think, have created in California because I think, you know, I think, you know the whole over all kind of climate and environment in, in California is much more open to that kind of thing.  Certainly in the time when we were trying to do it, then it is in many other, many other places.  But I would be, you know, I'd be in denial if I didn't say, that those, there still aren't, you know those issues and there still aren't issues of, you know, of cultural differences and understandings and you know, and all, and misunderstandings and all of those kinds of things, I think that still plays some part in it.  But I think what has happened here in California to a large degree over the last fifteen years, we've really worked hard at creating this climate where people feel like and I think, if you talk to people at State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company, Bloomington, Illinois], you wouldn't get many people who feel like, I can't succeed because I'm black, or I can't succeed because I'm a woman or I can't succeed because, you know, whatever reason.  You know, people do know that, you know, I may not succeed if I don't do all the things that need to be done to succeed and, but that's the case whether I'm black or white or male or female yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell me this, have you ever been tempted to leave State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] for some other post (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah on numerous occasions, you know?  I, you know I obviously have been offered opportunities to do other things.  Probably, there have been several times, but, but, but two that stick out of my mind, way back when I was in Pennsylvania, and this was before I became what we call a division manager, which is a very important senior management job here.  I was, I was brought to Pennsylvania to do some training, you know, they saw me kind of as a high potential person and they wanted me to go through all this different kind of training which I did, but that training took a lot longer than what I felt it should, I felt like I was far more ready and I really felt like I was kind of getting lost and I really felt like I was, I'd really felt like I had a whole lot more to contribute than what they were asking me to contribute and I really felt like, you know, maybe this thing wasn't gonna work for me and, and, I was offered a job with another insurance company in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I was very close to taking that job and as it turned out the vice president of that company was somebody that I knew from Ohio, from Newark [Ohio], worked in the Newark office, he was down in Philadelphia, I was very close to it.  But ultimately, you know I, I really felt like things are gonna work out you know for me here, it's still a great company, which it is, I still felt like, you know my opportunity will come, my time will come, well that was a hard decision to make and I finally decided to do it, and so I fi- I decided to stay, I mean, and so I stayed and you know of course, you know, from time to time I hear from people all the time, you know who  would like me to do this or do that or join this company and so forth.  But frankly, State Farm's a company I believe in, State Farm's a company I've invested a lot in and if it were a co- if it were a company I didn't feel good about, or a company I didn't feel or offered for not just me but all its people the kinds of, the kinds of, of opportunities and environment that I felt good about then I might think more seriously about that, but I don't feel that way.
Story_ID: 306614
Speaker 1: Tell me, we always ask this question, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community in general?
Speaker 2: You know, my hope is that somehow we as an African American community can reach back, that we can reach back and recapture some of the values that I grew up with.  I know that's difficult to do in, you know today's kind of, kind of environment, not just in the black community but in, in the community at large.  But you know, I grew up at time where it was assumed that people would work hard, it was assumed that people would try to be the best that they could be, it was assumed that people would take care of their families, it was assumed that people would respect themselves and others.  Some of those values we have seemed to have eroded, they've eroded in the larger community but they certainly eroded in our community in the black community to a, a, a disappointing degree.  And I think, if we could go back, and I don't know how to do this but to recapture some of that, that is for me, is, is the foundation of our future, if we can recapture some of that.  My, my greatest concern is how do we do that when we are allowing the deterioration of, of the education of our children to occur, for me I wasn't, it, it took some things for me to get greatly interested in my education, but the education system was there if I wanted to take advantage of it, it was even there for me as a black kid if I wanted to take advantage of it, a good education system.  Today, our education system is broken, you know, we live in a, in a society and a country wh- that as it relates to education that serves some kids very well and other kids very poorly and the kids that are served very poorly are those kids who, number one, are children of color and number two, that are, are kids without means.  And somehow, and this is, this is really what I'm spending all of my time on today, outside of State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company], we've got to find a way to recapture, you know that, and, and find that same foundation of education that I grew up with.  Today, sadly to say, you've read about this I'm sure, we had this incredible as they call it, achievement gap, the gap between the achievement of, of, of primarily white and Asian kids, and kids with means versus African American, Hispanic kids and kids without means.  And the achievement gap is tremendous and frankly today, I spend most of my time outside of State Farm working at finding ways to narrow the achievement gap because our future frankly as a people, I believe, is, is, is tied very tightly to the education of our kids.  And if we're not able to do that, then we're looking again at years and years of further deterioration of our community.

Speaker 1: Now tell us about the program, I saw it in your office, an article about Achievement Matters, is that the name of it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Achievement Matters is a program that State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] and myself together helped create.  Initially, back in 1995, and initially we created it to start out as kind of an awareness program to, to say to kids who were live--who were and still are to some degree living in kind of an anti-achievement culture where, you know, it's not cool to do well in school, you know it's not cool to achieve.  I really felt it was necessary to have something that said to kids, achievement matters, your achievement does matter, we need for you to achieve in the classroom and outside of the classroom.  So we started the program.  I went to Dallas, Texas and I visited with a, a very poor school in Texas, Roosevelt High School [Franklin D. Roosevelt High School and Academy of Health Sciences, Dallas, Texas] I believe it was in Dallas, Texas and I spent the day with students there and we talked about opportunities and we talked about the need to achieve and we talked about education, why it's important.  And there is a group of those students that I worked primarily with, ten students and we spent all day together.  None of those students had ever, none of those students families had ever been to college, moth--many of them had not finished high school.  These kids wanted to learn, they wanted to succeed and we talked about that and, you know, I'm really proud of that, that out of those ten kids, eight of them went to college, five of them that I know of have graduated from, from college, most of which, and one of 'em worked for State Farm, most of which I stay in touch with or they stay in touch, you know, with me.  And so, I think, you know, it, it takes each and every one of us to kind of reach back and now one of the challenges I think we have today is finding ways to share the lessons we've learned.
Speaker 1: That leads right into 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.].  Now you were the founder of the Northern California chapter of 100 Black Men right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly. Yes.  Yes.  And, again part of that interest was the same thing.  It was 100 Black Men.  We needed a way to reach out to African American kids who were struggling and, and w- I knew and I felt that us as business professionals had something to offer and, and I had heard about this organization because organizations started before me, 100 Black Men of America.  And, and it started actually in New York [New York], a number of years ago, but I felt we needed an organization like that in Northern California because we weren't reaching our kids whose many of which are struggling in schools.  So, I formed this organization, got a lot of other people interested in it and all of that and we formed the 100 Black Men with the intent of being mentors and counselors and even fathers to, you know some, some of these kids, not just male kids, male and female kids.  And to help them see the opportunities and we all, we kind of adopted some kids, we adopted a whole school back there and I, I, I, the first young man I worked with na- a young man by the name of Toby Kane [ph.].  Toby came from a family, his mother was on drugs and getting ready to go to prison, his father was dead, he lived with his grandmother who was raising I think nine of her grandchildren from other of her kids who had just kind of abandoned the kids.  Toby was in ninth grade he had a point zero seven grade point average, basically he was told, you know, you need to go join the [U.S.] Army and, if you can, bright kid though, I could tell that.  Toby and I, I spent a lot of time with him and, you know I'm proud of him because his grades started to get better, it got to the point, he went to high school and he graduated from high school with a, with a two point three average and, and we stayed in touch and about four years ago, or it was longer than that, about seven, eight years ago, I got a call from Toby Kane that said, "Will you come to my graduation from college?"  He graduated from Occidental College [Los Angeles, California] and now he's got a job working in the retail business as I recall.  But again, you know it's just, it's just, there are so many kids I've found that just need somebody to take interest in them, that's all.
Story_ID: 306616
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done this, thus far, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: You know, I can't think, you know, things I would do different.  I've been very blessed, I mean I made a lot of mistakes you know earlier on, you know?  I had a family very early in life, I mean I had a, I had a first kid [Brian Jones] at nineteen, my wife [Helen Thompson Jones] was eight--was eighteen and, you know we probably could have done some other things but, I mean, as it turns out, you know that was, you know clearly very much, you know a bl- a blessing for us.  And so, you know, people ask me that and I can't honestly say, you know, I, I can think of things that I would, you know, do different, some things I guess I could do better, but do differently, I don't know.  I mean, I, I think that what I've done probably as unconsciously, and consciously, is kind of carried on, sort of the legacy in that my parents [Mildred Weaver Jones and Gordon Jones], you know started you know?  You know, I was with my kids as my parents were with me, they, they kind of expected me to do well, they expected me to succeed, all though I disappointed them sometimes in my early, earlier days, they expected that I, you know, I was gonna get an education, even though I wasn't as diligent at it, you know early as, you know, they thought I should be, but ultimately I was.  And, you know, I, but, you know they were there for me, you know, I was fortunate to be raised by two parents that were in my life, that did everything that I did, they came to my games and supported me, the you know, they cheered me on, and see both, while I was younger and even older.  And the same things happened with my kids, now I have two kids who, you know are very well educated, my oldest son of course has kind of carried out the legacy of education of my family because he became, he was appointed by President George Bush [President George Walker Bush] as the general counsel to the U.S. Department of Education.  And, and so when we went to his confirmation, you had to have a senator confirmation hearing for that job, I had a conversation with Senator Ted Kennedy [Edward M. Kennedy] afterwards and said, he was confirmed unanimously, and he said that the thing that impressed everyone on the committee is his kind of legacy of education for all the way from his great-grandmother, all the way, you know through his, his family.  And, and my youngest son [Derek Jones] is also very educated and is with a master's degree and holds, you know, and is a professional person as well.  So, any rate, you know I think, yeah there are probably some things I'd do better but not a whole lot I'd do differently.
Story_ID: 306617
Speaker 1: Now in the same vein, when you look back on what you've done so far, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: To be, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Your legacy?
Speaker 2: In State Farm [State Farm Mutual Insurance Company] or out of State Farm?
Speaker 1: I mean period, you know?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, I, I think if I have a legacy and I hope I do, I think it lives on through other people.  You know what?  I've tried to do really both in and out of State Farm, is to help other people succeed, to help other people as Charlie Snyder [Charles Snyder] did for me, to see things in themselves that they might not otherwise have seen.  And, you know, that's what I spend most of my time doing, whether it's in State Farm or not, is to, is to help people believe in themselves and you know, I hope that's a legacy that, that lasts.
Story_ID: 306618
Speaker 1: Now I wanted you to tell that family history story real quick if we can.
Speaker 2: Oh, on my dad's [Gordon Jones] side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Now, this is a story that we left out in the beginning but I wanted you to kind of--
Speaker 2: Okay.  On my dad's, on my dad's side of the family, as I said, his father [Chester Jones], he was kind of not in his life, his father's father was a man by the name of Charles H. Jones [ph.].  Charles H. Jones, which I'd found a lot about doing family resear- research was of course, was born in Ohio as well, ultimately joined the, Union Army as a, as a, I think about an eighteen year old kid.  I was able to find a lot of information, you know about him in his, in his time in the, in the Union Army.  And, we were very curious about him because we kind of knew where he lived in Southern Ohio but we didn't know, my dad never, didn't know much about him at all until we started doing this family research.  But we found out he joined the Colored Infantry [U.S. Colored Troops] for the Civil War, we got a tremendous number of his records, I got all of his war records, to the war department and, or through the [U.S.] Department of the Army.  I even got, and they even sent me copies of his journal, he used to keep a journal and I, and I have a copy of his journal where he, where he illustrated which battle they were going in, they were going into this battle and they were marching from Maryland down to Petersburg, Virginia for a battle and, and all of that.  And so, h--he beca-  I became very fascinated by him 'cause we didn't know anything about him before.  We knew he was from down Southern Ohio, a little town called Gallia [Gallia County, Ohio], but none of my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell Gallia?
Speaker 2: G-A-L-I-A [sic. G-A-L-L-I-A].  But neither my father nor I had ever been down there, he knew his parents, his, some of his relatives were kind of down that way.  His, his relatives beyond his great-grandfather, beyond Charles Jones, actually came from Loudoun County, Virginia, and they were slaves and they were brought to Ohio.
Story_ID: 306619
Speaker 1: But Charles Jones [ph.] was somebody we got fascinated with especially after reading all of this stuff.  My dad [Chester Jones] really wanted to see if we, my dad wanted to get down to Gallia, Ohio [Gallia County, Ohio], and see if we could find his grave, and the stuff that we got from the [U.S.] Department of the Army, there was some mention that he may be buried in a place called the Bethel Cemetery around Gallia, Ohio.  My dad decided he wanted to go down there and see if we could find it, we went down there, Gallia has a very small place, but it's kind of in the hills, there's a lot of dirt roads and so forth.  We drove all other, essentially could not find the cemetery of course his grave or anything like that.  As we were driving around, we passed a little black church there that people were going in this church, we decided well, we weren't gonna go in this church but we kind of drove by it and we kept looking.  We ask a number of people if they'd ever heard of this cemetery called the Bethel Cemetery.  Nobody'd ever heard of it, we finally got to the point where we got discouraged and I said to my dad, "Look we can say we're in Gallia, we're, we're not gonna find this cemetery, it may not even exist, so let's go home."  He agreed, we go up a little dirt road, there's a guy out cutting his grass, a white man, my dad said, "Let's stop and ask him, maybe he'll know," and I said to my dad, "Look okay, we've asked everybody, nobody knows where this is, he's, I'm sure, he's not gonna know where this cemetery is."  Well my dad insisted, so I stopped the car on this dirt road and went and told him the story that we had relatives, ancestors that lived here many years ago and we were just kind of looking for this cemetery and called the Bethel Cemetery and the guy looked quizzical and "Nah, that didn't sound familiar to me, I don't think I know it," but then he said, "Let me go make a call from somebody might know more," and he goes in the house, he brings out a little cell phone and he calls and he asks the guy, he's talking to the guy about this Bethel Cemetery, the guy on the other end obviously said, "That's a colored cemetery," 'cause this guy says, "Yeah that's what they are."  So, he tells them about it and the guy gets off the phone and says, "Believe it or not, I know where that cemetery is." He said, "I cut grass at that cemetery or used to cut grass at that cemetery."  And so he's telling us where it is, and it's up some dirt road and so forth and he finally says, "Why don't you just follow me," so we go up and down these dirt roads and we go up the hill and, and right in front of us at the top of this hill is a little old church, it's not a functioning church right now and I remember it said, Bethel Church, 1841.  And right next to it, low and behold is the cemetery, it's all overrun by weeds and all of that.  And, and so we're looking around and all these weeds and the so--most of the tombstones, there were a lot of tombstones there, but they're all washed out, the sa- 'cause they're sandstone, you couldn't really read them.  My dad was over, I remember up on the side of the hill and I'm walking around on the other side and I look down and I see a tombstone as clear as clear can be that said, Private Charles F. Jones, 21st Colored Infantry, Company C and I just couldn't believe it and I called my dad over and he came over, tears running down his eyes and we found our, our, his grandfather, my great-grandfather's grave among all these that, you know the most you, the you know most you couldn't even read.  We went back, on our way out, we decided to go by this little church and they actually were just letting out and we went in, we pulled into the parking lot and I saw a young lady and I told her why we were down there, she says, "You gotta go talk to my dad who's the minister."  And, and his name was Mims [ph.], I don't think that's what I said at first, his name was Mims, and we said, "Oh, that's interesting, there are a number of relatives named, that we have named Mims." He makes us come into the, into the little banquet hall there and they're having a chicken dinner and he said, he's doing all this research for that area, wants to know about our research and starts introducing them, us to all these people and all of them literally, in that church hall had last names that we had found, you know, that were part of our family history, and so all of those people in some way or another, most of them were related to us.
Story_ID: 306620
Speaker 1: Our last question is like legacy but a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: You know, I guess I'd like to be remembered as somebody who believed in other people, somebody who helped other people succeed, helped other people find things in themselves, but also I guess, like to be remembered as, you know, somebody who, who found success for themselves through the help of others and I think that's I guess the thing that is most important to me is, is helping people kind of get where I was, you know?  The, somebody that's, being somebody that, that can help others as well and I guess ultimately, you know I, I, wh- what I really, how I really want to be remembered is somebody that cared for and nurtured my family.  You know, at the end of the day I really feel like the most important thing to me is family first and foremost, and taking care of and nurturing and guiding you know, my family which now includes not just my wife [Helen Thompson Jones] and my two sons [Brian Jones and Derek Jones], but now four grandchildren and, and hopefully, you know I can provide them the same type of guidance that was provided me, and I hope I'm remembered as a person that can do that.
