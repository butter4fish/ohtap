 Little Thunder. Today is Monday, February  14, 2011. I   m interviewing Anita Fields for the Oklahoma Native Artists  Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re in Stillwater at Anita   s house. Thank  you for taking time to speak with me, Anita.  You   re welcome.  You began your professional career a bit later in life, but your unique  approach to ceramics, including your renderings of cultural items in  clay, has made you very sought after. You   re a member of the Osage  tribe, but you   re also Mvskoke Creek. Is that on your mom or your dad   s  side?  I   m Osage on my dad   s side, and I   m Creek on my mother   s side.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  I was born in Hominy, Oklahoma, and I grew up until about eight to ten   years old  in Osage County in Hominy. We lived on my great-grandfather   s  allotment. My dad built a home out there, but then we  made a move to Colorado, and back and forth. There was a couple of  years they couldn   t get quite settled in Colorado and they were very  homesick. We kept moving back and forth to Oklahoma, and we finally  settled in Colorado, lived there until I was about eighteen.  You didn   t happen to know the Grays while you were there?  The Grays are my relatives, so we made that move, we were all up there  together  in Denver .  What did your folks do for a living?  5  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  My dad was a guide and outfitter, but he was also a welder, and my  mom was a housewife.  What are your earliest memories of art?  My earliest memories of art are in Oklahoma, out there on my great-grandfather   s  allotment that I was talking about earlier. Memories of  very hot Oklahoma summers, playing in the dirt and making mud pies.  My mom would save those little tins, you know, the little bitty ones like  Bama Pies. And I would mix water and the earth and grass and pebbles  and put them on a board and let them dry in the sun. Very much like  what I do today. (Laughter) But also just memories of being creative, of  creating things with natural materials.  In three dimensions?  Yes. Another thing that I talk about quite a bit in my earliest memories  of making things are that my grandmother on my mother   s side sewed.  She was a really, really wonderful seamstress, and so she would sew. I  don   t even know how young I was, but I think I was like six, six or  seven, and I asked her to teach me how to sew. She gave me some  scraps, and she taught me basic sewing. So, I started making these little  doll clothes for a favorite doll of mine. They   re very vivid in my  memory, what they look like. I have, still today, a fondness for material  and textiles and sewing. I still incorporate a lot of fabric into my work  and clothing. It   s just an extension of things that I learned early, early  on.  What kinds of art experiences did you have in primary and secondary  school?  In Oklahoma I don   t recall much except what I was talking about, what I  did at home. But in Colorado, we went to parochial schools. There was a  really elderly nun   when I was in third grade, she came once a week  and taught us art. Today, as an adult, when I think about her, I really  enjoy these memories because she was really, really quite passionate  about artwork. She taught us how to make a fresco, a real fresco, the  way that it   s been historically done, which is really kind of amazing for  third graders. She was just very passionate about her love for art, and  one of the things that she asked us to do was to create ourselves in a  collage. She taught us what a collage was and how to make a collage,  then she said,    I want you to create what you see yourself being when  you grow up, in collage form.    And I made an artist, and she had a little  tam on and she had a smock on and she was holding a palette. She  taught us some techniques that you just don   t learn in third grade,  6  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  normally. I remember that pretty vividly.  Unlike today, when people have lots of opportunities inside  communities to make artwork, or to go to a place that has classes, those  were not so available to us when we were young. There was a place that  taught kind of crafty things, some kind of community center, and I  remember going to that a couple of times. But I was the kind of child  that got real immersed when I was making something, creating  something. It was just kind of a self-taught activity. I would get  whatever we had at home and start making things, whether that was  sewing, making a costume to wear to a party or just making things. My  dad was a pretty good painter, so I watched him paint. I think that the  activity of making things, of creating, that language was real  comfortable for us. Nobody told you,    Don   t do that,    or,    Spend your  time doing something else.    We were just kind of left alone to explore  those activities, the activity of creating something, of making something.  But I do remember   and this awareness came to me after I started doing  the Artist-in-Residence program here in Oklahoma many years ago     watching children who never had the opportunity to work with clay, but  it just came very natural to them. Out of a hundred kids that you   d see in  a day, there   d be two or three kids that  were  just,    I can   t leave this  material, I don   t want to go back to the classroom. I   m all immersed.     And I thought,    Oh, that   s the kind of kid I was.    I saw myself in them.  You went to school at the Institute of American Indian Art  IAIA  in  Santa Fe for a while. Were your parents in favor of you going there? I  know Gina had to talk her folks into it.  Gina was really young when she went up there. No, not really. I had  graduated high school, so it was my decision, and they were okay with  that.  Was pottery your focus there, too?  No. I went to IAIA to paint. I had dabbled in painting and I went out  there to paint. But when I went out there, we were exposed to so many  mediums   one of them was video and multi-media, clay, sculpture. We  were exposed to all kinds of things, and so that was my first time to  work with clay. I really liked it, but I didn   t really pursue clay until  leaving IAIA. Well, when I left IAIA, I got married and started having a  family, so my art was kind of always on the side. Or if I had a job, I was  just making sure that I was at some kind of community art center or  some university where I could take classes, so I could have access to a  studio. I did that for a long, long time.  Who were some of your fellow classmates and maybe some of your  7  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  favorite teachers at the Institute?  Well, there was a lot of people   we were very influential on each other.  John Kindred was a painting instructor there. He was a great teacher, a  great person to give you motivation and encouragement. I took  printmaking from Seymour Tubis. He was another great teacher. One  thing about these guys that was really cool was that if they saw some  talent in you, they would buy your work or they would trade with you.  Even the teachers?  Yes. Not all of them. Two or three of them would do that. Ralph  Pardington was the clay instructor that I had. There was a couple     Otallie was there,  Otallie  Loloma. Allan Houser was there in sculpture.  But I didn   t always have those instructors. In terms of students, Mike  Romero was a great painter that we all admired. There were so many  people from so many places. Gordon Van Wert was a sculpture student.  Of course, Gina was there, painting. I could go on and on and on.  Tell me about meeting Tom,  your husband .  Tom was going to film school there. I don   t even remember what the  name of that place was. Richard  Whitman  was there, and there was a  couple other guys.  It wasn   t St. John   s College, was it?  It might have been there, but it was a program that was going. I actually  met Tom in Denver, during one of the holidays. Everybody   s kind of  running around in these huge crowds, back and forth, all these places  that we would travel to. I was still at the Institute, but I think we were on  break or something     And you knew that he was into photography?  Yes. And that was another thing that I had taken out there at the Institute  of American Indian Arts, photography with Kay Wiest. She really knew  what she was doing in that old-school type of photography. She was a  contemporary of Georgia O   Keefe and that crowd, so she really, really  knew what she was doing. I remember that about her.  While you were raising your kids, you kept your hand in art, and you  took some classes. Does this include the class at OSU with Richard   Bevins ?  No, that was later. One of the things I   ve always done, one of the things  8  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  that, when my kids were very, very young and I was pregnant, we lived  in Pawhuska. Tom was working for the Osage Tribe, and so I made an  effort to learn how to do ribbon work. They had these classes you could  go to  at  the  Osage Tribal  Museum. I learned how to do ribbon work,  I learned how to do finger weaving. I have this time, I might as well  learn how to be doing these things. So, I spent some time making  traditional Osage clothing for little relatives. And when my kids came  along, I started doing that for them. I took a class from Bill Glass one  time in Tahlequah.  When he was the artist in residence for Cherokee Nation?  Yes. And of course, I knew Bill from IAIA. Bill was another person that  was out there at the same time I was. Talented Bill Glass.  Did you get involved with the Artist-in-Residence program prior to your  class at OSU or after?  After. I had spent all this time going back and forth to schools. But every  time I would get enrolled in a school, I would get pregnant and have  another child. We lived in Tahlequah for quite a while, and then Tom  got a job with the  Oklahoma Department of  Career  and  Tech nical  Education , so we moved to Stillwater.  Approximately what year?  Oh my gosh, we   ve been here twenty-five years. We raised our kids  here. They were little when we left Tahlequah. I couldn   t find a job. I  was really having a hard time finding a job here. I had worked for  Cherokee Nation when we lived in Tahlequah. So, I thought,    Well, I   m  just going to go back to school.    I didn   t have much to finish. I had this  hodgepodge of classes and different degrees of advanced painting, but  no    what they required over here.    I had this hodgepodge. Marty Avrett  was there at OSU. Marty helped me get through what I needed to take in  order to graduate. I think it took me two years or something, and that   s  when I made the decision to pursue my work, pursue my art, because I  thought,    I   m not going to ever know if I don   t just pour myself into it.  This is what I   ve always wanted to do but always had to have a job or  was taking care of my kids.    And I thought,    I   m just not going to ever  know if I can make this succeed if I don   t just jump in there and do this.     So, it was at that time that I made that decision. And when I made that  decision, I actually went from a different way of working with clay.  Because before, how I was trained, I was trained as a potter, and I wasn   t  really that good at it. I was adequate. I can throw pretty adequately. You  see a lot of people that can just sit down and it   s very natural for them to  throw. But it took a lot of training  for me .  9  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  When you talk about throwing     I   m talking about throwing on the wheel. Making functional cups and  bowls and all this kind of thing. When I made that decision to delve into  trying to make art as a living, I decided also to just make things that  were more narrative in nature than to make things that are functional.  Were you working with earthenware, ceramics?  I had always used stoneware prior, so what I use now is kind of the  opposite. Sometimes I use porcelain, but mostly I use an earthenware  clay, since it   s not going to be used for any particular function.  When you decided you were going to get serious about this, did you set  specific goals, like    I   m going to enter such and such show?     I had a strategy. I thought,    Okay, I   m going to try to get a show at the  Southern Plains Museum,    because I knew they did that wonderful  catalogue, and that catalogue went out to all kinds of places. They had a  huge mailing list. That was my first strategy. And I had a strategy of  doing some of the shows and markets. I think the first thing I did was the  Kansas Lawrence Show.  At Haskell  Indian Nations University ? What was that experience like?  It was great. I think first shows I did, like, just even little bitty shows,  like things at malls, those weren   t always so great because people aren   t  really there  for that . They   re there to shop, they   re not there to buy art,  so it was lean. You didn   t sell that much, but you learned a lot. I did a lot  of those kinds of things. I don   t even know how long I   ve been doing   Santa Fe  Indian Market. I started doing Indian Market the last year that  they grandfathered people in. I   m the next year. So, it   s twenty  something years.  What kinds of things were you doing when you started out?  They were non-functional pieces. A lot of little figures. I did a whole  series of these little clay boxes, and then inside the clay boxes would be  these little figures or these little animals. A lot of them might be little  figures, like a mother and children. It was just based on my life,  basically, what I was going through as a mother and a human being and  raising your kids. I got into doing these platters, and I still do them  today, but they   ve transformed so much from those first platters I did. I  used a lot of ribbonwork designs, and then kind of abstracted them. I had  to come up with a palette, so I did a lot of things with terra sigillata,  10  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  coloring terra sigillata with pigments to come up with a palette that I was  pleased with and that would work for me.  Can you explain that term, terra sigillata?  Terra sigillata is a Greek word that means stamped earth. It   s a clay slip,  a very fine clay slip that you just mix   earthenware clays   and then you  let it set. You put a defloctant in it. What I used was Calgon. It will  separate the clay, so after about four days, you take a siphon, and it   ll be  a watery, very clear mixture. And you siphon that off   that   s kind of  like all the decay   and everything comes to the top. You siphon that off,  and what   s left in the middle   the clay actually goes to the bottom. It   s  real thick down there, so that middle layer is a real fine, fine clay. It   s  like milk almost, and you can take that and put pigments in it. And then  you can put that on when  the clay   s  leather hard, or you can spray it on  after you fire it. But when you look at Greek pots, that red and black,  that   s what terra sigillata is. It   s a real ancient technique, which most of  the clay techniques are. They   re things that people have been using  forever.  I think the first thing that I saw of yours were parfleche bags.  Oh, I did those for a long time. Yes, I did the parfleche bags for quite a  while.  But even the platters you made  were  always non-functional?  Yes, but the parfleches   I have this interest in things we carry and  things that you put inside things. And my interest is really more than just  the purses or the dresses or the things that have kind of evolved out of  those early years. What I   m really interested in is how people carry  things. I use those for a metaphor, actually, that you are carrying. Like  these parfleches, we use them to carry and to store, and it was more of a  metaphor of our culture during those times, and what we made to take  care of ourselves.  I think it   s wonderful in a couple of ways. One, you   re showing us that  these traditional cultural items are works of art when you   re translating  them into clay, but it also reminds me that everything  people make has  a spirit.  I believe when you work with clay   and it   s pretty deep, but I don   t  intellectualize it every single day that I go to the studio. If I have to start  thinking about it, it   s a really deep thing. Because clay, of course, it   s the  earth, it holds us up. That   s why, when I work with kids, they know  exactly what to do with clay. I just have to stand there and provide the  11  Little Thunder  Fields  clay. I don   t really have to show them anything. Now, of course, I do. I  have my own little agenda with them, but they still are very close to the  earth. They understand that connection to the earth very well.  Somewhere along the line, that   s where we forget it. So, when you work  with clay, it   s like the earth has this ability to allow you to use it. Or  we   re allowed the ability to use the earth and to transform it into  something else. I don   t really know how to verbalize it, but there is some  transformation that takes place when the earth allows you to create with  it. And if I   m at the studio for days on end, really making something,  and touching the clay all day long, sometimes when I come home, I still  have the feeling in my hands of,    I   m touching this material, this moist  earth.    It doesn   t go away when you stop working. It   s very close.  I   m glad you shared that. Thinking about the stories, or the narrative  element, is it important for the piece to tell the whole story or part of the  story?  I don   t believe it   s important for me to show everything. In fact, I do a  lot to kind of distort exactly what I   m trying to say, because sometimes  it   s so very personal. As a human being, I   m kind of quiet and keep  things to myself. I   m a private person, is what I want to say. And unless  you really know me, unless you know me really well or I   m very close  to you, I   m not the person to just tell all. So actually in my work, I think  of myself like that, too. I don   t have to let you know everything it is I   m  trying to say. I may even take pains to distort that message a little bit, so  that I   m still the person who the secret belongs to. And if you can kind  of jump online with me somewhere and understand what it is I   m trying  to say, that   s great. And people usually do. I think people are very  insightful. They look at it, especially people who love art and love work  and love looking at artwork, they can get that gesture, that expression  that you   re trying to make. They understand that.  My oldest son Yatika is a painter. He left Oklahoma when he was  eighteen, when he graduated high school. He   s twenty-nine now. He   s  been in the East a long time. He went to Boston to art school, but he got  real involved in a graffiti crew. (Laughter) And he was young, so I went  out there. I thought,    I   d better go check on him.    And I said,    Oh, my  gosh. You   re so lucky I   m an artist.    They have these just wonderful     him and his crew, these guys that he ran with   they   d have these  notebooks full of documenting, not just their work, but work of  others .  It was amazing. So, I was influenced by those guys. When I came back,  I started writing distorted messages on my work. And those guys will  tell you, at least, Yatika will tell you, that it   s not about actually what  you   re putting on there, but it   s a lot about movement and energy. He  describes it like a dance. I   m always open to learning. I want to be a life-long  learner. I want to learn something, I want to know something else.  12  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  And I think we can learn a lot from these young people. So, I   m  influenced all the time by all kinds of things. What you see, what you  hear, what   s going on where you   re at. But what I   m really interested in  is that gist of what information I   m taking in. It doesn   t always have to  be exactly what I see. It   s just what   s really happening here? I ask a lot  of questions.  When I think about ceramic cultural items I remember Bill Glass doing  some rattles. I don   t really remember seeing a lot of translation into clay  of traditional clothing. Do you think you were one of the first artists in  Oklahoma to be doing that?  Well, I know Karita Coffee made leggings out of clay. I think we   d have  to give that credit to Karita in terms of footwear and all that kind of  thing.  She was doing those in the mid-   80s or early    80s?     70s even, I think. But clothing, when I was learning how to sew when I  was so young, and then learning how to make Osage traditional clothing.  And when my children were at an age where I started making traditional  clothing for them, those kinds of influences     it   s  what I was talking  about earlier.    What   s really going on here?       What   s really  happening?    Yes, I   m making something traditional for my clothing, but  it   s so much deeper than that. I mean, I understood totally what my  grandmother went through her whole lifetime of acquiring Osage  traditional clothing for us. Or having it made when I was able to do that  for my own children. That was very clear to me, it   s wanting you to  participate and know who you are. It   s wanting you to be able to be  involved in the dance. It   s an expression of love for our children and our  families and our extended families and the relationships that we have  with one another, and they even signal     In Osage clothing, my grandmother had this wonderful collection. Her  most prized possessions were these Osage traditional clothing. I would  ask her, we would look at them and we would talk about them,  especially hand blankets. I would say,    Where did you get this?    and,     Tell me the story of how you got this.       Well, my. . . . . .     The  blankets  have relationships. We have our clan relationships and you  have relationships with your extended family. Your first cousin is  actually your brother, and your aunt and uncle are actually your mother  and your father, so she would talk about members of her extended  family like that. She said,    Well, they had that made and they gave that  to me.    Or,    When someone passed on, this was given to me in this  way.    Again, there   s just more going on there than this actual exchange.  It   s defining a relationship. That is the part that I find so interesting. It   s  13  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  all a very beautiful thought, how that manifests itself into an article of  clothing. That   s the part that I find really fascinating about it.  You devised a finish that works especially well for the buckskin dress  series. Can you talk about how you get the effect that actually looks like  buckskin?  Yes. First of all, when the piece is leather hard, I take a clay slip and a  series of sponges and just dip them into that clay slip, press it all out, and  then press it on, so it has a texture that   s similar to buckskin. Again, I  don   t think I would know what the texture of buckskin really was unless  I had actually made a pair of moccasins, or my grandmother had a little  buckskin dress made for me when I was very young. I wouldn   t know  what the texture of buckskin is unless I had that closeness to wearing  buckskin or making buckskin leggings for my children or those kinds of  things. Then, once I had fired it, I would build a little outdoor kiln, either  with bricks or dig a hole, but most of the time just do it in a trashcan. It   s  a sawdust firing, where you add sawdust in layers, and then you ignite it.  After a while I could kind of control it. In the beginning, I didn   t really  know what I was doing until I did it several times. Then I got to the  point where I could control it with paper, and with different layers of  sawdust and different kinds of sawdust. And adding different things that  ignite, different materials that ignite or different organic materials that I  could ignite. Then I could kind of control it. I don   t know if you   ve seen  pictures of it. They   re kind of waves, they go up and down like this. I  could take that flame to exactly  that point to create that.  That was still  very surprising, but I, at least, had a little bit of control over it, where I  could kind of make these layers start happening. So, they were sawdust-fired.  Tom has always helped by photographing your work. Does he help with  the art business side in any other ways?  He   s accompanied me on a couple of bigger exhibits in the East and  markets that we did a couple times in the East. Everybody   s helped me.  It   s a big deal to move ceramics. (Laughter) Especially the older I get, I  have to really rely on everybody. All my kids help me in Santa Fe, help  me set up, help me take it down. But I tell them also, everybody benefits  from this. (Laughter) The trickle-down effect. Everybody needs to do  your share. So they   ve all helped me. My whole family   s always helped  me in terms of getting the work there, getting it set up, helping me stay  there for several days, photographing it, all that kind of thing.  How important have museum shows been in terms of your career?  I think they   ve been really important, extremely important. Getting the  14  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  opportunity to show in a museum or show in an exhibit that   s important  has been really a jumping-off point in terms of significance. Having  people look at your work, critique your work. Having the opportunity to  show with so many wonderful other artists. When you   re in this  business, and you   re just making your work, you   re going to the studio,  you   re doing the work, you   re immersed in it, it   s hard work. Physically,  it   s hard work. Working with clay is really physically very hard. So,  when you arrive at the gallery or you arrive at the museum, and  everything is all beautiful, it just takes you aback when you walk in  there. Because it   s presented in such a beautiful manner     You see it anew?  Absolutely. Several times I   ve had the opportunity to visit somebody   s  home that my piece is  in    especially something that   s a big, major  piece.  I want to go back to your earlier question ,    How important is it  for you to show what it is that you really   the expression you   re trying  to make?    Well, sometimes I walk into somebody   s home, and I   ll look  at my piece and I   ll think,    I know what that was about.    It becomes  very clear to me what I was really trying to say, that I wasn   t really even  aware of at that moment I was creating it.  I remember there was a period when three-dimensional work became  super popular   I don   t know if it was in the    90s? It was just a big shift,  when everybody was looking for three dimensional work.  I guess I   ve never really thought about it that way. I   ve always kind of  made a living doing several things like galleries, museum shows and the  markets. And I never have done that many markets because I couldn   t  keep up with the inventory. If something got real popular, I was like,     Oh, my gosh. This isn   t the Anita factory.    I would feel that way  sometimes. And I thought,    That   s no fun, really, to kind of reproduce  this, in a different manner.    After a while, it just wasn   t fun anymore. It  was not the original idea. It had done its time. I found trying to do the  markets it was really hard to come up with that kind of inventory on a  regular basis.  For Santa Fe, you take how many pieces  typically ?  I have always had a low end kind of thing that helps me get there and  helps me get home and helps me pay for my hotels. But I take     excluding that kind of small thing   maybe six or seven pieces. And it   s  really hard to balance your life and your studio work. I don   t think the  general public really has any idea what goes into making something out  of clay, the time that is involved in it. The drying process, the firing  process. And then you can go through that whole process, and it may not  15  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  even make it out of the kiln. It   s a very involved process.  And balance is really important to you.  Yes, because I have a family. I   m very involved in the Osage  community. I serve as a cook for our current drum keeper, and I was a  cook for our drum keeper previous to him. That   s a commitment during  all of June that I love doing. Our kids all come home, so pretty much  June   I don   t do Red Earth anymore. I haven   t done it for a long, long  time because June was out of the question.  Backtracking a little bit to your artist-in-residence work, what was one  of the benefits of doing that? I understand you don   t do it as much  anymore, but you   re still on the roster.  It   s very rewarding experience to be able to work with young people and  excellent teachers. It   s just a really wonderful experience. I think I get  more than the kids get from me. I get rewarded by them because   what  I talked about earlier. They have this connection to the earth and they  understand it. They haven   t lost that, and it   s very close to them. So, it   s  just a joyful experience to be able to watch them create things out of  clay. One of the things that I   m very interested in them knowing is, art is  not make-and-take. And it   s not that you do exactly what I do here. It   s  an expression of who you are, and how you see the world, how you see  things. I try to accomplish that in a number of ways by just reading a  story to them, or we go outside and have an experience, and then,    Take  this lump of clay and just tell me how you felt about that or what you  saw.     I used to do six-week residencies over at Edmond, so I   d see those kids a  lot. And it got to where I was just running out of ideas. What are we  going to do here? So, sometimes on Monday morning, I would just give  them the clay and say,    Show me what you did this weekend.    It was  amazing what they would make out of clay. It was so beautiful and so  touching. It   s a good learning experience for everybody. Then teachers  can see that it   s not always about make-and-take. There   s a place for  make-and-take. I   m not opposed to a teacher standing up there and  showing somebody how to make something. There   s a place for that,  too. But I think it   s really important that young people know what the  act of creating is all about, what making art is. And there   s so many  aspects to that they can plug into for a little bit. In school, it   s just so  demanding of them. For them to have this time where they can make  those decisions, how I want something to be, is important. So, it   s very  gratifying to be able to do that.  You have described yourself as a kind of quiet person, but I notice you  16  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  have been doing a bit of public speaking lately. You gave a keynote  address at the American Indian Studies Conference in 2009. How do you  approach that?  It   s hard, and I am asked, if you   re at a museum exhibit. Or to write  about your work. All of the above is hard for me, because as an artist, I  make that expression through my material. That is my expression. That   s  how I do it. I   m not going to ask a writer to explain to me what you  wrote about through making something. So, that part of it is very  difficult. Sometimes it just takes days to pull those words out of  yourself, and to try to be exact, so that it will be very clear what you  mean. That   s very difficult. But I also look at it as a great opportunity to  be able to tell people about yourself. Not so much about myself, but  what it is that motivates me. Why I do this? That can be really hard to  do, but for me what works best is just to be honest. And if people are  interested in that, then they are. And if they   re not, that   s okay, too. I can  only be honest, I can only talk about what it is I do, how I do it, why I do  it, what   s just right there in my own backyard.  You are working on a commission for one of the Quapaw Casinos at the  moment. Can you explain what that involves?  Well, it involved doing some research about the Quapaw people. I knew  a little bit because my grandmother had some extended family members  that were Quapaw, and I have quite a few friends that are Quapaw. I   ve  spent some time up that way. But it involved quite a bit of research.  Luckily, I had the opportunity   as an artist, I   m so thankful that I   ve  been given the opportunity to have some just really wonderful  experiences that I wouldn   t have had in any other job. And some of  those include a lot of recent trips with the Osage Nation up to our  original homelands, and doing some work in Missouri and getting to  visit some sacred sites for Osage people with the Cultural Preservation  Office out of the Osage Nation.  Like that Lewis and Clark  Bicentennial Celebration . There was a lot of  activity going on out there, and I got an opportunity to be a little part of  that. So, those kinds of experiences just add to how I see things and how  that information percolates inside of me. How am I going to use that at a  later date? Or travel   being given the opportunity to travel to some  place absolutely wonderful that I never would have got to go unless I  was an artist. So, out of some of those experiences, I   ve had the  opportunity to actually see a huge collection of  Quapaw  pottery. I  spent a long time in one of their collections before this opportunity ever  came up. They have some books that they actually loaned to me, very  wonderful old books that they loaned to me to be able to do some  research. And it took me quite a while to come up with two or three  17  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  projects that I thought would be appropriate for them, one that we could  all agree on.  Their pottery   s a very powerful expression of how they can see their  past, this collection of pottery that exists today. And of course, how that  was acquired   all of that goes into what I   m trying to say. As we know,  that wasn   t always the best, how these things were acquired and who got  them and where they went. Those are still things that people are dealing  with. So, that all goes into that mix of how you see this. It   s like  everything else in this life, it   s the good and bad and it   s a balance of  everything. I thought that was a good way   I didn   t want to take their  designs just verbatim, kind of going back to what we were talking about  earlier. But they are very basic designs in there that people have used all  over. They   re just very basic human designs that are used in all kinds of  cultures, throughout history, throughout time. But they   re unique to  them in that they came up with these certain designs.  I wanted to think of those designs in terms of that, that they   re these  basic designs that are used everywhere, but I kind of wanted to abstract  them a little bit, so that I wasn   t exactly using their designs. Because I  don   t know what their designs were utilized for, and what their  importance was for them. I didn   t want to just exactly use some of the  designs like that, but I know when I showed them certain parts of it     because there   s over one hundred pieces to it   in some of our meetings  that we   ve had recently, they saw it. They saw those elements of their  designs and I just used the basic colors that are, again, used like from  Greeks to Quapaw pottery to Pueblo pottery. They are the colors of the  earth. They are what   s available to us, in whatever geographic region  that we come in. I wanted to stay on that, but I also wanted to be true to  myself and add that I made this. I don   t want it to be just a replica of  something that you would see in a historical setting or a museum or an  anthropological collection or archeological collection. So, they   re all  going to have gold on the back of them and on the edges, so that that  gold can reflect. Because these are very precious to them in their history.  I look forward to seeing that.  I do, too. It   s just kind of part imagination. That   s another thing. I have  to sometimes go to a place that I   m not sure how this is going to look,  but I have to rely on that part of me. I have to always go to that place  where I believe in this process. I believe in this process and I believe  where it   s going to take me is right.  So you order your clay. Do you ever dig any of your clay?  No. I do use the red clay here in Oklahoma for slips and surface slips,  18  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  sometimes, not all the time. We have such beautiful red earth here, it   s  hard to ignore it. But I make my clay. Actually, my son Nokose helps  me   I would say in the last couple years, Nokose makes my clay. The  bags are fifty pound bags. I have a recipe of clay that I like to use.  It is a  combination of different clays. Each element  comes in fifty pound bags.  There   s this huge mixer over there at the studio that you pour them into.  It   s a very lengthy process. I actually can still go in that storeroom, but  it   s hard to lift a fifty pound bag. So, I just thought,    When Yatika  comes home       Then Nokose and I, we finished, we made about six  hundred pounds of clay a couple weeks ago. That will last me for quite a  while. When I was making that clay, even with the mixer, it was like a  whole day process for me. I would make the clay, and then I would have  to rest, and then I would have to sack it up, sack the clay up. And then  I   d have to rest after that, and then that night, late at night, I would go in  and I would clean the mixer. It would take me a couple hours to clean  that mixer, but with my young son there, it   s just nothing to him.  You   ve touched upon the fact that you have not ever been interested in  doing any straight pottery, but you have mentioned that firing is kind of  this act of faith. Are larger pieces more of a gamble than the smaller  pieces?  I think so. You   ve invested a lot of time into them, but you go ahead and  do it, and it feels absolutely wonderful when   I think last summer, I  made the biggest platter I   ve ever made.  How big was it? Three feet?  It wasn   t quite that big, but there was not a flaw on it. I turned it over  and I thought, there   s got to be something here. There   s got to be     because also, you   ll come up with these little, they   re not a crack all the  way through, but they   re called surface cracks. You just stretched the  clay too much when you   re using some of those tools, or you   ve just  gone over it too much, and it   ll just cause a little tension there. So it   s  just, like, very small, but I didn   t see any. I thought,    Oh, I just can   t get  over this.    Because this is the biggest thing I   ve ever attempted to do in  terms of those platters. I can make something that big, I could do the  surface decoration or whatever it is I   m going to do to it, and most of   my work  requires two to three to four firings. You put one surface on,  then you fire it, then you put another surface on, then you fire it, then  you put another surface like that. So, I know in my heart that when you  do this, you   re not intending for anything to happen to it at the end, but  yes, this could totally crack into two pieces or three pieces. Or there  could be something so horribly wrong with it that it   s not going to be  usable at the end. But you do it anyway. I   m not going to stop doing this  process because it may not make it through. So what you said, it is  19  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  absolutely an act of faith to do this.  I noticed it   s kind of difficult for ceramic sculptors because they want  you either to be in the sculpture category or the ceramic category. Have  you run into that in competitive shows?  No, I haven   t. I think now, they have them, it   s pretty clear what is what.  At Santa Fe Indian Market, they   ve got some very     There   s just some tough competition out there. (Laughter)  Very well-defined categories. Can you explain the process of slips, if you  want to deepen a color? Is that a process of going back again with the  same color slip and it   ll get a little darker?  I use a lot of commercial underglazes, too, because they   re very stable. I  have one slip that I really like, that for me is very stable. It   s a white  base, and I can mix these pigments into it. Some of them are commercial  pigments, some of them are not. Some of them are just raw materials.  But to come up with a palette   it   s like an experiential type of thing.  You have a certain amount of this slip and then you add a certain  amount of this oxide. But you do that in a series of ten experiments with  the same oxide to see exactly what you   re going to come up with, and  then you label that. And you have a notebook, and so it   s going back to  that notebook going,    Well, if I want it to be this       You also have the  sample. You fire it and you go,    Well, this is what I want,    but that  doesn   t mean that   s what you   re going to get. It depends on the batch of  oxides. In addition to that, I use a lot of underglazes, commercial  underglazes, because they   re very stable.  How do you think your approach to working with clay has changed over  the years?  I don   t think about that too much. I think that I have experimented with  this material enough to have a pretty good idea of what it is I want to  say, and to be able to do it in a way that I   m real comfortable with. At  the same time, I wish that I would be more experimental and maybe find  another way of working that I   m not so comfortable with that may bring  me some delightful surprises. But I   m also comfortable enough with  what I do, that I can have an idea of what it is I want. I can have an  image in my imagination. I can think,    I want to say this, so I   m going to  do A, B, and C to get there.    But then when C actually comes, I   m  sitting there with my squirt bottles and my underglazes, and it   s time to  actually put that image onto the clay canvas or whatever I have prepared  for myself to be able to do that, I feel comfortable enough to just go with  20  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  it.  For instance, that happened a couple weeks ago. I was so happy with  what came out. I was just like,    This is better than I even imagined it to  be.    At the same time, the next night, I wasn   t so happy with what  happened there at that time. So the piece that I was so excited about  turned about to be not the piece at all. It was this other one. So, I think  this evolution that takes place with you as an artist can be subtle, and  sometimes it can be very bold, and sometimes it can be just this  evolution process. I   ve always really enjoyed it when there   s an artist I  love that I can follow their work. Visually, you just see that over the  years. You see how they develop from that to this. I think, sometimes,  when I can go through my own   starting with slides that we don   t even  use anymore, to images on the Internet   I can see that within my own  work. It   s not something that you sit down and think about too much  because we   re always so busy with other things. But it   s a combination  of that process, the physical process, the materials, understanding them,  knowing them, these techniques that you pick up along the way. And  also that process that we were talking about earlier, of information that  has come through you and to you, from that moment of taking the needle  and thread and sewing with that material. I can tell you it was blue and  white and gingham little checks and learning how to sew. Every  experience that I   ve had of being a mother and having children and  being a granddaughter and being a daughter and being all of these  things, all of this information wells up within you, and then you   re able  to make this expression. It   s all of those experiences up to this very  moment in time.  You   ve sort of drawn an outline for us of your creative process, but I  wonder if you can just review that a bit from the time you get an idea for  a piece. Do you keep track of those ideas in a notebook?  I do, and I also, I   m a terribly disorganized person, I just write on scraps  of paper.  And then you put those in a certain place?  I try to, but sometimes they just get all jumbled up. (Laughter) I have all  these little notebooks, and I keep a notebook in my purse. I am really  bad  with  scraps of paper. I keep extensive notes, especially if I travel.  It   s about, like, where I   m at, the landscape, I   m real interested in the  landscape. I   ve had the opportunity to go to some really wonderful  places, and I think it   s real interesting. To me, the landscape holds a  memory, and then as a culture, as modern culture, what do we do with  that landscape? Here in the United States, I   ve found it   s pretty typical  of them to want to obliterate these landscapes that have this really  21  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  important information about our indigenous cultures that have been here.  When you go to someplace like Mexico or even places in Europe and  other parts of the world, that indigenous landscape is maybe in ruins, but  it   s there. It   s very notable and it   s appreciated. So, you get this kind of  layering of information and landscapes. You can soak that in. I find that  very interesting, so I try to make note of that when I   m somewhere. How  did that make me feel? Notes like that that I can try to use at a later time,  in addition to some sketching. Those kinds of thoughts will come to me,  and they   ll stay there for a long time, maybe a couple of years. And I   ll  think, maybe I   ll work on those ideas that I   ve been taking note of for  quite a while and try to do like a series of pieces like that. I also do a lot  of figurative work. I try to incorporate that kind of thought with trying to  make this expression of being human, with these little figures or this  figurative type work. It varies. It   s like that information is all stored  there, and it could be endless what you could do with it. Sometimes it   s  hard to even zero in on that. Then also, I take great pleasure in just  making things. It doesn   t have to be about anything. It just has to be  about pattern and design.  Sometimes that   s preparatory to doing a piece?  Yes, I take great pleasure in that. My youngest son and I have these  great conversations, and he   s a great person to bounce ideas off of. And  of course, he   s very young, and I share so much of his ideas, but he   ll be  like,    You should do this, you should do this real experimental  work .     And I love that kind of work myself, but one time, I just looked at him,  and I said,    You know, there is nothing wrong with making something  beautiful. There is nothing wrong at all in making something beautiful.     Because I was really, like, defending. I thought about that for such a  long time. I thought,    Oh, my gosh, people have made beautiful things  all throughout our history. Where would we be without people making  beautiful things to inspire the world?    We have to see beautiful things.  As human beings, we have to see beautiful things, I believe. There   s  enough ugliness in the world that we have to have our beautiful things,  too.  I had a question about whether you   ve ever collaborated, for example,  with Yatika.  No, but I think we   re getting really close. I think maybe the timing has  just not been totally right. Yatika and I really have been talking about it  lately. And then, Welana and I   this just happened the other day. I had a  dream   well, my daughter came home about three nights ago. She   s a  student at Fort Lewis in Durango, and she   s getting ready to graduate.  She came home to do some field work for a paper, her senior thesis.  She   s doing some interviewing up in Osage County this week. So, that  22  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  first night that she came home, I had this dream. I dreamed that   Tom  and I have been to the Banff Center for the Arts. We were there with  other indigenous artists from Mexico, the United States, Canada. There  were some Maori people there. There were people from several different  nations. The theme was about Christianity, and how it   s impacted our  communities, and however you wanted to, good or bad, address that in  your work. That   s what we were doing. I was there for like five or six  weeks. Nokose was twelve, I believe, so Tom brought him. We took him  out of school for a week and Tom brought him and we all stayed there  for a week together. And then I brought Nokose home and Tom stayed  for a while.  It was just the most fabulous experience in the whole wide world. It was  beautiful there. And then just having that opportunity to be able to work  with other indigenous artists. This center is just really wonderful. They  also have studios. Every medium is available to you there, so they have a  fiber studio, also. And when I was there doing my clay work, I kept  thinking,    It would be so cool to come up here and do some Osage  ribbon work.    And the only thing you have to do is   you don   t have to  worry about your  daily mundane routine . You don   t have to be running  to the grocery store. You don   t have any commitment to anything  outside of your work and the beauty of nature around you, and exploring  all of those things. That   s what   s so wonderful about these residencies.  So I dreamed that  Welana  and I went up there to make ribbon work  blankets. And I told her the next morning,    I think we need to apply for  a residency up there.    Because in my dream, I told her,    When we leave  here, you will know how to make a ribbon work blanket.    Because  through me and other ladies, she   s been learning to do some ribbon  work. But I just thought,    You would know how to do it, from start to  end. That process.    Because we   ve been wanting to do that for a while.  And I thought,    That would be so wonderful      I hope you follow up on that.  We were talking about collaboration   he   s a musician, our youngest  son. He   s a very talented musician. And Yatika asked me not too long  ago, he emailed me and said,    I   m applying for this thing. Do you want  to collaborate?    I said,    Let   s do it.     You   ve incorporated photographs in your work. Have you collaborated  formally with Tom?  On a couple of pieces. I think that that influence is really  there . The  last one-woman I show that I had, when I walked into that gallery after  everything was set up, I just thought,    This looks like a black-and-white  23  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  photograph to me.    Every tone, the greys, and all the hues that go into a  black-and-white photograph, were evident in my work. It was at that  time that I really felt this huge influence of photography onto my work.  You enroll at OSU and do studio hours. What is your creative routine if  you have to plan it around when you can use the space?  Well, I work at my home quite a bit, too. This is what I require. I require  that I don   t want to be interrupted. It was really hard when my kids were  teenagers and having to go places and needed to do things. It was really,  really tough. I try to clear the calendar so that I can have at least three or  four days of, I   m just involved in this process and that   s where I need to  be. And I have to tell people,    No.    I   ve gotten way better at that. I  wasn   t so good in the beginning, or when I was younger. My time is  really precious to me. I usually listen to music. I have an iPod. Got some  music on there and listen to it.  What kind?  I listen to all kinds of music. I listen to the oldies, I listen to rock-n-roll, I  listen to indigenous music, I listen to Ponca War Dance, I listen to  peyote songs. I listen to some music I picked up in Africa. The blues.  It   s all over  the place . And then, just get to work. I try to work on two  or three pieces at the same time because of the process of clay. Things  have to have a time where they   re drying before you can go to the next  step, so I try to have two or three pieces in process. And that might  include firing and spending a couple hours doing that, and then go back  to those pieces that I   m working on. I think the biggest part of that is just  having to say,    No.    That includes my family in Osage County. I have to  say,    I can   t do that because I   m working.    And then there are those  times when I   m not working. That   s when I do all those other things.  What was one of the important fork in the road moments when you sort  of chose to go this one direction, but you were looking at another  direction?  I don   t think there   s ever been any other direction that I wanted to go  into but to be an artist and to make art. I think even when I didn   t, could  not do that, it was always there. There was really no other thing I really  ever wanted to do, except maybe be a poet. I mean, kind of like, secretly,  I   ve always thought it would be wonderful to be a poet. But I don   t have  the talent to be a poet. I know that, so it   s just kind of a secret longing,  and this admiration that I have for poets. But in terms of a fork-in-the  road, that was really self-imposed, like I explained earlier. This longing  was so big, and the realization the only person that can make that happen  is you. So, you either try it or you don   t. That was very clear to me, that  24  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  you have this choice to make, and I did that. I just went for it.  In terms of opportunities that have come my way that I   m so very  grateful for and thankful for that exhibit in Washington, D.C. It was     Legacy of the Generations: Pottery by American Indian Women.     Susan Peterson was the curator of that. She   s not here anymore, but she  was a very influential potter, writer, curator. She wrote a lot of the books  that are used as texts in the academic world of learning the techniques of  pottery. She wrote those books, the text books. Susan Peterson had a  long-standing relationship with a lot of Pueblo women potters and came  up with this idea that she wanted to show American Indian women   s  pottery from the aspect of,    Where did they learn this? Where did this  legacy come from?    And how that is passed down in these women, in  their families. Along with that, she was very interested in the avant-garde.  She called them the avant-garde   what contemporary women  who are rooted in their communities are doing also. Being asked by  Susan Peterson to be a part of that exhibit was really a jumping off point,  I believe, in my career.  What year was that?  I think Yatika was about sixteen, because he went. We took him. Mobile  Oil funded that exhibit at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in  D.C. They brought us up there for about a week and took us on tours,  and there was this whole series of events, this huge black tie dinner. It  was like being in a movie or something. So it   s been   if he   s twenty-nine,  I guess probably about fifteen or sixteen years ago.  How about one of the low points in your career?  Well, there   s lots of those. There   s everything from,    I didn   t sell  anything,    to,    I didn   t get that grant. I got turned down.    I have kept all  of those letters because that   s all part of it, too.  It is. It   s time-consuming, grant applications.  Yes, and it   s really a blow when you don   t get awarded something. But I  don   t know, it   s just part of it. What are you going to do? You   re not  going to quit doing it.  Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to cover in our conversation that  you   d like to talk about?  One of the things I was thinking about, that I kind of want to touch on  because it   s something that I   m working quite a bit on right now in my  current work. I did touch on that about the landscape and my feelings  25  Little Thunder  Fields  about landscape and the earth. But along with that is the Osage thought  of how we look at the world, which comes from our Creation story. I   m  working quite a bit in that thought of duality. In our Creation story, we  came from stars and we came to this earth, and there was this division of  the earth and the sky. And out of that division came all of the clans. But  I think what   s interesting is today, how that thought is still here, that  perception is still here. And then, what do we do with that? What do we  do with that information? I find that very interesting.  So, where I   m at with that now is when I think about my grandmother or  my aunties or when I was a young person, people, my grandmother and  her contemporaries, they still spoke to each other in our language, in our  Osage language. I feel very fortunate to have kind of got in on the tail  end of that. When I was a little girl riding around with them or going to  social events, they still spoke our language. I would ask them,    What are  you saying?    or,    Tell me what you said.    Even as a teenager, I would  ask my grandmother,    Tell me what you said.    And it was very poetic, it  was very beautiful, it was very expressive. I found it to be very  expressive. So, when I think about all of those kinds of things, that kind  of philosophy, I think that we   re left with a way of thinking. I have a  way of looking at things and seeing things, and it   s a way of thought. It   s  hard to explain, but that   s how I see it all at this time. So, when I   m  making these pieces about the landscape or I   m making this person, I   m  trying to put that  Osage thought  in there and have that be expressed  some way. It   s not always easy to put your finger on it. It   s kind of  unobtainable almost. It   s not exact, but that   s how I see it at this time.  Well, we are going to take a look at a couple of your pieces.  This piece is called Changing Thought in Black Dress. This is from the  exhibit at TU  Tulsa University  called The Black Dress. This is all clay  up here, but then down here we have fabric, and then oil pastel. I created  this piece when I came back from   I had the opportunity to go to Italy  and paint for three weeks in Tuscany. So  the piece  has this distorted  writing which I was talking about earlier, which are my thoughts about  women and their clothing and how clothing transforms us. This article of  clothing can not only make an expression of who you are on the outside,  but also, clothing has the ability to transform us, again, with that thought  of,    When we get dressed up, what is it  we   re doing ?    We   re going to  something special, something important to us, or an event or a situation  that   s very important that could be very happy. Sometimes it   s even a  sad event. What is it we   re really doing when we attend these functions?  And what is it that information that you take home from something like  that? So, I had this opportunity to go to Tuscany and paint for three  weeks in the hillsides of Italy. It was really wonderful, and they have  these trees over here, cyprus trees. People  at the exhibit  kept thinking  26  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  Little Thunder  Fields  they were feathers, but I said,    No, they   re part of the landscape,    again,  kind of doubling that information about the landscape, and how thought  can be transforming for us as well. Putting yourself into a new  environment and a new place, and then taking that with clothing, and  translating all that information into what we wear and how we see  ourselves. That   s what this piece is about. I   m actually making a white  one now that   s going to be about the sun. And I think it   s going to have  lily ponds on the dress.  I think this is a good example of what I   ve been saying about the  landscape. I have two of them. These pieces, they   re actually about the  Mounds and our original homelands, so this is specifically about what I  was talking about earlier, my feelings for the landscape and how the  landscape holds a memory of the past cultures that were there. When  you   re able to visit those kinds of places, being able to tie into that and  get a feel for the cultures who were there, how they affected us and how  we   re still here and have survived all that, I think it   s just very  interesting how the landscape can hold that. So these forms were made  specifically after being able to travel to some of those places.  And you   re talking about some of the Osage sites, specifically?  Yes.  We can see the stamp work on the bottom, which is really wonderful. On  the top you   ve got a different type of texturing.  Yes, I made that with these little squeeze bottles of slip. The red is the  terra sigillata that I was talking about earlier. These also kind of  reference that Osage thought of the sky and the earth. That   s why there   s  such a different technique on the top as opposed to the bottom because  I   m thinking about that thought process. How we see things from the sky  and how we see things from the earth, so you have these little droplets of  rain coming, these little bitty things that are kind of falling. Those are  supposed to be indicative of rain. Even though this all is one landscape  piece, I want to have that delineation of thought. The earth and the sky.  That polarity. These are wonderful. Thank you so much, Anita, for  taking time to talk with us.  You   re welcome, Julie. It was fun.  -------  -------
