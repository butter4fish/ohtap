Speaker 1: All right, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer with The HistoryMakers today.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, can you please give us your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--my name is Alfred Msezane.
Speaker 1: And can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: M-S-E-Z-A-N-E.
Speaker 1: And Alfred?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, then the middle name is Zakhele. It's Z-A-K-H-E-L-E.  It means essentially, "to build it yourself."
Speaker 1: Okay, and Alfred is spelled A-L-F-R-E-D?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and is there a story--now, the middle name means--
Speaker 2: "Build it yourself."
Speaker 1: "Build it yourself," and what does your last name mean?
Speaker 2: It's Msezane.  Oh, the meaning is, it's "ladies' man."
Speaker 1: All right, now, is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because my people (unclear) were--they liked women.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And so that's how they acquired the surname.  They became, actually, in Zulu, it's pronounced Msezane.
Speaker 1: Msezane, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so that's how they got the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story behind how you got the name Alfred?
Speaker 2: No, they--in South Africa, there was a requirement that apart--in addition to the Zulu name, you had to have a Christian name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is a government requirement?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we are growing up because, you see, the whites couldn't pronounce the Zulu names.  So you find that many Africans of my time had the English names.  Remember, like Nelson Mandela [first democratically elected president of South Africa; Nobel Peace Prize winner], like Sisulu Walter [South African political activist], those were given, you know, European names, at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a way they do that?  I mean do they--
Speaker 2: No, you choose your name, you choose--the family chooses the name, but so that when you go to school, they'll use the English name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're given this name at birth just like you're requesting (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at birth exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But the Africans would give their own name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and well, okay, and, sir, and your name is Zulu, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: So would you say it's--is there a proper way to say it in--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Zulu, it's [phonetically, Mm-Se-Za-Ne]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but you don't pronounce the "Mm", it's Msezane [phonetically, Se-Za-Ne].
Speaker 1: Okay, I was talking about the Zulu part, and I know Zulus live in--
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean--
Speaker 1: KwaZulu.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right.
Speaker 1: Is there a proper name for the Zulu language?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that's how it's called, the Zulu, but now, remember, I grew up around Johannesburg [South Africa]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so there, you have a mixture of people.  The emphasis on Zulu is down because there we have (unclear), Xhosas, everybody mixed together.
Speaker 1: In a urban environment?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, sir, now, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was December 38--no, December 31, 1938.  I was born in Springs, which is thirty miles from Johannesburg center.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Springs is like a suburb of South Africa--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --of Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm professor of physics and director of the Center for Theoretical Studies of Physical Systems.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's December 11, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At Clark-Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --(laughter), at the Center for Theoretical Studies--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of Physical Systems.
Story_ID: 24955
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight, little questions that we always ask as just sort of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: All right, good.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Not quite.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Navy blue blazers, I like.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: That's Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't like, I don't care much for vacation.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a--the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "I don't have till the second coming."
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  "I don't have till the second coming".
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, yeah, so my time is very limited here.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24956
Speaker 1: Now, all right, so I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: --I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your father's side.  But we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Esther Msezane, M-S-E-Z-A-N-E. Esther is E-S-T-H-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was in, I've forgotten, 1921, I think April.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Swaziland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's another country, right?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  But in the olden days, you know, at the border between Swaziland and South Africa was, you know, it's just like Mexico and this country, was just free when she was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, and it wasn't--now, Swaziland is a kingdom, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kingdom of the Swazis.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and did the Germans have some kind of stake with that--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, no, they have always been free.
Speaker 1: Always been free.
Speaker 2: They were British protectorates.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Like Lesotho and Botswana [countries in southern Africa], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so, all right, so what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother's family, you know, I had a grandmother, maternal grandmother.  Her name was Vilanzi, V-I-L-A-N-Z-I.  What is interesting, and I have--my grandfather died much earlier, actually when I was young.  And my grandmother was--, my grandfather was a farmer, and my grandmother was a housewife.  But she had very strong personality.  She was a benevolent despot.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) all right.  So she was the matriarch of the family?
Speaker 2: Right, you see also, when we were younger, she strongly believed that kids should learn farming, and all that.  So she took us from my parents from the city, and we lived with her on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where was the farm?  Was this in--
Speaker 2: It was in the Orange Free State, one of the provinces in South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is this where you were a shepherd?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell us about that.  Now, this is--
Speaker 2: Well,--
Speaker 1: Don't tell us yet--
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: --don't tell us yet.  I'm getting ahead of myself.  But we'll talk about that later.  But so your, now, were there stories passed down in your family of what it was like in South Africa, you know, prior to colonialism and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: You know, what's interesting is, on my mother's side, I think there were people who were looking forward.  You know, you were supposed to be preparing to do something.  Like my grandmother, you know, she was a very great storyteller.  I give you an example.  My grandmother knew a lot of herbs and a lot of, you know, concoctions for healing.  You might have thought she was the medicine person.  In Zulu, they call them, Isangomas.  Now, to me what is interesting, she used to talk about medicine.  That's why I became interested in learning.  In fact, in '85 [1985], we were--, my family and I were in England.  And there was a big headlines in the newspaper.  It said, "African frogs heal themselves."  This British scientist skinned the frogs, discovered that actually they secreted certain enzymes, which were superb for healing.  You know what my grandmother used to do, used to take those frogs, if you were hurt, skin them alive, take the skin and put it on your wound.  It healed like magic.  So that was one of the trades my grandmother had and knew.  So then you see I would have been famous if I had listened to her (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, if you could find those frogs now, you could--
Speaker 2: You still find, you find them, but, you know, my grandmother would skin them alive, yeah, and then they would--it was just magical.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it must be some--has anyone investigated the properties of those frogs?
Speaker 2: That's why this British scientist investigated them because they were--and then discovered that there were certain enzymes that the skins of these frogs, you know, secreted, and they were just magical in healing.  I don't know what happened then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess what I'm asking is like are they still using, is anybody using that--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  You know a lot of--(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --those enzymes?
Speaker 2: A lot of things went to the grave with my grandmother as is the case.
Speaker 1: Okay, even with the British scientist, you don't know if he, if they use the enzymes now or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I haven't followed that, you know, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So your mother was born in 1921--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so she was born during the, what the Union of South Africa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during, when, yeah, during that, because the Union of South Africa was established in 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was like dominated by the British, right, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that time, yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: With the Boers and the native Africans, you know, all--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, following a British Parliamentary system or--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, any other stories from your family, from your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's side, again, led, you know, it's--on my mother's side, when I was younger, I tended--remember I said to you, I was a shepherd, so I never went to kindergarten.  So I was busy shepherding, but much earlier, my grandmother and my mother decided that I had a tendency to express opinions, and question authority.  In African customs, that's a no-no.  So they decided, using the model of a school principal, that I would go to school forever till I was ten.  So every time I asked the question, when do I quit school?  Oh, you are still asking questions.  Go back to school.  I'm still going to school even this day.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: So that was the interesting thing about it.  Another thing, you know, so because I was supposed to go to school, regardless, one day I was playing soccer, I got hurt badly.  So when I arrived home, my mom spanked me for stupidity because she thought I would miss school the following Monday.  But my grandmother was on it with a concoction.  The following Monday, I was up and running--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --ready to walk three or four miles to school.  So they basically treated me like a race horse or like a boxer.
Speaker 1: Now, was your mother or your grandmother, were they able to attend school too?
Speaker 2: My grandmother never went to school.  My grand--my mother was maybe grade three or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you see the reason why they wanted me to school, they observed that people who had been to school are polite, respecting.  So sending me to school was essentially self serving.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was to tame you, you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was to tame me so that I would listen to them.
Story_ID: 24957
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Esther Msezane] ever talk about growing up, what it was like for her growing up in--
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, my mother, their lifestyle was very difficult because they lived on a white person's farm.  So the reason why they never went to school is because the farmer used them as a source of labor.  This was a white farmer.  You know, these people, you know, they lived as squatters in the language of South Africa, which means you stay on the white person's farm.  You give the labor in return for staying there.  And so normally, many--some of the farmers did not want the kids to go to school because, you see, if they go to school, nobody would be working on the farm.  You see, that's how, at some point, I became a shepherd too.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me this.  Now, if they were not squatters, where else could they live?  I mean I'm talking because I know--
Speaker 2: You're right.  That's a difficult thing.  That's why some of them, you know, found themselves in the cities.  Otherwise, there was no place for you to stay.  You had to be a squatter because, you know, the South African farms are extensive.  And they use a lot of labor, and so then they had, they need to be provided with the labor.  Otherwise, you have no business staying on the farm if you couldn't work.  You, the parents and children, they all worked for the farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, right, so, just to be clear--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at one time, before colonialism,--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the land was either, you know, controlled by the Zulus--
Speaker 2: The chiefs, yeah, the Zulus (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --or the Xhosa whatever group of those, subdivisions--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of those groups.  And people held the land in common.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But after the Boers came over and the British then, you have like ownership by whites of large tracts of land--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which make it difficult to find some place to be other than on somebody's land.
Speaker 2: I agree with you.  You see what is interesting is the Africans were hospitable, the blacks.  So you come, yeah, we give you a piece of land.  You stay there.  Well, after you have had yourself together, you move on.  But the white man, when he came, they give him land.  He starts building fences.  This is mine, and then the next thing you know, you find the land is gone because we are not used to having fences.  The land belongs to us.  So that's what happened, and then the next thing, the blacks didn't have any land left.
Speaker 1: So you're a squatter on the land--
Speaker 2: Yeah, then you become a squatter.  You know, suddenly you are in somebody's property.  You have to supply the labor.  It's unfortunate that things worked that way.
Speaker 1: Now, was there any homeland for your mother at all--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: Now, remember, now, then the Apartheid system comes in, says the Zulus were sort of in Zululand.  Now, they start assigning people according to their origin.  So your homeland is Zululand.  Swazis, Swaziland, Zuto, whatever it takes, and they put you in the, mostly, those places were barren.  You know, just before the fall of Apartheid, 87 percent of the land belonged to white and 13 [percent] to blacks.  So you can see now--, in fact, and that small percentage was barren.  You couldn't grow anything there.  So then you are sort of forced again into working for the white men on the farms or somewhere else.
Speaker 1: So in other words, you're saying that they would assign you like barren land that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was not necessarily the land that you would choose or the land you were on when (unclear) got there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, you know--
Speaker 1: --that's the most barren land.
Speaker 2: --and what's interesting is, if they perceived that you belonged to this group, they just give, assign you, that's where you're supposed to go.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24958
Speaker 1: But, you know, the dynamics then of my parents and my maternal grandmother, that becomes interesting because, you see, my grandmother was a very strong woman.  And so like in my household, my grandmother and my mother [Esther Msezane], they're like the CEO [chief operating officer] of the company.  They ran everything.  So my dad was like the president.  He was just there, nominal.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: So in this country, people say, they're frightened about being run by women.  Not me.  I had no choice (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's, now, so your mother was born in Swaziland--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and is there--so this a free, I mean this is a kingdom where people are nominally free--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see the Swazis, their land belongs to the king.
Speaker 2: But it's a--from what I remember of the map, it's surrounded by South Africa, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it's land locked.
Speaker 1: Right, except a small part facing the Indian Ocean.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: One which is completely landlocked is Lesotho [country in Southern Africa].
Speaker 2: Okay, so Swaziland does have a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has an access at the back of Swaziland.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, now, is there a story as to why she left Swaziland to go to Johannesburg?
Speaker 1: You know, one of the reasons, once she got married to my dad, then they went to Johannesburg [South Africa] because my dad, also in some sense was like me.  He didn't want to work on the farms.  So he was going to get, you know, get something going in Johannesburg, like many people did.  There were opportunities in Johannesburg.
Speaker 2: Now, Swaziland itself, is it in the mountains or--
Speaker 1: There's a lot of mountains in Swaziland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you see, the Swazis sort of tend to be comfortable, lazy.  Those are my mother's people.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, why do you say that they tend to be lazy?
Speaker 1: No, because, you know, all--this is an honest fact.  If you go to Swaziland, the men in Swaziland are always sitting, drinking.  The women and the children work in the fields.  Sometimes a Swazi might have four or five wives.  Remember the old king had eighty wives.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So these are my mother's people.
Speaker 2: I think the Swazi king, recent--I mean he set a record, didn't he?  He made the tabloids newspapers for having more wives than--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --anybody else?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so then, you know, I'm not making up this story, that traditionally--, because the men sit and drink and that's all what they do, and make babies.  And so the women are the engines of the, the farming.
Speaker 2: So, are you saying this is a cultural trait--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is a cultural thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 24959
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, I'm gonna go to your father's side now.  And then we'll put your mother [Esther Msezane] and father together.  But can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: It's Albert Msezane, the same as mine.
Speaker 1: Same middle name too?
Speaker 2: No, his middle name, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So were you to be a junior or--
Speaker 2: No, I don't, we don't use those labels in South Africa, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Alright, and what is your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It is in 1916, I think it's April.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in South Africa, a town called Piet Retif, P-I-E-T, R-E-T-I-F.
Speaker 1: Piet Retif, I've heard of that somewhere, and I can't remember where--
Speaker 2: You know, because one of the leaders of the Boers in 1838, after the emancipation of slavery, Piet Retif was the leader of the Boers that moved from the Cape into the interior of South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's a Dutch name, the name of a Dutchman who--
Speaker 2: Who left, you know, he was one of--in fact, if you go around 1832, remember in 1832, the British Parliament in one line wrote and said, there shall be no slavery in the British Empire.  Compare that to the Americas.  So in 1838, Piet Retif and his group moved away from the Cape [of Good hope] province which was controlled by the British, moved into the interior.
Speaker 1: Now, was Piet Retif trying to practice slavery?  Was he still practicing slavery?
Speaker 2: Oh, they still had, you know--let me point out.  In South Africa, actually, the South--the South African blacks were never slaves.  What the Dutch East India company would do, would bring slaves from the Far East to the Cape, and then to Europe.  And so they would always fight with the Africans and use them, but not as slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and if I'm--correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that they conquered some of the native people--
Speaker 2: The natives, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and had babies with them, and these became the colored population.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the colored population was enslaved?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think in the context of this country the slavery.  They became basically, closer to the white man.  Now, as they moved into the inter--first, (unclear) when Jan van Riebeeck [Dutch colonial administrator] landed in the Cape, they didn't have women.  Now, the Dutch East India Company would bring slaves from the Far East, Malayan slaves, so, and intermarry with them.  You see, the Cape coloreds, they are very light.  They are very close to the white man because those were a mixture of the Dutch and the Malayans.  The Malayans are very light.  But as they moved into the interior, then they encountered the blacks.  So the, if you go to the interior of South Africa, you find certain types of coloreds that are darker compared to the ones in the Cape.  And so, but the reason why the Boers left the Cape of Good Hope was because the British had abolished slavery.  So they decided to go to the interior where they wouldn't be under British domination.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and when you mention Jan van Riebeeck, that's the Dutch--
Speaker 2: Jan von Riebeeck is the first Dutch person to establish a halfway station in the Cape.  That was in 1652.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, that's right.  Okay, and it was some sort of stop that people could get refreshed before they went around the Cape, right (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right, but remember in 1486, Dias [Bartolomeu Dias, Portuguese explorer] landed at the Cape.  It took then hundred, at least a hundred years for them to establish a halfway station because they thought that the Africans were fierce.
Speaker 1: This is Bartolomeu Dias--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dias and--
Speaker 1: --the Portuguese sailor.
Speaker 2: --and yeah, Portuguese sailors and Vasco da Gama [Portuguese explorer].  They would just land at the Cape and move on.  It wasn't until 1652 that they actually established a halfway station.  They said, oh, the blacks were very friendly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's actually a song by Hugh Masekela [South African musician] called 'Vasco da Gama'. (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, those, you see, I have to respect, you know, those guys, the way they were determined to find the sea route to India.
Story_ID: 24960
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your father's [Albert Msezane] side of the family, and your father was born in Piet Retief as you were telling us about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Piet Retief--
Speaker 1: --who Piet Retief was and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the leader of the Boers, the Africanas.
Speaker 1: So was that a--was a, Piet Retief was a town named after--
Speaker 2: After him.
Speaker 1: --after a Boer leader.  Was it a tough place for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was very tough for, for--
Speaker 1: --Africans to live?
Speaker 2: --blacks there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's why many of them wouldn't stay there, including my dad, went to Johannesburg.  Let me just point out, I knew, my dad had a grandmother.  Well, she was my great grandmother.  Now, my--you know, I couldn't stand that great grandmother.  I once said to my dad, I can't stand that grandmother of yours 'cause she was always vicious.  So my dad said, that's all what I had 'cause he said his dad died when he was very young.  And his mother disappeared, so she was, he said, I was left with my grandmother.  So if she says, "Jump", I say, "How high?"  And my dad was a very strong character person, but he would always dance to his grandmother.  Now, you can see, and his grandmother didn't like us.  And that's why we didn't like her too, simple as all that.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name Conquane (ph.), S-I-K-H-O-N-K-W-A-N-E.  It's hard to pronounce.
Speaker 1: Sikhonkwane, Siquan (ph.), is that it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Conquane (ph.).  It's like a steak.
Speaker 1: Sikhonkwane.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I don't--so this woman was born in the 1850s.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: When she died, she was over a hundred seven [107].
Speaker 1: Well, she must have had--did she have any stories?
Speaker 2: Oh, she had all kinds of stories.  In fact, you know, one of the stories she used to tell.  In 1879, there was the battle between the Zu--it's called, it's the Battle of Isandlwana.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, between the British and the Zulus.  The Zulus defeated the British.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was young, you know, maybe a teenager at that time.
Speaker 1: Now, that's the one, the battle, I think, when the--yeah, the--
Speaker 2: 1879.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: That's when the Battle of Isandlwana came.  You remember, 1879, the Zulus defeated the British.  1881, the British defeated the Boers.  Eighteen 1899, the British and the blacks defeated the Boers.  1910, the Union of South Africa is formed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --excluding the blacks.
Speaker 1: Isandlwana is one, is the battle that's popularized in a movie with Burt Lancaster.  I think he was in a movie about--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Is your--(unclear), do you think or are you thinking of 'Blood River'?
Speaker 1: Not 'Blood River', but that's another battle, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is much earlier though, when the Boers, you know, defeated the Zulus.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But it was, you see, 18--remember 1886--1886, gold is discovered in Johannesburg.  So there was a lot of influx into Johannesburg.
Speaker 1: Yeah, gold is gonna really make a difference in South--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --African history, right?
Speaker 2: Exactly, but you see, before that, 1867, diamond is discovered in Kimberley where you have the DeBeers mines.  So that is 1867.  '86 [1886], gold is discovered in Johannesburg.  It changed the equation of South Africa.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, yeah, the movie is called 'Zulu Dawn'--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with Burt Lancaster, the Battle of Isandlwana, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it's another movie called 'Zulu' about the Battle of Rorks Drift, but I'm not sure--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, (unclear) yeah, it is, (unclear) you're right, there was that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in that one, they show all the Zulus getting killed, but I'm not sure if that really happened in history or not.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You know, also what is important, I tell students that, who are the best people to write about us, except us ourselves--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --because history is very important in that perspective.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then the grandma, my great grandmother, that is, you know, I didn't like her because she was essentially very selfish.
Speaker 1: And how so?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How was she selfish?  Is there a story (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You see what she had, she had the--she had own children.  So the offspring had also children.  So she--but she had control--my dad had resources.  So she would want to see the resources plowed into her immediate family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see, where again, you know, she was Zulu, and then my dad married a Swazi.  It didn't bode well for her that--
Speaker 1: So she didn't like it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She didn't like that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's still amazing how, you know, my wife is, was Canadian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she would rise from the dead if she knew that (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And so, but you see that part, you know, they still didn't like the fact that he married a Swazi.
Story_ID: 24961
Speaker 1: Now, are the Swazis related to the Zulus in a sense?  Do they speak a similar language?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they are related.  You are right.  But for some reason, you see, because the Zulus are under Shaka [most influential leader of the Zulu kingdom], they're called by everybody.  So nobody--even today, you know, some Zulus have the mentality of, you know, like negotiating is not a good thing.  It's a sign of cowardice, yeah.  So then they are used to conquering or dominating.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Zulu, from what I understand, are very marshal people, under the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Precisely, yeah.
Speaker 1: Under Shaka Zulu--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that was terrible under, under Shaka because they conquered all the neighboring countries.  Remember, even as far north as what, Zimbabwe and--
Speaker 1: Right, that's right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly--
Speaker 1: Mzilikazi--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you are right--
Speaker 1: --went up there--
Speaker 2: Exactly, so it is in that context that people don't like them.
Speaker 1: Now, there was, now, the Basuto [Sotho] I think are the only ones that didn't get conquered.
Speaker 2: The Basutos remember, there's a (unclear).  They would climb this mountain--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and roll the stones.  You couldn't reach them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  That's the story.  That's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I've heard--I've read anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But the Zulus were not part of them, believe me.  Even today, I don't think they are.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed that the Zulu took sort of a very conservative position during the independence struggle--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in relationship to ANC [African National Congress, South African political party] and the PAC [Pan Africanist Congress; South African liberation party; now a political party]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The, what is that?  The Inkatha--
Speaker 2: The Inkatha Movement [liberation movement].
Speaker 1: --yeah, movement was kind of, very--it was, you know, kind of hand-in-hand with the Boers (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but if you remember, Luthuli, Chief Luthuli, was Zulu.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: He was--he won the Nobel Prize, Peace Prize in '60 [1960].  He was the President of ANC.
Speaker 1: Albert Luthuli--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Albert--
Speaker 1: --same as your name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right.
Speaker 1: Albert Luthuli.
Speaker 2: In fact, their daughter used to live here for a long time, Tandy Karbashia (ph.), before she went back to South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm saying, you know, even though the Zulus were not behaving well, but there's history in the sense that Luthuli was a Zulu and he was president of the ANC.
Speaker 1: Right, and so I guess the way--once again, correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think the picture you're painting I think is one in which, especially in the cities, a lot of the ethnic groups combine and have common cause, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and elsewhere in South Africa, and the Inkatha Freedom Movement was dominated by just the Zulus--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but that was an expression of a Zulu--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -hierarchy or something (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, it was a perspective of the Zulus.  You are right, but when you go to the cities, you see, we are sort of similar to them.  Yeah, then we have something in common.  You see, the Zulus--it's just like the Xhosas too.  They tend to, they don't want to mix.  Now, it is interesting because the Zulu's are strong, the Xhosas--now the Zulus never conquered the Xhosas.  I don't know, maybe I--and they never attacked them either.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, they were just--was it, the British or the Boers were--the British, I guess, conquered the Xhosas, I guess.
Speaker 2: But, no, you know, they're, these various wars in the Eastern cape because, you see, for example, the Xhosas and the British were always at each other's throat.  You know, they--initially, the boundaries were close to Cape Town.  They moved it toward the Case Common River, the official river in the (unclear).  So the Xhosas ever so often, they'd rise against the British, and they'd feed--they'd fight.  The British would, defeated them and push the boundaries back.  Now, there was a time when the British had established a buffer zone between the Kostas and what used to become--it was known as the Cape of, Cape Inowe (ph.), which was controlled by the British.  Yeah, there's a long history of wars in the what is called the Eastern Cape.

Speaker 1: Now, your father [Albert Msezane], now, did he have a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: No, he just went to standard two.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, so he was a farmer in--
Speaker 2: Not for too long because he decided he'd go to Johannesburg and find for himself.
Speaker 1: Now, had he married your mother [Esther Msezane] before he went to Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: No, it was before--he went before they got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he--did he meet her in Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: No, he met her on the farm while visiting there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he met her in the Orange Free State [South African province]?  Was it--
Speaker 2: No, but, oh, I forgot.  Before they moved, my grandmother moved to the Free State, they lived close to Piet Retief [South Africa], close to where my dad grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he did meet her in Piet Retief?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't meet in the Free State.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they met at Piet Retief or near--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --Piet Retief.  Okay, now, is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't--actually, remember I said my surname, my dad was a lady's man, you know (laughter).  Actually, he used to tell the story that if when he--you know, in those days you had to make fire and (unclear) cook.  He says in fifteen minutes, in fifteen minutes the food was not on the table, he'd be gone.  There'd be a woman who would deliver that.  (Laughter) So apparently, my mom was able to deliver the food in fifteen minutes before he was gone.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So that's how they got, you know, together.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so they moved together to Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they moved together to Johannesburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my other brother, he was born there, and then I was born there.  Now, when we were little, then again, I told you that my grandmother was a benevolent despot.  That's where she decided that kids are supposed to be brought up on a farm, be taught farming.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your parents married in--about what year would it be that they got together?
Speaker 2: Maybe in the early '30s [1930s] or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the early 1930s.
Speaker 2: No, no, around '35 [1935].
Speaker 1: About '35 [1935]?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because that's when my--you know, some of the people just like you have read, the women, the girls married when they're very young.  Just like my mother, I think when she was married, she was quite young, I think about twenty-one to thirty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she would have been around sixteen, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your dad, you know, he wasn't that much older, about twenty-three, I guess, twenty-four?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, you know, they married young, those people then.  I guess that's why they didn't go too far, but my dad was lucky because he had an ambition.  He became a business man--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he did well.
Speaker 1: So that's what he did in South--in Johannesburg?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24963
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit.  Now, many people watching this will never go to South Africa or haven't been, but what was the, you know, Johannesburg like, I guess in those days when he--
Speaker 2: Let me just--, the set up in South Africa in all cities, there were two ways you could live in the city.  You lived in what we called the townships, like Soweto and all those kinds, where you just have blacks, no whites.  Like in Kwathema, you had blacks.  You also had some vestige of Indians and coloreds.  Those lived in separate places.  So, but they were also those who lived in the cities.  They were domestic servants.  So there was a difference between the domestic servants and the people who lived in the township.  So they're in the townships, people traded, you know, it's just like you, you look at there--if you look at some neighborhoods like I used to live by a ghetto here.  It's sort of self sufficient.  The business, you know, goes on.  You don't need to go to town.  So that's how the townships were like.  And then you can have your own business.  They don't bother you.  You know, what's interesting about the way we lived in the townships, compared to today, now, in the townships, many of the people don't pay taxes, 'cause the taxman tells you, know how much we make.  They don't go there.  We would have big, big businesses unregistered, and the water, a lot of the utilities, we don't pay.  You can get by, but, you see, many of them, when you go to the city, everything is tracked.  So in some sense it was nicer to live in the location or the townships than living in town.
Speaker 1: Now, was your father's [Albert Msezane] business in the township or--
Speaker 2: It was in the township because they couldn't, he couldn't trade in the city.
Speaker 1: What kind of business did he have and what--
Speaker 2: He was--
Speaker 1: --was the name of the township?
Speaker 2: --he was buying and selling livestocks. Even though he lived in the city, he would go out and buy all kinds of goods and sell them.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Like, you know, we would sell livestocks for him, like for an example, sheep and goats and cattle.  They'd order, but we'd take care of them, even when I was little, I developed, you know, skills in serving.
Speaker 1: Okay, so sheep, goats and cattle and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of that township that he--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was called Kwathema. It's K-A--you know, K-W-A-T-H-E-M-A, Kwathema.
Speaker 1: Kwathema.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a very nice township, you know, when it was built.  You know, around 1952, I remember, we lived in a village--in a township.  It was flattened by a tornado.  The first time--you know, tornadoes are not common in South Africa.  We couldn't get a decent house.  Luckily, the tornado went and flattened that area.  Then we got a place, we bought a place in Kwathema.  That was luck.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24964
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions and sense of humor, their--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can tell--
Speaker 1: --habits, who--looks, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, I take after both.  I give you an example.  I told you that I was playing soccer.  I got hurt, so my mom [Esther Msezane] spanked me for stupidity.  But then that same Wednesday, my dad [Albert Msezane] and I used to--we're very in good terms, even when I was little.  So I went to him and so I started telling him what happened.  So I said to him, why don't we trade my mom for a better mother?  A mom who will allow will allow us to skip school, slip out.  So my dad stopped counting his money--for some reason, he was always counting his money.  So then he listened.  So I went on, I said--so after I finished, he said, this is serious.  Why don't you wait till you have your own wife.  On comparing notes, we might decide to trade your wife and not mine.  He said, don't you fair--don't you think it's unfair for us to deliberate on mine when you have nothing.  That was the best--you know like, I wouldn't have handled the situation like my dad.  From that time--remember, I was nine.  I never gave my mom any trouble because I was waiting for the day when I could trade her (laughter).  So, and, you see, and my dad, you know, I was telling somebody that my--in my family's house, there was never a raising of the voice.  We were, there was always peace.  You could come as a stranger.  You would find a place to live.  In fact, you know, at my dad's funeral, I pointed out that my parents accepted all kinds of people.  People thought there were many of us.  There were only two of us.  So at the end, one woman said to me, "You know, your parents were very nice.  You remember, I stayed with you for a long time until I found myself.  Now, I'm principal."  And I said, "I didn't remember that we ever took women."  We (unclear) (laughter), my wife would kill me today to hear that we took women, no, but that's how it was.  So I was brought up in a very nice, easy-going environment.  That's why I always had an opinion.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I could sit with my dad and talk with him.  Of course, my mother did not accept nonsense.  She could see when, where I was going to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've got a brother, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Older brother?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 24965
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, the earliest, you see, is just like, when I think much earlier there were--I wasn't smart.  The earliest time I remember, it was on the farm.  You know, I said when I was in grade four, after I came back from the farm, now in the city, I said to this friend of mine, I said, "You know what?  I'm special under the sun."  He said, "Why?"  I said, "The sun is always walking with me." Remember, I used to be a shepherd.  And he said, "Stupid.  Don't you know that the sun also walks with me?"  (Laughter) You see, you know how city people are.  And then for the first time, it dawned upon me that the sun walks with everybody.  And there I thought I was special, wherever I walked, it was there with me.  And so that was, you know, of course, until the city people told me that I wasn't special.  Also, I always thought, we shepherds were special.  Last year around Christmas, I was listening to a radio program.  This preacher said, "Christ came to the lowest of the low."  Guess what, shepherds (laughter).  Can you imagine that?  And there, you always took us very seriously.
Story_ID: 24966
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to ask your brother's name.  What's your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Richard.
Speaker 1: Richard.
Speaker 2: Richard with the same surname.
Speaker 1: Now, did he go into science too or did--
Speaker 2: He was an engineer, electrical, but not the university one, where you go to a technical school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did--were you and your brother sent to the farm?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we was--in fact, even after I retired from the farm, every summer, we would go to the farm and work in it for my grandmother.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when you were a shepherd?
Speaker 2: I stopped being a shepherd at the age of six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, what's interesting is, you know, when I first came here, I was hired at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  It was on a Sunday.  I was interviewed by the late, Gloster.  He was president of Morehouse.  He said to me--
Speaker 1: That's Hugh Gloster, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, tell me about yourself.  How do you tell a person, I say I retired as a shepherd at the age of six, never stayed on one job for more than three years.  He said he'd hire me just like that.  But he discovered I'd never taught blacks in my life.  He was worried.  That's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll get there.  We'll get there.  So, you said that your grandmother and your mother thought that you asked a lot of questions, and you needed to be--
Speaker 2: I needed to be tamed.
Speaker 1: --you needed to go to school.
Speaker 2: In my culture, you don't ask or criticize elders.  It's a no, no.  So if you do that, you need somebody to tame you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I'm still going to school.
Speaker 1: All right (laughter).  So what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, my first school--what was it?  It was a Catholic, it was St. Louis Catholic School, St. Louis.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It had nuns and priests.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was it in Orange Free State?
Speaker 2: No, it was in--now, I'd come back to Kwathema, where you, you know, my parents lived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know what is interesting, this is important.  Many of the earlier blacks that were educated went to these church schools because, you see, the public schools were a mess in South Africa.  So that's why I went to this Catholic school at an early age.
Story_ID: 24967
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The smells--
Speaker 1: Sights, sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the sounds.  You know, what's interesting, we didn't have a clock, but there used to be some gold mines close by.  So the siren was our time, even going to school, you know, seven o'clock, the first shift.  You know you are supposed to get up and get ready.  And the smell of cyanide.  You know, they were treating the mines, you know, the, you know, how the cyanide, the gold mines use a lot of water with cyanide.  So you were smelling that.  And the sounds were those of the gold mines, you know, the--you were, you would hear the wheels turning and the siren.  And, of course, on the farm, you had the sounds of the animals, the cattle, the dogs barking and the birds too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, what's interesting also in those days, now, brothers go there with their Walkie-Talkie, with their earphones, you know, the miners used to have gramophones and carry--you know, these, his master voice--master's voice, the gramophone you wind.
Speaker 1: The kind with the horn on it, the big--
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the horn.  They'd carry it on their heads and move there and listen to the music, honestly.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, you know, then when I think about now I see brothers there, I say those guys were ahead of their time (laughter).
Speaker 1: How did they keep the record level?  How did they--
Speaker 2: But, you know, one of the things, if you look at Africans, especially, the women, they can carry a load and walk, you know, with almost complete stability because you see, if you go and carry and just walk, you won't walk a lot.  And that's what they did.  And, you know, a phonograph is very sensitive, but they'd be walking there and carrying this stuff and listening to their music.
Story_ID: 24968
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you gave us some good sights and sounds.  Any smells [from Msezane's childhood]?
Speaker 2: But I told you about the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: --the cyanide.
Speaker 1: Cyanide.
Speaker 2: And, you know, that was very strong smell because the mines, they were very--the mines around Johannesburg [South Africa], those days, were all over the place.  And so they were generating a lot of these, you know, I don't know whether they are toxic gases, into the atmosphere, 'cause you know these are gold mines.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't sound healthy, cyanide in there.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, you're right.  Those things were not healthy, but we didn't know any of that.  It's like a friend of mine, he said he lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He didn't know that they were poor.  Only the rich people said, you are poor.  So we didn't know that these were toxic gases.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24969
Speaker 1: So now at school in St. Louis Catholic School [Johannesburg]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did you have a favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, my favorite subject has always been mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you about what happened.  So when I got into grade seven in my school, so they had two streams, the smart people were given mathematics.  The dumb people were given Latin.  Can you imagine, even today, I shudder, if they happen to have given me Latin, I would still be in high school today because Latin is not a child's play.  You see, I still don't understand how that system actually came to that conclusion.  But I was lucky.  So they gave me mathematics, and that's what I've always done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So those they gave Latin were in a stream to do literature and stuff like that or--
Speaker 2: You know, I can't--I still, to this day, I cannot understand how you can slam people with Latin because that's, you know, I went through high school,  and there were always, maybe you could count them, the very bright could do Latin.  But us, we'll do the mathematics, and all these other things, but not Latin.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have a favorite teacher at St. Louis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a favorite teacher.  It was a female.
Speaker 1: What was her--do you remember--
Speaker 2: Her name was Mrs. Mabaso.  It's M-B-A-S-O, no, M-A-B-A-S-O, Mabaso.
Speaker 1: Mabaso, okay.
Speaker 2: And I had a teacher in high school who taught me mathematics.  He was superb.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: It was Thlakula, it's T-H-L-A-K-U-L-A, Thlakula.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the principal, and they named the school after him, excellent principal.  That's the person my mom used as a, my parents used as a model of what an education, an educated person looks like.  He was the principal of that school.
Speaker 1: And they named the school for him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, was he your favorite teacher?  Did he teach--
Speaker 2: No, he was the principal.
Speaker 1: He was just the principal, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, he was the one--I skipped grade eight, and I regret why I skipped it.
Speaker 1: Well, did they skip you because you were ahead--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I used to be good.  But the point is, I missed the ability to write, you know, my feelings.  Now, I can only write with my head, not my feelings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I might have learned that in grade eight.  So--
Speaker 1: So you have no problems doing scientific writing, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't know how to write "me."
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said you had a favorite math instructor at, in high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is Xaba.  It's X-A-B-A.  The "x" is "click" [phonetically], Xaba.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was excellent teacher.  We always said he was leaking energy.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, the way he was, you know, very much--you know, you would learn with him even without doing anything.  He was exciting.
Story_ID: 24970
Speaker 1: Now, you were in school, I guess you were growing up during the, during World War II, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so--
Speaker 2: We would hear the Spitfires [fighter aircraft] flying through too.  Remember, the Spitfires.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did the Germans ever attack South Africa during the war?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think.  They never--but South Africans went to war.  No, they did not attack South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, now, were your family members involved in the ANC [African National Congress] or any of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents, remember, we have--basically, there's four of us.  In the ANC, in my town, the organizers, in fact, we had a very strong women league, a component of the African National Congress.  But, you know, some of us participated little.  But I was always working for my dad [Albert Msezane].  I never had time for anything.  Sundays and holidays, I was working for him.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: The interesting thing is, even though we used to sell for him, we never cheated him of his money.  We'd always deliver everything.  We would even go hungry.  I mean I guess maybe, leaving there, even my research could never, never learned, you know, to cheat.  So we were always working and working and working.
Story_ID: 24971
Speaker 1: So, now, did you play soccer in high school [Thlakula School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Did they have a team or did everybody play?
Speaker 2: No, they had a team, you know, where you could play, but, you know, they selected the team.  But, you know, I think the competition where it was not as fierce as in this country.  In fact, [Carlos] Handy [mathematical physicist; also a HistoryMaker], I told you, when we started coaching soccer teams, I--he said to me, "Why, what do you like about soccer?"  So I said to him, "Handy, I like beautiful configuration and beautiful play."  Handy says, "That's African.  I want to be number one."  So I said to him, "What does it take to be number one?"  So he told me.  I said, "With my beautiful configuration and play, you can have your number one."  And he did have his number one.  I just have to orientate, you know, the attack so that we are number one, instead of pleasing people.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, you're referring to your colleague, Carlos Handy--
Speaker 2: Carlos Handy, yeah--
Speaker 1: --who was here at--(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --he and I, yeah, did a lot of things together.  So we coached teams and won, yeah, all kinds of championships.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this, so, okay, so when you're in high school, this is the--is this the British system we're talking about really--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, British system, yeah, right.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're tracked into the mathematical and science--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly, much earlier.  You know, it's funny because even, as soon as I finished, you know, grade twelve, I went to university.  I'd never studied any other subject except physics, applied mathematics and, yeah, and chemistry, first year at university, because in my system, once you go to university, it was assumed that you know all this history, English.  You don't do them, just science stream.  That's what I've done all my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you, in high school, did you run for class office or anything like that or were you--
Speaker 2: Oh, I used to be a class monitor, but I've never liked power myself.  I'd rather work behind the scenes than be at the fore--at the front, don't like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24972
Speaker 1: Now you graduated from high school in what?  1957--six [1956]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty--
Speaker 1: Five, [1955] maybe?
Speaker 2: You know what?  The high school I--, in 1959, I finished my matriculation which is equivalent to grade twelve.  1960, I went to Fort Hare University [University of Fort Hare, Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa].  What is interesting in that, so when I finished in '59 [1959], remember, it was just the time when apartheid [legislatively enforced system of racial segregation by the ruling National Party of South Africa between 1948 and 1994; under this system, black South Africans, the majority population, were discriminated against] was being implemented.  That's critical because I wanted to go and become an engineer.  The government refused, the apartheid government said I couldn't be an engineer because I might destroy the country and myself.  So then I decided to go to Fort Hare, University of Fort Hare.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell that?  That's--
Speaker 2: It's Fort, F-O-R-T, Hare, H-A-R-E.  That's where my dad [Albert Msezane] went too--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, Fort Hare.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is in, this is in '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: No, I went in 1960, beginning of '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24973
Speaker 1: So they [the National Party of South Africa, which enforced the apartheid system of racial discrimination against black South Africans from 1948 to 1994] decided in, at that time--,[University of] Fort Hare [in Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa] was, had been in existence for a long time.  The apartheid government changed the law so that the degrees that were offered, were by the University of South Africa.  University of South Africa was a correspondence college in Pretoria [South Africa], a university.  So they said they didn't want Fort Hare to give easy degrees.  They wanted to control that.  So even though I went to Fort Hare, but my degree is, it has University of South Africa, the certificate.  At one time, the degree was Rhodes University [Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, South Africa], even though one studied at Fort Hare.
Speaker 2: Okay,--
Speaker 1: So that's the difference.  You will not see on my certificate, Fort Hare.
Speaker 2: When we discussed this outline over the phone--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --from Chicago [Illinois], some people on The HistoryMakers' research team] were surprised that you were allowed to go to a university in South Africa with apartheid and all--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, you're saying apartheid actually started while you were on the verge of graduation.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did apartheid, like did they stop people from going to college?
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: All what they did with the apartheid system, before the apartheid system, you could go to the University of Cape Town with, what was Rand University, now University of--the English-speaking universities.  But after apartheid implementation, beginning of 1960, you couldn't go there.  You had, if you were lucky, you would get a special permit from the government.  Then you had Fort Hare which was for certain group of Africans.  You had Westville in the Cape, in, around Cape Town [South Africa], for coloreds.  Then you had the university in Natal which was for Indians.  So after 1960, so people had to go to these ethnical universities.  But Fort Hare all it was, educating coloreds, even Indians, blacks and what not.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: So they didn't close them.  It was just, they had just separate institutions, like basically, the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities in the United States].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  And so the graduates of Fort Hare would be able to either teach in the other black schools or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --and function in the black community--
Speaker 1: Precisely.
Speaker 2: --but separated from whites?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they couldn't go, for an example, and teach at the Wits, at the Witwatersrand University [University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa], or Cape Town--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --UCT [University of Cape Town].
Speaker 2: I remember years ago, at a book auction, I bought some copies of the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'Zault' (unclear; ph.) magazine, remember that, 'Zault'?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember, I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And there were little like cartoon stories like soap operas--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and one lady was a nurse and there was a doctor.  And I said, oh, I didn't know they could be a doctor or nurse in South Africa because I didn't--, you know, so a lot--so you could almost be any profession, but you'd have to be separate from--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, like they had a medical school in Durban [South Africa] for blacks, Indians and coloreds.  So those are the--that's why you find a lot of the medical doctors in South Africa, they were educated in those institutions.
Speaker 2: Right, and I know Nelson Mandela [South African anti-apartheid revolutionary; president of South Africa from 1994-1999] was a lawyer, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mandela was a lawyer.  What is interesting, Mandela went to Fort Hare initially.  Yeah, in fact, there was a Doman Nokwe, Nokwe is N-O-K-W-E.  He was the first African advocate.  You see, the, in the South African system, he was a QC, a Queen's Counsel.  That's a serious law degree.  Only very few people carry those labels.  So he was an African, and he also taught at Wits, at the Witwatersrand University.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 24974
Speaker 1: You know, (unclear) I will have to say to you, when I was growing up, education was paramount.  Now, I want to tell you, you know, what is interesting, because around 1960 or '62 [1962], 1960, there was a treason fire in South Africa, where many of the people, including Albert Luthuli [South African teacher and politician; president of the African National Congress; Nobel Peace Prize Laureate and first African to win a Nobel Prize, 1960/1961] were rounded and charged with treason but where many of us learned was they had some excellent lawyers, like the Jewish community in South Africa was very strong.  To cut a long story short, they defeated the government with its own laws, with its own prosecutors and judges, very impressive.  So that was motivation for us to go to school.  The intellectual capacity of these lawyers, yeah, it's not--it wasn't easy to defeat the South African government at that time.  But they could.  These people were freed, yeah, we know a treason trial in South Africa meant you would hang at the end of the day.
Story_ID: 24975
Speaker 1: So the time that you enter college is about the time that, you said that apartheid is officially implemented?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was being implemented.  There were all kinds of problems.
Speaker 1: And this is when the Boers, you know, get control of the government.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they controlled Parliament in 1948 and pushed the legislation to put the blacks in their rightful place.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, at [University of] Fort Hare [Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa] now, were there--now, you were studying mathematics and did you--
Speaker 2: Physics and chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your--did you take calculus in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did, calculus in my, yeah, in my high school, we did.  Imagine, that was long ago, yeah.  You know, we were taught by nuns.  There's a high school, Thlakula [School], where we had blacks.  Then I went to a high school grade, it was grade eleven and twelve.  So there was a Catholic school, a preparatory school, one of the best in South Africa.  It's called Inkamana.  It's in Natal.  It's a boarding school run by Catholics, nuns, German nuns and fathers.  That's where I did my high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's--can you spell it for us?  It's called--
Speaker 2: It's I-N-K-A-M-A-N-A, Inkamana.
Speaker 1: InKamana High School, it's a Catholic high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was one of the top schools for blacks, high schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you graduated there in '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with matriculation.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  I thought it was Thlakula, but it's not--
Speaker 2: No, the Thlakula is from grade seven to grade nine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's like a middle school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--you're right.  That's a middle school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Sorry about the (unclear)--
Speaker 1: No problem.  So, okay, right, so at Fort Hare, you're well-prepared then to study physics.  You've had calculus and so was this your introduction to physics or did you have it in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where I do it, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Did you have it in high school at all?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did you have physics in high school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't have physics in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But, you see, the mathematics was good enough.  You know what I didn't tell you.  When I went to school, my grade, I wasn't good at many languages, but I was good at mathematics because I used to be able to count sheep.  You count in ones, in fours, in fives.  You know, you know a sheep, a flock of sheep is running through.  You have to pinch, sometimes they are jumping, sometimes they are walking.  So you keep a running total in your head.  So I have always been good at mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now were there any special teachers at Fort Hare that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, in fact one of them was a Professor Davidson.  He came from Scotland.  He taught us physics, one of the finest persons and teacher too.  He taught many of us physics.  That's how we got to like physics--, Scottish person.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, physics, you know, in 1959 when people thought of physics, they thought of Albert Einstein and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the great, the rocket scientist and that sort of thing.  So, were you interested in physics from the standpoint that, you know, Einstein split the atom and that sort of thing or did you, I mean did you--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You know, I was interested in the atom, but my interest in physics--, to be honest with you, the other subjects didn't give me trouble.  But physics, you--always tended to give trouble.  So I thought, once I fix it, then I'd move on to the things that I understand better.  I'm still at it today (laughter) and still it gives me trouble (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were trying to get it out of the way--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, so--
Speaker 1: --because it was the hardest subject?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I can go and do this stuff I like, that's easy going but I've never had it fixed.  There's always trouble.  You know, I've published hundreds of papers with collaborators, but it still gives trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So Fort Hare, now, is there--are there any people in school with you that we would know, whose names we know now?
Speaker 2: You know, one of the things is many of the people just fell by the wayside.  There's a colleague in, he is in South Africa--no, actually, he went to high school with me.  He's a very big business guy.  But, no, not those that I went to school with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's unfortunate because there were some bright students I knew, but probably they were not as tenacious as I was.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have time for the same--you know, what goes on at American college campuses, did you have fraternities and stuff--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I never had time for that.  In fact, you know, I'll give you an example.  When I was at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], the students say, you--I said, "You guys, why don't you just sit and work?"  They said, "Look, first you go to school to have fun.  And then, you know, study. When you are as old as you are, you don't have the energy to have fun."  There I was beginning to believe them.  And maybe I didn't know while I went to school (laughter), and so, I, I just started, you know.  And that's all what I liked.  I still do the same thing today.
Speaker 1: But, all right, so no real extracurricular activities at school, but you stayed on campus, right, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, you know, Fort Hare was residential.  We used to, no, like for example, we played chess.  It was easy and played tennis, not competitive sports like we do--you do it in this country, no.  These were simple things.  Actually, you know, my system also was more academic than anything else.  You know, the academics, even today I'd give anything just for the intellectual capacity.  That's still what is in my mind.  I don't care about the other things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, okay, so you were at Fort Hare on a Rotary--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rotary International--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --International scholarship, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24976
Speaker 1: So I guess your grades--do they have the same grading system that the American system has, A, B, C, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, but you see, the South African system is based on the British.  It's much stringent.  For an example, you would see a 65, 66 percent, is a distinction in a subject.  With you, you would think it as a, you know, as an area, you would fail me.  (Unclear) the system is so hard that that's considered extremely good.
Speaker 1: Is it, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 65 is, as I say, it's a first, it's a distinction, not even excellent.  It's way up. 33 percent, that's the (unclear) grade, you pass (laughter), but it's like getting a C or so, 33 percent, where in this country, you know, I'm at--there's no lower grade than 33.  I don't know if it's a grade lower than F.
Speaker 1: But you have to know more material though there, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you see, the also, the tests, the exams are very challenging.  In our case you start in January and write the final exam in November or October.  So, you see then, if you fail, it means you wait 365 days.
Speaker 1: Oh, to do it again?
Speaker 2: There is no in between.  .
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you were nearing the end of--now, you were at Fort Hare for four years or was it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Four and a half years.
Speaker 1: Four and a half years.
Speaker 2: I was, three years I get the B.Sc., Bachelor of Science.  That was in 1962.  In 1965, I get the B.Sc.-Honors.  It's another--, you go for two years or a year, and you get a separate degree.  In other words, the B.Sc.-Honors is--, you study nothing but physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's B.Sc. like a "B", capital "S" and a small "c"?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But then it has "honors".  It's, "honors", it means, and that's a, just a degree by itself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You specialize.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 24977
Speaker 1: Okay, so when--now, did you think that you would go on to teach or go to graduate school [after graduating from the University of Fort Hare with a BSc-Honors degree in physics in 1965]?
Speaker 2: I still wanted to go to graduate school.  At that point, I wanted to do physics.  Now, that is when, you know, apartheid [legislatively enforced system of racial segregation by the ruling National Party of South Africa between 1948 and 1994; under this system, black South Africans, the majority population, were discriminated against] now was in place.  The government said I couldn't go to the Witwatersrand University [University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa] nor University of Cape Town, 'cause that's the place I could do a Ph.D. in physics.  So I got a scholarship to go either to Oxford, England or Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, you know, at [University of] Fort Hare, there was a visiting professor.  I've forgotten what, from what institution.  He was very nice.  He was not stiff like our teachers, and I liked the model.  So when I had the chance to go to England, I decided to go to Canada, which was closer to the U.S.  That's where that changed my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So I went to the University of Saskatchewan [Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada] on a World University Scholarship.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was in 1960--I got it in 1965, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a world university scholarship.
Story_ID: 24978
Speaker 1: All right, so University of Saskatchewan--
Speaker 2: Saskatchewan.
Speaker 1: In Saskatoon--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Canada.  So, now, South Africa is not really, really hot.  It's kind of cool, right?  But it's not like Canada (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, no, no, you're right.  You know, I was also curious.  How do people live in snow, 'cause you know, if you had a vestige of snow, it would close everything in South Africa.  So I was curious as to when do--that's why I was ready to go to Canada.  And I was going to--I had gone there to study nuclear physics.  It was fascinating for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went there to study nuclear physics.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The subject that the gov--South African government didn't want me to study, 'cause you know, nuclear physics, they thought I would make bombs, kill myself and kill people.
Speaker 1: So they were thinking that if native South Africans studied physics, they'd be able to make a bomb that would be able to dislodge the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: --the government.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't want to, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did you get--so, but once you got over there, they couldn't stop you, could they or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but once I got over, you know, they--sometimes stupidity is good.  The South African government said, like they didn't want me to come to the U.S.  I could go to Canada because those people are as ignorant as you are, Eskimos.  That's what was in their heads.  So that was my luck.  Here, they thought, you can't learn anything from those people (laughter).
Speaker 1: So they had a low opinion of Canada?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they had no idea, you know, what Canada was about.  The Africana's knew the United States, the England, that's all, and Germany.  The rest of the countries didn't count.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so well, at University of Saskatchewan--
Speaker 2: Of Saskatchewan.
Speaker 1: --who were your advisors?
Speaker 2: My advisor was Ray Skinner, S-K-I-N-N-E-R.  I'll tell you an interesting story.  I was supposed to do experimental nuclear physics.  But there was a Dr. Katz, he drew a Feynman diagram on the board.  I didn't know what the Feynman diagram is.  So Katz says, you cannot work in my group because if you don't know what--this is fundamental.  So I went to Ray Skinner.  The students were terrified of him.  He was very good.  But then luckily, he accepted me and he was happy.  And that's where I got my master's [degree] at the University of Saskatchewan in theoretical nuclear physics.
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: Now, I can tell you at the University of Saskatchewan, I used to participate in many things.  At that time, one of the interesting subjects was, even in North America was, the issue of IQ.  So one professor had given a talk about, you know, the subject.  So I criticized him.  My wife was in the audience.  Then at the end, with her friends, she comes and says, how stupid could you be, criticized, challenged this professor when you just came from Africa (laughter).  So, but anyway, that's--this, anybody would come and approach me like that, only my mother [Esther Msezane] could do that.  So that's how we know, we started dating.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, so out of conflict comes--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Exactly--
Speaker 1: --harmony.
Speaker 2: --anybody who can confront me must be serious 'cause nobody, people normally don't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what phase of physics were you drawn to at University of Saskatchewan?
Speaker 2: It was this theoretical nuclear physics.  The theoretical aspect to me was fascinating and more interesting because there were essentially no boundaries.
Speaker 1: Did you--I mentioned Einstein [Albert Einstein] a few minutes ago, but who were your heroes then in terms physicists?
Speaker 2: You know, to be honest with you, you see, Einstein comes in basically in terms of the astrophysical environment.  Since I was interested in nuclear physics, you have [Eugene] Wigner.  Wigner is one of the big shots in physics, and also Feynman.  Feynman was at Cal-Tech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California].
Speaker 1: This is Richard Feynman.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those are the, to me, you know, at that time, because they were looking at the fundamental physics.  You see, Einstein, yes, the theory of relativity and all those things, but when it comes to fundamental physics, those guys do feature.  You have, you know, the Feynman diagram.  You have Wigner (ph.), Wigner used to--when I was at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], he used to come there too.  So these are examples of people that actually motivated me to do the field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, as I grow older, you know, then you can throw in the relativity in the fundamental physics.  Then Einstein comes in.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you were awarded--you were there on an Oppenheimer Memorial Scholarship--
Speaker 2: I got an Oppenheim--Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, the Sir Oppenheimer, I can say he was the chairman of the Anglo-American corporation, you know, the corporation that owned many of the gold and diamond mines in South Africa.  It's called Anglo-American Corporation.  As you can see from the label, it's American and British.  It has fancy offices in Johannesburg [South Africa].
Speaker 1: Okay, when I saw Oppenheimer, I thought it was J. Robert Oppenheimer, but it's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, it is--
Speaker 1: --Sir--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, that's a Sir because he was the chairman of Anglo-American Corporation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24979
Speaker 1: All right, now, you worked on--now, did you--now, you finished, did you go--well, no, you took a break after you finished your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Then, but the scholarship said I had to go back to South Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But tell us, what was your thesis for your master's degree, what was it about?
Speaker 2: Well, my thesis, it involved, form factors of the deuteron.  Like if you think about the deuteron is like a proton which at that time was supposed to be probably the smallest particle.  But if you probe this deuteron with high energy, you begin to see the structure.  The being to see the mesons, you begin to see other particles.  Of course, recently, if you probe the proton even deeper with high energy particles, then you begin to see the quarks and anti-quarks.  Most recently, in July this year [2012], they discovered the Higgs boson, one of the most fundamental of the particles.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a particle they started looking for in the 1950s or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, many years ago.  Remember, actually, they labeled it the God particle because [Leon] Letterman [American physicist; Nober Prize in Physics Laureate, 1988] said, this God, where is this God--,what is it, God damn particle.  Well, he was--that's how he reacted so people christened it as the God-particle.
Speaker 1: Shocking.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but to me it's exciting because it gives you the fundamentals, you know, the Big Bang, and all that, they start from there.
Story_ID: 24980
Speaker 1: So you had to, so when you finished your thesis for your master's degree, you had to go back to South Africa?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Then, you know, at the University of Saskatchewan [Canada], there was a powerful--like this Dr. Katz.  He knew the director of the Nuclear Physics Research Institute at the Witwatersrand University [University of the Witwatersrand] in South Africa and simply told him to take me, regardless of government policy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it legal for you to go to school there?
Speaker 2: It didn't matter to Katz because Katz didn't live--so when I went there, they maneuvered things.  I was, I did go into the Witwatersrand University.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1968?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 1969.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, and you got your master's degree in sixty--
Speaker 2: '68 [1968]--no, at sixty--yeah, formally, it was awarded in '68 [1968]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, you know, in '68 [1968], I had gone, I had started at the Witwatersrand [University]--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Remember, sometimes you finish the requirement, and the degree is formally awarded, it may be six months or three months later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at Witwatersrand University, now, what was your Ph.D. dissertation about and who was your advisor?  Was your advisor--
Speaker 2: At the Witwatersrand University was Sellschop.  It's S-E-L-L-S-C-H-O-P, Sellschop.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was your advisor?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there was another guy too, at the University of South Africa.  He would come, his name was Dr.--Professor Lemmer, L-E-M-M-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's at University of South Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Pretoria.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, and so tell us about your dissertation?  What was it about?
Speaker 2: Now, the dissertation was to study low energy nuclear, low energy nuclear physics reactions.  Now, [pause], low-energy nuclear physics reactions.  Now, let me just point out because I never completed that.  Now, at that time, the special branch was very active.  You know, these are the secret police by the South African government.  So what changed my life at that time, you see, the special branch visited me because I was in the Witwatersrand when it wanted me to work for, for the government.  Now, this is a secret person, informer.  And contrary to what I was taught at [University of] Fort Hare, it was interesting because, you know, the people at Fort Hare used to tell you that the special branch are stupid.  They are not.  So the man told me, he wanted me to work for him.  He'd give me a brand new car, lots of money, lots of that, but as soon as somebody starts criticizing the government, I would take the notes, give it to him, and he'd deal with them.  So I convinced him--that's why I respected these guys, that me, being a physicist, I'm not exposed to people.  So he would pay me a lot of money, and I'm not worth that kind of money.  And the man, you know, agreed that, you know, I was right.  So, actually, he said he'd never met anybody like me to turn him down.  He says if I--he said, if I ever needed help, I should not hesitate to contact him.  The same week, that Friday, my passport arrived home.  The government had kept it for fifteen months, 'cause I wanted them to extend it.  They wouldn't.  And so it was extended, and then I left South Africa for good, never went back again because then I realized this guy was reasonable.  I could convince him on the basis of logic.  But some other agent, I may not be able to do that.  And so then when they gave my passport, and I respected the man because when I said I wasn't, I was essentially worthless.  But, you see, that part was common in South Africa around that time.  You remember, people used to tie tires around people's neck and set them on fire, traitors.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I couldn't do that.  You know, even today I'd probably say, you can't buy me by offering money.  You can convince me logically that we have to go for an enterprise.  It's as simple as all that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--okay--
Speaker 2: So that's how I left the Witwatersrand--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --back to Canada, now to Ontario.
Story_ID: 24981
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is the University of Western Ontario?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I start my Ph.D. then.
Speaker 1: All right, this is 1969.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, at that time, this is important, my wife had come from Canada to South Africa to get me.
Speaker 1: Oh, now, this is--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She (unclear) me.
Speaker 1: Now, is this--is your wife a white Canadian or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a white Canadian, yep.
Speaker 1: And so she went to South Africa--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, it's not hard for a white Canadian to get in, but to--did she her know--let them know--
Speaker 2: She would go to Canada.  It's interesting because even in South Africa, you see, one of the interesting things is she came to South Africa and just (unclear) told me that it's not worth staying there.  I should leave South Africa.  But, of course, we couldn't, she didn't know that I couldn't do that with the South African government openly because I would hang.  That's how the South African government policy was.  I couldn't date a white female.  It is interesting though, now, she's late, of course, the South African government had said, such a marriage would never happen.  If it did, it would fail.  My marriage never failed.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she came--so, you couldn't really reveal to the South African government you were married, could you?
Speaker 2: No, because we left there in South Africa and went--when I arrived in Ontario, '69 [1969], we married then.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, you weren't married then, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24982
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, now, then, now I understand that you're a theoretical physicist, and so your experiments are in your head.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so what were you working on for your Ph.D. [at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada]?  What were you working on?
Speaker 2: In my Ph.D., I did collision theory, as I've always done collision theory.  You know what's interesting in this collision, I used electrons and photons.  Photons are quantum, quantum of light.
Speaker 1: So photons are light particles?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so--
Speaker 2: So I did my Ph.D. on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I think it's--
Speaker 2: That's where I met Daniel Basses (ph.).  Remember the guy you talked, we talked about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --at Texas with Carlos Handy [mathematical physicist; also a HistoryMaker]?
Speaker 1: Yes, the colleague of Carlos Handy's--
Speaker 2: That's where I met Daniel, Daniel--
Speaker 1: And he's from France, right?
Speaker 2: Right, he was visiting Western Ontario.  So I did research.  I did some work with him too, mathematical investigations.  And he and I published a paper, and when I finished my Ph.D., I stayed and worked in teaching self-paced method of teaching.  Then a friend, I came to the states for post-doc.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now was--okay.
Speaker 2: There weren't many--there weren't blacks in my classes, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: None?
Speaker 2: No, not in physics--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: When you--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) even at the University of Saskatchewan, there were not--
Speaker 1: Were you the--as far as you know, were there any other South African blacks that--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --received a Ph.D. in physics?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  In many cases, I was the first, but I don't want to talk about that.  Even yet, there's a--there are many things where I'm first.  As I remember, I don't want to talk about myself.  I don't want enemies.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (laughter).  Well, we're not gonna get you enemies, but I think it's, because it's an oral history, it's important to find, you know, that you were first--
Speaker 2: I was first in many, many things, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, and at that time, did you know of any other black Ph.D. candidates in physics from South Africa at all?
Speaker 2: No, not in South Africa.  At that time, there was only one person at that time who got a Ph.D. from Wits, from Witwatersrand University [University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa].  He became dean of [University of] Fort Hare [Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa].  That's, you know, for a long time, there were no Ph.D.s in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24983
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, this is--now, you can't go back to South Africa now, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, I can go back--
Speaker 1: I mean, no, no, not now, I mean, but in 1969?
Speaker 2: In nineteen sixty--no, remember, I left in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, of course, it makes things--
Speaker 1: So after you got your Ph.D., could you go back if you wanted, you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but then it becomes complex because I have a white Canadian wife [Gail Msezane].  Then how am I gonna go back because that's a cardinal sin, punishable by death, yeah, so, couldn't go back.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's worse than I thought.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It's worse than I thought.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So it's a crime punishable by death?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, because there, you know, because what happens is, it is--let's suppose if you are dating a white person, the government will arrest you, change it, says it was rape, even if you didn't do that.  So that by itself, you hang for that.  It's almost unbelievable.  You could look at the white woman, and it's--and sometimes I look back, I say, I used to be brave (laughter).  I know it doesn't matter, but it's past now.  So I couldn't go back because of that.
Story_ID: 24984
Speaker 1: Okay, so you took a post-doctoral [position] here in the states, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: First at Georgia State [University, Atlanta, Georgia] with a friend of mine, Steve Manson.  I must say that when I worked with Steve, Steve Manson, M-A-N-S-O-N, changed the dynamics of research completely because his model was first, we have to publish in a prestigious physics journals.  Otherwise, we don't count.  And that's what, you know, was imbedded in my head.  For the first time, I could see us publishing in some of the prestigious physics journals.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you publish your first paper?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, about--my first paper was published in, when I was at Western Ontario [University of Western Ontario, London, Canada] for (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But with him, in this--between '75 [1975] and '79 [1979], we published lots of papers with Steve Manson here, and he exposed me to many of these very high-powered physicists.  One of them is Ugo Fano from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], one of the top physicists at that time, yep.  And there's a large--and then he also made me attend the meetings of the American Physical Society and introduced me to many people.  I also attended the international conferences.  And that bothered me because you had, you don't see blacks, even in America.
Speaker 1: Well, not many.
Speaker 2: Yeah, even today, you still don't see many.
Story_ID: 24985
Speaker 1: Okay, so in '76 [1976], it says here, you worked as an instructor at the University of New Brunswick [New Brunswick, Canada]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't like it 'cause these people didn't like to do research.  They thought, you know, you're supposed just to teach.  I didn't like that.  So in '78 [1978], a friend of mine, he was at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Juan Handley, accepted me.  So I--now, at that point, we immigrated from Canada to the U.S., and I went to LSU.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Louisiana State University.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, now, Dr. Diola Bagayoko [also a HistoryMaker] was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, infact, you know--
Speaker 1: Did you know him?  He's from--
Speaker 2: --you point out that Bagayoko.  LSU had very good people at that time.  Now, Bagayoko, you see, I'm at post--I've finished Ph.D.  Bagayoko comes in.  He's very impressive.  There used to be a professor, Joe Calloway.  He drives students crazy, yeah.  This guy, very talented.  If he says he wants this, you give it.  And he'd drive many students, you know, to tears.  But Bagayoko comes in.  Here, he's an African, starts controlling Joe Calloway's empire, and Joe is happier than ever before.  It was amazing.  I respected the guy.  I said, you know, you never heard Joe Calloway complaining.  He was just that good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's one of the few people I could see a black face at LSU.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so he was also in theoretical physics (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you're right, exactly, because Joe Cal, as I say, Joe Calloway was a well-known theoretical physicist.  I respected Diola because he could make Joe Cal very happy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so this is in 1978?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you were there for, what, four years then, at LSU?
Speaker 2: No, two years.
Speaker 1: Two years, okay.
Speaker 2: Remember, I, yes--
Speaker 1: Oh, '78 [1978] to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I went from '78 [1978] to '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: '80 [1980], January, I'm recruited by Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I'm curious to see where, what a black, very good black institution does.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you had never been on a black college campus before?
Speaker 2: No, never.
Speaker 1: Now, you must have had some association with Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], right, right by, from LSU?  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: No, not at all?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's right, it's right down the road.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know that it's down the road.  But for some reason, I never.  You see, even here, remember I said when Hugh Gloster hired me, when he discovered that I had never taught blacks in my whole life, he was worried about that.  And rightfully so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Hugh Gloster was the president of--
Speaker 2: Of Morehouse.
Speaker 1: --of Morehouse.  He took Benjamin Mays' place, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right around that time, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, because 1980, Gloster hires me.
Speaker 1: And you said in your interview, you said that (laughter), you said you quit your sheep herding job when you were six [years old] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and never stayed on one job for more than three years.  I stayed three years there and quit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was sort of a self-fulfilling profit--prophecy.
Speaker 1: Now, what--so you're hired in as a professor here at Morehouse.  Now, why did you--well, you were--well, did they have a pretty good offer?  Was it a good offer?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't that smart.  I never, you know, if you say to me, I want you to make a difference there, I join you.  I never negotiated any offers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that you're supposed to do that.  All what I was interested in, I wanted to see what is it that makes this institution not to crank as many, you know, Ph.D.s, because I was always concerned about why are we so few in physics, blacks.  Then I went to Morehouse.  Then I could see why.
Speaker 1: What was the physics department like when you got there?  I mean what was-(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: When I was in there, it wasn't good, to be honest with you.  Again, probably, normally, my standards are also high.  What happened is, you know, first day, Dr. Gloster introduces us to the faculty, first mistake I made.  I had research grants.  I said to him, "I don't understand how I can do my research with no clerical assistance.  However, I'm happy to be at Morehouse."  Can you imagine, and people said, "How can you embarrass the president like that?"  But the following week, I got a secretary.  And Gloster and I got along very well.  When I left Morehouse, Gloster pulled the secretary out.  So, I respect him for that 'cause I just told him upfront.  For me to be effective--had two research grants.  He needed to give me the support, okay.
Story_ID: 24986
Speaker 1: So we were talking about your arrival at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were saying you had to get a clerical aid because--
Speaker 2: Right, it's like a secretary in the department.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause you had research projects you were already--
Speaker 2: Yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --doing, and you were bringing those with you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what research projects were you working on at (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was working on, you know, this amazing one, electron collisions with ions and atoms and also photon interactions with atoms and--you see, these projects were of interests to Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Labs.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they funding these projects?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Do--you know, what's still amazing, I have, I still have funding from the Department of Energy [DoE], Fundamental Interactions Branch, since I was at Morehouse.  It's a very competitive program.  I also had funding from the National Science Foundation [NSF].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the one for the DoE, even to this day, I still maintain that.  It's, I'm the only minority in the group that it has institutions, researchers from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] and all those big institutions.  I'm the only one that is black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've been forever.
Speaker 1: So were these DoE research projects with, that were of interests to Oak Ridge and Livermore, the collision stuff?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but this is now, this division of the Department of Energy, it deals with the fundamental branch.  In other words, we are not interested in applied (unclear).  We look at the problems at the most basic level.  And so this is a flagship, that program is the flagship of the Department of Energy.
Story_ID: 24987
Speaker 1: All right, so, now, what--did Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], was their approach to teaching and research reasonable when you got here.  I mean did they, because I (unclear) (simultaneous), a lot of the black--
Speaker 2: Un-un, no--
Speaker 1: --schools want you to teach more than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they want you to teach more, even when you have research grants.  They don't understand that you're supposed to be given enough time to do the research.  Now, I don't know.  There's a Carl Spight [also a HistoryMaker].  He came from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Dr. Carl Spight, I know him.
Speaker 2: Oh, you know him.  Yeah, he's a guy, he has ideas, full of energy.  He had just--was leaving as chairman of the physics department at Morehouse.  He had a nice lab there.  But it wasn't working.
Speaker 1: And what was wrong, what was wrong?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was wrong?  I had heard that he was trying to--we interviewed Keith Jackson [also a HistoryMaker] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you are right, yeah, but you see, the point, the problem is, they don't have the resources for them, you know, to underwrite the kind of research Carl Spight was interested doing.  You see why many of us, especially at HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] do theory, because the support infrastructure is poor.  Now, in our case, why I'm success--by any standard, I'm successful in physics.  The reason why I'm successful, I learned much earlier to hook up with people with very powerful computers.  Now, with the Department of Energy, I use those super computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.  I also used the computers at the Queen's University of Belfast in England.  So I have collaborators in Russia and in India.  So my work will always go on.  But, you see, HBCUs cannot provide what I want.  If I did not form the collaborations and so that, you know, most of the time, you know, those guys are working, I'm working.
Speaker 1: So, in theoretical physics--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: As we were alluding to before, you don't necessarily need quite the--or do you, need quite the monetary support as someone doing--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The experiments, yes, you're right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But theoretically, the nice thing is, there are these national lab facilities, like super computers.  Like my colleague, now, the University of Tennessee too has a super computer.  We also use that.  We use many computers that belong to other people.
Speaker 1: Now, do you use the National Accelerators like the Thomas Jefferson Accelerator and the other--
Speaker 2: No, you know, those are experimental facilities.  You know, there are these national computing centers where we can, you know, like Illinois, you can access them or the DOD [Department of Defense] super computers, the Department of Defense.  So there, you see, all what you need to do is just to gain access, and you can compute till the second coming.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was wondering about in terms of colliders and stuff and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but remember, I'm theoretical.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're not really--
Speaker 2: So I don't do the experiment.  You know, all what I'm saying is, you do the experiment.  I do the theory.  We can compare.  In fact, one of the breakthrough we have today, and which is unbelievable, we have, we can catalyze methane into a useful product like methanol without CO2 [carbon-dioxide] emission.  That's our latest paper.  It appeared in 'Gold Bulletin'.  So those kinds of breakthroughs and--, you know, unless you have the super computers--I have people here that work with me.  Otherwise, you know, if--HBCUs cannot that kind of research competitiveness.
Story_ID: 24988
Speaker 1: So in '82 [1982] you were promoted to associate professor and became a full professor in 1983--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --one year afterwards.  But at Atlanta University [Georgia], not at--
Speaker 2: They recruited me as a full professor here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At Clark, at Atlanta University, you're right.
Speaker 1: How did that happen?  I mean what happened?
Speaker 2: You know, one of the things again, they, you see, the building, the research building across there, they wanted money from DoE, the Department of Energy.  And so the Department of Energy says, I'm there and Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and they could recruit me.  I give credibility to the enterprise.  That's how they recruited me.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was Luther Williams at Atlanta?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Luther Williams comes, you see, Luther and I--Luther is very good, no question about it.  He understands the research.  But the people, many of the people there don't, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, there was--I know Keith Jackson [also a HistoryMaker] was telling us that when he got here, they were talking about physics for teachers, and they had about several subjects that were like physics for different applied uses.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was saying, there's only one physics.
Speaker 2: I agree with you.
Speaker 1: Not all these different kinds, and he said that they were, that's part of the discussion that Carl Spight had with the students, the grad [graduate] students, that there was one kind of physics, and these other subjects, I mean these other--that they were teaching--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --weren't really physics.  And most of the, he said that a lot of the faculty, staff here, didn't understand what physics was about or what--how to support the department.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you see the problem is also the people who run these institutions, sorry to say that, they are ignorant.  They do not understand the research.  I give you an example.  With the Department of Energy, we always meet once a year in Washington [District of Columbia].  As I said, these come from the big institutions.  You know what?  Some of them teach one, two courses a year.  Here, even I have three, once they want me to teach three courses.  There's no assistance.  You know, you can only do so much.  So then you see already you're starting at a negative position compared to your counterparts at the other institutions.  And you don't have the facilities.  Now, the nice thing with me, remember I said, with [Carlos] Handy [also a HistoryMaker], we coached teams.  We learned how to compete even under, you know, as I said, challenging environments.  That part, you know, Handy and I learned to--we would compete, get into the Department of Defense [DoD], you know, collaborations.  Our co-partnership would win.  At one time, we used to control lots of money.  You see, Handy and I, our chemistry just resonated beautifully.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 24989
Speaker 1: So, now, when did Dr. Handy get here, I mean to Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Actually, I found him here in '80 [1980].  Maybe, he maybe came, maybe six months before.  Remember I said I found him lost with his talents, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could focus him.  He could focus me too, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a rich collaboration?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a very--yeah, because we did resonate, you know, our personalities.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, what kind of projects were you and Dr. Handy working on?
Speaker 2: We worked, you know, Dr. Handy was more mathematical.  I was more theoretical physics.  So, for an example, one of the things was he worked on wavelengths, you know, target detection for, you know, the [U.S.] Army.  For an example, if you have a tank buried in cluster, clutter, as they call it.  It's hidden in an environment.  You had to generate an algorithm to detect the presence of the tank, using the heated rod (unclear).  And so we built a capability then.  In fact, I'll show you a certificate we got from DoD [U.S. Department of Defense], a collaboration.  We hook up, well, we did hook up with a French group at (unclear), Belgium groups, bring them together.  It was at that time when we brought our capability to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the Institute for Theoretical Physics and had an international conference.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what year?  What year is this?
Speaker 2: It was in '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: '98 [1998], okay.  Okay, so we're really moving here.
Speaker 2: Remember, we're already here with Handy.  The question I was responding to was--
Speaker 1: So, what was he--
Speaker 2: --Handy came six months, I think, before I came here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was the name of your conference in, at Harvard?  What's the name of it?
Speaker 2: It was, what is it?  Wavelengths, Wavelet--, 'Wavelets and Application in Physics and Astronomy', something like that.  I can get you the exact title.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, if you go to the ITAMP [Institute for Theoretical Atomic Molecular and Optical Physics, Harvard University] website, click that, you will see us.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this was held at Harvard [University].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was held at Harvard because, I mean instead of Atlanta U [University], because?
Speaker 2: We were driving the thing.  So for us, it was convenient to have it at Harvard because they have the facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay, they had better facilities for it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had conferences, yeah, the international conference, it deals with ions.  With Lawrence Livermore, we co-sponsored it with Lawrence Livermore National Labs, us, and IBM [International Business Machines, Inc.].  We had it here at CAU [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  In fact, we used the Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] facilities.  We were driving the collaboration.
Speaker 1: And what year was that held?
Speaker 2: It was in 1994, I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so International Conference--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, electron ion collisions, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Brought people from Europe, and, yeah.  We could do that.  Even today, I can do that.  One of the greatest accomplishments too, in 2005, celebrating 100 years of [Albert] Einstein's miraculous accomplishment, I brought together close to fifty U.S. scientists to go to South Africa, and we headed the first U.S.-Africa Advanced Institute on Photon Interactions.  There we got some of the people from Argonne [National Laboratory, Illinois], Harvard--Alex Delgana, from Harvard too.  He was there.  There were lots of people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we celebrated the hundredth anniversary there.
Speaker 1: This is 2005?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: In 2005?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the hundredth anniversary of his discovery, Einstein's, his photoelectric effect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The National Science Foundation [NSF] put the money.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let me just, I'm still kind of--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a hundred years of the theory---not the theory of relativity, but the--
Speaker 2: No, it's called, you see, you remember, actually Einstein did not get the Nobel Prize for relativity [theory of relativity].  He got it for the photoelectric effect.
Speaker 1: Okay, photoelectric effect.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, but then, that is the year that was marked as, in two--in '05 [2005]--what is it?  In 1905, he wrote the theory for that.  So we were celebrating the hundredth years' anniversary of this miracle, miraculous accomplishment by him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, there's a picture on the internet of Einstein delivering a lecture at Atlanta U to black students?
Speaker 2: Yeah?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: This had to be in--
Speaker 2: Oh, at Atlanta U--
Speaker 1: -- the '40s [1940s] or early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Oh, that was great.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's sitting at Atlanta U with a chalkboard behind him and he's--
Speaker 2: You--
Speaker 1: --lecturing to the students, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I should look at--you know one thing, you know, I have to say Atlanta U was a great institution.  Yeah, you see lots of people that came from Atlanta U.  That's what motivated me to go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the picture, yeah, he was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I should find it though.  That's interesting.
Speaker 1: I could, it's easy to find.  It's in Google.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, I'll Google it, but--'cause when I present, I'll say that's my institution.  Einstein did (unclear), oh, that's pretty good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's interesting though.  It is, [William D.] Phillips.  Phillips is at NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland].  He won the Nobel Prize [in Physics], I've forgotten when [1997].  He gave a talk at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] too, the last year [2011].  He gave a beautiful talk to a general audience.  Those are the things that we can be proud of.
Speaker 1: Now, Einstein was also like very much in favor, spoke out in favor of civil rights--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and, yeah, here in Atlanta.
Speaker 2: Well, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so I have to get it for you.  I can send it to you or you can Google it.
Speaker 2: Oh, that'd be nice.
Speaker 1: But, so, now, you and Dr. Handy are working together here at Atlanta U--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, so, what would you think in terms of--what were you able to accomplish here in building the department?  Would you--what do you think are your greatest accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Our greatest accomplishment was to bring, like the physics or sciences into the forefront here because we published in the serious physics journals.  And then we got one of the National Science Foundation Research Center of Excellence here, in their early '90s [1990s].  In fact, you know, from the, '90 [1990], '92 [1992] to about 2002, in terms of R and D [research and development], Atlanta, Clark Atlanta University has even gravitated above George Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia] and many institutions.  We were very active, the institution.  But now, after 2002, started sliding because the people who were in charge had no clue what it takes to be competitive in research.  Remember, you mentioned Luther.  Luther is very good at seeing where to go.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the president for a brief period of time, right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --acting president, yeah.
Speaker 2: But at NSF, he was the engine in the human resource development for many years, yeah.  I always respected Luther.
Story_ID: 24990
Speaker 1: Now, just a South African question for a second--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When Nelson Mandela was released, I guess it was in '91 [1991], '90 [1990] or '91' [1991] when he was released?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember.  Yeah, it should be around there [February 11, 1990].
Speaker 1: But I know he did a--so that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think in '94 [1994], he comes here.  The AUC [Atlanta University Center] institutions give him an honorary doctorate.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '92 [1992], I think it was '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Was it '92 [1992]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '92 [1992].  He did, took a tour--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you are right.  That was, that should be the time then.
Speaker 1: Right, and so did you get--
Speaker 2: In fact, I talked to him when, he was--the only time when I put my gown, when they had the graduation--
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about that.  So take your time and tell us about this 'cause this has got to be a big event in your life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell us about that visit of--
Speaker 2: No, it was good because, you know, for the first time you could see the C--the AU, AUC, Atlanta University Center institutions coming together for the common good and organizing the faculty and everybody and went there and gave Mandela [Nelson Mandela] an honorary doctorate.  The presidents were there.  That was beautiful when you see they could come and work together.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, and talk to him?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Actually, I also, in '98 [1998], [University of] Fort Hare [Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa] gave me a D.Sc. [Doctor of Science] honors course.  The University of Southern Australia came there and gave Mandela an LLD [Doctor of Laws] honorary degree.  And his friend, Julius Nyerere [Tanzanian politician] was given an LLD by the University of Fort Hare.  Fort Hare gives me the first D.Sc. honorary degree.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did they do that in--when did Fort Hare honor you?  Was that in the--
Speaker 2: In '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: '98 [1998], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when Mandela too was honored by the University of Southern Australia.  They came to Fort Hare [University of Fort Hare] to give him the degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So Fort Hare thought they'd give me the honorary degree 'cause at that time I had accomplished a lot of things too.  I'd become a fellow of the American Physical Society, I won the [Edward] Bouchet award of the American Physical Society.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, now, when were you a fellow of the American Physical Society?
Speaker 2: I became, oh, in '99 [1999], I'd become a fellow--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: '99 [1999], a fellow of the American Physical Society.  In '99 [1999], I win the Edward Bouchet Award of the American Physical Society.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And Edward Bouchet was the first black Ph.D. in physics in the country, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, and what is amazing in that context, imagine 1878--, the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], four years ago is proud to award the first Ph.D. in physics, black.  Can you imagine?  View this in the context of Edward Bouchet.  I would hide it.  It's embarrassing.  It took you so long to graduate a Ph.D. in physics, black, huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--it's interesting.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 24991
Speaker 1: Now, did you--you had a chance to--now, you couldn't go back [to South Africa] until when?  When did--did you go back in '94 [1994] after the election or what?  Or did you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh, no, then I could go back and--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I know you went back, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let's say if I went to visit, you see, under the apartheid, I couldn't go with my wife [Gail Msezane].  I'd go by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you did go to visit before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did go--you see, my mom [Esther Msezane] passed away in '84 [1984].  I think I went there in '85 [1985] with my kids.  But not my wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that must have been dramatic.  I mean so your--was your father [Albert Msezane] still living?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my wife--my dad passed away in 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what did your children think of where you grew up?
Speaker 2: Oh, they are happy.  In fact, you know, actually, I--let me take it back a bit.  I also went just before my mother died with my kids.  And so they were, you know, she was happy to see him.  They were little, but my kids have always had nice attitudes.  Yeah, they don't know discrimination, no.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, so you've been back regularly since then, I guess or--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I go now, I go often.  I evaluate free for the African Laser Center in Pretoria [South Africa] or what they do.  Once a year, they pay for my travels there.  Then I evaluate for them and come back.
Speaker 1: Now, are there many--I wouldn't guess there're many, but what's the status of physics in South Africa in terms of the African population, the native population there?
Speaker 2: It's still not good.  Just like, you know, the status of physics in this country for blacks is not good.  South Africa is worse.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any other--do you know any other black Ph.D.s in South Africa now?
Speaker 2: There's a person actually I know.  The guy who directs CSIR [Council for Scientific and Industrial Research] has a Ph.D. in physics from [University of] Cambridge in the U.K. [United Kingdom].  There's another one I know, he is Philemon Mjwara.  When we organized in 2005, this first U.S.-Africa Institute, he's the--, he was at the funding agency now in South Africa.  His name is Philemon Mjwara, it's M-J-W-A-R-A.  He's very good that guy--he's--
Speaker 1: Okay, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mjwara, yeah, Philemon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, he is also featured in the competition of this, the SKA, the Square Kilometer Array.  He was instrumental in getting that funded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's a Ph.D. in physics.  There are a number of them now.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think there's also a guy who directs iThemba Labs [iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Sciences, Cape Town, South Africa].  He's a physicist.
Story_ID: 24992
Speaker 1: Okay, I know in the, I guess it was in the late '90s [1990s], I guess, when the--I can't think of his name now, the successor to Nelson Mandela, when he took office, he made some comments about AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome] that just--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you're right.  That guy--
Speaker 1: --shocked the, shocked people that he would--it's almost like the U.S. senator [congressman] that talked about pregnancy [Todd Akin] (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you are right.
Speaker 1: It's just complete ignorance of science, I mean, or medicine.
Speaker 2: Oh, like the congressman [Paul Broun] who said the earth is 9,000 years old--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right, so it's not just South Africa, but the president of South Africa, so it just kind of made people say, wow, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, I agree with you.  This guy, you know, it's just like, I tell you, [Jacob] Zuma, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the current president [took office in May, 2009].
Speaker 2: --people use him as a model.  This kid says, even sorry to say that, even an idiot who has never been to school can become president.  Why should we go to school?  Huh?
Speaker 1: So, children are saying that in South Africa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you see, this guy, they say that anybody, you know, can come from the ashes and become president.  There's no respect for that.  You have to say, you have to go to school, at least be able to process information.  Yes, you can be intelligent, but you require training to be able to process information.  You know, my grandparents were good intellectually, but they were never trained how to use their intellect systematically.
Speaker 1: So, you're emphasizing--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That becomes critical.
Speaker 1: Right, the difference between native intelligence and--just being smart--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and being trained to do something--
Speaker 2: --exactly.
Speaker 1: --specific.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you can be smart, but, you know, you need to be tailored and focused so that you use your intelligence appropriately.
Story_ID: 24993
Speaker 1: All right, now, in '93 [1993], you were recognized by the 'Atlanta [Journal] Constitution' [newspaper] as exemplary immigrant.  I've never heard of that before.  But that's--
Speaker 2: That's what they did.  They had a writing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: You know, my kids and I had been running the Peach Tree, the Peach Tree Road Race.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what's the Peach Tree Road--it's like a--
Speaker 2: It's a 10,000 meter road race or in the streets or on the fourth of July.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They selected immigrants (unclear).  Yeah, we ran that for years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's fun.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds (unclear).  Now, let's see, okay.  Oh, you served, in 1998, you went up to Detroit [Michigan] as a visiting professor?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Exactly, at, you know, we went--(unclear) I was impressed too.  Remember, you have the Marcus Garvey School there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that guy was a serious guy, this Marcus Garvey [Jamaican political leader; proponent of the Pan-Africanism movements].
Speaker 1: Yeah, so did you visit the Garvey School?
Speaker 2: I did go to the school to visit it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, that, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that the Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was a teacher there--was he teaching there then?
Speaker 2: I don't remember though if he was a teacher, but I'm just saying, I went there, I was impressed by that school, Marcus Garvey.  Everybody, this guy's serious, yeah.  So, that's what impressed me.
Speaker 1: Did you know about Garvey in South Africa?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, okay, so we talked about a honorary doctorate at University of Fort Hare [Alice, Eastern Cape, South Africa].  In 1999, you--and 2009, you organized the first through the fifth--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: International--
Speaker 2: Conference--(Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, these were in Benin with their collaborations with the French and Belgians.  We had, we organized the conferences there.  We're driving here.
Speaker 1: These are conferences on contemporary mathematical problems--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in mathematical physics.
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, there are three volumes that I added to that with those people.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, in 2005, you organized the first U.S.-Africa Advanced Studies Institute on Photon Interactions with Atoms and Molecules.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was in Durban [South Africa]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right?  Now, yeah, okay, it was in Durban.  Yeah, and I see Dr. Philemon Mjwara here--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Dr. Edmond Zingu (ph.)--
Speaker 2: Of the institute, South African Institute of Physics.  But we drive it.  I organized that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you seemed to have organized a lot of conferences, you know, towards, in the last ten years or so.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I do organize a lot of things because, you know, you can depend on me.  Yeah, if I say we are going to be the member, I say, traditionally, we are warriors.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If we are going to penetrate you tomorrow, we don't change that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, in 2007, you co-organized the sixth Edward Bouchet Abdus Salaam Conference in Cape Town [South Africa].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, who is Abdus Salaam?
Speaker 2: You know, he won the Nobel Prize in elementary particle physics [in 1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, this Trieste, it's called the ICTP [International Center for Theoretical Physics] in Italy.  That institute was established and named after him, yeah.  It's called now, Abdula Salaam Institute for Theoretical Physics at Trieste.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see, and 2007, you were named a fellow of the National Society of Black Physicists?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of that, I organized that meeting when nothing was working.  I just came in and made it happen.  So they gave me the fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay, in 2007, you also organized the first U.S.-Africa workshop on nano-sciences--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Cape Town [South Africa].
Speaker 2: That's where I learned about nano-science, the breakthrough I have now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what kind of work are you doing in nano-science now?
Speaker 2: Now, I do fundamental collision theory, resonances. So now, these resonances in low energy, electron scattering tie up with chemical reaction  dynamics.  That ties up with nanoparticle catalysis.  Nanoparticle catalysis is at the (unclear) most fundamental of the reactions that take place in catalysis.  Nobody ever thought that we used negative ions to catalyze a reaction.  I gave you an example, which is a breakthrough where methane is catalyzed using gold negative ions to methanol, no CO2 [carbon dioxide] emission.  It's incredible.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 1998, you co-organized the wavelengths and applications in physics and astrophysics workshop for the Joint Institute for Theoretical--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the title.
Speaker 1: And that's the one at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the one at Harvard.
Speaker 2: But we go forward, 208 [2008]
Speaker 1: Yeah, 20--
Speaker 2: 208--[2008] was the one in Egypt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I write the proposal to the National Science Foundation [NSF] for all those things.
Speaker 1: And the National Science Foundation supports--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I write the proposal, and if I have, I give it to somebody else.
Speaker 1: You're right, that was, I was talking about the 2008 in Cairo, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the one in Egypt, the 208 [2008] was this institute in Egypt.
Speaker 1: 2011, you're elected as a fellow of the Institute of Physics in London.  Now, this is --
Speaker 2: Yeah, that a prestigious one.
Speaker 1: Right, so this is really the physicists--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the biggest physicists recognizing you as--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I agree with you.
Speaker 1: --one of the--
Speaker 2: And these guys don't realize how many plaques in the world you can qualify for.  For example, I hold the two now.  Now, I hold four fellowships.  The last one was the AAAS.  So because of my research and organization, I get, become a fellow of the Institute of Physics.  Because of my organization, general, and research, I became a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  Again, last year [2011].
Speaker 1: Okay, so once again, your philosophy was to reach out and to make alliances?
Speaker 2: Exactly, so--because I gave you the information, you know, forming collaborations and making things happen.  That's my strength.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, like I keep going to [Carlos] Handy [mathematical physicist; also a HistoryMaker].  Handy and I were successful because of--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, we were not--you know, I tell students that you have to be generous with the knowledge.  Then you will be successful.
Story_ID: 24994
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently or undo?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think--I have been lucky in life.  I like to work, and I enjoy, you know, being happy with people.  So if you collaborate with me, you can sure--be rest assured the work will be done.  But what I would have liked to do, there are herbs in South Africa and Nigeria, around the world.  If I were to do things again, I'd go in and investigate the effectiveness of these herbs and plants.  I evalu--I reviewed a proposal in, at the University of Nelson Mandela Metropolitan [Port Elizabeth, South Africa], and these people study herbs that are supposed to be good for cancer cure and other things, scientifically.  You remember, I told you about the frogs.  I'd take them and analyze them scientifically.  So that's what I would have liked to do, but in physics, the driver was the people in South Africa, said they couldn't see a black going to university and studying physics because physics was too torturous for blacks.  I want to remind you, maybe twenty years ago and right in the globe, in the Boston (unclear), he said, the Boston Marathon is too torturous for blacks.  They don't have the mental fortitude, you remember that?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Guess what happened?
Speaker 1: And now, every year--
Speaker 2: Exactly, so those kinds of things, you don't make a statement like that.  That's why I stayed in physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I publish in the most prestigious journals profusely too.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you had to go back, you'd go back into biology and--
Speaker 2: Not biology.  I don't like biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know this, I would cover this part of research where I could do the fundamental understanding of the mechanism.  You know, for, I'll give you an example.  In catalysis, many people have tried it because they approach--if you approach it from the physics point of view, you go to the fundamentals.  So once you understand the fundamentals, then the rest just follows.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems to day from some of the people we've interviewed this year that biologist, chemists are all, they're more theoretical, biologists and theoretical chemists now are using math to, you know, predict outcomes.
Speaker 2: And you are right.  But you know what I can tell you, especially even physicists or others, what do people do?  Sometimes they model systems, but in my case, I'm interested in the most fundamental.  I give you an example.  If I look at catalysis, if you look in the literature, people don't understand the, why nanoparticles make good catalysts and bark doesn't.  I go to the atomic level and identify the mechanism.  Once I identify the mechanism of catalysis, the rest follows.  So, you see, but if you model the system, you don't understand the fundamentals, every case will be different, you'd be modeling.  We wrote the field.  And so we could, we even can catalyze water into peroxide using nano-gold and nano-platinum.  We understand the fundamentals for that.  People keep on mixing--you remember the old alchemy.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He used to drop in this brew and pray.  Nothing happens (laughter) and drop, and so you see that thing doesn't lead anywhere.
Speaker 1: Except to a paycheck if--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, no, no, my case--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous) doesn't understand.
Speaker 2: I'm interested in fundamental understanding so that I can go there at the end of the day.  Remember, my favorite saying is, "I don't have till the second coming".
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 24995
Speaker 1: Are you still conducting research today?  Now, you've been at this for a while now.
Speaker 2: Of course, now, I'm still have, you know, the--I just came from the Department of Energy meeting, you know, this big storm in New York, we had a meeting, you know, the usual meeting in Washington [District of Columbia] where there's about sixty-five people supported by that division.  And I still have a grant from the [U.S.] Air Force and the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Now, you're enjoying what you're doing apparently--[simultaneous]--
Speaker 2: Of course, I enjoy it very much.
Speaker 1: --and you're not--did you ever, do you foresee yourself ever retiring or--
Speaker 2: You know, a friend of mine again--
Speaker 1: --or moving into administration or something?
Speaker 2: No, you know, I nearly became vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town [South Africa].  But in the interview, I became frightened.  I said, this is not what I would want to do.  It's not me.  I'm basically a research, I've decided on that.  I don't want administration.  I ran the center, you know, this CTSPS.  I directed it.  There, I decide what to do, and I don't have to take a formula and execute it.  That's the difference between and administrator which has a structure or directing a research enterprise because there, if I decide, we want to go through the window, we go through the window instead of the door.  You see what I mean.  So to me, the time factor is very important.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's why I like to do the research, and I still have collaborators in Russia, Pakistan, all over the place.  And I've, my colleagues, we crank out papers.  That's what I like.
Story_ID: 24996
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, likewise, when you look back over everything you've done to this point--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --then, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: The greatest achievement here for me was to get a breakthrough in nano-scale catalysis.  You see, I remember that linking low-energy electron scattering resonances with chemical reaction dynamics.  You know, to quote Al Delgona, he's a Phillips professor at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], he said to me, "Alfred, how did you think, you guys, about this thing?"  You know what?  Every time we write something, people would shoot us because they didn't know any better.  So the more opposition they give us, the more strengthened we became, especially, as you know, at HBCUs, people didn't expect that to happen.  But we do make it happen.  You know, one time last--I was in Italy.  So this guy comes to me, he greets me.  He says, "Before I knew you, I thought you were very good."  He thought I was Italian.  So sometimes, it's not bad, it's not a good idea to be seen (laughter).  So once he saw that I wasn't Italian, that disappeared from my being good.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, I guess he could take that as an Italian--I guess if he didn't know any better.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, but, you know, I learned from South Africa, you know, to survive.  That's why I do not push myself to the forefront because I don't want to be visible.  You know, with the South African government would put hurdles.  The hurdles are sitting there, but we go, bypass them.  By the time they realize we are far because we don't make noise.
Story_ID: 24997
Speaker 1: Now, this is a question we always ask.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community today?
Speaker 2: You know, I quote from a recent paper.  It says, "African American males are leaking even out of the HBCUs" [historically black colleges and universities].  See what, that's a serious problem.  I don't know if you ever tried to carry water with a leaking vessel.  By the time you arrive there, there won't be any water.  So I, you know, it's a pity (unclear), you know.  He has good ideas.  First, you go to an enterprise and say, let's stop this leakage.  That's what, you know, African American leaders need to do, 'cause I see it, the routine.  I see black African American females dominating in physics.  You know, at one time in my class, I asked the male students, I said, "You guys, why are you so laid back?"  Says, "No, there's nothing we can do.  These ladies just walk over us."  "If they walk over you, you don't just lie down and do nothing."  "No," they say, "it's just too much for us."
Speaker 1: So, are--I know you're probably involved in some sort of early training programs for high school students--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I do that.
Speaker 1: --maybe on campus and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: You know, I told you when we were off the record, remember I told you about we have some of the finest high schools here in Atlanta [Georgia].  In the summer, some this summer, we had about eight students supported by the National Academy of Applied Sciences, to try and get students interested in the sciences.  I go there and selected the students personally.  And I get some of the finest. Believe me, if you see these kids, they are bright.  One girl over the summer, I said to her, if I was as good as you are, I would have been way ahead of myself now 'cause that girl, the girl, you know, you talk to her, she focuses and she can write.  I don't know how to write, except physics.  So, you see then, there's a lot of talent here.
Story_ID: 24998
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your family.  Now, you have children, right?
Speaker 2: I have two children.
Speaker 1: And you got married around nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: Nine.
Speaker 1: Nine, [1969], right.
Speaker 2: My first born was born, is a son, was born in Canada, in '73 [1973].  My daughter was born in the U.S., '75 [1975].  The girl--it's interesting, when you look at them, the way they are, my daughter is aggressive like an American.  My son is a little bit low keyed like Canadians.  So my daughter went to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey], and went to medical school.  She's a surgeon, practicing and my son went to Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York] and went to (unclear), and he is an MBA [Master's in Business Administration] from the Goizueta School of Business at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia].  But, you know, he's a businessman, but I don't--he doesn't have the same drive as I would like to see.  My daughter and I are the same, very competitive.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, he sounds like he's doing pretty good.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, he's doing, you know, maybe.  You know, I expect him to do a little better--I always expect--even I expect myself to do better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how I am.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: You know, one--they went to very good schools here.  They went to Marist which is a prep school here in Atlanta.  For ten years, I was on their board of trustee.  They used to like me because my kids made them look good.  For example, for my daughter to go to Princeton and him to go to Cornell, that says a lot about the school.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) As a good person, yeah.  You know, one of the things I can tell you, if you want to remember me, I proved the South African government wrong.  I married Canadian [Gail Msezane].  It was a successful marriage.  I did physics with the best, things that they said I could never accomplish.  Again, even in an environment like ours, I told the president at one time (unclear) in a challenging environment, I can still be successful.

Speaker 1: Tell us who's in this picture or what this occasion is and about what year?
Speaker 2: This picture was taken in Benin [western Africa].  This was a conference that we organized in mathematical physics.  This was about 1996.
Speaker 1: And this is--
Speaker 2: That is Sekosim (ph.) Tingua (ph.).  He was current--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mtingwa.  It's M-T-I-N-G-W-A.  He's African American.  He was--no, I'm not going to tell you all, everybody--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: And that's me, next to him in the red stripped shirt.
Speaker 1: Over here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then the white guy on my far right, there, yeah, that's Rome Voe (ph.).  He's from Belgium, because this conference is Benning.  Benning is French speaking, so we bring the people from France and Belgium to organize this conference because they are French speaking.
Speaker 1: And about what year is this?
Speaker 2: It was about 1996.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Before you start this stuff is--let's see the year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, actually crest (unclear), I can bring it.  It's about 19--it's about 2000.  Okay, that's fine.  Let me--this is an important thing.  This, this was generated by the National Science Foundation [NSF].  Remember, I said Luther used to run the human resource development--no, Luther at Tuskegee.  And so they were advertising these centers, yeah.  You see, the centers of research, research excellence in science and technology.  Ours was one of the most productive research centers.  It was founded in 1991.  And this one was made by Clark-Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  It was done a year ago because when I became a fellow, the Institute of Physics.  AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science].  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was teaching a graduate class.
Speaker 2: About what year is that?
Speaker 1: That was in about 201 [2001].
Speaker 2: Now, this is an interesting thing.  The person on my left is Bill Lester, standing, researcher at Berkeley [California], that one.  And that is his wife, the only woman there.  We were in Benin.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's his late wife, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, huh?
Speaker 1: She passed away.
Speaker 2: Oh, also, just like we are.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, we were in Benin, the compro (unclear).  We are talking about.
Speaker 1: And who's this?
Speaker 2: That's his student.  He's now at Howard [University, Washington, District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, this is--that's serious people there.  This is Print Peck.  The lady, that is me, you can see me there.  The lady on my, second, this one is Mrs. Love.  Mrs. Love at that time was running the company, Print Peck.  It's a large company.  It has offices in England.  So I--they have a scholarship program for its workers.  So how I get there, when they studied the (unclear) committee in maybe, I was a part of that.  I'm still a part of it.  I evaluate for the scholarship every year, free.  Now, this is Mrs. Love.  She was the CEO.  That was Joe Baker.  She was the vice president for Academic Affairs at Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Geiorgia], and this was Gwen.  She is, she was a counselor at Westminster.  Remember, Westminster is one of the top schools in the nation, private.  So.
Speaker 1: That's it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you, sir.
