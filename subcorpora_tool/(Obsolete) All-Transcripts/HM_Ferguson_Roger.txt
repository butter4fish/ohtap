Story_ID: 626905
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your family history, let's first start with your mother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and we'll work down your mother's line and then we'll go to your father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.].  So, what's, what is your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Alberta Elizabeth Lawson Ferguson [Alberta Lawson Ferguson].
Speaker 1: And where was she from?
Speaker 2: She was from Washington, D.C., but many of her relatives were also in, in St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 1: And now you, you spoke in the past tense, your mother's deceased?
Speaker 2: My mother died in 1987.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us anything about your mother's family history, about your grandparents, her parents and--how far back can you go and tell--talk a little bit about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well saying we can't go back to far on my mother's side, both of her parents died when she was very young, she was raised by her grandmother, whom she called Momma and then by her aunts and they were my great-aunts, and I got to know them a little bit.  And then she had--she was an only child because her parents died when she was very young, so she had no siblings.  She had a very close cousin, Aunt Naomi [ph.], and you can tell I refer to her as my aunt, she actually wasn't--she was my second cousin, I guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And Aunt Naomi had a brother, Sonny [ph.], and that really was, you know, fi- the Lawson family that I knew. And they were known as the Beasleys [ph.] because momma, my mother's grandmother was Mrs. Beasley [ph.].  And they all lived in Washington, D.C., that family, mainly domestics, you know, took in the cleaning, did some cooking, worked in other people's homes, raised other peoples' kids, washed their clothes.  The funniest thing that happened with that, if I can keep talking about that side of--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --my family was, one of my great-aunts, Aunt Addie [ph.] turned out to have been the housekeeper for one of my high school classmates [at Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.].  And so here we were at high school commencement and suddenly my Aunt Addie's there, you know, with her fur on and her hat, sitting upfront at commencement and her white family as she was- they called them, or as she called them, didn't know she was coming they were stunned to see her there, trying to figure out what she was doing there, and low and behold, there she was, she was my aunt.  And so that side of my family, my mother's family was not well educated, and as I said they were mainly domestics.
Speaker 1: Now, you said you believed they came from St. Louis, Missouri?
Speaker 2: She had many relatives from St. Louis, so I'm assuming there's some linkage back in that direction, yes.
Speaker 1: You never went to St. Louis and met any of your--?
Speaker 2: We went to St. Louis once or twice, and met some of those relatives, it was very interesting 'cause we're from Washington, D.C. and though we didn't have much money, we had some indoor plumbing things of that sort. They did not have indoor plumbing in St. Louis when we went there.  As I recall having to take a bath in one of those big wash tubs, where one of my relatives, a cousin I guess she was, was heating up the water on a wood burning stove pouring it into the bathtub and then pouring in the cold water and then we'd all--I'd take a bath and get out, and, you know, there was no privacy and it was basically what, I guess, what we now call a cold water flat.
Speaker 1: What year do you think that would have been?
Speaker 2: That, that had to be, well since I was born in, in '51 [1951], that was probably '56 [1956], '57 [1957], something like that, we didn't spend much time after that in St. Louis.  So it's not as though I have really deep memories there, but what you learn was as little as we had in D.C., at least we had running water and these folks back in St. Louis were making ends meet with--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --a lot less.
Speaker 1: Did they, did your aunts tell you anything about your family history, about St. Louis, or if any other background information that you learned from them?
Speaker 2: What they really led me to believe was that, you know, it had been sort of hard to grapple existence--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and getting from St. Louis which was a, a very southern city to Washington, which is still a southern city--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --But more African American dominated, was for them a big step.
Speaker 1: What caused them to move from St. Louis to, to Washington?
Speaker 2: It was looking for jobs basically and, you know, one or two of them, one of them worked in the government, the other ones as I said were domestics.  But for the black, not even middle class, lower middle class, government jobs being in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S Postal Service]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --or the labor department [U.S. Department of Labor] or government training offices, one of them worked, that was a big step up because it was relatively secure employment.  Then the other good thing that happened in D.C. for my mother was that she got into what was then a very good public school system and she told stories of her aunts didn't care very much about education nor did her grandmother.  But she was a very smart young girl and the principal of the local elementary school would walk by the house every day, pick her up and escort her to school and make sure she got to school.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the school she may have gone to?
Speaker 2: I know where she went ultimately for, for high school, it's one of the famous black D.C. high schools, Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] and then she went on from there to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and to what was then called Miners Teachers College [sic. Miner Teachers College; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], so she stayed in school and she continued on her schooling, it was not something that her family encouraged or motivated but everybody else around her did.  So that's really what I know, not, not a deep knowledge from my mother's side, and I think it's 'cause it was a very disrupted background with folks who are working really hard on a day to day basis just to make ends meet.
Story_ID: 626906
Speaker 1: Well then let's, let's move to your, your father's side.  What, what is your father's name?
Speaker 2: Father's name same as mine, Roger Ferguson, he was Roger Ferguson, Sr., I'm Roger Ferguson, Jr. [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: And he was born in Indiana, Marion, Indiana in 1918, and he has sort of a much more interesting background actually, well least on that side, we know a bit more.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So my father's original name was not Roger Ferguson at all, but it was Roger Pettiford.
Speaker 1: Could you spell that for us please?
Speaker 2: P-E-T-T-I-F-O-R-D, and this was a piece of news that we Fergusons didn't know until about ten years ago.  So what had happened was, Clarence Pettiford and a woman named Mary Burden Pettiford [Mary Burden Ferguson] were married, they had two children, Thelma Pettiford [Thelma Ferguson] who I--is my aunt--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was my aunt, and then my father and then Clarence Pettiford died at some point in the 1920s and so we had Mary Pettiford with two relatively young kids in Marion, Indiana. And she was fortunate enough, I believe fortunate to meet a young man, a, a military officer named George Ferguson and they got married and George Ferguson adopted these two young kids and so the young man who was known as Roger Pettiford for the first three or four years of his life became known as Roger Ferguson.  And so, Mr.--Mr. Ferguson moved his new young family to Washington, D.C. which is where he was from, but my father still had many relatives back in Indiana.  Now we did not know about this Pettiford story until about ten years ago, so all this was relative--news to us and very interesting news to us and it's affected the way we've gotten to know who our family is over the last several years.
Speaker 1: What did you learn about the Pettifords?
Speaker 2: We're just learning now about the Pettifords.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Frankly as I said, and we've learned a couple of things, one is a very large family in Indiana, my sister [Rochelle Ferguson Washington (ph.)] has been to Pettiford family reunions and there are lots of them in Indiana, deep roots in the Midwest, which were not our roots, but they proved to be my father's roots actually.  And as you can imagine, what we're learning is a range of individuals, some of who are well educated, some of who are not.  So, it looks to us, looks to me as sort of a classic, sort of lower middle income--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --kind of black family from the Midwest. A little more stable than my mother's family for sure, but this big tragedy of, of having Clarence Pettiford die at a relatively young age, leaving this widow and two kids, really changed everyone's life.
Speaker 1: Did your father speak to you ab- about his real father?  He had no recollection of him, do you know?
Speaker 2: My father had very little knowledge or recollection of his real father as far as I can tell and he never spoke about that at all except towards the very end of his life when he talked about being adopted.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: But it all didn't come together very quickly I must say, until one of my aunts really started to do some research and that's when we discovered this.
Story_ID: 626907
Speaker 1: What did he [Ferguson's father, Roger Ferguson, Sr.] tell you about his step father who became his real father?
Speaker 2: Well we absolutely thought of--
Speaker 1: Oh, you knew him?  So--
Speaker 2: I knew him.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: George Ferguson and--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about George Ferguson.
Speaker 2: And George Ferguson was to me, the most amazing person, I mean, I was very lucky, I had two or three men in my life who are amazing in different ways.  So George Ferguson was a man of many skills, as I've already indicated he was in the [U.S.] Army, he rose to be a colonel serving actively in World War I [WWI] and World War II [WWII], leading black troops in, in World War II, he also was an architect and designed a number of the churches, black churches around Washington, D.C., some them, some of them still stand.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of any of those churches that he designed?
Speaker 2: Oh he did some work at Calvary Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.] for example and a couple of the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] churches. They were very active in the A.M.E. church in Washington, D.C., at Mount Zion A.M.--A.M.E [sic. Mount Zion United Methodist Church] in Washington. They were--George Ferguson and his three sisters were, I think of them, as being pillars to the black Georgetown community.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Georgetown, Washington, D.C. now is very shi-shi and is known for, you know, the Kennedys having lived there and Kate Graham [Katharine Graham], who owned The Washington Post lived there, the reality is, back in the days, my kids would say back in the '20s [1920s], the '30s [1930s], the '40s [1940s], much or the '50s [1950s], Georgetown was a black enclave and the Fergusons were a part of that. They were stalwarts of the A.M.E. Zion church [African Methodist Episcopal Zion], where my grandfather was active. As I said he was an architect, he owned a corner of land in Georgetown, and then ran a little store and then he also taught mechanical drawing and R.O.T.C. [Reserve Officers Training Corps] at Armstrong High School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Friendship Armstrong Academy, Washington, D.C.].  And so I looked at my grandfather, the man I think of as my grandfather, actually--
Speaker 1: --Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --my step grandfather, as really a man of many, many talents.
Speaker 1: And did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: I did not know my grandmother, Mary Pettiford Ferguson [Mary Burden Ferguson] died in 1946, or somewhere thereabouts, maybe a little earlier.  She, they're pictures of her, they show her to be a relatively taller than average woman, broad shoulders--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --apparently very strong, as you can imagine she had to be, not only did she have these two little kids, with Mr. Pettiford [Clarence Pettiford], then she went and had four other kids with George Ferguson and she was a stalwart of the household as far as I can tell. But we don't know, I don't know very much about her in part because she died at a relatively young age.  And when she died, what happened was my father and his older sisters ended up basically taking care of their youngest sister and so he was, my father became, well he was sort of a character in his youth, also relatively responsible at the right age, at the right time for his younger sister as well.  And so, back to my grandfather, he was a real presence in my life, he died actually when I was in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and one of the things I remember most about him in addition to the things that he did was, you know, we'd have dinner with him one Sunday, every month he'd come over, always wore a suit, be it hot, cold.  And you know, in D.C., in the '50s [1950s], and '60s [1960s], we had no air conditioning, and so my grandfather showed up, suit always buttoned, tie on, pocket handkerchief, and he would smoke a pipe and he spoke French or to be more accurate, he pretended to speak French because he had been in World War II, in Paris [France] and came back with five or six French phrases.  But as a little kid, I thought my grandfather spoke French because he would take the pipe out of his mouth and he'd say, "Bon," and put the pipe back in and I was completely mesmerized (laughter) by this global man who had been to Paris and spoke French and smoked a pipe and, you know, was called Colonel by a number of distinguished gentleman.  So he was quite, you know, quite a force in my life and in a very positive way.
Story_ID: 626908
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about your father, Roger Ferguson, Sr., tell us--okay do you know when he was born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1918, in Marion, Indiana as I said.
Speaker 1: Right.  Tell us a little bit about him.
Speaker 2: He was also in his own way, quite a character, he was, I've learned recently, quite a bon vivant as a, as a young person and you'll see some photos of him where he was, nice dresser, hair appropriately parted, he, he--when I really got to know him, he didn't care that much about clothes or looks, but as a young person, he looks to me as a guy who really, you know, cared about how he looked and made sure he attracted the young ladies.  He was a good athlete, surprisingly, 'cause I am not much of an athlete.
Speaker 1: What were his sports?
Speaker 2: His sports were swimming, where he swam at the Francis Pool in Washington, D.C., which is this spectacular outdoor pool, he taught me to swim there, then he went on to swim for Howard University [Washington, D.C.], he was a sprinter in short distances and he was really quite a good swimmer, when I, was we were coming up, he took up bowling, and taught me how to do that, and then he became quite an angler, quite a fisherman, joined a fishing club, black guys called Anglers All [ph.].  And one of the great memories I have of my growing up, carrying in my youth was going fishing with my father, we'd go out fishing in the Chesapeake [Chesapeake Bay] quite a bit and then, up and down the East Coast we'd take these bus trips with the Anglers All group to go fishing down in North Carolina for also to, you know bigger game fish. It was--so he was, you know, a great father.
Story_ID: 626909
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] was a cartographer, is that right?
Speaker 2: My father was, let me talk a little bit more about his background in education.  You've heard that he was an athlete, he went to Armstrong High School [Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School; Friendship Armstrong Academy, Washington, D.C.], where his father [sic. step father, George Ferguson] taught him mechanical drawing and he was being trained to be an architect at Howard and he had that very meticulous hand writing that only a, an architect would have, he did not complete those studies however.  He started in, he started his family and had to get a job and so he went to work at the Army Map Service, first as a, what was called a cartographic technician, because in those days if you were black you couldn't be the mapmaker, the cartographer, you had to be the assistant.  So there are two assistants in this level unit, my father and his good friend, Juan Rivera [ph.], that who by name you could tell was Hispanic.  So the black guy and the Hispanic guy were both very talented but they were the assistants, at least initially. And he worked his way up to become a full mapmaker and he made a special kind of map, not the maps that most people see, not those flat maps, he made a three dimensional map called a relief map.  And so you can look at it and in miniature scale you can see the mountains going up and down, you can see the valleys et cetera. And he made maps for the [U.S.] Army most of it was classified, I assume it had to do with Korea and Vietnam and other places.  But importantly and interesting from my standpoint he also made maps of the moon and they were making maps before men landed on the moon of the various locations where they might land.
Speaker 1: What years would this have been?
Speaker 2: This was, he worked there from the '50s [1950s], through his retirement.  And so, when I was growing up, '50s [1950s], '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s], he was still working at the Army Map Service as it was then called, and so he was, so he had that element to him.
Story_ID: 626910
Speaker 1: But the thing that was really distinctive about my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] was that he was a child of the Depression [Great Depression] and he had lots of stories to tell about the Depression and it clearly impacted him.  And the way it impacted him was he became very interested in savings and investments and the way the banking system worked. So the thing I, I remember many things about my father, the thing that really influenced me was that my father got me very interested at a very young age in things having to do with finance and banking and et cetera.  And, in fact, as soon as I could do math at a reasonably proficient level, you know, just adding and subtracting, multiplying and dividing, he had me balance the check book.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And much of our conversation while he was an avid football fan and, you know, loved to bowl and fish, much of our conversation was really about interest rates and investments and safe banks and, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: How do you think he acquired that kind of knowledge, he had the interest but how do you think he got the, the knowledge?
Speaker 1: I think he may have gotten it, some from his father [sic. step father, George Ferguson], I think he got it some from school as well, but mainly he was just sort of self taught. He read the newspapers, the other thing I remember about my father is not just that he read newspapers, but he had a broad interest in life and he was a curious person as well. And it, it showed up in, in unusual ways.  I've talked a little bit about his interest in, in finance and money and investing, and for a, you know, a guy who was living, my mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] was a school teacher, my father worked for the government, they didn't have huge amounts of money so it was unusual for him to be interested in that kind of thing.  He was interested in training people in that space, not only did he train me, but my sister [Rochelle Ferguson Washington (ph.)] has a very good friend who has gotten interested in investing in only land and property and she attributes all that to my father.
Story_ID: 626911
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have and what are their names?
Speaker 2: I have a sister, Rochelle Ferguson Washington [ph.] who is a few years older than I am, and then I have a younger brother, nine years younger than I am, Rodney Ferguson [ph.] who lives out in California.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know how your mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] and father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I, I do.  They met, remember I mentioned my father's a swimmer?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They met at Frances Pool [Washington, D.C.], Frances Junior High School [School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens] is a high school in, junior high school that still exist in, in Washington, D.C., Georgetown [Washington, D.C.], my father's house was down the street from Frances Junior High School and my mother lives about fifteen blocks away but she'd walk over to go to the Frances Pool, and that's where they met.  And she was a few years younger than my father and, you know, very petite, she was--
Speaker 1: What year do you think this would have been?
Speaker 2: Oh, they had to have met in, certainly had to be when they were both in school.
Speaker 1: In?
Speaker 2: In D.C., so--
Speaker 1: In high school, college?
Speaker 2: No, no, they would have been in high school, at this point (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In high school?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Very young and, you know, my mother tells us a crazy story, I don't know if this is true, she's standing outside of the fence at Frances, my father spots her for the first time and waves and whistles and, you know, carries on and behaves completely inappropriately and she would have none of it, but I think obviously she found it pretty intriguing, so they'd known each other from high school days.  And, you know, it was, I'm not sure I can say it was love at first sight, but it was certainly a sort of an intense relationship.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And you'll see in the, in the pictures they look, you know, as though they are suited for each other.
Story_ID: 626912
Speaker 1: Well, let's move to you now.  Tell me a little about, from your memory, the first sights, smells and sounds that you can think of.  Let's first start, your first impressions if you can go all the way back.
Speaker 2: All the way back, my first impressions probably were being in D.C., they had to be, the thing I loved most about that city is the greenery. Washington is a city filled with trees, and our first house, we were very lucky we never lived in apartments, there weren't that many apartments in D.C., most people lived in houses, had a little back yard and trees in front of it and around the corner and down the street was sort of a long walk but we made that walk frequently, there was something called the National Arboretum [U.S. National Arboretum, Washington, D.C.], which as the name indicates, it's just filled with trees.  So, one of my earliest memories really was around the trees in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: And what about smells?
Speaker 2: The smells had to do with one, the trees, and two, the cooking obviously.  My mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] was, you know, a good cook, I wouldn't say she was a gourmet cook at any sense but, you know, all the usual things that we just think of now as soul food, were things she did.  So, you know, collard greens and pigs feet, which I do not like, but were (unclear) and chitlins, you know, had to be in the house sometimes.
Speaker 1: Fried chicken?
Speaker 2: Fried chicken for sure, cornbread which is one of my favorites, I said French fries, but cornbread is another one of my favorite foods, you know, and so you can imagine, you know, those sorts of, you know, great smells from the kitchen.
Speaker 1: What about sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds were probably city sounds, I'm not a country person, so, you know, cars, ambulance and, I grew up in a nice neighborhood with, no one had a lot of money but there were kids around.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, kids sounds, you know, 'cause we played outside, you know--
Speaker 1: Where was your neighborhood (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) sticks, bikes--
Story_ID: 626913
Speaker 1: Sticks, bikes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where was your neighborhood?
Speaker 1: The first place we lived was on 19th Street Northeast in Washington, D.C. It's what would be described technically now as a low and moderate income neighborhood. Right be hound us--behind us was a, sort of a housing project and then a number of tiny and really small row houses.  My house had no basement, had a crawl space underneath, a small living room, a small dining room, a small kitchen, an upstairs, two bedrooms and a bathroom and--
Speaker 2: Do you remember the name of your street?
Speaker 1: Oh, 19th Street Northeast.
Speaker 2: Oh, 19th Street North--?
Speaker 1: 19th Street Northeast, I lived pretty much at the corner of 19th and M Streets Northeast. A little further up was Lyman Place, it's called and it was, as I said a black neighborhood, everything was segregated then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And these tiny little row houses, very, very small the size basically of a, a, you know, small two bedroom apartment but just happened to have two levels.
Story_ID: 626914
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to two different elementary schools, kindergarten through the third grade I went to Charles Young Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], which was the local elementary school. There was a picture of Charles Young, Charles Young had turned out, was a lieutenant or a black officer in World War I [WWI].  My mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] taught at Charles Young Elementary School, taught first grade there and they had a phenomenal principal, and I didn't know this personally, I could see through my mother, who kept that school in line.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the principal's name?
Speaker 2: Oh, it'll come to me, I don't remember, it'll come back to me though, she--
Speaker 1: Now, what are your first impressions of elementary school?  What was your favorite subject, your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: You could maybe tell I just, I loved school, I, it--
Speaker 1: Clearly.
Speaker 2: --it, that's one of the things that clearly drove my life.  My first impressions were, you know, having to line up, you know, 'cause you're a kid, you're running around and suddenly you're lining up to go and, and do things.  So this little sense of order and discipline and, you know, this was not a place where you came to play, this is a place where you came to work.  And the teachers there are all black women, as you can imagine, were really quite good, it seemed to me, I don't really know except they, they were my mother's friends and they, they were, they were good teachers and you only had obviously in kindergarten, first grade, second grade, third grade, you had a teacher who did everything.  And my favorite subjects were math and reading. My worst subject was penmanship, my penmanship then was terrible, it's terrible now, and I guess it always will be, but I just loved math and I absolutely loved to read.  And then at that point in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], the schools were segregated, but we also had something called tracking, which currently has a bad name.  What tracking means basically is you give the kids a standardized test, then those who do well, get to go to the more select public schools and those who don't go to the other schools, well I was really fortunate because, I did well, and continued to go to the better schools.  So, we had test every three years so I did well on the third grade test and what that meant is fourth grade, fifth grade, or sixth grade I went from Charles Young school to the River Terrace School [River Terrace Elementary School; River Terrace Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], that created two big changes in my life.  So I started in the fourth grade riding the bus to school on my own.
Speaker 1: Is that still in Northeast [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Still in Northeast, just in the Anacostia section of D.C., and if you know D.C.--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anacostia is a slightly tougher neighborhood than where I grew up and so my mother was worried 'cause I was taking the bus across to far Northeast, it was actually getting into Southeast [Washington, D.C.], across the Anacostia River and this school, River Terrace was, as the name might indicate, right on the banks of and the Anacostia River, the neighborhood was a little tougher, but that's where they put together in fourth and fifth grades to ke- fourth, fifth and sixth grades, the kids from Northeast who had done better on the standardized test.
Story_ID: 626915
Speaker 1: So you're in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.] at a new school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For the gifted children essentially?
Speaker 2: Basically, yes.
Speaker 1: So tell us abo- a little bit about what were your influences at that school?
Speaker 2: The influences were again the same, I didn't get to know the principle, my mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] didn't teach there, so I didn't have a sense of the administration of school.  But again, it was my teachers and they were, seemed to me, you know, sort of quite good.
Speaker 1: All black teachers?
Speaker 2: All black teachers and all black students at that point.  And frankly the thing I remember about it is, this is a classic school, the last day of school they, kids who weren't in the school came to try to beat up the kids who were in the school (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --and so we all had to run for the bus and get back over the bridge and I had this, I have, I think it was a friend, or we've lost touch, I won't mention his name, a tall guy, very slender who could not defend himself. So I'm here this little skinnamarink, 5'1" kid, I wasn't that tall at that point, this kid was much taller, I, and I'm fighting these other guys off to protect my friend Floyd [ph.] (laughter) from the local toughs. We get on the bus and head back over.  And the reason I tell this story is this guy Floyd, who I mentioned, then, I lose track of, but he comes back into my life at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I won't mention any more because if I give away much more, people will know who I'm talking about, a lot of folks will know who it is anyway, but so this big guy who ended up being a great athlete could not defend himself in the fourth, fifth and sixth grade.  So it was my job at the end of the school year to then to have to, (laughter) you know, fight off the local toughs.  So, you know, they, they, River Terrance [River Terrace Elementary School; River Terrace Education Campus, Washington, D.C.] was interesting, it was a great school, I think, you know, continuing the path of my own education, but it was also the first time that I sort of came into a little bit of the tension between, you know, the, the smart kids and the other kids.  But, you know, it never really been that important but every once in a while, it was a jolt that maybe being a smart kid you might be in physical danger sometimes.
Speaker 1: What was your--did your favorite subjects remain math and reading?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Particularly during this period it was all about math and more actually, more about reading.  And so during the summers, while I was in elementary school, I would read the series of books, my family makes fun of it now called, Freddy the Pig, Freddy the Pig is a mythical pig who could talk and, you know, pigs are actually relatively smart animals I gather and this pig was incredibly smart and so Freddy would go to the moon, he went to Florida, he did all these incredible things with the goat and the cow and the other farm animals, and I'd spend all summer reading the Freddy the Pig series.  I tried to get my kids interested in it and it's actually been republished and (laughter) they read one chapter of this thing and thought it was completely hilarious 'cause, you know, kids these days grow up on 'Star Wars' and, you know, serious fictions and serious entertainment if you will, and then, and science fiction and things that really are other worldly, and  the thought that this pig would fly to the moon (laughter) was so ludicrous but it just completely captured me during elementary school.  So, reading had to, really was my thing, if you will.
Story_ID: 626916
Speaker 1: What about hobbies?  Did you have any hobbies?
Speaker 2: I tried to have hobbies but I was not very good at having hobbies for some reason.  So, we got a telescope and I'd go out and look at the moon, but I never really got into astronomy. Like a lot of kids, had a tiny little coin collection but never really got into that--
Speaker 1: Did you play any musical instruments?
Speaker 2: I played the piano, but my sister [Rochelle Ferguson Washington (ph.)], who's, I mentioned, is three years older, was that much more advanced and she proved to be and still is a very good pianist, and so I played but I'm not nearly as musical and for me it was much more torture, and then compared to her, it was even worse.  So, I just sort of retreated into the academic space if you will.  I was also in Cub Scouts for a couple years, but black urban Cub Scouts is not the same thing as that thing you saw on TV. (Laughter) And so, we were not out, you know, camping--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, doing canoe trips and so it sort of lost its appeal.  So I just actually became, for a lack of a better word, more and more nerdy.  You know, I had plenty of friends. You know, would do bike riding, as I mentioned go bowling, roller skating, that kind of thing, but the reality is, you know, by the time I was certainly in fifth grade, six grade, and then to junior high school [Jefferson Junior High School; Jefferson Middle School Academy, Washington, D.C.], I was clearly being formed as a more nerdy kid, as opposed to anything else, you know, that's, yeah so be it.  But, in a great family where I was also learning lots of other things as well, as we've talked about.
Story_ID: 626917
Speaker 1: Now this is now in the '60s [1960s], right?  We're in the 1960s around this time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is the political--what is your perception--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of the political environment?
Speaker 2: Very interesting.  As I said, the schools in D.C. were segregat- segregated, but there was a man named Julius Hobson who was pushing hard for desegregation and my mother was a school teacher, she was a big believer in desegregation, but she was really worried about what this was gonna mean.  And actually, because D.C. is so heavily black, it didn't mean that much except one thing that I'll come back to--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in a minute.  And then again, during the same period of time, the March on Washington took place.  And my family was really interested in this but very conflicted. Should we go?  Should we not go?  I remember active discussions around the table. And they ultimately decided that they were not gonna go because they were afraid that violence would break out.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Because there had never been such a big march of this type in Washington, D.C., they wanted to go down there and then thought, well how are the police gonna react?  And how are the neighborhoods gonna react and what's gonna happen?  And so there is a lot of discussion around the table that I recall around politics--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --civil rights, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], et cetera, and my family clearly saying that it is absolutely the right thing to do, but also worried about, you know, the physical dimensions for those of us who lived in, who lived in D.C., or it's absolutely supporting desegregation, but also worried about what is exactly is that gonna mean for peoples' day to day lives.  And so, it's a very interesting time, as I was thinking back on it--
Speaker 1: How did you feel personally?  I mean did you have any personal sentiments, any anger, any fear?
Speaker 2: Well let me tell you the way desegregation hit a little kid, or segregation, in a little kid in D.C., because as I said, the schools were all black--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the neighborhoods were all black. It, it was just where you lived, that's, that's the reality of it.  But when you went to buy shoes or clothes, you had to go in the back door. And you started to think well why, you know, everybody is going in the front door, why are we going around to the side here waiting for some reason?  And the worst part of it was, there's an amusement park in Washington, outside of Washington, Montgomery County [Maryland], called Glen Echo amusement park.  Glen Echo is owned by Montgomery County, it's not private, they would advertise on TV all the time, particularly in the spring and the summer, but it was segregated, black people could not go to Glen Echo Park [Glen Echo, Maryland], and that was very hurtful.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We were lucky because there was another amusement park called Hersey amusement park [Hershey Park; Hersheypark, Hershey, Pennsylvania], owned by Hersey Company [Hershey Foods Corporation; The Hershey Company], two hours away, that was integrated.
Speaker 1: That's in Pennsylvania right?
Speaker 2: In Pennsylvania, so it was a two hour drive up past Gettysburg [Pennsylvania], and that was integrated and so there was always this effort to try to figure out where can black people go?  I remember growing up in the '60s [1960s], we had one week of vacation every year and we went to Wildwood New Jersey, on the Jersey Shore, again one of the few places where the beach was integrated, blacks and whites where sitting next to each other on the beach.  The housing was not--the first eight to ten blocks, where nicer homes, nicer motels and hotels all for the white population, and then the back ten blocks were all for the black population.  And we ended up getting a house back near the garbage dump, they had closed the garbage dump and built a few black houses back there.  And so my recollection of this time personally--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was one that in many ways was safe and comfortable because of my community, my family, et cetera, but it dispersed with these moments where unusual, sort of hurtful things would happen and you had to sort of change your plans. You couldn't go to Glen Echo, you had to drive for two hours--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and go to Hersey, you couldn't be down, you couldn't stay down near the, the beach at Wildwood, you had to stay in the back near, in our case, the garbage dump.  We made the best of it, you know, happy family time for sure, but as I said, it's 'spersed with these little moments where you suddenly realize, well wait a minute, you know, we're not being treated like everybody else and that, that clearly upset my parents [Alberta Lawson Ferguson and Roger Ferguson, Sr.], it clearly upset me, it was clear that we were not being treated fairly.  And so, that was a problem for us.
Story_ID: 626918
Speaker 1: Now, so, after you leave the school in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.], those were good years I'm assuming, those were good years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were good years.
Speaker 1: --for you? Where was--
Speaker 2: Except for that last day when we had to fight, right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And then you head off to high school?
Speaker 2: No. Then I--
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) head off to junior high school.
Speaker 1: Junior high school and where was that?
Speaker 2: And here is, this is a big change in my life.  Again, remember I told you about the tracking--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and you described it as a, as the smart kids?  So, then two things were happening, continued to have tracking, the schools were no longer technically segregated, though in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], things were still quite different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This--so what year would this be now then?
Speaker 2: This was 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the--so desegregation legally is the law but it's not quite there yet?
Speaker 2: It's not quite there but that's in part because D.C. itself is just heavily black--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and all the whites live in one part and all the blacks live in the rest of the city.  So, in '63 [1963], I went to--again, through this tracking--the other thing that was happening by the way was, urban redevelopment as it was called, and what that meant was in part of D.C., in the Southwest part of D.C., they were getting rid of all these really bad tenements--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and building new houses, so they're public schools in the Southwest part of D.C. that had no student population.  So all this came together in that they did again this tracking and took the--a whole junior high school worth of kids from all around the city into a place called Jefferson Junior High School [Jefferson Middle School Academy, Washington, D.C.] and that's where I went to junior high school, from '63 [1963] to '66 [1966].  And Jefferson Junior High was important in my life because it's the first time I went to school with white kids.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, what were the percentages looking like, black, white for the Jefferson High School [sic.]?
Speaker 2: At Jefferson it seemed like it was sort of 60/40, black/white, all right?  So there was still a small number of local kids who were there and then there are all these kids who are coming from all around the city for, you know, the, the, magnet part of the school, if you will.  So that was the first time I went to school with white kids and the first time I had white teachers.  And what I found interesting was, I could hold my own, you know, and, and, and I didn't have to think much about that because I, as I said, except for these, you know, moments of segregation, segregation was not something that was, you know, a punch in the face--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --the way it is for--the way it was for lots of other folks, for us it was part of the background noise in life.
Speaker 1: But when you say you could hold your own, are you being modest?  I assume that you probably did better than hold--
Speaker 2: Well, I--
Speaker 1: --your own at that school.
Speaker 2: --I think I did, I don't know what other people's grades were, so yeah, the chances I think I did better than hold my own.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I ended up being the president of the class.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Which was, you know, quite an honor and we had a little Spanish club, I was involved in that as well and I assume my grades were good. And what I remember though were a couple of white teachers actually, a woman named Mrs. Rudski [ph.], who taught math and she had come from Eastern Europe I think so she had a slight accent.  But she was a great math teacher and here I am, you know, this white woman there, this little black, ke- kid from Northeast, D.C., taking the bus down to Southwest every day and just fell in love with math because of Mrs. Rudski.  And that was, it was very interesting, if you can imagine, it was really eye opening.  So I'm doing better than a lot of the white kids, at least as well or maybe better as you point out than many of them.  I had this white teacher who cared about me and who was doing math and made that very appealing. So it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the environment at the school--how would--how would you describe the environment?
Speaker 2: The environment at the school was, to me, magical because it was integrated which was interesting and, and magical not in the positive sense but novel--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but it also was positive.  We had as I said, more I think, it seemed more white teachers than black, I don't really remember but, you know, quite an integrated faculty, and bright kids from all around the city and I just thrived, I loved it, it was, it was, you know, quite transformative, it was, in some sense the beginning of a big transformation, still very much a D.C. kid, but playing on, you know, bigger, a bigger plane, no longer just the Northeast, D.C. plane, no longer just a black plane, but really a city wide--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --playing field if you will.
Story_ID: 626919
Speaker 1: Were you at that time beginning to form any ideas about what you wanted to do in your future?
Speaker 2: Towards the end of this, I was beginning to form some ideas. And what happened was in 1965, 1966, just as I was transitioning from junior high school [Jefferson Junior High School; Jefferson Middle School Academy, Washington, D.C.] to high school [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.], President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] nominated the man named Andrew Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer], to be the first black governor of the Federal Reserve System.  And suddenly--
Speaker 1: Now how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was then fourteen, fifteen.
Speaker 1: Now most fourteen or fifteen year olders wouldn't even know what the Federal Reserve was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --let alone that President Johnson had nominated--
Speaker 2: Well, let me be quite clear, I didn't know what it was either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what happened was, this was really big time news because Johnson was doing, you know, the first black everything, all right?  So, Thurgood Marshall, solicitor general to the [U.S.] Supreme Court, Robert Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] at the Housing and Urban Development [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development], and then this fellow Andrew Brimmer.  Now, I had no idea what any of this meant, except it was front page news and, remember I told you how my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] had always talked about investments and had me balance the check book?  Well here this big important thing called the Federal Reserve was on the front page of The Washington Post, a big description about what they did, how they influenced the economy, importantly how they influenced the interest rates, remember I'd, I had been talking to my father about interest rates?  Well now, I finally figured out who it was who decided interest rates and there's this mysterious thing called the Federal Reserve and low and behold, this black guy had become a governor of the Federal Reserve and suddenly everything sort of clicked, I became very interested--
Speaker 1: And so this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and called--
Speaker 1: --is junior high school?
Speaker 2: The last year of junior high school, the beginning of high school, so right at that transition period.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, it--to say I wanted to become a governor of the Federal Reserve at that point, probably a little bit of an overstatement. To say I was actually fascinated with what this Federal Reserve was and what they did and what it took to be there, absolutely true.  The other thing that was happening at the Fed at time was one of their most colorful chairman, a guy named William McChesney Martin was a chair and he was famous for pithy statements.  So he was the one who said, "Just when the party gets going, the Federal Reserve has to take away the punch bowl."  I thought, wow, this, you know, these guys are saying these important things, they're driving interest rates, I know nothing about it, I've gotta learn more about this.  And so I started, unlike, as you say most fifteen year olds--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --kids, became very intrigued with, you know, money banking, how interest rates were set and this mysterious place called the Fed that Andrew Brimmer is now gonna be part of.
Speaker 1: Okay so would you say that was the begin- that that's the beginning of your interest in economics and monetary policy?
Speaker 2: It's absolutely the beginning of my more formal interest in all of that, as I said, I had an informal interest in economics, monetary policy, through conversations with my father about interest rates and investments and where we get the best return in balancing check books.
Speaker 1: But at this point did you have any idea career wise what you would do with that interest?
Speaker 2: No.  At this point I had no particular idea except I knew about this Federal Reserve thing, it was in the back of my head, but it was really the beginning of an interest in economics and economic policy and what makes the economy work, and that kind of thing.  And that was the beginning of all of that.
Story_ID: 626920
Speaker 1: So then you moved to high school--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in 19--?
Speaker 2: --Nineteen sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so--the other interesting thing about Jefferson, before we move, was also the first place where I had to wear a coat and tie to school.  So, it, it was a big transition the way I start--thought about school. We'd--to be clear, at Jefferson we didn't have to wear jackets, we did have to wear a white shirt and a tie, so it was a big transition lots of different ways.  So, in '66 [1966], time to go into high school, and a couple of my teachers suggested that maybe instead of staying in the public school system, I might want to apply to some private schools.  And this was again, I, I didn't know that private schools existed, so this was eye opening to me. And so they mentioned a couple of boarding schools and then they mentioned the Sidwell Friends School [Washington, D.C.], and that sort of rang a bell and it turned out that my cousin, George Ferguson [ph.], was also gonna--he was older--was gonna go to Sidwell Friends School. And he knew--his mother was much more sophisticated than our family, she knew more, more, knew much more about all of this.  And so I applied to Sidwell Friends School and got in, in 1966 there were four, three other black guys in my class, one black girl and the whole class was ninety kids. And so this was a big switch. First time I had gone to a school that was majority white, big time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is in Northwest, D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: This was Northwest, D.C.  So, taking the bus started in ten or fifteen minutes going over to River Terrace [River Terrace Elementary School; River Terrace Education Campus, Washington, D.C.], thirty minutes down to Jefferson Junior High School [Jefferson Middle School Academy, Washington, D.C.], I took the bus across town from Northeast, D.C. to Northwest, D.C., to go to the Sidwell Friends School.  And on many days actually, my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] would take me because he worked at the Army Map Service which is far Northwest, D.C. and he'd drop me off early in the morning, I'd sit in the lobby (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well let's talk a little bit about that environment, 'cause Northwest--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is generally known as an affluent section of Washington, right?
Speaker 2: Very affluent, white.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So quite different from where I was growing up.
Speaker 1: And what was your initial impression of that to go, to move into that new community.
Speaker 2: You can imagine, my impressions were quite mixed in the sense that all my--majority white for the first time, very affluent, though ironically, a lot of the houses looked a little bit like some of the houses and parts of the Northeast they just cost, you know, they're bigger, they cost a lot more.  But I was lucky in that I had moved to a new neighborhood in Northeast, D.C. and some of the neighbors up the street had their kids going to Sidwell as well, and so I also had a sense that, and then, as I said, my cousin was going to--was going there.  And so, I had a sense that, gee okay, it's, it's quite different, but I think I can hold my own, and particularly having come from Jefferson Junior High School, as I said was the first time I was in an integrated class and I, as you point out, sort of held my own, or maybe did a little better, so I was, a lot of trepidation but also a sense that I could probably do this and, you know, it's not gonna be beyond little [HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson from Northeast, D.C., to at least do okay in the classroom.  Now I wouldn't have a car and lots of the social life I would miss, and the social part was actually, for me, not as important as the academic part of life.  And so I got to Sidwell and continued to enjoy the math for sure, developed a real interest in Spanish, there was a great Spanish teacher there, Senora Suprativia [ph.], who got me interested in Spanish, I studied through eight piece Spanish there, a great history teacher, Larry Turner [ph.], got me interested in all that, they did not have, at that point, economics or anything that would allow me to pursue that particular interest and so that one, you know, I kept going mainly by reading a newspaper, but there I would say, you know, it, everything worked out, you know, quite well.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with your classmates, did you make friends at Sidwell, and--?
Speaker 2: My relationship with my classmates was generally speaking positive, I had a number of friends for sure, you know, the black kids would sort of hang together, we, we tried to start a black student union, it failed miserably, (laughter), we couldn't get ourselves together, you know there were fifteen of us, (laughter), you know--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --in all the classes, they now do have a successful black student union, Sidwell has actually become quite a--it was always quite progressive because, even more integrated, but back in the late '60s [1960s], they were, we couldn't get ourselves together to have a BSU.
Story_ID: 626921
Speaker 1: The relationship with the students was very positive. Had a girlfriend--
Speaker 2: She was at Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: She was at Sidwell.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name is, was Diane Straus [Diane Straus Tucker].  And that was quite a leap for me to put it mildly, because her father [R. Peter Straus] was in the Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] administration, her parents came down from New York to be in the Johnson administration, they had been written about because they were descendants of two, her parents were descendants of two very famous German, Jewish families.  The Strauses that owned Abraham and Straus [New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and Macy's [R.H. Macy and Co.; Macy's Inc.] on the father's side and on the mother's [Ellen Sulzberger Straus] side, the Sulzbergers that owned The New York Times newspapers.
Speaker 2: Big family name.
Speaker 1: Big family name.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so here's this little old skinnamarink black kid from Northeast [Washington, D.C.] going out with Diane Straus and, you know.
Speaker 2: How did your, your family react?
Speaker 1: Yeah, my family was very, they're very savvy, my family was, very savvy about all of this, you know. They said okay, you know, you're gonna go to this integrated school, you're gonna meet all these people--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --You know, go on with your life.  They didn't overreact, they didn't expect much to happen either, its not, you know, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you were like sixteen?
Speaker 1: I was sixteen--
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --so this is not sort of, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --they, as my wife [Annette Nazareth] would say, they didn't invest, they didn't act as though--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --this was the beginning of, you know, something spectacular, but they also weren't, you know, they didn't act in any negative way, they just, which was very important, they'd created a real sense of, this is sort of the normality of life--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --whatever circle you're in, that's your circle, you're gonna be part of it.  They only--they're small number of tensions, around two or three different things, one, is socially we just were not in the same place, you know, so all of my new fancy Sidwell friends' friends were going off to summer--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --At Rehoboth [Rehoboth Beach, Delaware], or summer in Bethany [Bethany Beach, Delaware] for the whole summer and we were going for one week to Wildwood, New Jersey, or the Strauses went back to their, their place in Lake Saranac [Saranac Lake, New York], which is a, a place up in the Adirondacks [Adirondack Mountains] and certainly we were not doing that.  And so, you know, the social differences always emerged, emerged around cars, emerged around clothes a little bit but--
Speaker 2: But, how did that make you feel?  Did that propel, did that propel you more to success or was it like, I know who I am, it doesn't matter, I mean what was your--?
Speaker 1: It was much more, I know who I am, it doesn't matter. Great that these kids have money, we don't have money, fine. I still got a great family, guess what, this is about school and academics and, you know, guess who's gonna be inducted into the cum laude society, and that first six that they chose, you know, [HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson and Diane Straus (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --by the way, you know. Guess who's gonna be in AP Spanish.  And so though, you know, they had things we didn't have, it did not, I was not envious, it didn't suddenly, you know make we wanna do even better 'cause I always wanted to go very, very well.  It, for me, it was just simply that's the environment you're in, they've got something you don't have, you've got stuff they don't have and, you know, everybody will, you know rise or not depending on fundamental skills.  There are things I was very good at, there are things I was--I was a, not a great athlete, but I was the captain of the cross country team (laughter), I was a terrible wrestler, but I wrestled and I ran track, I became the editor of the yearbook, the president of the Spanish club and, you know, won a number of awards.  And actually, I told the story about my high school graduation with my aunt--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --had been, was the housekeeper for one of my classmates, I just find that just, it brought a smile to my face, you know?  It was sort of the serendipity and the humor of this crazy mixed up, you know, socially integrated but not really integrated society that we're in.  And it, it didn't, you know, I was not ashamed, I was not embarrassed, I, my head was high and I was in there participating fully and, you know--
Speaker 2: And your aunt I'm assuming, was very proud?
Speaker 1: And she was very proud, as my mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] would say, chest high the whole time.  So that was my high school experience, it was eye opening from a social economic standpoint, I was suddenly in a very, very different place socially.  But I felt generally speaking, I could hold my own and in the places where I couldn't because we weren't summering, we were, you know, taking one week vacation, I made the best of it.
Story_ID: 626922
Speaker 1: Did you work during the summers?
Speaker 2: At that point, not until after my senior year, so I spent most of those summers, as I said, doing the thing I loved the two most, which was reading and fishing.  We would go fishing almost every other weekend during the summers, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So then 1970?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969]--
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 2: --I graduated from Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And you enter?
Speaker 2: Went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay and now, was Harvard your first choice?
Speaker 2: Harvard was my first choice, I applied to three schools, Harvard, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and Amherst [Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: No Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York]?
Speaker 2: No Cornell, no Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  One of my teachers who had gone to Princeton and advised me that I would not like going to Princeton. So Harvard is my first choice and it was a--deciding it was my first choice, was a little bit of a struggle because Amherst had a longer history of African Americans.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, I will never forget, there's this gentleman, he's probably deceased now named, Chauncey Larry, who had been in the Amherst class I think of 1932 [sic. 1927], who called me, probably on a weekly basis to try to get me interested.  But Harvard was absolutely, you know, as much as love and still love Amherst, Harvard was actually, my first choice.
Story_ID: 626923
Speaker 1: So, we'll go back to Su- to Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.] for a moment.
Speaker 2: Okay, well they're two interesting things about Sidwell.  One is, as you well know, it's a Quaker school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the Quakers have a long history of being very progressive now and they were abolitionist, you know, back when the big fight about slavery was going on in the U.S.  But ironically Sidwell in the '50s [1950s], and I think even the early '60s [1960s], had a headmaster who would not allow blacks in the school and there was quite a bit of a tension and they finally got rid of him.  But when I was there, there were still a number of my classmates whose parents or grandparents were not very pleased to have blacks in Sidwell, I recall distinctly as I said, I was the editor of the yearbook and I'd gotten to sign lots of peoples yearbooks and then on one, on commencement, one of my good friends asked to get another copy of the yearbook without my signature in it 'cause his grandmother would be so upset that I had signed his yearbook, so it was that kind of thing going on.  I had another fellow at Sidwell who constantly referred to me and one of my good friends with the N word, and, you know, about ten or fifteen years ago, I and my buddy got a letter from this fellow who had gone on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and is doing great things, of an apology, because he had been so unwelcoming to us at Sidwell, and so while I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And now you're the CEO over a (laughter)--
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: --Fortune 100 company.
Speaker 2: Be that as it may, but while I had broadly speaking, a really wonderful time at Sidwell and, and, you know, axed the social stuff, thought I was fit in quite nicely, it was not as though it didn't have those moments of black, white tension--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --that came into the school, either because the parents or grandparents or some of my schoolmates.  And so, I don't wanna leave people--it was a great experience--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, you know, it was fraught, not every day but every once in a while the racial differences.  And the biggest time it hit was in 1968, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been assassinated, Washington, D.C., had riots.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Over in the Northeast side, Northwest section [Washington, D.C.] where Sidwell was, things were quiet, but we're hearing on the radio about riots in the streets.  So all the black kids had to figure out how to get home from Sidwell--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on that day in April, 1968, and it was not an easy trek at all, my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] worked, as I said, over near Sidwell, he came and picked us all up, a bunch of my classmates and tried to drive up and down Georgia Avenue, dropping people off as close to their homes as possible, trying to get around the riots.  And so, when the riots occurred in D.C., the distinction between far Northwest, the affluent, white section of D.C., and the rest of D.C. became (snaps fingers) visible for everybody to see, very tangible and questions of physical safety even started to, to arise.  And so, while I have really positive memories of Sidwell, and everything that was going on there, it was not in any sense isolated from the broader social dynamics that were occurring in, in the U.S. racial, political, et cetera.
Speaker 1: The mon- among the faculty at Sidwell, do you feel that you got the support and, and education that, that white students got?  I mean--
Speaker 2: I think so.  Now again, you know, Sidwell Friends, Friends School moving towards being very progressive. There could have been things going on in the faculty lounge that I'm not aware of--
Speaker 1: But nothing that, that you could have even impacted you? That (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nothing impacted me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at the end of the day, you know, got into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so it worked out well.
Story_ID: 626924
Speaker 1: Right, 1969, you're at, you're in Cambridge, Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: A long way from Northeast, D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Long way from Northeast, D.C., you know, parents--my first recollection of Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was not actually being at Harvard, it was getting to Harvard.  So, we packed up my limited belongings, my electric typewriter, the one electric thing I had, and my tensor lamp or desk lamp that we had at that point. Parents [Alberta Lawson Ferguson and Roger Ferguson, Sr.] took me down to National Airport [Washington National Airport; Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Arlington County, Virginia] here, put me on a plane, I'd never been to Harvard before, put me on a plane and said, "Junior [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson]," they called me Junior, "let us know when you get settled in."  So here this, again, skinny little kid from Northeast, D.C., going to Harvard, no parents to drop you off, not a tear in the whole place (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: "Son, good luck, let us know when you get there" (laughter). So I dragged my little self up there, took the Red Line over to Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] from Logan Airport [General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport, Boston, Massachusetts]. I had to get there a week early because I was a scrubby, I was a work study student--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and my job was cleaning bathrooms.
Speaker 1: What house were you in?
Speaker 2: Well, Harvard starts first, we're all in freshman dorms, I was in Hurlbut [Hurlbut Hall], which was outside of the yard, had three dorms outside of the yard, I was in one of those three and then sophomore, junior and senior year, I was in Dunster House.  But my first recollection at Harvard was cleaning bathrooms and that was really my first job, 'cause I didn't have, you know, a real summer jobs during my, most of my time in high school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I just couldn't, they weren't any, I couldn't find 'em.  So I think of myself as a Harvard scrubby, as much as anything else, 'cause that's the first thing I did and some of my best friends from Harvard were the guys who got there a week early to clean bathrooms for everybody else.  And in fact, you know, cleaning bathrooms as my first real job was quite transformative for me in some ways, it taught me that, you know, no job is too small to do while you're--you know, people, "Oh yeah, that jobs too small, you don't have to worry about." No job's too small to do well.  I was really proud, even though I can't find it now, I got a letter from some of my classmates about how well I cleaned their bathrooms--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --after a particularly raucous party, you can imagine.
Speaker 1: (Makes sound).
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.  But it also taught me you should have to sort of do even Harvard your way.  And so, I had a schedule where I went to class, did lunch and then I cleaned bathrooms every afternoon from one to three [o'clock] and, you know, in 1969, it was wild times believe me--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --at Harvard. And I'd walk in on some scenes in midafternoon that other kind of things that, that, you know, you wouldn't wanna tell your kids about and what you learn when you, you know, get involved and walk into people's lives that way. You also, you know, can be very judgmental.  People live very different lives behind closed doors. And as the scrubby, similar to, you know, maids and butlers of the old days, you get a real sense of, you know--
Speaker 1: Except for these were your classmates (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the great lives. Except these were my classmates, exactly right.
Speaker 1: And so you would scrub from one to three?
Speaker 2: I'd clean bathrooms at--
Speaker 1: But during the day you'd sit in class right next to them?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And, and how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: You know what?  Same as I did at Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.], my head was high, it was honest work--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, lots of black folks had done that kind of work before me, it had to be done, I did the best I could, and I still thought I could clean your bathroom in the afternoon and do as well as you are gonna do on the exams and, you know, in macro economics in the morning.  And that was absolutely my attitude and I, you know, was a bathroom cleaner, you're supposed to do for one year, I did it for two, 'cause it was also the best paying job at work study, so my father's [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] pragmatic (laughter) approach to money came into play here.  But I never tried to hide the fact that I was a scrubby. I don't to this day, and, you know, I didn't then, and I was very proud of the work I did and did not in any sense feel like a second class citizen versus all those guys--'cause then it was all single sex--who, you know, didn't have to clean bathrooms for a living.
Story_ID: 626925
Speaker 1: So, at Harvard, had you decided what you were going to major in?
Speaker 2: I knew I was gonna do economics.
Speaker 1: And so you said, at that time, co-ed--oh, that's right, 'cause you had Radcliffe [Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Massachusetts], was for the women and then you--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) were at, Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was all male?
Speaker 2: Right. It--and we became co-ed, my sophomore year was the first year that the men and women were in the same houses.
Speaker 1: Now at the same time though, we're at 1969, and I know at, at another Ivy League school, Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York], there's a straight takeover.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of student unrest going on, you've got in Ohio, you have the, the demonstrations and--
Speaker 2: Right, at Kent State [Kent State University, Kent, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Kent State.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What are you feeling and thinking during this, this, this particular time in history as a student?
Speaker 2: The same thing I think most people were.  All right, so people were appalled by Vietnam [Vietnam War], we still had student deferral, so I wasn't afraid of being drafted as long as I was in school.  But, like everybody else, I was, you know, ready to go for the strike when we had a strike that year, it was probably the biggest strike we had.  I recall very well, going around getting signatures from faculty and students that, you know, Harvard should not have final exams and we should, you know, be engaged with the activities of the day for sure.  So, I had exactly the same kinds of political emotions that others did, I was not in any sense a leader of all that--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --kind of activity because I was a little work study student and also was going to Harvard to, to learn--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and so the balance was very important.  A lot of my classmates, I think sort of lost their balance and maybe it was a time to lose balance--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I'm sure that's what they'd say.  From my standpoint it was a time to be actively engaged in the issues of the day, and having to do with Vietnam and a number of other local issues at Harvard, but it was also clearly a time to stay engaged in my studies.  And at Harvard, as with Cornell and other places, it wasn't just Vietnam, but there is a lot of activity around African American studies for example.  One of my good friends, was a guy named Roger Rosenblatt who had been selected by a lot of the black students, you can tell by his name he's a, he's a Jewish fellow, selected by a lot of black students to teach some of the first African American studies classes.  And so, I got to sort of participate in that through, not through demonstrations to get African American studies started, but rather through Rogers's eyes of a scholar bringing, you know, African American studies to life.  And so, I had from my standpoint, a really activist Harvard experience, not as activist as some, because I was also balancing with my, you know, (laughter) scrubby duties--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and the fact that, you know, my parents [Albert Lawson Ferguson and Roger Ferguson, Sr.] didn't send me up there to spend all my time out in, in Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: Being a revolutionary.
Speaker 2: --being a revolutionary.  And that's, you know, that's, that's the true me frankly.
Story_ID: 626926
Speaker 1: So, economics at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And how did that go for you there?
Speaker 2: It went well I will say.  My interest in economics then started to broaden 'cause I was thinking it was all gonna be about money and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --monetary policy and banking.  I, you know, took the, all the intro courses and then got very interested in development economics, there's a great professor named Albert Hirschman [Albert O. Hirschman], who was the dean of Latin American studies.  And remember I'd mentioned that I had, had taken AP Spanish?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I kept the Spanish going, linked that to economics and became very interested in development economics. My junior year I got a scholarship to go down and study economics in Latin America.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: And I went to Chile. And Chile, you may--this was in 1972, you may not know Chilean history very well but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Actually I do, but that's another story, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: This is--?
Speaker 2: Salvador Allende?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I went--
Speaker 1: Salvador Allende.
Speaker 2: Salvador Allende, the socialist who was progressively moving to the left and becoming--
Speaker 1: Yeah he, he preceded--
Speaker 2: Pinochet [Augusto Pinochet].
Speaker 1: And before that was Eduardo Frei [Eduardo Frei Montalva].
Speaker 2: Edwardo Frei.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I see you do know your Chilean history.  So what happened in Chile as, you know, is it moved from being sort of a liberal democracy, elected Dr. Salvador Allende--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to be president, he ran on sort of, sort of a soft socialist platform, but became more and more of a communist.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I was there, in the summer of 1972, as the beginning of his last year before he was overthrown--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --in '73 [1973].  So again, here's this black kid in Chile, Chile was a very isolated country behind the Andes and never really seen many black people.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: So I'd walk up and down the streets speaking Spanish very well, a number of people spitting at me, calling me an Indian, which for them was derogatory.
Speaker 1: Indios.
Speaker 2: Indios.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Which for them was derogatory.  The nicer folks, who were more progressive if you will, were trying to figure out where did this black person learn Spanish?  Are you from Panama maybe or--
Speaker 1: Did they say, viva Pele to you?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh very, very excited about Pele and, you know that was their idea of, you know, what a black person was--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --gonna be, they were stunned when I couldn't play soccer (laughter).  And so it's for me, a fascinating experience. But I had been with my--to Europe for about a week before, after my sophomore year, the first I've ever lived overseas really, leveraged my Spanish, learned how to, you know, get around in a strange society, also, experienced a place that was going through social upheaval with the left and the right.
Speaker 1: Were you in Santiago [Chile]?
Speaker 2: I was in Santiago, I went out and spent some days out in the, they would call them barrancas, the, the slums basically, speaking Spanish and trying to get the left perspective. It was, I was registered and the U.S. Consulate knew that I was there--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so I got invited to the U.S. Fourth of July celebration where I met a lot of the military leaders from the right--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and could get their perspectives of what was going on.  So you could imagine, my eyes were like saucers the whole time, I'm speaking Spanish, we've got the left and the right, you know, at each other in the streets, tear gas, a sense of rebellion in the air.  I remember very well people are waiting fo- there was a point when the economy was under stress, people were waiting for ships to arrive with pork from China--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because there wasn't enough meat, it was a fascinating time for me, three months in Chile, I gave it a real (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What were you studying?
Speaker 2: I was studying economics, I was studying unemployment.
Speaker 1: Were you at the university there?
Speaker 2: I was at the university but I was also doing some independent research--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I went around and interviewed some of Allende's ministers--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I remember spending a whole afternoon with a guy who was in charge of land reform to learn what they were doing there, spent some time with his minister of labor.  This was a--fascinating right?  'Cause I'm down here on a Harvard scholarship this little, you know, black kid (laughter) from D.C. [Washington, D.C.], going in talking to, I'd never met Allende himself or folks really close to him, but people two or three levels down, trying to understand and study how they were doing economics and particularly how they were doing--
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) unemployment.
Speaker 1: --were what, nineteen, eighteen, nineteen at this point in time?
Speaker 2: I was at this point, yes, yeah I was nineteen, relatively young--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --obviously.  So, a transformative experience. Then again there was a little bit of a racial tone to it, didn't have a big impact on me, and, you know, that was fascinating, it was absolutely fascinating.
Story_ID: 626927
Speaker 1: So you returned to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Returned to Harvard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in 1970?
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972]?
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: From, from Chile?
Speaker 2: From Chile. Finished up my undergraduate thesis, got a magna [magna cum laude] on that, graduated, actually got a high magna I think on the thesis, graduated magna, and had to figure out what to do next.
Speaker 1: What was your--what was the title, the subject matter of your thesis?
Speaker 2: It was unemployment policy in, in sou- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Latin America?--
Speaker 2: --in, in Chile.
Speaker 1: In Chile, okay.
Speaker 2: And to be fair, how I faired it out, unemployment policy given how--what I knew (laughter) it was good enough to get that magna. And I was very proud of it.  So, then I had to figure out what to do next.
Story_ID: 626928
Speaker 1: And you took another trip?
Speaker 2: And I took another trip. What happened was I decided, well I was gonna apply for some fellowships. And I applied for a number of them, my grades, though they were good, were not good enough for the Marshall [Marshall Scholarship], I did get a Rhodes [Rhodes Scholarship] interview, didn't get the scholarship at the end of the day, I was a Rhodes semi-finalist but I won one of the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] scholarships, the Frank Knox fellowship [Frank Knox Memorial Fellowship], that took me to Cambridge.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Cambridge, England?
Speaker 2: Cambridge, England.
Speaker 1: So from Cambridge, Mass [Massachusetts] to Cambri- Cambridge, England?
Speaker 2: To Cambridge, England.  And this was, again in '73, [1973], '74 [1974].  A fascinating period in English history because while I was there, the coal miners went on there--went on strike.
Speaker 1: Margaret Thatcher would have been the--
Speaker 2: Margaret Thatcher was not on the horizon yet, she was in the opposition.
Speaker 1: Who was the prime minister at the time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I was there, the prime minister was Harold Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a labor prime minister, and half way through, Jim Callaghan [James Callaghan] took over, known as Sunny Jim.  These guys were sort of, you know, European social democrats, but they were having a big--having a lot of trouble with the far left, a guy named Arthur Scargill ran the coal miners union [National Union of Mineworkers] and when I was there, they had a shortage of coal which drove the British economy.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: The--Cambridge, England year was about as cold as it's probably ever been. And so, once again, here I am thrown into--
Speaker 1: Now what did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) not at the--
Speaker 1: --what did you go there to study?
Speaker 2: I went there to study, wasn't sure I was gonna study. Ended up studying U.S. history, decided I wanted--
Speaker 1: From the British perspective?
Speaker 2: From the British perspective.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But to be fair, I was not very interested in studying, I was mainly interested in enjoying England, and I did.  I had a great time at Cambridge but what was fascinating, as I was saying, was the social dynamic of the moment, once again, a lot of political tension that year, one of the worst ever in England. I was here (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well who were some of the people that you met when you were--?
Speaker 2: I met a range of people, I met the economics tutor at my college, was a guy named Michael Kuczynski.
Speaker 1: And your college was?
Speaker 2: I went to Pembroke College at Cambridge [University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England]. So Michael Kuczynski, is one of the names I remember he was the economics tutor. And he, his brother, Michael Kuczynski is from Peru, his brother Pedro Pablo Kuczynski became the finance minister of Peru.  And so I got a little linkage to Latin America through Michael and, and, I wouldn't say I'm close, but he has been helpful to me one and off during the years through, through his brother, my tutor went on to write some great histories of World War I [WWI] and World War II [WWII] and so I got to meet some great historians as well, spent a little time with a few of the other economists there as well, but I was merely in the economics faculty.  So my experience there was really a little bit about the faculty, a little bit about other students.
Speaker 1: Yeah were there in--other international students that you had?
Speaker 2: There were a number of international students. Names I forget, experiences I remember, so there was a South African student who--white South African student--who was clearly trying to befriend me, was a little uncomfortable I must say, trying to figure out, you know, that racial component.  I remember he played a little trick on me that I thought and was, you know, I sort of laughed it off at the time but I knew he wouldn't have done to a, to a white guy. At, at Cambridge there's this thing called punting, they have a little narrow river not to fa- deep--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) called the Cam--
Speaker 1: --it's got the long boat and--
Speaker 2: --stand on the long boat and you push 'em off a stick.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he was doing the punting, I was sitting there and I kept feeling this water, and I turned around and he was intentionally throwing water on me. I, well, you know, this is completely inappropriate.  So we had a few words about that, it was a very interesting little experience where this white guy from South Africa is trying to figure out how to deal with this black guy and he was, you know, he was playing a little trick on me that I thought was completely inappropriate and probably racially motivated.  There was a little touch of that every once in a while, again not very heavy--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because by this time, it was 1973, and people were, you know, trying to--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --move on, in their racial interactions.  But I had a great experience at Cambridge (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Any romances at, at--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in Cambridge?
Speaker 2: No romances at Cambridge.
Speaker 1: No romances?
Speaker 2: Cambridge was not a romance point for me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: It was a, a nice relaxing point and what I say is what I'd, I'd studied history theoretically, studied economics by looking at what was going on in the British economy, and learned how to drink port.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So those were the three things I did in England and had some great vacations with a bunch of other friends from Oxford [England] and other places, went to Venice [Italy] and Rome [Italy] and Spain of course.  So it was a good relaxing period and I needed it because I was heading back to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a joint degree in law--
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and economics.
Story_ID: 626929
Speaker 1: What made you decide?  You took that year at Cambridge [England]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --because after Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you really couldn't, you hadn't made up your mind what you wanted to do.  So you got that year, what made you decide that you actually wanted to do a joint degree, law and Ph.D.?  Most people do law and business--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) but it's rare that one does law and Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Well, remember back to Andrew Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer]. My, my passion was economics, you know, it was interesting how businesses run, but I was really interested in the economy runs and at many different dimensions 'cause I also discovered while I liked monetary policy, I was also interested in development economics and other things--
Speaker 1: Define for us what you mean by development economics?
Speaker 2: Development economics is really how it is that emerging market economics progress to being fully industrialized economy like the U.S. or, or Western Europe.  And when I was studying it, they're lots of different theories about how that could happen, could you do that by what's called export led growth?  Could you do that by what's called export led growth?  Could you do that by substituting imports for own, for your own domestic production?  How would you invest in big capital such as dams versus investing in people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just to put this in perspective, at this time, you have the African countries that are emerging--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --into independence, was that one of the factors that interested you in development economics?
Speaker 2: It absolutely was.  Well I, my undergraduate thesis was on South America, 'cause I wanted to leverage my Spanish, the paper that really got me going in development economics was about school and school leavers, you know, drop outs, and graduates in, in Tanzania--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and how they were faring.
Speaker 1: Was this Julius Nyerere time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It was and so, you know, there was a lot going on about Africa, Africa emerging. Again it was the politics, but it was also the economics.  And so that was one of the things that got me very, very interested in development economics--
Speaker 1: So, okay so that's why you wanted the Ph.D. aspect of it?
Speaker 2: I wanted the Ph.D. 'cause I loved economics and I loved many different components of it.
Speaker 1: And law?
Speaker 2: Law was, it's gonna sound funny, meant to be my fall back, because while I loved economics, and had done, you know, reasonably well, I was not--
Speaker 1: You were magna cum laude.
Speaker 2: I was magna--
Speaker 1: That's beyond reasonably well.
Speaker 2: Right but it wasn't summa cum laude. Right?  And so, you know, those who were going to be faculty members probably graduated summa cum laude from Harvard College [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey] or Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], or where ever it may be.  [HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson did well, he graduated magna cum laude, he did very well, but not with the highest honors, with high honors.  And so I had to be very pragmatic, again I'm Roger Ferguson's [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] son from Washington, D.C., had to be very pragmatic. So I wanted to study economics 'cause that was my love but I also wasn't sure I was ever gonna get to be first rate leader of the theoretical academic part of economics, so I needed something to fall back on, believe it or not.  And I thought, well I'll combine that with a law degree. I'm not sure this is true, I think I'm the first person to ever attempt to do that at Harvard, I haven't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --tried to validate that statement. So there wasn't a joint program.  I applied to the economics department and separately to the law school, I explained to each what I wanted to do and I was very lucky because I got into both, and got into the economics department with a full scholarship.  They had known me as an undergraduate--
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: So I started the, this, this journey of the joint program in 1974.
Story_ID: 626930
Speaker 1: I started off doing, well I'm gonna get my orders wrong here. First year of, of law school--
Speaker 2: You went to, okay law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] first?
Speaker 1: --seventy-four [1974], '75 [1975], then back to economics for two years in '75 [1975], '76 [1976], '76 [1976], '77 [1977], back to law school '77 [1977], to '79 [1979], so I technically graduated in '79, and then I finished up my Ph.D. in 1981.  And my interest in law continued to evolve. I got interested in a new field called law and economics, I continued to be interested in monetary policy and then I got interested in something else (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) While you were in the, in law school--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you were com- there was one year when you were doing both Ph.D. and law right?
Speaker 1: No the way it worked was, my first year was just a first year of law school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then the second year of my program I did the first year of graduate school courses in economics.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then I did the second year in what's called the general exams, that then allow you to do your Ph.D., and then you're correct, one of the years when I was in law school I also took a seminar in law and economics from a guy named Mitch Polinsky [A. Mitchell Polinsky].  And so, I was combining both, and then I went back and did my dissertation and so it was ex- exhilarating in lots of ways but an awful lot of hard work and a little schizophrenic academically.
Speaker 2: Well, most people find just being in law school intimidating, difficult and challenging and yet, you were doing the Ph.D. and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --law, how did you psychologically deal with all the stress of, of, of such a, not done before program--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --such a very, very difficult program?  I mean most people are like just thrilled to make it through one of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Make it through--
Speaker 2: --programs?
Speaker 1: --One, yeah I know.  You know, remember all my stories about every three years, changing schools, going to Jefferson Junior High School [Jefferson Middle School Academy, Washington, D.C.] with the white people for the first time and figuring that out and then going to Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.] and frankly going to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  The reality is by that point I had come to recognize that, if you give a fair shot then I would be okay, not that I would be the best, not that I would be the best.
Speaker 2: But in many cases, you were the best.
Speaker 1: In many cases I was close to the best (laughter) for sure, you know, there's always some, look I'm not modest, there's always someone better--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay?  And let me tell how I know that.  So in my first year of economics department they encourage us to get into study groups, so I was in a study group with a guy named Steve Halpert [Stephen K. Halpert], who you don't know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson who you're talking to, third person in our study group, Larry Summers [Lawrence Summers].
Speaker 2: Secretary of treasury?
Speaker 1: Future secretary of treasury.
Speaker 2: Future president of Harvard?
Speaker 1: Future president of Harvard, what he was then was nephew of two Nobel Prize winning economists [Paul Samuelson and Kenneth Arrow], and son of two other economists [Anita Summers and Robert Summers].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So the reason I make this point is, you know, you're talking about the best, I know what the best is, I know I'm awfully close to it. But you also know, I know, you know, exactly what it takes to really be running on that track.  And so, the way I dealt with the issue around stress and pressure, was to say I've been on this track before, not always the number one, but in the race, number two, you know, not summa but magna, strong outcome and I know I could do it.  And so I had a really deep sense of self-worth and ability to compete because I had been in lots of these sorts of races before and had always come in, you know, not at always at the top but awfully close to the top every time and I knew full well that if I applied myself, I would get to that outcome and it worked out well.  So I graduated from law school cum laude, I think I may have been one of one or two black students my year who graduated with honors.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think Biogh [ph.] and Lacey [ph.] probably--
Speaker 1: Biogh was the other one.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And Biogh is sharp as can be and after he got into the law review [Harvard Law Review], I, I think I barely missed by grades and didn't bother to write on, you know?  So I was quite comfortable. The other element about this, as you can sense, is being comfortable with, you know, where you're gonna be?  I know I'm gonna be one of the best, I'm sure there'll always be somebody who at any one point could be, you know, a little better, good luck for them, I bring what I bring to the party.
Story_ID: 626931
Speaker 1: So you were telling us a little bit about, I guess I would call it your way of competing and your way of coping (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --with the competition.  And I'd like to explore a little bit about, a little bit about the root of your confidence.  Where do you think that comes from to say, I know I may not be the very, very best, but I'm wanna be in the race pretty close to the top?  Where does that confidence come from?  Where do you, where do you get that and how do you maintain and nurture it?
Speaker 2: In my case I really do think it comes from my family and I think that may be the cliche but in my case it's actually true.  I haven't talked very much about them really, particularly not about my mother [Alberta Lawson Ferguson], but in both cases, particularly as you could hear from mother, she didn't have an easy upbringing but she was smart.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And she valued education and she was the one who said to me, "Junior [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson]," as I told you, my family calls me Junior. You know, "Whatever happens, they can't take your brains away from you," she said, "you've got my brains and no one could take my brains away from me." She said, "And no one can take 'em away from you. So you leverage that."  And then my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.], again, you know, this child of the Depression [Great Depression] learned how to manage small amounts of money to be, still small amounts of money by current standards, but he did okay.  And so, it was from her, just this real sense of the self worth that comes from having some intelligence and applying yourself and from him it was absolutely the pragmatics of getting through every day, every week, you know, thinking about how you're gonna get from point A to point B.  And it was for me, a magical combination of nature and nurture and, I told you the reaction my parents had about my little high school girlfriend [Dianne Straus Tucker], you know, very cool, you know, "Don't get excited, celebrate success, you know, don't let new things fluster you." Told you about my, my little three months in Chile, you know, tear gas in the air, I'd send them notes back, "Be calm, you know what you're doing, we trust you completely."  So, coming out of an environment where people validated, my parents in particular, validated, you know, the skills I had, the, the natural gifts that I had been given and inherited from them, and God given gifts and a real sense that we know you can do it.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know?  This is gonna sound small, but think about how empowering it is when you are in the fifth grade and you're balancing your family check book.  You know, tiny little thing--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --it matters.
Story_ID: 626932
Speaker 1: But that was a monumental, and I don't use that as an exaggeration, a monumental thing to accomplish academically. When you had, I'm assuming you--there had to be moments of doubt or struggle or--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: How did you cope with that?  I mean was there ever a point when you said, my god, why am I doing a law degree and a Ph.D.? Why don't I just do one of these and be done with it?
Speaker 2: I said that frequently, particularly around commencements when everyone else was leaving.  There are two things that, that kept me true to what I wanted to do, one was a real sense of who I am versus who everybody else is, all right?  So it was okay for everybody else to go off and be a lawyer or be a--just get the Ph.D. I knew I wanted to do something that was gonna be in the space that needed both things.  So this is about Roger [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson], all right, and what Roger thought he wanted to do, couldn't say exactly what it was, but could really see that was gonna combine both 'cause I didn't love law enough to wanna be a partner in a law firm.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And certainly not enough to wanna be a, a law school faculty member and as much as I love economics, I never saw myself being in, on the Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] faculty 'cause I'm not, you know, I'm not gonna be that scholarly person, you know, breaking new territory.  So I needed to continue down this path because it was what--
Speaker 1: But you knew that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) I wanted to do--
Speaker 1: --in your twenties that you, you knew that?  That wasn't something that you subsequently sort of came to terms with.
Speaker 2: I knew that in my twenties. I didn't know what it was gonna be, but I started on this path 'cause I knew somehow or another I was gonna bring those two things together, I couldn't say quite where, I couldn't say quite how, I knew I wanted to do it.  Frankly, I also knew something else, which I think people don't take advantage of. I also knew I had the luxury of time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So I said to a lot of my friends, I'm taking part of my retirement now, and stayed in school until I'm thirty, because I'm gonna have to work thirty years anyway, so if I stay an extra three years now and work an extra three years later, I'm gonna still end up basically being in the same place.  So I had this sense of pace, that I didn't have to dash out to get a job, it was very important to invest in my own human capital, and I couldn't do it later, so I had to stick with it.  Now I was lucky because as I said, I got a full fellowship to the graduate school and when I was there, law school was not so expensive that you couldn't afford to pay for it--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --through summer jobs and then I got to be a tutor at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and so the money dynamic of it for me, never came in, so I could then, afford this luxury of, of taking time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was just quite clear to me in my twenties that, that was a point when I was investing in Roger and then I'd get the rewards later in life.
Speaker 1: So your father's [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] investment strategies spilled over, not just from finances but also into the personal Roger?
Speaker 2: Absolutely. And my mother's [Alberta Lawson Ferguson] investment strategies as well.  I didn't tell you, my father never finished college, my mother as I said, went to college, went on to--
Speaker 1: To teach (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Minor Teachers School [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.], the other thing I didn't tell you was, when she was pregnant with, with my brother [Rodney Ferguson (ph.)] she was working to get a master's from George Washington.  So I learned from her, you know, you stay in school and you keep pushing, but by the way, if you don't do it when you're young, it gets harder.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Imagine her getting a master's degree from George Washington University [Washington, D.C.], you know, two kids already and a third one on the way.  And so I saw what it was to work towards an academic goal later in life, and how hard that was versus doing it earlier in life.
Story_ID: 626933
Speaker 1: So you finish your Ph.D., and J.D. at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and now you have to make a decision?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tha- I mean, you--'cause what else you gonna do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What are you gonna do?
Speaker 1: You could, you could keep going to school, but at some point--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right and I came close to it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I decided when I was thirty, I had to have a job when I was thirty, that was part of the, you know, the, you give yourself your retirement, but you have to start when you're thirty.
Speaker 1: So this is 1979, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it's actually 1981.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one, [1981], I'm sorry, 1981, wha- what was your next move?
Speaker 2: The 1981, then it was this choice, right?  And as I said, I knew I wasn't--I could have gotten a teaching degree at a sort of a decent school, maybe work my way back up to someplace close to Harvard, but I told you one of my classmates was Larry Summers [Lawrence Summers]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --so, you know, I know what it is to look like you're a Harvard professor when you're, you know, twenty-seven.  So I had to figure out well what's the first professional step?  The good news was that the law practice had a little bit of appeal because once you get a law degree, you're not really a lawyer, you have to work for a few years.  And so I had the great opportunity to go to work at, at Davis Polk and Wardwell [New York, New York], I had two or three different choices. Davis Polk and Wardwell, was then and is now, in my assessment, the premier corporate law firm.
Speaker 1: Yes, sometimes referred to as the Tiffany [Tiffany and Co.] of law firms.
Speaker 2: Sometimes referred to by others (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Davis Polk is the Tiffany of law firms.  I had a number of friends there who had gone to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and some names that, that you and I know.  And so I started at Davis Polk the first Monday, of October in 1981.
Speaker 1: In what area?
Speaker 2: And, in corporate law.  The reason I--I'd been a summer associate there. The reason I emphasized first Monday in October, all lawyers know that's when the [U.S.] Supreme Court session--
Speaker 1: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) starts, so they're a bunch of really cool, you know, in lawyers who say we're gonna the first Monday in October, so that's what I did.  I had been a summer associate there in corporate law, I knew I wanted to do public finance and M and A [mergers and acquisitions], and I was very fortunate at Davis Polk, I got to do some cutting edge activities--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --including one of the first debt for equity swaps, one of the first debt for debt swaps, I was on the team that took a company called People Express [People Express Airlines] public. People Express was the pre cursor to today's Southwest Airlines [Southwest Airlines Co.], it was one of those sort of low frills--
Speaker 1: They were one of the first ones to start off with, put your bag on the plane yourself.
Speaker 2: First one to start off, put your bag on the plane, you know, seventy-nine dollars I think it was--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you could fly anywhere, then they went to London [England].  So I got to know a guy named Don Burr who was still an airline entrepreneur through, through Davis Polk, I did a lot of great work for a number of, of their clients.
Speaker 1: How many years did you stay at Davis Polk?
Speaker 2: I was there at Davis Polk from '81 [1981], to '84 [1984].
Story_ID: 626934
Speaker 1: The secret--the most important thing at Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell, New York, New York] is that's where I met my wife.
Speaker 2: And her name is?
Speaker 1: Her name is Annette Nazareth.
Speaker 2: And she was in what department?
Speaker 1: She was also corporate law.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the reality is that I saw her on the first day and knew that she was the one for me, she did not notice me for about a year (laughter) so.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But that wasn't bad because during that period I had purchased a co-op in an up and coming part of Brooklyn [New York] called Park Slope, it cost fifty thousand dollars, I purchased this co-op for cash, with money that I borrowed from my father [Roger Ferguson, Sr.] and my next door neighbor in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and my promise was that I would pay them back in one year.  Now in 1981, I think the first, I was being paid as a third year associate, I think it made eighty-five thousand dollars a year (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a lot of money.
Speaker 1: It was a lot of money, but not if you have to pay off a fifty thousand dollar loan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, my first year, I worked, I ate as many meals as possible at Davis Polk, charging it to clients--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but legitimately.  I paid taxes and quite literally, with every penny I had left, I paid off my fifty thousand dollar loan.
Speaker 2: Oh I see, so you did not take a mortgage out on the place--
Speaker 1: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at Parks Slope?  This was actually borrowing cash from your family--
Speaker 1: --Borrowing cash--
Speaker 2: --and neighbor?
Speaker 1: --from family and neighbor.
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: So my father lent me thirty thousand or thirty-five, the neighbor lent me fifteen or twenty, and this was a big punch of their--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --life savings, so I had to pay them back, they trusted me with--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --their money and I promised to pay 'em back in one year, so this was not a mortgage, this was a personal loan.  So the reason I tell you this story is, it's just a little story about perseverance, it's a little story about budgeting, but it also tells you why my wife didn't notice me for the fir- my now wife didn't notice me for the first year 'cause the first year I wasn't out socializing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and partying with all the other Davis Polk associates. I had no money. But year two, I had a co-op with no mortgage in an up and coming part of Brooklyn and a lot of money, so I was ready to party--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in year two. And so she finally noticed me in year two and as much as I love Davis Polk and obviously love my wife, by year three I decided that being a lawyer was not the thing for me.
Speaker 2: Now you're, so did--were you able to seal the deal with your wife in year, year two?
Speaker 1: No, but she agreed to--I made a big tactful mistake with my wife which is before we went on a date, I said, "You know we're going to get married?"  Now, this is not romantic, if you say to a young lady before you go on a date, "We're going to get married," you know what that means?  She doesn't wanna go on a date with you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And what that would have meant in 2012, is that you would've had me arrested for--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --harassing her.  And so I pursued her and pursued her, we had mutual friends explain what a nice guy I was, I explained to her how I had a con- how I had a co-op with no mortgage, (laughter) that was worth a lot and so she eventually went on a date with me before I left Davis Polk and then we got married a couple years after I left Davis Polk.
Story_ID: 626935
Speaker 1: What made you decide to leave Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I loved it but I knew I didn't love it enough to be a partner.
Speaker 1: Okay. And this was after three years?
Speaker 2: After three years, so in '84 [1984], actually it was about two and a half years I made this decision. They do some great work, very technical, if I needed a law firm, I'd go to do Davis Polk, but I wasn't going to be in it to become a partner.  And the reason is that it didn't take advantage of sort of the business, the economics--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --side of things, but I loved working with clients, I loved being in an advisory role, so I put two and two together and said, look I wanna do something that's got more economics, maybe a little more business, but still as an advisory kind of role and I decided I wanted to go to work at McKinsey and Company [New York, New York].  Now McKinsey at that point I think had not hired anyone who did not have an M.B.A.
Speaker 1: And McKinsey is a consulting firm?
Speaker 2: McKinsey is a, I think the world's premier consulting, management consulting firm, super duper first rate place. It'd also have to be--
Speaker 1: It's also not an easy place to get into either?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no and it was not easy for me because as I said, I don't think in 1983, when I started interviewing there that they had ever hire- or '84 [1984], that they'd ever hired a person that did not have a business school degree.  And so I had thirteen interviews, normally at McKinsey, you get six interviews or something like that, I had thirteen interviews and I think the jury was sort of seven, six or one that they'd hire me, I don't really know.  The thing that helped me there was a, a young woman who was a business analyst who, they were about to send a rejection note to me and she went to the head of recruiting and said, "No, you can't just send a rejection note to Roger [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson], you've gotta meet him 'cause though you've never hired a person that doesn't have an M.B.A., this guy"--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --"is the real deal."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that, that got me into, into the path and that woman's name is Karen Gordon Mills [Karen Mills] and she now is in the cabinet of President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], as administrator for small business.  So Karen kept my resume alive at McKinsey, I did thirteen interviews, as I said, I think it was sort of seven, six, and I finally got in and started doing consulting in 1984 as a partner in the financial institutions group, and stayed there until 1997.  Along the way, I became a partner there--
Speaker 1: Did you feel at that point and time that you had foun- found the proper milieu for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, in general but it still didn't have, at that point, the public policy thing I was interested in, leveraging my economics.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so I could have stayed there for a long time, but I would have eventually had to get them involved in something they've now gotten involved in which is public policy consulting.
Speaker 1: And were you married?  Did you finally catch her [Ferguson's wife, Annette Nazareth]?  Did you finally get her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I finally caught her, we got married (laughter) a couple years on, in my McKinsey years, and it, it's, we've been married ever since and we've got two lovely kids [Roger Ferguson III and Caroline Ferguson].  And my wife had a great career trajectory, left Davis Polk, went to be in house counselor to a number of big Wall Street law firms, went on to be a commissioner of the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] and is now back at Davis Polk as a partner.
Speaker 1: In D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: In D.C.  So her career has gone full circle.  So I was at McKinsey, '84 [1984], '97 [1997], we got married in '86 [1986], and I became a partner, along the way I also became the director of research and information services for McKinsey which proved to me, again one of those very lucky important things 'cause it gave me an opportunity to do management--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --internal- not just to be a consultant, but to management the internal research staff of McKinsey, McKinsey is about four hundred researchers, ranging from librarians to Ph.D. economist, so it was my job to manage that group.  But it also gave me a chance to learn about the intranet and knowledge management, in a professional services firm, so it proved to be, for me really spectacular.
Speaker 1: And this is sort of the beginning of the takeoff of the Internet at this point.
Speaker 2: It was beginning of the takeoff of the Internet, that's why it was important, as before folks who really knew what it was all about, how it could be used--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and, you know, obviously, you know, I didn't create the Internet, but I got in on the ground floor of how it could be used in business.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And, you know, no one saw it. You know, it's not as though they asked me to do this because they saw this as being potentially transformative. And I can't claim I saw it to be transformative, but it really was the beginning of something new.
Story_ID: 626936
Speaker 1: McKinsey [McKinsey and Company, New York, New York] is known as you said as being one of the world's premier management consulting companies. It's also known as being a place that is extremely demanding--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in terms of your intellectual rigor, but also in terms of time that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the time that, that the one has to put in, how did you balance your--balance your married life and this work situation that you were in?
Speaker 2: You're absolutely right about the time demands and I can't claim that we had an easy balance, the good news was my wife [Annette Nazareth] had an equally demanding professional schedule, the early part she was still at Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell, New York, New York], then she was a partner with a Wall Street firm, general counsel and moving up that path.  And so we found that our weeks, you know Monday through Thursday were mainly focused on work and particularly I, at McKinsey, I was starting to travel--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --an awful lot, she was very supportive and sort of allowed me to do that. Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays were always meant to be family time.
Speaker 1: So you had children at this point?
Speaker 2: We--our son was born in 1991, our daughter was born in 1994.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now remember I told you along the way I became a partner?  And also, I become the head of research and information services?  Well, when I became the head of research information services for McKinsey, I ratcheted back on my client work and became much more focused on the internal management of operations around this research function.  The good news for that was, it gave me more control over my schedule.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so I used that and I bec- became a partner in '92 [1992], I think it was. My son was born now, my son was born in '91 [1991]. So I started to get more control over my life, starting around '92 [1992], or '93 [1993], and that allowed that work life balance to work out a little better.
Speaker 1: Now are you living in your paid for it cot- co-op in--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --Park Slope [Brooklyn, New York] at this point and time?
Speaker 2: Ah, you came back to that, let me tell you why that co-op is important. The answer is no, we were not, at that point we had a house in Westchester [Westchester County, New York].  But the reason I make a little story about the co-op is I sold the co-op for a nice capital gain and that capital gain then allowed us to buy a bigger co-op that we then sold for another capital gain that allowed us to do the down payment on the house.  And so I say that all my success, I haven't had a lot, but all of my real estate success moving from one place to another was all built on that little co-op in Park Slope that I bought for cash, at fifty thousand dollars, 'cause I, that capital gain kept getting reinvested in more and more and bigger and bigger properties.  So no, we were not at that point (laughter) living in Park Slope but we were living in a house that basically the Park Slope money bought, so that's the story, that's how the Park Slope story comes full circle (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So are you, so then at this point and time with your son, what is your son's name?
Speaker 2: Same as mine, not very creative--
Speaker 1: But he's the third?
Speaker 2: --Roger Ferguson III yeah.
Speaker 1: So, well he's not, he can't be RG3, but he's--
Speaker 2: No (laughter). No he's not.
Speaker 1: You can't do that.  But, so Roger's now in your life--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --are you finding that you now really do have to focus more on balance in life?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I absolutely have to focus on balance, which is why I'm happy to make this transition to be an internal partner at McKinsey--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --focused on, on our research information systems.  I'm learning a lot about management, I'm leveraging my Ph.D. skills a little more fully on research, I'm learning about this new thing called the internet, and I'm getting to, you know, not have to travel around on anyone schedule other than my own.  So I still travel a fair amount but a lot more balance comes in my life starting in '92 [1992], '93 [1993], after our son is born, and our daughter's born, Caroline Ferguson, in 1994.
Story_ID: 626937
Speaker 1: So then you make a move from McKinsey [McKinsey and Company, New York, New York] where, you know, people spend thier--
Speaker 2: Their whole career (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) their ultimate dream is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to be a partner at McKinsey.  But for Roger Ferguson II [HistoryMaker Roger Ferguson]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you've still got another move to make.
Speaker 2: I've got another move to make. Remember I told you that when I started in the economics department [at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], one of my study mates was a fellow named Larry Summers [Lawrence Summers]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, now take us to 1995, Larry sai--Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] is in the White House, Larry Summers had become I think the deputy secretary of treasury at that point.  Larry Summers and I, you know, stay in touch, we're not intimate friends and our paths cross at something called Renaissance Weekend.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, the Democrats' big get together.
Speaker 2: Big think fest--
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) get together, it's actually bipartisan but it's, by that point it's really heavily associated with Bill Clinton.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And so I get invited, for some particular reason, I don't really know why, Larry's there playing tennis, one of his sports, not one of mine. He recognizes me, I recognize him, he says, "What are you doing?"  I said, "I'm just, you know, I'm a part of McKinsey, running research, thinking about economics, I know what you're doing," we have dinner and that's about it.  Then a little while later a slot opens up on the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve System], I hear nothing from Larry 'cause he doesn't know of my interest in the Fed. But he calls, not to join the Fed, he calls me because he needs someone to go work with him to do, to run the administrative side, I think, of the treasury, right?  'Cause he knows McKinsey experience doing internal stuff, I know something about technology, maybe I can help him run the day to day operations of the treasury.  So Larry calls to say, "Would you come and do this?"  And I said, "Larry, I love you dearly but no I won't do that," I said the--he said, "Really?  I'm stunned, people jump at that job."  I said, "No, no, because my lifelong dream has always been to be a governor of the Fed."
Speaker 1: Is that going back to Andrew Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Andrew Brimmer 1965, 1966.
Speaker 1: And the sub- subsequent to that, there has been one other African American--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Federal Reserve--
Speaker 2: A gentleman named Emmett Rice [Emmett J. Rice].
Speaker 1: Exactly.  But Andrew Brimmer is the person that sticks with you the most?
Speaker 2: Absolutely because he was the first and also because I come to know Andrew's family a little bit through his daughter Esther Brimmer.  So, Larry's calling saying, you know, "Come down here and do this thing in the treasury." I'm saying, "Larry no thank you, what I would like to do is be governor of the Fed," 'cause they're two openings at that point.  He says, "Oh please, everybody wants to do that, no way are you gonna get it."  So I said, "That--that's fine, I'm happy doing what I'm doing," and we end the call.  A couple days later he calls back and says, "Look I know you thought about it, I'm sure you really want that treasury job don't you?"  And I said, "No, no, you didn't (laughter) hear me, I'm happy doing what I'm doing, I don't want to work at the treasury, for a variety of reasons, it's not my job, but I'd still love to be on the Fed."  He says, "All right well, do you need--let me think about it," so then we start this courtship around the Fed, two open slots.  So eventually, he says, "Okay, if you're interested in the Fed, send down your resume and your material explaining why this is something that you want to do." And so I did all of that.
Story_ID: 626938
Speaker 1: Now, my resume does not shout out academic economics, it doesn't really shout out Wall Street or markets.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's--
Speaker 2: And those were criterion that you believed--
Speaker 1: --and those are some of the criterion (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) are the tra- traditional ones for being on the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve System]?
Speaker 1: Right.  But what it does say is consulting in financial services, law consulting around finan- law practice around markets and, and that kind of thing, and a little bit of regulation and understanding of technology and how that might be impacting productivity in America.  Now these are starting to be big issues at this point--
Speaker 2: This is 1990 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen ninety-six [1996]--
Speaker 2: Six [1996].  So the economy still is, is booming though?
Speaker 1: The economy is totally fine, the economy is not a problem.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So they have this long list, the Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] administration, of potential candidates, I brush up on all my economics, I brush up on some regulatory things, and I get an interview.  I started at the treasury with a guy named Jerry Hawke [sic. John D. Hawke, Jr.], who was the undersecretary for regulation basically in, in financial markets, that interview goes really well.  Then it's time for--then I get interviewed by the Council of Economic Advisers, well one of the folks in--
Speaker 2: That's Gene Sperling, is that correct?
Speaker 1: No, Council of Economic Advisors is a person named Janet Yellen, Janet Yellen had been my professor and Larry's [Lawrence Summers] professor back at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when she had just gotten out of Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  So Janet had lost track of me but she sort of vaguely remembered a little bit of that, that name when I reminded her of who I was. So that interview goes pretty well.  So then it's time to go to Gene Sperling, who runs something called the National Economic Council, not the Council of Economic Advisors, they are really the policy--NEC is the policy crew. So Gene looks at my resume and says, "(Makes sound) No way."  So I say, "Well, can I at least have an interview, you owe me at least an inter- everyone else has interviewed me, it's worked out well, you at least owe me an interview." So he schedules me for an hour, I go to his office, actually outside of his office, he--I won't say he refuses to see me, that would be rude, Gene is not rude he's just incredibly busy and can't seem--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to find the time to fit me in.  So I sat outside of his office for it had to be, you know, two hours.
Speaker 2: But you were so--you really wanted that--?
Speaker 1: I wanted this job, I knew it was my job, I knew I was the person, I had been thinking about monetary policy issues and other issues from the time I was seventeen, sixteen, you know, I wanted this job.  My moment had come and I was not gonna let somebody's busy schedule stand in the way. So long story short, Gene finally lets me into his office, we talk for forty-five minutes, I do my thing, he recognizes that, yep, this guy actually does know what he's talking about.  And then the- they all get together and recommend to the president that he choose [HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson, little known consultant from McKinsey and Company [New York, New York], former associate at Davis Polk [Davis Polk and Wardwell, New York, New York], Ph.D. from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, New York] and law degree from Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And another guy well known academic economist named Ned Gramlich [Edward Gramlich] to fill two empty slots on the Fed, and the story evolves. There's a little bit of a hiccup even getting a hearing in the [U.S.] Senate (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Does this, does this require a se- the senate confirmation?
Speaker 1: It requires Senate confirmation. Now the Senate committee that hears this is the banking committee, in 1996, 1997 it is chaired by Al D'Amato, he's a Republican from here and New York, Aldamotto is interested in who gets on the Fed.  But he's very interested in two openings, to open slots on the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission], and he has a jurisdiction over both the Fed and the SEC.  And so he refuses to schedule a hearing for me or for Ned Gramlich to join the Fed until the SEC slots are filled.  So Ned and I cooled our hills from, heels for, must be four months waiting for this politics to sort itself out. So eventually all that gets sorted out, I have my hearing Ned is there, Paul Carey [Paul R. Carey] had been nominated to an open seat on the SEC, and a woman named Laura Ung- Unger [Laura S. Unger] is nominated to the SEC, so the four of us have this hearing, and, and it works out quite well.  And the most ironic story of that is one of the--my McKinsey colleagues watches it, watches the hearing and sends a note to around everyone saying, "Roger was really good, he knows what he's talking about"--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --"I wouldn't have thought."
Story_ID: 626939
Speaker 1: So you're confirmed by the [U.S.] Senate--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and you're off to the Federal Reserve [Federal Reserve System].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you begin an illustrious ca- career that has, Andrew Brimmer [HistoryMaker Andrew F. Brimmer] has actually moved you to this point.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Andrew Brimmer has, has moved me to the front to this point, but Emmett Rice [Emmett J. Rice], as you say, comes in as well, Emmett is a great economist. Emmett's daughter, Susan Rice is now the UN [United Nations] ambassador from the United States.  And so there's, you know, these Fed governors and, and their kids because Andrew Brimmer's daughter, Esther Brimmer, is an assistant secretary of state right now, and so I tell these little stories to say you never know how the linkage is gonna work.  So yes, I am now on the Fed, I will tell you Alan Greenspan is not so excited that I'm on the Fed, he doesn't know who this Ferguson is, why should he be on the Fed, so I've gotta go back to my old, you know, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Sidwell [Sidwell Friends School, Washington, D.C.] activity of just to study hard.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so, my family's still in New York [New York], I'm in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], and my first two years on the Fed are nose down, study hard, learn everything you can and figure out, as I said no--remember?  Back to being a scrubby, no jobs too small, do well.  So I take on whatever assignment they want and do the best I can.
Speaker 1: Does Alan Greenspan make the assignments?
Speaker 2: Alan Greenspan and--basically makes, he has to approve the assignments as someone who may, who decides but he has to approve them.  So the reason I tell you the stories, I go from Alan Greenspan saying, you know, "[HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson who?  Are you sure this is the person you want to appoint?"  To the vice chairmanship opens up, Alice Rivlin leaves and Alan Greenspan signals to the White House that he wants Ferguson to be the vice chairman, so this is a year and a half of just hard work, no job too small, do well and little Roger from Northeast, D.C. becomes the vice chairman of the Fed and this is in 1999, yes.
Speaker 1: Now are your parents [Alberta Lawson Ferguson and Roger Ferguson, Sr.] still alive at this point?
Speaker 2: No.  Sadly my parents are not alive. Brother [Rodney Ferguson (ph.)] and sister [Rochelle Ferguson Washington (ph.)], aunts, uncles so, you know, lots of family around, but you know what, you know, my--you could imagine I miss my parents greatly, but this was a little bit for me because this was something I'd wanted to do since I was fifteen.  And not everybody in this world gets to do what they wanna do. Particularly if that's the thing you think you wanna do. And as I said, wanted to do, not in a really aggressive sense, but it's in my head spinning, spinning, spinning, this thing and I get to have my dream come true. Better than come true not only a, a governor, but I get to be the vice chairman.
Story_ID: 626940
Speaker 1: And so, you know, the role of vice chairman is amorphous. There's no particular thing except you get to lead the Fed [Federal Reserve System] in the absence of the chairman, which becomes important later in the story.  But when I been--first become vice chairman, the big issue of the day believe it or not, is something that in hindsight, looks relatively small, which is Y2K [Year 2000]. Remember my story about the Internet and technology?  So, someone comes to me and says, "Would you lead this group called the Y2K Council, it's the international regulators getting together, working with the industry to make sure everyone's ready for Y2K."
Speaker 2: And that would mean the change from--
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: --from analog to digital?
Speaker 1: Right and it's the change from 1999 to 2000 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two Thousand [2000]--
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: The zeros?
Speaker 1: The zeros. And everyone's concerned that computers have been set up to only change the last two digits, you know, you click over from 1997 to 1998, to 1999, but no one, when computers were created and became central, no one--people worried that no one thought to program, to click over to the new millennium, to 2000, so it wasn't clear how this was gonna work.  So businesses take on lots of investments, they go back and check all their computer programs and do a lot of upgrading to software and hardware, et cetera.  And we go through the click over from 1999 to 2000 with nary--
Speaker 2: Without a hitch (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a peep it, it appears.  Now in hindsight, was it all hype?  Was it people were actually prepared?  We oh, we really don't know.  I think there's some truth to both, I think maybe's there's a little too much hype not from regulators but, you know, out there in society, it may be too much hype about it. But I also know a lot of work went into getting everything prepared.  So that worked out, you know, pretty well if--
Speaker 2: So it's your first success as the vice chair?
Speaker 1: That's my first success as the vice chair though it's, you know, in, in quotes, because one doesn't really no the degree to how seriously severe the problem was.  I also do something else as the vice chair which was I lead a study on the impacts of consolidation in the financial sector, which does mention, it doesn't trump it, but it does mention that this growing consolidation means that we have a smaller number of institutions that create this challenge around being too big to fail.  We saw that, I saw it and the team saw it back in 1988, 1999, it's becoming a big issue now as we talk in 2012.  And so, I've had a couple of things that have been important in my vice chairmanship role.
Story_ID: 626941
Speaker 1: The thing that proves to be most important about my tenure at the Fed [Federal Reserve System] though is 9/11/2001 [September 11, 2001]. Nine, eleven, two thousand one is a day that obviously along with other fa- sadly a few other days, lives in infamy, 'cause that was the day of the terrorist attacks in United States of America.  On that day Alan Greenspan was in Europe, in Switzerland at a big meeting of central banks that occurred every six to eight weeks, sometimes he would go, sometimes I would go, it was his turn to go, all the other governors in the Fed were around the country and the U.S. doing Fed business or giving speeches of, of, or doing other things.  And so I was the only governor in Washington, D.C.  I'm at my desk as usual at around 8:15, my wife [Annette Nazareth] at this point is an important senior official at the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission], she runs market regulation. And market regulation team has a desk that watches and monitors markets in real time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on a daily basis.  And so at about 8:20 at the time, I'm gonna get the time wrong, 8:40, 8:45, my wife calls and says, "Our market watch folks have alerted me that there's something wrong in New York [New York] because one of the World Trade Center towers is on fire, you might just wanna turn on the TV and monitor it"--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --"we don't know what's happening," et cetera.  So I turn on the TV, I see the second plane go into the second tower, obviously not a coincidence, not just bad luck, but hard to imagine what it is, you can't quite imagine that anyone would intentionally fly--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --airplanes into the world's tallest buildings in New York.  But what it, what I do know is it's gonna be a scramble in Manhattan [New York, New York] because the World Trade Center, very close to the New York Stock Exchange [New York, New York], close to a number of other very important financial services firms and institutions including a company called Bank of New York [Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, New York, New York], which is one of the cl- clearing banks that keeps the, the system operating, the check clearing system operating, but more importantly, keeps the security systems operating and, and money flowing the system.  World Trade Center was also very close to the New York Fed [Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York], so it's in the Wall Street area [New York, New York] and obviously I and my wife both know that it's gonna be a tough day that we don't know what the source of the problem is.  I immediately then, you know, go to the floor where we are watching and listening to New York in the Fed, decide a couple of things that are very important, the president has announced that there has been some sort of attack and--
Speaker 2: This is President Bush [President George Walker Bush] at this time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) President Bush at this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that there's been some sort of attack and that we need to evacuate Washington.  I made immediately the executive decision that I was not gonna leave the Fed, others could leave, I couldn't lock the door and make the staff stay, but I was not gonna evacuate my location.  That proved to be really pretty important, because everybody else was moving around the city out of touch, my phones were still working, everyone could call me, so the Fed, not just my office, but I was part of it, became the spider in the web of information flow, the SEC, the CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission], the Treasury [U.S. Department of the Treasury], the White House [Washington, D.C.], the New York Fed, a number of the important banks, we in Washington, I at the Fed and my team, the Fed team were central in knowing what was going on.
Speaker 2: And so you kept the financial system together during that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we kept the financial system together. The second thing that we announced was that the Federal Reserve System was open and operating and that we were prepared to lend money.
Speaker 2: Throughout the entire time of--?
Speaker 1: Throughout the entire time.  These things, as you point out, through lots of different technical reasons basically kept the Federal, the financial system operating, all checks got paid, the money market system still worked. A lot of technical things called the repo market, still worked and that was very important because there was no panic in America.  Imagine if you would come to work one day and your check didn't clear on 9/11 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --or 9/12 [September 12, 2001], or you went to an ATM machine and you couldn't get money out of the machine, and so we kept the system operating, we kept the panic down and I truly believe that because of the good work that the Fed team did on that day, and I happen to be the one in the leadership role for the first two and a half days after 9/11, that we kept the economy from sinking into a deeper recession. At that point the economy had actually started to slow by the way.  So I ran the Fed with a team but I was the team leader all on Tuesday, the September 11th, Wednesday September 12th, Alan got back very late on the 12th, he did some quite research, found that I had done a good job and basically I was responsible for the Feds initial reaction all through that first week.  And, you know, I'm not a person given to immodesty, as you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and can tell, but, you know, things worked out well, the team did a really good job and in hindsight, obviously, I am pleased with the role that I played in keeping the system functioning--
Speaker 2: Would you say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) after 9/11.
Speaker 2: --that's one of your proudest moments in your career?
Speaker 1: It's definitely my proudest moment. It's the moment that brought together my knowledge of the banking system, financial markets--
Speaker 2: And technology (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) technology, the way the Fed system worked. It required a lot of international coordination as well, so having spent that time starting back in my little story about going to Chile and England, and other things that I did. So it all came together.  It also was a time where communication was important and I learned a lot of communication skills from McKinsey [McKinsey and Company, New York, New York] and frankly sort of interpersonal skills, which are important all through life.  So it's absolutely my finest moment and, you know, had we made other decisions, had I decided to evacuate the building or not keep the Fed System open, or not issue a statement, or not lend money, I do believe things would have been, you know, much worse.
Story_ID: 626942
Speaker 1: So you, you're at the, you're the vice chair [of the Federal Reserve System] and then Greenspan's leaving?  And the chairmanship comes up?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this something that you wanna do?
Speaker 2: It, you know it, to be quite fair, yes and no, you know?  If you're the vice chairman, sure you'd probably wanna be the chairman, one the other hand I have to tell you, having watched it, it is a heavy, heavy responsibility.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's much more visible than the vice chairman's role, the chairman is in the political crosshairs all the time and we see it now with Ben Bernanke, at the end of the day, you really have to make the final call, there's a whole committee, but there's a lot of difference to the chairman.  So there comes a point in life where you go, (laughter) okay, I've done the stuff I wanna do, you know, is that the, you know, is that the big step and is that the right step?
Speaker 1: But then, you made a decision to take another step--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after the Fed. You, you'd lived that dream that you harbored--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when no one at fifteen knew what the Federal Reserve was.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: And you step out and knew, have an interim step before you come to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where we are today, here at TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Well let me, but the whole, to be su- let's close on the chairmanship story.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'm a Democrat, not a--pretty--I'm not a partisan person, I'm a moderate kind of person quite bipartisan. So Alan Greenspan, his term is up, it's time for him to leave, the president in the White House is George Bush [President George Walker Bush], he's a Republican, so, you know, the probability that he's gonna choose a Democrat is not very high.  But the papers report, and I can't validate this, but what did I find interesting is that papers do report that there are a number of candidates that he was considering, apparently I was one of them, another one of the governors, Don Kohn [Donald Kohn], was a great man was another one, a couple of Republican economist and then a gentleman named Ben Bernanke, who is Republican, he ultimately chooses Ben Bernanke, which is a great choice--
Speaker 1: Did you know Bernanke?
Speaker 2: I knew Ber- I knew Ben because Ben Bernanke had been a governor of the Fed for a few years before he went into the White House [Washington, D.C.] to be the president's chief economic advisor, as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.  So Ben and I had a chance to be colleagues for about a year and a half?  I may get the timing wrong, when he was the governor of the Fed. I have a high regard for him, and I think he was abs- and believe today, absolutely a superb choice to be the chairman of, of the Fed.  So I'm honored that Ben asked me to do both the informal swearing in in his office and then the more ceremonial swearing in when the president comes over to the Fed to, to witness it.  And then, after Ben's been in office for, I don't know, about a month and a half, I decide that I should move on to the next step, as you point out, and that is in 2006.  So the summer of 2006, actually I think April or May, of 2006, I leave the Fed, you know, try to figure out the next steps. Take an interim role, take a role at a company called Swiss Reinsurance [Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd.], Swiss Re not a very well known organization, I decided to do it because I didn't wanna go to an entity that I had been regulating--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --which took all the banks and indirectly the investment banks off the list, I didn't think that was the right thing for me to do, it's okay for other people, it wasn't the right thing for me to do.  And so I was looking for something else in financial services and decided to go to Swiss Re. That leveraged my international linkage, my interest in markets, interested investing, and it worked out, worked out well.
Story_ID: 626943
Speaker 1: So I'm there very happily doing, I'm doing it over there at Swiss Re [Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd.] and then in early 2008, I get a phone call from a headhunter saying, "You're probably not thinking of moving, but there's this company called TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York] and they're looking for a new CEO." And my life is full of coincidences, it turns out that one of my good friends from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] is a ya- is a woman named Martha Greenough, Martha Greenough's father, Bill Greenough [William C. Greenough] was the CEO and chairman of TIAA-CREF for many years.  So I got to meet Bill Greenough at Martha's wedding which I, I'm gonna get the date wrong, I think it was 1979, something like that, maybe a little before, a little after.  So ironically, though most people don't know much about TIAA-CREF, I've actually gotten to meet--
Speaker 2: Prior to you coming?
Speaker 1: --prior to my coming, the president and CEO of TIAA-CREF. So when the phone call comes, I know the company, I know its history and--
Speaker 2: Can you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I'm interested--
Speaker 2: --just tell us, you know, what the TIAA-CREF is?
Speaker 1: TIAA-CREF is the largest provider of retirement and other financial services for people in the not for profit sector.  So we manage about $500 billion of retirement money for teachers and folks who works at mute- folks who work at museums, people who work in hospitals--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --K to 12 [kindergarten to twelfth grade], et cetera, that's what we do.  We've been around since 1918. We're not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's founded by Andrew Carnegie--
Speaker 1: It's founded by Andrew Carnegie. We're not a publicly traded company, and, and we are ourselves are not for prof- have a big not for profit heritage.  So it's a unique company, it's financial services, not traditional Wall Street, but it leverages all the things I love. Higher education, education in general, the not for profit sector, investing, markets, and providing financial security and wellbeing for millions of Americans who serve other people.  And so, that's what I'm doing today and it's just, it fits like a glove, I love it.
Speaker 2: You are the CEO?
Speaker 1: I'm the president/CEO of TIAA-CREF and I've been here since April of 2008.  It's been an unusual time, because markets have been very volatile--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but I'm quite proud of what the team has accomplished.  We, as we sit here, July, the end of July, 2012, we have the largest capital base you've ever had, last year we had record net inflows, we have--and let's face it, very low interest rate environments, every retiree is continuing to be paid appropriately and so this team has done a masterful job through some very, very tough economic times.

Speaker 1: At this point we usually talk a little bit about, more, more esoteric issues.  And I guess one of the things that I would like to ask you, now that you are sitting on the top of the world here at TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York], what do you want, wha- what do you want the world to look like for your children [Roger Ferguson III and Caroline Ferguson]?
Speaker 2: You know, every parent has, you know, dreams for their kids. Obviously the usual things are important, so peace and prosperity, you know, all that's important and pivotal for sure, and not to be taken for granted.  'Cause as we sit here, there are trouble spots all around the world and certainly prosperity is really hard to come by these days, the U.S. is, you know, gradually coming out of the deepest recession we've had since the Great Depression.  Europe looks like it's in recession, China's slowing, so peace and prosperity are not to be taken for granted.  I also really want society to deal with some of the big issues that we're confronting, and I'm speaking as an economist, so they're other issues out there as well, global warming and other things that other people worry about, I worry about them too.  But as an economist, the issues that we really have to confront are, how to deal with something I'm working on, the aging baby boomer population for the next twenty-five years, how do we make sure that we don't burden the next generation, my children with unsustainable debt?  Which is a real problem for them.  How do we fix some of the challenges that we're confronting around social security, Medicare, Medicaid, to make those successful for people in America because many, many Americans depend on the, that sort of social safety net.  And do that in a way that's consistent with good fiscal policy, those are some of the things I, I think about for my kids.  Most importantly though, I really wanna have my kids to have the magical opportunities that I've had.  Think about it.  I was born in the time when segregation was the norm, I grew up in a time when, you know, we couldn't stay in a room close to the beach at Wildwood [New Jersey], we're back towards the garbage dump, I couldn't go to the local amusement park [Glen Echo Park, Glen Echo, Maryland], we had to travel two hours away to go to an amusement park [Hershey Park; Herseypark, Hershey, Pennsylvania].  But I had the advantage of a great public school system, that was segregated but that worked. I then went to some of the country's and indeed the world's best private schools and got a great education without taking on a big student loan.  I have been very lucky to have worked in some great private institutions when they were hiring, which some of them are not these days.

Speaker 1: Well, let's look at this then from a more macular prospective.  And--macro, I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is your hope for African American people?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We're seeing actually some would say, progress that we're slipping, that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that the--
Speaker 2: Let me turn to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All right, we've, as I said, my life has been magical, an African American born in the '50s [1950s], has seen an upswing, you know, out of desegregation into integration; out of a place where the best schools didn't want you, to did the best schools really want you; out of a place where you weren't sure if the faculty were supporting you, too they were writing strong recommendations, where I'm leading with my kids [Roger Ferguson III and Carolina Ferguson] is where I'm leading with African Americans, and society in general.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I do fear that's slipping. I had a two parent household, both parents [Alberta Lawson Ferguson and Roger Ferguson, Sr.] had steady jobs, that's sadly now the exception for African Americans--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I believe it's true that more African American babies are born to single unwed mothers than those born into two family households.  I went to some great priva- public schools, public schools across the country I think are suffering, my public school got me ready for Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I'm not sure that's happening anymore, the job front, great, white collar jobs for me but also a range of jobs for people.  So what I want from African Americans is what I want for my kids 'cause they are African American, which is a continuation of the magic that I had, because I do see it slipping away. So I wanna have healthy families, I want mothers and fathers togith- together to giving their kids what my parents gave me, and it really wasn't about money, all right?  It was about self-confidence, a sense of value, the importance of hard work. So those are the things that I want, I want for African American community including my kids, to have all the stuff that I had.  I've--it's a funny thing, but I really do fear that society, including the African American part of society is falling back, not moving ahead and there are a lot of statistics that are showing that.  This generation of kids will be the first generation that's less well educated than their parents. And I've told you the story of my parents.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right, if nothing else, I'm at least as well, if not better educated than my parents, I think that's what our generation stands for, those of us who are aging baby boomers.  So as an aging baby boomer, what I really want is for my kids and all African Americans to have a real shot at replicating this spectacular trajectory that I've had, and I fear that's it's really falling back.

Speaker 1: What do you want as president of TI- of TIAA-CREF [Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America - College Retirement Equities Fund, New York, New York]?  What do you--what do you want your legacy from this company to be?
Speaker 2: You know, TIAA-CREF right now is at a very interesting place because it is a retirement company just as the baby boomers are starting to retire. And so now we really have to do two things, we have to live up to our mission and purpose, and get all of these millions of Americans, 3.6 million Americans who depend on us, safely through retirement, and this is the first time we've had this kind of big generational swing towards retirement.  So I want my legacy to be, he got us in a position where we could continue to keep the promises that we've made to help all of these Americans retire safely.  And then the second part of it is, he also kept the company, rea- really viable for the younger folks who are joining today.  I remind all of my colleagues that right now as we speak, there's some person on campus, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, years old who is starting on the path of saving for his or her financial security in the future, and we owe it to them to be as healthy seventy years from now as we are today.  And so I want my legacy to be, he got us to a place where we could absolutely continue to pay off the retirement for all the baby boomers and at the same time, create a safe secure financial future for all those Gen Y, Gen X millennium folks who are signing up for us as well, which to say, I'm trying to set the company up for great success over the next ninety months, but also for great success over the next ninety years, and that's really what I want my legacy to be here at TIAA-CREF.

Speaker 1: And is the next step for [HistoryMaker] Roger Ferguson, or Junior, is it perhaps a position in the Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] administration?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know what, I love what I'm doing, I think this is a very important social service, it gives me a great chance to be in the private sector and help in the public sector, so I think my next step is to be here.  I intend to be here, I hope to 2018, get us to our hundredth birthday here at the company, get me to my tenth anniversary as CEO and then we'll see what happens after that, I don't expect to retire though.
Speaker 1: Thank you so very much (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh thank you, it's been a pleasure.
