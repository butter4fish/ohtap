 Neurohr  Pults  Today is October 15, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian at Oklahoma State University. I   m here at the White Barn  Estates conducting interviews for the O-STATE Stories Oral History  Project of the OSU Library. Today and tomorrow we   re doing  interviews with the Women of Willard. This is the fifty year reunion for  you ladies, isn   t it?  This is my fifty-first.  Welcome back to campus and Homecoming and your reunion this year.  Thank you.  And thank you for agreeing to participate in the interviews with us.  Glad to.  Phyllis, can you tell me about your early life, where you grew up and a  little information about your parents?  I grew up on a farm west of Coyle, Oklahoma in a German-Lutheran  Community called Pleasant Valley. I went to a little country school my  first eight years and went to high school in Coyle. My father was a  farmer and my mother was a homemaker at that time and I had two  brothers and an older sister, kind of a limited life. (Laughs) We were all  German-Lutherans, so we couldn   t date. We had lots of parties and lots  of fun, but we were all cousins. (Laughter)  What influenced you to attend OSU?  Probably because I had been in 4-H Club and I had been to Roundup for  four years so I was very familiar with it   very comfortable here and  5  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  thought I wanted to be a Home Economics teacher. I really wanted to be  an airline stewardess, but I didn   t have the courage to go that far away  from home. (Laughs) So I did something that was familiar and stayed.  What were your first impressions of campus coming in as a new student?  Pretty comfortable actually because we   d been here and stayed in the  dorm.  Had you stayed in Willard at 4-H Roundup?  Yes, we stayed in the dorms when Roundup was here, so it was very  familiar.  And you majored in Home Economics?  Yes.  What year did you graduate?  In 1958.  Did you live in Willard Hall all four years?  I lived there three. My daddy ran out of money the last year and I lived  with my aunt and uncle here in Stillwater that last year. Part of it I was  in the home management house and part of it I was student teaching, so  that worked out okay.  Was Willard your preference for a place to live?  Yes.  Why is that?  I don   t know. It was a little closer than Stout and Murray at that time and  Joanie Harper and I worked in the Residence Halls office. She and I and  Mary Jane Hessell and Kim Rohr lived on Willard Two West with a  whole wing of seniors. (Laughs) So the next year after they graduated,  when the applications came in of kids we knew we just put them on  Willard Two West and that   s how we really got together. We   d known a  lot of us through 4-H and through the church  during  our high school  years. So we got us all there and we stayed. (Laughs) We liked it.  What was your room number?  6  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  215. It   s now a stairwell. (Laughter)  Was there a window?  Yes, two. One on the west and one on the south.  Oh, you had a two window room.  It was a corner room, yeah.  So what did you look out on from your windows?  Monroe on the west and really just west of the pond. The south.  Can you describe your room for me?  Yes, we had two twin beds. We had two desks and we had two chest of  drawers and one sink and two little itty bitty closets. But everything fit  because we didn   t have any clothes. And we had steam pipes that ran  across the ceiling and we all wore our big can cans and we hung them up  there because there wasn   t room in the closet.  What   s a can can?  Big petty coats that went under all of our skirts. (Laughter) Had to have  the can cans.  What color was yours?  White. But we shared. Whatever anybody didn   t have, we shared.  Did they have an elastic waist?  Oh, yes. And about four tiers that got bigger and bigger and bigger.  How did you launder them?  Well you just rinsed them in the sink and hang them up to dry. They  were nylon net, so they dried real easy.  Did you decorate your room?  No, we didn   t have the money. We did buy some black and purple  flowered  fabric  and made some curtains, but she had her bedspread  and I had mine and they didn   t match and I didn   t care.  7  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Did any of the girls have sewing machines in the dormitory or could you  use the sewing machines that were on campus?  I don   t remember. I don   t think we did, but I don   t remember. We had  forbidden popcorn poppers. (Laughter)  Oh really?  Fire hazards.  Were they electric?  Yes. The kind you put the oil in and it could really make a good fire. But  we didn   t have any.  Did anybody have little refrigerators or anything?  Oh, my goodness, no. (Laughter) No, no. In fact, we all shared one  bathroom down the hall and we all shared one phone, if you can imagine  that.  What was that like?  No problem, really. Just whoever was closest answered the phone and  yelled a name and they came or they   re not here. It worked out.  What about typewriters?  No, no. None of us had typewriters. We wrote with our hands.  Was there ethnic and international diversity in Willard?  Not very much at that time. We were just beginning to get Ethiopian  students over here and we got our first black student over here. We  didn   t have very many. They began to come as we were there, but at the  beginning there weren   t very many. But we welcomed them. We thought  it was great.  What do you remember about your house mother?  (Laughs) A little prim and proper, but very nice.  What was her name?  I don   t remember. I knew you were going to ask me that. I can see her.  8  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Was it the same one all of your years there?  Yes. I can see her, but I can   t remember her name.  Did she have friends?  I don   t remember.  Okay. You didn   t really know anything about her personal life?  No. I think we were just so wrapped up in our own life.  Do you remember the Dean of Women at all, anything about her, Dean  Patchin?  Oh goodness, yes. In my mind, it was Dean O   Tool at the Home  Economics department. Yeah, Dean Patchin, she was a wonderful lady.  Do you have any stories about her?  No, no. We didn   t really know what was available for us. We just kind  of went our way and if we had a problem then we sought help. We  usually didn   t have any problems because life was very simple.  What can you tell me about the cafeteria in Willard?  Good food, except Brussels sprouts. (Laughter) Had to dress for Sunday.  Couldn   t wear shorts and sleepwear and stuff like that. Had to wear  clothes, but I thought it was very good food.  What other places were special in Willard Hall?  Really just our wing. We didn   t do much in the living room downstairs.  We just all congregated in each other   s rooms and had our own fun.  I   ve heard that there was a curfew.  Oh, yes.  Freshmen had to be in by 8 o   clock?  Yes.  Were you ever penalized for coming in late?  No. We did what we were told. (Laughter)  9  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Oh, okay. I   ve heard that more than once today.  Strange phenomenon. If you were a sophomore and had a B average,  you could be out until 10:30.  Oh, really?  But freshmen and sophomores had to be in at eight otherwise. 11 o   clock  or 10:30 on the weekends   let   s see, I can   t even remember. I thought I  did. But did they say 12?  I   ve heard 10:30. I haven   t heard anybody say anything past 10 or  10:30.  Seems like 11 on Sundays, but I can   t remember.  I   ve asked several people about the famous panty raids and everyone  keeps telling me to ask someone else, that they   ve heard stories, but they  don   t really remember it. What do you know about that?  That   s because we    58 girls were   the ones who graduated in    58 were  freshmen when that happened. They were right outside our room and we  were scared to death.  Was it at nighttime?  I don   t know what time at night it was, it was just dark and we heard this  roar and we were scared to death. We got all in one or two rooms and  locked the door and all of a sudden when they got in the door and they  were coming down our hall, our friend Joanie said,    Oh, my gosh. I left  my door open and I   ve got my name on all my panties and bras     Sure  enough, they got them. (Laughs) You know, coming from the farm, that  was really terrifying. But we didn   t have any problems about it, it was  just our underwear.  Was it after everyone had gone to bed?  No, probably 8:30 or 9:00. We   ve got the papers over there.  Oh, you do?  Yes, Virginia has the papers over there.  So what did the boys do with all those panties?  I have no idea.  10  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  The girls didn   t get them back?  No, we don   t know where they went  (Laughter)  Well that   s a question for the boys then, I guess. You mentioned that you  were active in the Residence Hall Association?  Yes.  Tell me a little bit more about that.  Well, I was trying to think. I was a floor representative at one time and  we had meetings, but I just don   t think I ever was really involved in it.  They would plan socials. We   d have an Easter parade where everybody  had to make their hats out of something, whatever we had. We   d have an  Easter parade and judging. It was just fun stuff. I really don   t remember  us doing a whole lot there.  So was the Association comprised of representatives from all different  dorms?  No. I was just involved in Willard.  So you planned activities just for Willard?  Right.  Were the same types of activities going on in the other dorms too?  Yes.  So that was coordinated?  Yes.  Did you have another job while you were in school?  Besides Residence Halls? No, I just worked in the Residence Halls  office. Fifty cents an hour.  And how many hours a week?  Gee, I can   t remember.  Every day?  11  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Yes, some hours every day. I bought all my clothes on layaway and I   d  take my little dollar or two down and pay them off.  What stores were you shopping at?  There was one down on Washington that I really, really liked. I can   t  remember the name of it. A little dress shop.  You mentioned where you worked after you graduated.  I graduated on August 2, 1958 and my husband and I got married on  August 3, 1958. He had changed majors twice and still had some work  to do, so we lived here in Stillwater and I worked at the library in the  card catalogue section. That was really a neat experience until I got  pregnant. Then when I started showing because I was pregnant, I  couldn   t work there anymore.  Oh, really?  Oh, yes.  And who dictated that? It was just the policy?  Just the policy. And then I encountered that again thirteen years later  when I was teaching in Davis, Oklahoma. I got pregnant with our third  daughter and had to quit teaching when I started showing. Haven   t times  changed?  They have. I   d like to know more about working at the library. What  floor were you on? The second floor?  The second floor with the card catalogue and I got to do   I can   t even     Were you typing the information in the cards?  Yeah, the cards and filing them and putting the information in the mid  books and doing accessions. And I don   t remember a soul that was there,  but I loved that library. That was pretty new. It was pretty new when we  were here.  It was finished in    53.  Yeah, so it was pretty new when we came in    54. And it was wonderful.  Did you study in the library, too?  12  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Yeah, fourth floor.  Fourth floor. You had a special spot?  Yes.  Where was it?  It was just kind of back off over quiet by itself.  Do you have any other library stories?  No. I was just amazed at all the information that was available because  our little country school had a bookshelf about four feet wide and eight  feet tall and then Coyle didn   t have a really good library and we weren   t  encouraged to read. I don   t know what we did. I don   t think we   d make  it today. But it was just a wonderful place. You could roam the sections  and find out all kinds of things.  Have you been back to the library since? Have you ever been back to  campus?  Just a few times. My husband is a retired Methodist minister, so we lived  other places and have been involved in lots of lives, so.  Well I hope that you have an opportunity to come back. We   d love to  give you a tour. It   s changed quite a bit.  I   ll bet it has. The big room on the west as you came up the stairs to the  second floor, was that the     We call that the Reading Room.  It had a lot of historical books in it, didn   t it?  It doesn   t now. We have over 2.75 million volumes and some are stored  off site because they won   t all fit in the building.  My goodness.  And then the Browsing Room is on the east side as you come up the  stairs and it   s very beautiful. There   s some renovation going on now in  the library, so  there are  lots of computers on the first floor.  We wouldn   t have known what to do  (Laughs)  13  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  I think your group would enjoy seeing it.  I learned to type on a manual typewriter. I can type eighty words a  minute with long fingernails.  That   s quite an accomplishment  (Laughter) Let   s talk about any other  traditions at Willard. Were there holiday events?  The residence halls always had a winter dance and that was always a big  event for us. Sometimes I think we had two a year, but those were  always real special. I made my dress for them. My children love it.  Somebody mentioned earlier Christmas caroling, a special Christmas  party or tradition.  I just don   t remember.  What about Homecoming? Did you all participate in Homecoming?  Some, but Homecoming wasn   t a big deal then like it is now. The south  side was never even half full when we came to school.  At the football stadium?  And a lot of students went mostly because our tickets were paid for in  our tuition, but our poor Cowboys would get down to the one yard line  and have to go the other way so many times (laughs) so it wasn   t a really  big   we wanted it to be, but it wasn   t.  Was basketball popular?  Yes, very popular. Yes, we liked to go to the games.  Does anything stand out about the basketball games?  No, just that when Wilt Chamberlain was there, I was in the infirmary  and my boyfriend took another girl. (Laughter) Funny.  What about wrestling?  No, it wasn   t interesting. That   s too hard.  Were there opportunities for women to participate in the sports?  We had intramural basketball. I have to tell you about that. I played  basketball in high school, but our basketball intramural was   you take  14  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  one dribble and you pass the ball. Well after you   re used to dribbling the  ball up half court, you can   t even think that way. It was not fun. Weird.  Was it three on three?  Yes. Dribble once and pass it.  Any other sports opportunities?  No. I wasn   t into sports much.  You became engaged while you were there.  Yes, and married. Married a boy from there who didn   t graduate. He was  from Tecumseh, but he came to school here. Lived in Cordell and we  dated all four years.  Was there anything special that happened when you got engaged?  No. (Laughs) The girls would usually fill the bath tub with water and  throw you in. We had one bath tub on the wing.  So did that happen to you?  Yes, yes, yes.  Did you put up a fight?  Oh, of course, you have to. (Laughter)  Are there any other special memories from Willard that you can think  of?  Well, you want to know about the water fight we had?  I do.  We had transoms over the doors that were like the plantation shutters  now. They were slotted, you know, for air. And we got to having a water  fight one evening and we were throwing buckets of water through those  in each other   s rooms until it got downstairs to the housemother   s floor.  So that put an end to that real quick. (Laughter) That   s about the worst  thing we ever did. Oh no, we did   I have some great pictures over there  during Western Week. We had a saloon in one of the girl   s rooms and  we have on our can cans like tutus and our swimming suits and we   re  smoking cigarettes and we   ve got beer bottles   there   s nothing in them.  15  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  But we were just   and we were playing    The Green Door.    You   ve  never heard the song,    Green door, one more drink without knocking        or something. (Laughter) That one record played. That   s all I can  remember anybody ever having. We didn   t have record players. We just  had radios, but I don   t know whose that was. 45-records, you know.  For your dances did you have live music sometimes?  Sometimes we did. For the big dances, yeah. Nearly everyone in our  group would go to the Wesley Foundation. They had vespers every night  of the week and we   d all go to vespers and we   d all go to the Student  Union fourth floor and dance to jukebox.  Was that called the Starlight Terrace then?  Yes. We loved it. It was special.  Could you get food and drinks up there, too?  Yes, cokes. Not much. I can   t remember anything else, but cokes  because we didn   t have any money to buy anything.  When Willard was changed from a dormitory to the College of  Education, do you remember feeling sad or upset about that?  Yes, I do. But it   s okay now. We went back to see it after it was open  again. We went back to see where we had furnished this little alcove in  memory of our friends who had died of breast cancer and it was funny  because, of course, no men were allowed in our dorms and if there was a  man, we opened the door on the floor and we   d holler,    Man on two      So we stepped out of the elevator and Joanie hollered,    Man on two      The girl sitting around the office, she said,    They don   t even know what  we   re talking about.    (Laughter) Same old elevator   slow as Christmas.  But it was good to go back and see. You could feel it.  What about when the name of the university changed?  We didn   t like it. We liked our OAMC songs. Last year at Homecoming  I had two 78-records of OAMC songs and I donated them to the Alumni  Center. I don   t play 78s anymore. And I have a ring that has the OAMC  seal on it and then I have my graduation ring that has Oklahoma State on  it. Pretty special. My girls love them, too.  I think I saw in the year book, it looked like maybe the freshmen had  beanies.  16  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  I don   t remember that. Probably.  Have you been to a lot of the reunions?  All of them.  Do any stand out in particular?  Well the first one was ten years and it was at Quartz Mountain Lodge  and all of our children were little and we have all the black and white  pictures of those. And then in 2002, Virginia and Melvin Semrad have a  lovely log cabin home in South Fork, Colorado and we all went out there  and they had made arrangements for us to stay in some cabins that some  friends of theirs had and we just had a great time. Just all of them really,  through the years. We wouldn   t miss them for nothing. (Laughs)  Are you aware of other groups on campus that have stayed in touch like  your group has?  No, I   m not. In fact, when we say what we   re doing, people say,    I don   t  think I even know one person I graduated with.    We   re unusual.  Why is that?  I think we just had the same values and pretty much the same  background, the Christian values, the farm background and we just felt  really comfortable with each other. You know, there was no threat and  there was never any jealousy or any animosity among any of us. I don   t  remember any of us ever getting mad at anybody. We just had a great  time.  So after you had your children, did you work any longer?  My career? Oh yes, yes. After we left here, we went to a church in  southeastern Oklahoma and then went to seminary at SMU in Dallas and  I taught in a private preschool that a lady in our church had and loved  the four-year-olds. I taught one year of Home Economics and there  wasn   t anything those girls needed to know that I knew. (Laughs) I  mean, they knew everything. So I was kind of disillusioned there and  thought,    Nah, I don   t think so.    But I loved those little kids, so when  we moved back to Oklahoma after he graduated from SMU, I went to  OU and got my elementary certificate for school. So I taught thirty  years, first grade. I taught everything but second and third and loved it.  First and kindergarten are a lot of fun. So school teaching, that   s it.  When you were at OSU, are there any classes or professors that stand  17  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  Neurohr  Pults  out in your memory?  Lara Zola Coe was the Home Economics professor. She was my advisor.  She had a sister, Emma Coe. Two sisters, both in the Home Economics  department. And, gee, names are running together. I haven   t thought  about those people for a long time. (Laughter)  Were you involved in other activities on campus? Sounds like you stayed  pretty busy.  Just the Wesley Foundation.  Do you remember anything about the President of OSU, Willham?  Yeah, Mr. Willham. And then Dean Kamm became president after that. I  just remember the names and they were always held in high esteem.  Were there any other student traditions on campus that stand out in your  memory? Was there a Howdy Walk?  No, we didn   t have a Howdy Walk. We had the Howdy Dance.  When you walked around Theta Pond, were you supposed to speak to  people or anything like that? I heard that.  Never did that.  Okay, that was an earlier tradition, I think.  I think it was earlier or later. I don   t remember that.  Do you have anything else you   d like to share? Anything that comes to  your mind?  I can   t think of anything. Thank you.  Well thank you for the interview. We appreciate your participation.  It   s my pleasure.  -------  -------
