Story_ID: 70452
Speaker 1: I want to ask you to talk about your parents.  I'd like to first ask you about your mother.  Her name is Nancy, right?  I'd like you to give her name and talk about her background.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Her name is Nancy Ann Penn Page.  And she was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.  She was born in an area called the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio].  Her father's name was Walter Montbelieus Staples Penn, the III, I believe.  And he died when she was quite young, I believe of colon cancer--like when she was like three years old, or something.  Her mother's name was Susan Bell Hodge Penn.  And she then thereafter, raised her family--my mother had three sisters and three brothers.  And she was the next to the youngest.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about all, about growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, she talks about growing up some.  Not as much as I'd like her to and we probably should get those stories out of her before it's too late.  But, they--after my grandfather died, they were very poor.  And I think she doesn't--because they really were poor, she doesn't like talking about that that much.  But she does talk about having a pleasant childhood.  They didn't always have enough of everything, but she doesn't sound like it was a downtrodden childhood, because I think they had a lot of love.  Her mother was, I think, revered among them.  I mean, I hear my father--use to hear my father talk about my Grandmother Penn.  And he talked about her with reverence, practically.  She was a--at least in the pictures she looks like a large woman, but one of my mother's stories is that she would get dressed up to go downtown and she'd put on her corset and she'd become a different-shaped woman.  And when I was born, I know that my mother and father lived with my father's parents, but everyday my mother would go from the east side of Columbus, Ohio to the Hilltop on the bus and spend the day with her mother, basically.  So, she was very fond of her.  To my knowledge she did--was not employed in a "outside of the home" type of job.  She may have had some other kinds of work that she did for people, but, not at a place where you would go off to work.
Speaker 1: Did your mother's side--side of the family, did it have a long history in Ohio?  Do you know that going back?
Speaker 2: Well, on her mother's side, my understanding is that her brothers and sisters were also born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.  Their--I can't remember if it's her grandfather--it must have been her grandfather, was connected in some way with the fire department.  And I know that they all lived there.  Her father's family came from somewhere else, I believe.  But there--because there were a lot of them, and because one of her brothers has a lot of children, they were a well-known family on the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio].  Not as I said, a family of means, but I can remember when I was a kid, people would ask me was I related to any number of her brothers.  And they are the side of the family that's big and closely connected.  They're one of those families that think it's a party if you invite all your cousins over no matter what ages they are, and tell them to bring whoever they want.
Story_ID: 70453
Speaker 1: Now, the Hilltop, what is the Hilltop?
Speaker 2: Well, it's actually in Columbus [Ohio].  If you go up the hill that area is call the Hilltop.  And there was an area that--I suppose at the time my mother was a kid it was an integrated area because she was one of the few African Americans graduating in her class from what was West High School [Columbus, Ohio].  And it was across the street--the area was kind of across the street from where there was a big mental health facility.  And it was an older part of town.  And African Americans lived kind of on the east side, south side, some in the north and on the Hilltop.  And there was-- I mean they have reunions.  And people tended to live up there and some of them tended to stay living up there.  Even--I think my mother, at one point, lived on the east side for a short time.  And I know that her mother's sister lived down on what would be--wasn't really the east side, it was kind of near East High School [Columbus, Ohio], there.  But it was an area where people lived on the west side of town.  And it was a hill, which was why it was called the Hilltop.
Speaker 1: Did it have any culture that was reflected out, that I guess that what I'm saying is, what, you know, aside the physical location, was there anything (unclear) living on the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I really don't know that I know the answer to that because I know that there were people that seemed to be--have more means than others that lived there.  So there was, I think, some differences in the amount of money people had who lived up there.  But people would--it was a neighborhood that, if you asked somebody where they were from they would say they were from the Hilltop, and then you would know they would know a certain subset of people.
Story_ID: 70454
Speaker 1: Now, what about your father.  Give his name.
Speaker 2: His name is Richard Arlen Page.  And he also was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.  He was actually born at 791 Taylor Avenue.  Which is the place that I always known my grandparents to have lived.  And which we actually owned until a couple of years ago.  He had two brothers.  I know a lot more about his family.  His father was a postal worker and a minister.  My father started off also as a postal worker and then went on to work for the federal defense agency in our town, where my mother also ended working.  His mother was a homemaker.  Her name was Perina, P-E-R-I-N-A.  She always liked to spell it, so no one got it confused with any other name.  Eliza, which she would be very upset if anyone knew it was anything other than just "E", Payne, and then Page.  And they actually met at the St. Paul AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, where my grandmother was very active and my grandfather became very active and then went on to become a minister, and a presiding elder in the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church.  And his name was Thomas Nelson Page, Senior.  And he's my beloved grandfather.  Both of my--of my four grandparents, my mother's mother died when I was about three years old, and so, my father's grandparents were the grandparents that I really knew.  And I was really, really close to my grandfather.  And my father had two brothers, also born and raised in Columbus, Ohio.  My grandmother had been born and raised there, and her father had been a higher up official in the [Columbus, Ohio] Fire Department's black firefighters employees.  So much so that--and I know this only from oral history, when he passed they--and they drove through town to the burial site, the fire departments came out and were at attention when he rode by, and that kind of thing.  And in Columbus [Ohio], he has one of those--he's buried in a firefighter's section, and the whole thing--at least, that's my oral history of that.  She--her family lived in southern Ohio, near Nelsonville, Ohio, and the property that they owned down there, eventually was purchased by the National Forest Service [U.S. Forest Service].  It's part of a National forest down there.  And part of it, one year my cousins were looking--actually my aunt was looking for the family cemetery.  And my father drove my aunt and my mother and one of his cousins down to look for this cemetery and they couldn't find it, and ultimately they stopped at a farm house and asked some people and told them they were looking for the cemetery.  And they said: "Oh, yes, the Payne Cemetery."  And they were shocked 'cause that's their family's name, and they didn't think anybody really knew about the cemetery.  And they said, "Just go down--the sign's kinda messed up now"-- but there's a sign that was actually a State of Ohio sign saying, "Payne Cemetery" on the road where this little triangular piece of land is where their descendants are buried.  And the story is, and this is a piece of oral history as well, that their great-great-grandfather had this piece of land on which people were buried, or maybe it was even further back than that.  And that he had some people who came from Eastern Europe and who were not welcome in the town cemetery, and that they came to him, and asked could they bury some of their people in that cemetery; and that he said "of course", and that some of those descendants of those people are also buried in that cemetery.  And the people in Nelsonville [Ohio] have a genealogical society, so they've done a lot of work on it, and ultimately the [U.S.] Forest Service put up a small monument there to designate some of my ancestors who were instrumental in the development of that area.  There's actually a place there called "Payne's Crossing."  Which we believe to be a cut-through their land that people just dubbed "Payne's Crossing".  It was not part of the land I don't think that actually was sold to the [U.S.] Forest Service, but it's nearby there.  And so they think it was a pass-through the land where people who were traveling could feel free to walk through to get to the next town.
Story_ID: 70455
Speaker 1: But they have a lot of--some of my cousins have been doing a lot of research on that part of the family.  As a result of having found the cemetery and the forest service being interested in that part of our family's history.  My grandmother was the next to the youngest of her siblings who--all of the sisters stayed in the Ohio area.  Theo was the youngest, then my grandmother, then I believe, Thelma and Dorothea.  And then she had some brothers, one went to California--Paul, and Uncle Kinsel, I believe was in Pennsylvania up around Wilkes-Barre.  And I think there was one other brother--Chelse (ph.), I think it was Chelse.  But on that side of my family, they have kind of the tradition of keeping some of the family names, so that one of our--the grandmothers of the line was named Virgie.  And then my father's generation, there are three women named Virgie.  And there was also an Uncle Kinsel.  And there continues to be a Kinsel.  Which I think is spelled K-I-N-S-E-L.  And there are a couple of "Chelses" (ph.) and I suppose I could take a stab at spelling Chelse, but I'm not really sure.  But it was kind of a tradition that those three names sort of swirled around our family for a number of generations.
Speaker 2: Good.  No sense of who the people were?  Were they farmers?  Were they, were they--I mean any sense about that?
Speaker 1: Actually, I think my cousin who kind of keeps up that part of the history, Beverly Reed, has found some interesting things about them.  They owned this land and to our knowledge, they were farmers.  They did do other kinds of work.  Some of them were in the military.  Which was how she found some records about them.  A couple of the--one or two of the young men that were in the military joined the military somewhere other than Nelsonville [Ohio].  I'm not exactly sure why.  And so there were records in another town.  But they owned that land, and someone lived on it until the generation before my grandmother.  And my grandmother's generation most of them had moved into the cities.  And they sold the land in a time recent enough for me to remember.  So that when I was like a teenager, a young teenager, or a preteen, I remember them talking about whether or not they were going to sell the land to the forest service.
Speaker 2: What--has there been any documentation of your European ancestry, or that part of it?
Speaker 1: I don't think there is any documentation that I'm aware of.  I know that on my mother's side there was an individual who, I believe, is like a great, great grandfather who was a merchant marine type person.  He was a naval--some kind of naval officer.  Not in the United States Navy, but in that part of seafaring where you worked on ships and the like.  I don't know if he was involved in ocean-type seafaring, or whether he was on the Great Lakes, or what.  But I do know they have some old pictures of this gentleman who is obviously in naval attire and who they believe worked on some ships.  That's kind of the extent of what I know on that side about where Caucasians came into my ancestry.
Story_ID: 70456
Speaker 1: Now the other thing I just--one name you mentioned and it was your mother's grandfather, I think, and it was a very interesting name.  (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, Walter Montbelieus Staples Penn.
Speaker 1: Montbelieus?  (unclear)
Speaker 2: Right, M-O-N-T-B-E-L-I-E-U-S, I believe.  There actually--we're on the fifth, I think.  We have a cousin that's--he's third generation down from me.  And he's in his--maybe he's close to thirty now--maybe over thirty now.  And he is the fifth.  A cousin of my generation is the fourth, and then my mother's brother was the third.  And I really don't know the--how that name got started--except that I do know that there is some belief that some of those people came from West Virginia.  Her other brother's name is Thomas Orville Penn, and they also think that those were family names that were brought down in their family and just kept going.  But I honestly don't know the origin of them.
Story_ID: 70457
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, your siblings you have?
Speaker 2: I have a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, sister.  Can you (unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Teri Lynn Page.  And her first name is spelled T-E-R-I, and then Lynn, L-Y-N-N.
Speaker 1: --Older or younger?
Speaker 2: She's younger.
Speaker 1: Okay, she's younger.  Okay.  So you're the oldest?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 70458
Speaker 1: Can you give me your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I can remember myself.  I remember that we lived in the Clifton Apartments in Columbus, Ohio.  And I remember a couple of things about that.  One is that my sister was a baby and she use to cry everyday during the 'Mickey Mouse Club'.  And I remember that we had one of those chenille type couches with the design on it.  And I had a little fuzzy terrycloth robe, and that I didn't have very much hair.  I remember that.  And that they had a swimming pool, and that we were always very interested in learning how to swim.  I remember that.  One of the earliest things that I recall, but I don't actually recall it myself, was that prior to that we lived with my mother's sister and her husband, and they had a son named Darrell.  And Darrell and I managed to pull one of those icebox-type of refrigerators down on ourselves when we were, you know, under four years old.  And how they recused us from being smashed by the icebox.  But those are some of my earliest memories.  Probably my sister wouldn't like that story I told about her too much.  But those are my--probably my earliest childhood memories--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)So--
Story_ID: 70459
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--what was family life like?
Speaker 2: I would say--[HM] Nikki Giovanni has that story about how we were poor, but we didn't know it.  And I think my mother would remind us that we weren't very well off.  But I don't think we ever had the sense that there was anything we wanted, and I don't think we really did.  I think I had a very happy childhood.  As I said, my mother's family was very close and her three sisters especially, and one brother--actually two brothers.  Actually all of us--all of us cousins and there're a whole big group of us--I think we're all very close.  And I remember spending the nights at different cousins' house.  And I remember that a birthday party would be that the set of cousins closest around your age group would come over and they would sing happy birthday, and you'd always have a cake.  But I had a very, very happy childhood.  My parents were very loving.  They were very young.  I always thought they were very cool.  Unlike my children, who think I'm a dinosaur.  But, I thought they were really cool.  I was very, very close to my grandfather.  My--the best thing I remember about him is that he always took me seriously, so that if I came and I had a real question, which I thought was intellectual, even though I may have only been nine years old, he treated it as a real question from a person who wanted a real answer, not just a kid.  And as a result, I became very, very close to him.  And ultimately when I learned to drive, he would take me around with him to his churches and I would drive him home.  I later found out I drove home because I didn't drive fast enough to drive him there.  But we became very, very close, and so I would say, that I had an overall very, very happy childhood.
Speaker 1: What things did you learn from your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned a lot of religious things.  I learned the answers to a lot of my--what I thought, as a child, were pressing religious questions.  I think I learned how to talk to adults.  Because even though I perhaps was too challenging in those settings where I talked to other adults, he never treated me as if I was being challenging, and so I learned a lot about just how to talk to an older person so that you didn't sound like you were always taking them on.  I learned respect for other people.  I--he was kind of funny.  He used to always say, "I have to go take care of my older people."  And I later found out some of those older people were actually younger than he was.  But he had a very strong sense of-"I should care about the people in my community--my neighbors".  I learned that you should be generous.  I think he was extremely generous to all his grandchildren.  I think I learned that it's okay--and I don't think he was--set out to teach this--but it's okay to have someone in your family that you like better than someone else--that you don't necessary treat people equally because you don't have an equal relationship with them.  And just as we all kind of knew that my sister was my grandmother's favorite grandchild.  You know, there's just that kind of petty sibling, cousin thing that--I think everybody probably knew that I had a relationship with my grandfather that not everybody had.  Even though I think he did a very good job of treating us all, in terms of bestowing his gifts on all of us, pretty equally, that, it's not equal if one person wants to have more of a relationship.  And so I had more, I think, of a relationship with him than some of the other grandchildren.  Just because I was interested and because he treated me like someone who had real interest and that--you know, he talked to me like I was a person of--not just a kid.  And so, you know, I learned all kinds of lessons from him--fairness, I think I learned that from my mother and father too.  That, you know, there is--everybody ought to be treated fairly, and be given a chance.  And....
Story_ID: 70460
Speaker 1: Now, did you--tell me what elementary school you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to first--well, I went to the Eastwood Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio] for kindergarten.  And then I transferred to the Eastgate Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio].  And I went there for--through sixth grade.  And it was a--kind of a more middle class area that had some apartments--an apartment project built--newly built, close by.  And I lived in that apartment complex.  But there--it meant there were a mix of kind of more-financially secure families and less-financially secure families, that all went to school together.  Which I think was really a good, a good thing.  And we had a female principal.  And I won't remember her first name, but her last name was Webster.  And she was actually the daughter of one of my grandfather's very, very good friends who was a layman in our church--Ray Davis.  And Ms. Webster--I was frankly always terrified of her because she was--went to my church and she was the principal.  And she always seemed, even though she probably was, pretty stern. And that at that time, I thought that was a pretty big deal, that she was a woman, and she was our principal of our school.  And she was in charge of everybody.  It may not have been unique, but because--well, I guess I kind of thought that was a really a big deal, and because she seemed so stern, that it was something that really captured my attention that she was in charge.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--can you tell me what type of child were you?  Were you the typical older child?  Were you introspective?  Were you active, were you (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think I was probably an outgoing, older child.  I think I was one of those older children, very eager to please their parents.  When I got into trouble it was usually not my own trouble, it was usually somebody else's trouble--or, sticking up for someone who seemed like they were being picked on by other people.  I think that probably I was a smart kid, you know.  I was in the top of my class most of the time, and was rewarded for that.  In school I think that the teachers were trying to keep me busy so I won't disrupt everybody else.  I was the kind of kid who had really good grades, and on the other side of the report card it said, "talks to much; disrupts others."  And I would basically get punished for getting, what we called check marks, as opposed to grades, because my grades were good.  And....
Speaker 1: And did you--do you-okay.
Story_ID: 70461
Speaker 1: Anyway, we were talking about your elementary school [Eastgate Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio]and teacher, but, I want you to take yourself back to your community growing up and I'm wondering if you could tell me what sights, smells, or sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, one sight would be that, as I said, we lived in an apartment project across the street from a neighborhood that was more upscale.  And one of the sights is the house on the corner of Nelson and Maryland [Columbus, Ohio].  A friend of mine, Karen Brown lived there, and Karen's mother, Loretta, was a schoolteacher.  And her father was a city worker.  He collected parking meters.  And then whenever I drive by that site, it immediately reminds me of everybody in my childhood.  Much more so than even seeing my own apartment, because we were very good friends and it was kinda that mix between the kids who lived in the apartments and the kids who lived in the houses.   And while we didn't discern that very much, I think probably in some ways our parents discerned it, and wanted in some ways, to put it aside because it was divisive.  And in some ways it still divided us.  But, I remember that because they took me to the first symphony I ever went to see.  And we took her to her first drive-in movie, where you know, you put on your pajamas and you sit in the car.  Another site would be Alum Creek, which was kind of across from where we lived, but it kind of depicted to me--it kinda divided the--some of the black neighborhoods from more wealthy Bexley [Columbus, Ohio], but it was also a place that had a swinging bridge and we would go there and people would play baseball and tennis and things down in that area.  And you could actually hike over to the bridge and then walk along the creek, which, you know, only happened when your dad was there, and not your mom, 'cause your mom was sure you'd fall in and be swept away.  So those would be kind of some of the sights.  Sounds would be from, from that time would be football.  East High School [Columbus, Ohio] was one of the black high schools and people followed the football games everywhere, so on Friday night my father would drag all of us to the football game and that whole--being outside and that.  You know, in Ohio, football is a really--high school football is a really big thing.  And being in that kind of crowd, with people cheering for one side or the other, and watching the cheerleaders do those wonderful, you know, acrobatics, was kind of a sight thing.  My church would be a sight thing.  It was really important to us.  And all those ladies who demanded that I do things that I really didn't want to do, but I knew I had to do them because otherwise I'd be reported to my parents.  It's kind of a sound thing.  I probably--I will always relate to my church the song 'Love Lifted Me', because one of the ladies there insisted that we always sing it, and I always had to play it on the piano.  And I hated it for many years.  Basically, I think because I knew that if she called on me I had to go up there and, you know, it was kind of like everybody--it's that whole "it takes a village."  But the whole village can like boss you around.  (Laughter).  And I think when you are a kid you don't appreciate that.  But when you're older, you realize how very important that is in how do you develop character and leadership skills and the ability to have confidence because they've said you will have confidence because you will come forward and speak or pray, or play the piano, or whatever.  I will--we had a vacant lot--when we moved from the apartments.  We moved to an area called Shepard, and behind that--well, at the end--we're on a dead end, and there is a train station, not a station, but a switching area there.  And so, at night you could hear the switching people make sounds--talking over the loud speaker and then the train.  And even when we lived in an apartment it was the same connecting train track there.  And so I'll probably always, in the back of my mind, not ever be able to discern that there is a train coming, but that will be a part of what I remember because it was always kind of close to us.  And that vacant kind of lot, that I think belonged to the railroad, was a place where we'd go out and, you know, have a neighborhood baseball game and that kind of thing.  So those would be kind of--and it wasn't always cut.  Sometimes you just had to go (laughter), you know--shin high grass, or knee high grass around us.  So those would be some of the sights and smells.  Another smell would be my mother's family that gets together and thinks it's a party.  One of the things would be that the one aunt--her aunt, would have a chitterling dinner.  She'd invite everybody over.  And your choice was to eat chitterlings or hot dogs.  I mean there wasn't very much--it was not an extensive menu.  And so that would be a smell.  And I would always remember that I would have a hot dog and coleslaw.  And that it was not the deli coleslaw.  It was that coleslaw that's, you know, has a lot of carrots and a lot of celery seed in it.  And it's a little bit more tart.  Those would be some of the sights and smells, I think.
Story_ID: 70462
Speaker 1: Now when did you start taking piano?
Speaker 2: Well, I could read [music], I remember that.  It was probably around second or third grade.  I took music lessons from the Vincent Walters Music Academy.  And Vincent Walters was a very popular music teacher in Columbus, Ohio.  And he taught music in his mother's house.  When you walked in there was that little parlor and he had three uprights [pianos] there.  And then if you walked to the left, she had one of those from the front to the back of the house, living rooms that was probably originally a living room and dining room.  It had more furniture in it than any place I've ever since been to--couches, and chairs.  And he had a grand piano there.  And you came after school, and he took you in the order that you arrived, or in the order that he thought that your parents would pick you up.  And it was basically, you came and it was a little family, I mean all your friends or people who came there from all across the city.  You did your homework with them and talked on the porch, or in the house, and you had your piano lesson.  And, it really wasn't, you know--now my children's piano teacher comes at a certain time for a half hour--it was if you didn't practice, he'd say, "Her lesson's going to last longer 'cause she hasn't practiced, so she has to practice first."  And so, it was kind of a very, very interesting way of teaching children piano.  And also, of having them have a community other than their school.  And then he'd put on recitals with photographs.  You'd have your picture made and it'd be in the Call and Post, which was the black newspaper, and you'd have a recital at the church and then the big kids--the kids who were really talented musicians and older, would have theirs at the piano store, where there was a huge Baldwin [piano], like concert grand piano.  And it was a very interesting experience.  He didn't teach piano until you could read, because he taught kids to read music.  And on Saturdays you'd go and you'd learn theory from Ms. Jacobs.  And it was a great experience.  I just--he was a wonderful person and I think taught kids who really, really were very, very talented--medium talented, like me.  And then some who, you know, they never were going to play anything that resembled a real recital piece, but their parents wanted them to learn about music.
Speaker 1: So you, you played, you said, piano in church?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And the church was St. Paul's [African Methodist Church, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But I didn't play for the big people.  I played for the little Sunday school, because I was not very good at playing the hymns.  We had some other--much more talented organ and piano players in our church.  But they did--I made five dollars a month or something like that for playing for the junior Sunday school, which was like kindergarten through sixth grade.

Speaker 1: Now, you--did you go to your elementary school up until eighth grade?
Speaker 2: ... 'til sixth grade.
Speaker 1: ... 'til sixth grade.  Now, what happened at sixth grade?
Speaker 2: You--then we had the junior high system there.  So you went seventh through ninth at a junior high.
Speaker 1: ... at what junior high...?
Speaker 2: And I went to Eastmoor Junior High [School, Columbus, Ohio] for seventh and eighth grade. Now, when it was time for you to go on to high school, were your thoughts that you would go--you weren't--no, you weren't on the East side.  (unclear)
Speaker 1: (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, no, we lived on the East side [Columbus, Ohio].  (simultaneous)  My mother grew up on the Hilltop [Columbus, Ohio], but we lived on (simultaneous)-- on the East Side.
Speaker 1: So you would have gone to East High [School, Columbus, Ohio], had.-- no?  (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Actually, I--when we lived in there--we moved when I was in sixth grade.  And so I went to Eastgate [Elementary School, Columbus, Ohio], even though I had moved, I finished the school year there.  And those kids would go on to Champion Junior High [School, Columbus, Ohio] and East High School [Columbus, Ohio].  Instead I moved to an area that was--went to Eastmoor Junior and Senior High School [Columbus, Ohio].  And, I would have gone on to Eastmoor High School, which was an integrated high school at the time.  The kids in our neighborhood, which was called Shepard [Columbus, Ohio], were bused.  The kids from Shepard and East Columbus [Ohio], which were African American neighborhoods predominately, were bused over to Eastmoor Junior High [School, Columbus, Ohio], which was in a more affluent white area.
Speaker 1: So, the time that you're going to, to Columbus School for Girls it's, it's, lets see, what, 196--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: 6-
Speaker 1: --6.
Speaker 2: --1966.
Speaker 1: Ok.  And how many other--tell me what you--so, I know you said your, your parents prepared you on everything, you know, for the experience, and it wasn't of your liking.  But, I'm wondering--you talked some about the whole leadership and how you, in hindsight.  But, how was the experience for you going through it?  And, you know, how--were there other black students there?  How large was the school?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a small school.  It was pre-school through twelfth grade when I went there, and still is.  Girls--there were boys in pre-school only.  There weren't even boys in kindergarten, I don't believe at the time.  And I went in ninth grade.  In eighth grade, some teachers at our school--counselors, recommended students take an entrance test for this school as part of learning test taking skills.  And a few of us scored really highly and they wanted to interview us.  I was offered a scholarship, but my father basically said, "You are going there."  And, like I said, they--my parents really did say you're going for education, do not expect that this will be your whole social life.  I don't--well, and, if you come in with that attitude, I think you have a really different attitude about why you are there and what you are doing there.  And I had a neighborhood where I had a lot of friends still, and I had a church where I had a lot of friends.  So I didn't have to rely on school for my friendships.  Although, I do think that I formed pretty strong friendships there with people that I still have contact with today.  I don't think anybody was overtly discriminatory.  In my class, we had one of the largest classes at the time and it ranged from about forty to forty-five students--forty-seven students in my class.  And we were the biggest class in the school at the time.  I was the only African American.  There were two in the grade below me, and there were two, two or three a couple grades below that, and then some in the lower school.  And I think there might have been some effort to have it be more than one in a class, except for the class that I was in.  And, I think that the administration really wanted to begin to integrate the school.  I don't know therefore, if they were protective or not, I didn't have that sense, you know, I was in ninth grade by then.  I probably had, what looking back, I would say was a pretty big ego.  I wasn't a timid person.  And so there were some instances I think, where people were--acted in a discriminatory fashion that I didn't realize that was what was happening because I wasn't tuned in for that.  There were things that we did that were different, like--that's when with--people started having--we would have chapel nearly every day, and one of the kids who had come from my junior high and I--she wanted to bring in a menorah, because there were a lot of Jewish students.  And so she brought in a menorah.  And so then when it came to be Afro, African American History Month, I thought well, we should do something to let people know there are African Americans, you know, on earth.  And, the two kids who were in the class below me, or maybe it was two classes--I think it was just one class, we would congregate and people would ask us questions, I'd say that was kind of when it was-- "black power" was coming in.  I would say, "Oh yeah--if a bunch of, you know, if the three African Americans in the high school get together we were planning a revolt", you know.  But, you know, it was nothing very, very obvious, you know, it was kind of the stuff--like people would go on vacation and come back and say they were as tanned as you were, and not recognizing that they had no clue what that meant.  I think that at the time, I knew much more about their culture than they knew about my culture.  And I think it made me want to know more about my culture; that I wanted to be able to still know about my own poetry and a novelist, and history, and that you had to kind of do that on your own then.  I mean, we're talking '66 [1966] through '70 [1970].  But, like I said, I think it was the perfect place to build leadership skills because, you know--and maybe there's some advantage to being the unique person in that group because then you really can't--you'd standout anyway, so you might as well standout in the best way you can.  And so, I think I had a lot of opportunities to be a leader.  I had some disappointments.  There were some times when there were things I wanted that I didn't get.  And, I wouldn't--I couldn't say with confidence that I didn't get them because I was black, because you could use that as an excuse for everything that you don't get.  But I think that I've been a pretty good alumni in, in terms of being someone who's been successful, and therefore, that's something the school can point to to say, "Here's someone we had that was a success."
Story_ID: 70464
Speaker 1: Now, were there any subjects or teachers that were, you know, an influence to you on--I'm just wondering what was forming you as a person, and how you ended up, actually ended up going to Yale [University, Connecticut]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think there some teachers that formed me and maybe they didn't even know it.  One was a science teacher, Ms. Cherpian (ph.), and I'm not really a scientist, but, she's the one who helped me figure out that I actually needed glasses, which really opened up a whole new world to me.  But, also she wrote textbooks and I thought, "Gee, that's something different."  I just thought teachers taught school and went home and spent their summer having fun, and she spends her summer writing a textbook for a textbook company.  So, it was clear that that something out of the ordinary that I saw.  And she was also, I think, very personable to me.  I mean, some teachers didn't really care that I was there or not, but she was a personable person to me.  Two other teachers--Ms. Smith, who taught philosophy, opened up for us because it was an elective, a lot of different sources of information that were out of the main.  She just allowed us to have a class where we had different things than the strictly, you know, college bound curriculum.  And I think that really helped me to know that there were a lot of other different kinds of things and thought--there were a lot of different kinds of thought out in the world.  We had a teacher whose name (unclear) is going to pass me by.  She taught government and she was revered by all of us, and her name escapes me.  It'll come to me.  But, she had us do a game where we were different countries and it was a diplomacy game.  It might have also been called "Diplomacy."  But you had to pick a partner, and I can recall that she partnered me with someone that I really didn't think I had very much in common to--in common with, and we really didn't.  And part of what both of us learned in that setting, was that you could work with somebody who you won't necessary choose to be your friend, and who you would never pick on your own to be your partner, and because you had a common goal, you could reach your common goal.  And in reaching that common goal, find actually, some commonalities in your experience that you never otherwise would have ever, even been interested in uncovering.  And she later, this young woman, later I asked her--I was president of the senior class--I asked her to do a very big activity.  And some of my other friends were like, "Well, why are you asking her?  She's like--not in our group and...."  I said, "Because I know now that she can get the job done, and that I don't have to like really like everything about her to work with her or to get along with her, or even really to become friends with her."  And she's one of the people that I still, from time to time, have contact with.  And we are really politically, socially, very different.  But in some ways, in that setting, we worked really well together.  And I think that taught me a big lesson about making judgments about people based upon what they seem to be without going any further getting to know them, and, that was really important.  I also learned there, a lesson that probably is not a very assertive, ambitious lesson to learn, which was that there really are enough leadership positions and positions that will get people noticed and the like, to go around.  I mean, we had a whole group of us who were kind of, you know, the leadership core of the class.  There were some other young women who just never had been tapped to do that, and in a couple of instances, a group of us decided those people should lead something.  And I really think that because we didn't say, run for those offices, or attempt to get those various kind of leadership positions, and, I don't want to say we let someone else get it, but encouraged someone else to be active, that that really changed their lives.  They never thought of themselves as leaders until they had to do it.  And so it taught me that sometimes it's important to be a follower, and to be part of the team, as opposed to being in charge.
Story_ID: 70465
Speaker 1: Now, when you--how did Yale [University, Connecticut] come into the picture?
Speaker 2: I think my father really wanted me to go to another girls school--another--a girls college.  And I was like, "I won't be able to do that."  And, I probably would have, in the long run, except that Yale [University, Connecticut] began admitting women, I guess, the year before I--they were going to admit women the year before I came there [1969].  And a recruiter came to our school, and this recruiter told us, in this meeting, that if you couldn't afford to come to Yale [University, Connecticut], that would not be a stumbling block, that they would figure out a way if you were admitted to--for you to get enough scholarships and money to attend.  And I was--back then, I was much more challenging and probably not as diplomatic about being challenging as I am now.  And I was like, "yeah right."  And he said, "No, no really."  And I was like, "Are you telling me that if I'm admitted, my parents can't afford to pay, that you all will see that I have the resources to come?"  And he said, "Yes."  And it was clear that I just, frankly didn't believe that.  And, so, the next year when he came back, when I was a senior, he asked the head master--he said, "You know the young lady that was here last year that was asking me those questions, is she coming to our session?"  And I think my head master who, you know, they want their good students to go to good colleges, said, "She'll be at your session whether she likes it or not."  And I think he was interested that I might still be interested in coming there.  And I thought, "Well, my father wants me to go to a girls school"; which back then meant, you know, Smith [College, Massachusetts], Mount Holyoke [College, Massachusetts], you know, Wellesley [College, Massachusetts].  And if I could go to Yale [University, Connecticut], that would be good enough, you know.  And so, I went home and told my dad and he was actually not that thrilled at first, but he kind of came around.  And so, I was given the opportunity through really the largess of somebody at the school, an alumni, who I still do not know who it was, to go out and visit the college, which was a really good experience.  I mean, I just like set foot, and I was like, "This is got to be the greatest place on earth", right.  Maybe it was just my limited knowledge of colleges, you know, Ohio State [University], Ohio University.  I hadn't really--I didn't really have a broad horizon at that time, but, I met a wonderful group of African Americans students, and I stayed with one of the students from my high school who'd gone there the year before me.  And so I had an overall wonderful experience.  So that's kind of how that happened.
Story_ID: 70466
Speaker 1: So how was it--what--how do you think Yale [University, Connecticut] formed and changed you?  And what was your--also, you didn't go on with--took a major, or anything?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't go in with one.  I got--went in thinking I wanted to be in book publishing or be a college professor.  And, I, you know, was--got really interested in African American studies and I worked in their office, and I became a major there and in psychology.  And it really-- went and interviewed with a book publishing company, but that was when there was a recession, and so the bottom kind of fell out of all the entry positions, and I had to scrounge around and find something to do after I graduated [1974], that's how I ended up going to law school.  But, I think the college--for me there were so many things there that people could do.  I mean, there were so many subjects that I'd never like really paid any attention to--anthropology.  There was a biology course that involved the environment.  I took some history and philosophy.  African American studies at the time, was kind of like American studies.  You took something in every discipline and then related it to your core.  And so that worked out really well for me.  Plus, John Blassingame was the head of the [African American Studies] Department at the time.  And, it was just an exciting time to be in that curriculum.  But, you know, they had anything you wanted to do there, you could do it, and if it wasn't there, you could make it, if you wanted to.  So, kids were like involved in the radio station.  I was really into film.  And you could go see a film almost every night somewhere on campus, and all kinds of film venues, and all kinds of film, foreign film, independent film, first runs, I mean it--we saw a preview of the 'French Connection' there.  And people would come and speak about the films.  It just was--I mean, one time I remember--could I make a choice between taking my anthropology exam and going to a film then, and it worked out that the film was going to be shown again later and I was like, "Boy, if my parents knew that I was making this choice, they would like go bananas."  So it worked out where I could take my exam and then also go and see the film.  But--and there were interesting people.  I'd been in school for four years with, oh, predominately white females, and now I'm in a place where everybody is kind of academically like me, and they're all different.  There are all kinds of people, a good enough number of African Americans that you could have that base.  And then, a couple classmates, the young woman that I'd played "Diplomacy" with was there.  And so, if we wanted to just reminisce about Columbus, Ohio, we had the opportunity to do that.  All kinds of singing and acting, and academic pursuits, magazines that you could work on, there was just the whole gamut.  And so, it was just, like any college, but I'd just never been there, and nobody in my family had really been to college like that until, you know, I had a cousin in college at the time.  He was at Ohio State [University].  But, it was just a different world.  And then I was, you know, like, really close to Boston [Massachusetts], really close to New York, and that was idea, because I was coming from a small town.  I didn't really need to be in New York right then.  But I could get there and have all the benefit of that part of our culture at the same time.
Story_ID: 70467
Speaker 1: Now, was there anything in terms of African American studies that you, you know, took a special interest in, or did you do a honors thesis on a particular subject or--?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody had to do a senior paper and I ultimately did mine on games that young people play because I was also in psychology and I was trying to relate that to child psychology.  But, really, I think I was--that was at a time when people went to college and you were supposed to graduate and be able to go do something.  And I suppose people still do that now.  But what I really liked was, I like literature.  And those were the courses that really captivated me, on both sides.  The regular English literature courses and the African American literature courses, and that was the part of it that I, I really enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Now, so you say you branched--are there--were some people that influenced you there, at all during that time, or that you were friends and still are friends with, or...?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would say that--well, I think John Blassingame influenced everybody in the [African American Studies] Department by setting a really high standard for scholarship, one that I was like, "I'll never reach that."  But I mean it was really a high standard.  If you're going to be a scholar, here's what it takes.  And people should be interested in scholarship.  Bill [William R.] Ferris taught folklore at the time, and he made the oral traditions of people a lot of fun.  In terms of my friends, my college roommate, Caroline Jackson [Smith], she's a professor in the theater department at Oberlin [College, Ohio] now, and started off school teaching and is on maybe, I think the second or third career.  I'm still real good friends with her.  And, we--there were several of us that were in African American Studies together, and she was one of them.  And I would say that, in addition to my parents at that time, that her mother was a Ph.D. and taught at a university and she was kind of a mother to us because they lived out that way, and kind of set the standard, for here's someone involved in a different kind of profession than my parents were.  And had gone to Wellesley [College, Massachusetts] at a time when it was much more of a statement to go to Wellesley [College] than it was even for us to be at Yale [University, Connecticut] at the time, and so was kind of a role model.  And then I had friends--Shirley Merrill (Ph.) worked in the African American Studies department.  She was the administrative assistant there.  And she kind of took us all under her wing and her husband was involved in some group dynamic-type movement and we went to some of those kinds of seminars that lead us--kind of had a feel for people working together and how we think about ourselves.  And how we think about others, and how we interact.  Those were good things that happened to me while I was there.
Story_ID: 70226
Speaker 1: How did, how did you end up going to Columbia Law School [New York], instead of Yale [University Law School, Connecticut]?  Did you try Yale Law School?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't and I kinda wish that I'd tried Yale Law School [Connecticut] because Yale Law School had--was more--there were--you had the opportunity to do papers and do exams.  And that wasn't very prevalent at Columbia [University Law School, New York].  It was mainly just an exam at the end of your class.  But, and this is so, this is just the personal side of life interrupting the academics.  I had met Nick [Hood], who ultimately became my husband.  At--but--and he was going to divinity school.  I didn't want to be stuck in New Haven [Connecticut] if we broke up.  And I kinda wanted to be in New York.  I really wasn't sure I wanted to be in law school at all.  And so, I said, "Well, where am I going to apply?"  And I kinda picked the law schools where I kinda wanted to be.  And so, I picked Columbia [University, New York] because it was in New York, and Georgetown [University], in Washington, D.C.  And then I picked the University of Michigan because it wasn't very far from Ohio and it was pretty highly rated, and I had basically blown the deadline for Harvard [University Law School, Massachusetts].  That's sort of how that happened--kinda of not very pointedly.  Columbia [University Law School, New York] kinda had the reputation for its students getting jobs in New York and Washington [D.C.], and I was hopeful of staying on the East, East coast.
Speaker 1: So you went following him off to the East coast?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I (unclear) may be a better way of saying it was, I had fallen out of love with the Midwest (laughter).  You know it was--I, you know--at that time Columbus [Ohio] was a small town, and as I said, my mother was from the West side, my father was from the East side, and between them they knew, probably--or someone in their family knew all the African American people in town.  And so anything you did was reportable.
Speaker 1: So, now, you're in those formative years, and I'm just wondering when you got to law school were there surprises?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, you know, Yale [University, Connecticut] is a very--at the time I went there, there was a very liberal institution.  You basically could make your own schedule.  You weren't tied to a faculty adviser if you didn't wanna be.  I had written mostly papers, you know, research and writing and the like.  And I went to law school and they ask you to sit in assigned seats.  And I was like; "I don't think I've sat in an assigned seat since elementary school."  And I kinda really fought against that whole--you're in an assigned seat, someone was gonna call on you and ask you very strictly to recite--and what's the purpose of that.  And there is a purpose, and since I hadn't really planned to be there, I hadn't like, done my homework on what the purpose was.  The purposes that--just like in medicine they teach everybody a way of doing things that will be kinda universal, that's what they do in law school too.  They teach you the lingo and they teach you how everyone's going to approach lawsuits and cases, and the use of cases in statutory law.  And, now that I look back on that, I would have been a much better law student if I'd done that research ahead of time and realized that's what we're doing here.  Because in some ways, some of the things that you do there aren't very practical.  I mean, it doesn't teach you how to go and file a lawsuit in court, if that's what you can do--litigate.  It doesn't necessarily teach you how to negotiate a contract, if that's what you're going to do.  It doesn't even really teach you always about advising the client, if that's what you're going to do.  But, it teaches you that everyone in your profession is going to approach things and use statutes and the case law in a certain way.  And, I think I would have fared much better if I'd realized that early on, plus, I wasn't really planning to be a lawyer.  It was kind of "I'm going here because, you know, I don't want to go home.  I haven't found a job, and I have to go to graduate school."  And I'd done so much better on the law student exam than the, you know, the LSAT versus the graduate record exam.  I said, maybe I should try this.  And frankly my friends thought it was a joke.  And they said, "You're going to be out of there in ten minutes."  I mean, they just thought....  One professor, Sylvia Boone, said, "Why are you going to waste your life like this."  (Laughter).  "Why don't you go somewhere like, you know, the school of public policy, somewhere, or something where you're gonna be able to be creative and think."  Because they thought this is gonna be much too rigid.  And, I guess I just didn't really think about the fact that it was gonna be that rigid, and it was.  It was really rigid.  I mean, my college roommate will tell you that she came and said, "Denise, let's go do this and this," and I said, "I have to study."  And she said, "That is so weird that you're going to pass up--can't you make this up?"  And I said, "You don't understand, I have to read this whole book by the end of the semester, every page, know every case."  And, so it was kind of more regimented than what I'd done in the past.
Story_ID: 70227
Speaker 1: Did--were there subjects or professors that you gravitated to, or just some...?  I'm trying to understand what the environment did, you know, what formed you and the fact that you weren't thinking about, you know, this was going to be a life-long thing, it was graduate school of, sort of, in a way?
Speaker 2: There was a class on labor law that I was--that was an elective.  And that professor ran his course by telling you that if you would participate in class and be prepared every day to participate, he would count that towards your grade, if you agreed to do that, and that, if you didn't, he wouldn't call on you in class unless you raised your hand.  But, it would also--it wouldn't count toward your grade.  And I said, "Well, that sounds like a good deal."  And, so, it made it for me more interesting that I knew each day that I have to be prepared in this course.  It was an interesting course subject too, to me.  And even though he was not a professor I would have gravitated toward, I think that what it did was to let me--to set me in a pattern of study that I had not yet perfected.  Which was, ok, "Here's what I have to prepare for the next day, here's where his thinking is going, and to be prepared and ready to respond each day."  I also was lucky enough to have a class with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund, and we got to actually work on some of their cases with a lawyer.  And that was a very, very interesting thing to see how they took on a case for the purpose of protecting people's rights or ensuring their rights.  And also, to make some law that would benefit people later, and that was very interesting.  Jack Greenberg taught the class.  He was a legend in his own right, and then you worked with one of the lawyers on one of their cases, and that was very, very interesting to me.
Speaker 1: So you got pulled in?
Speaker 2: I got pulled in, and, a part of it is (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --it gets to be a challenge partly, I mean you, you know, you kinda look at it and you say, you know--there was a snow storm when I was coming back from Detroit [Michigan] in the car and we were a few days late, and I actually told my classmates I was friends with, that I'd dropped out.  I was like, "No, I'm here, I've already paid my money, I'm going to see it through."  And I think after you've seen through the first year, unless you're really, really not interested in it, you've already made the investment, that's how I looked at it.  I'd made the investment.  I had a job during the school year at the EPA [U.S. Environmental Protection Agency], and that was a little interesting.  It didn't seem like anything I wanted to spend my life doing, but I could see that there was something other than working in a firm.  There was even something other than litigation, if that's what you wanted to do.  I didn't hold any lawyer jobs during the summer, while I was in law school because I really didn't think I was going to get out and be a lawyer.  And it just happened that I was going to end back up in Detroit.  And I said, "Well, I do have my credential, and I should try and get a job in the legal field, because that's where I'm the most qualified.
Story_ID: 70228
Speaker 1: So you were going to end up in Detroit [Michigan] because of you and Nick [Hood]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: So, now, you were talking marriage, at this point, or thinking?
Speaker 2: I actually wasn't thinking marriage 'til maybe six months before.  We were actually were married because--that wasn't exactly in the plan at the time, you know, I thought I would finish all my school before I get married.  And it wasn't working out like that.  And, actually, he started talking about it, and I was--and that's what he was doing, he would just like talk at it.  And my college roommate would say--'cause she had introduced us, she would say, "You guys are engaged, aren't you?"  And I would go, "No, believe me you will be one of the first people to know."  And it ended up we never really got formally engaged.  But, yes, we did, you know, actually we got married before I finished law school.  And so I knew I would be out here.  And that was kind of different.  I hadn't really prepared to--I had thought, well, I'll get back into book publishing afterwards, or some business thing, or some communications area, where I had some interest.  And, when I came out here, I said, "I should take the bar exam and get a job as a lawyer, and then, you know, we'll find something else, 'cause we're only going to be here two years, anyways."  So, at least, that was the plan at first.
Story_ID: 70229
Speaker 1: Until you went to work and, and that was for the City [Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: I went to work for the City [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: And how was that experience?  Cause this is--I mean you're not--you've not lived in a place like Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, Detroit [Michigan] is different.
Speaker 1: And was it [Mayor] Coleman Young? Was it-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: It was the [Mayor] Coleman Young administration.  I had actually worked for the [Detroit, Michigan] city council for Nick [Hood]'s dad [Noah Hood] before we were married for three summers as an intern, and learned a lot about city government, and about politics, which was all very, very interesting--lots of different levels of it.  As well as learning as an aside to that, because I worked with him, all about some of the other things that the church did besides Sunday morning worship; their social action programs, like housing and our center for the mentally handicapped, and, and the like.  But I went to work for the City [Detroit, Michigan], and I had--it was probably a really-- the best thing that could have happened.  I don't think I was really a law firm person.  I was must less smooth at the time, I think.  But, I went to work for the City's [Detroit, Michigan] law department.  And Anna Diggs Taylor was the supervisor of the labor section, where I was hired.  And that was invaluable, I mean, she's a brilliant woman.  And, so I got to learn a lot about writing and research.  And also, about being a woman professional, kinda balancing being a very kind of assertive, aggressive person, with being, you know, still feminine person in your profession.  Not having to take on all the baggage of the male world to be successful.  Because she--I think has down set very, very well, I mean, she's a very--a lovely woman, and very bright, and very well respected.  And she basically saved me from the library, found me an office.  And then I did a lot of interesting labor arbitration work, which they let you go, even though you're a brand new lawyer, to do an arbitration, because it wasn't a big litigation.  But you got to argue, and you got to enter--you know, question witnesses and write briefs, in a less formal setting.  And, that part was good.  I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: And you found that challenging?
Speaker 2: And I found that challenging.  And I changed departments to the water board, where I was more an in-house counsel position and working with people kind of like a corporate lawyer would work, because they were kind of a "money-making end" of the City [Detroit, Michigan].  And it--I made a lot of interesting friends in that department and did a lot of contract work and got to understand that they really treated their lawyers like they were their lawyers.  They didn't just bring you a problem and say, "We messed up, solve it."  They would come and say, "We're thinking of doing this.  How do we get this done?"  And I thought that was great.  It meant that your clients really listened to you.  They valued what they--you said.  It wasn't just litigation, where something has already caused you to be in an adversarial position.  And I had a lot of fun, I mean, the people there are engineers and the like.  Their intrigued that someone would be interested in understanding the plan of this underground pipe to negotiate a deal, and that you really wanted to have them explain it to you.  And that's kind of, you know, part of their joy of their work, having someone that maybe doesn't understand it, to understand it.  So, I had a good experience there--made a lot of good friends.  And, so it--I kinda got sucked into it, it's--because it's really--practicing law is really different than being in law school.  You're not just in a chair, someone's having you recite, you know, sometimes what you think at the time, are obtuse, legal positions, cases, and the like, that you think will never relate to your everyday life.  Well, when you begin to practice law, you see how that kinda plays out.

Speaker 1: Now, the other thing I want to know, your husband [Nick Hood], when he moved here, was he placed with the church, was he assigned a church at that time?
Speaker 2: No, because in his denomination you're not assigned.  The denomination--the individual churches freely agree to be part of the larger church.  And they hire their own ministers.  And so, they can hire a person for life, you know.  We've been talking about how we're in the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] Church, but this was the United Church of Christ.  It was a Congressional Church.  And so what happens, is the congregation hires their own minister.  There are some requirements, like you need to be ordained in their denomination, or at least you did at the time.  And, his father [Noah Hood] had had two associates, and one had gone on sabbatical, and one had decided he was going to go take a church, and he said, "Come and work for me for a couple years, if you don't mind.  I need some help, you can just come here."  And, my husband decided, "I'm gonna go do that, help my dad out for a couple years."  And that's how we ended up back here.
Speaker 1: So your, your father, your father-in-law was--is what?  Oh, 'cause you said you worked in the city council I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, he had two jobs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --He was (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --He [Nick Hood] was a minister in the United Church of Christ.  He'd started off in AME [African Methodist Episcopal], and when he went to divinity school, changed over to the Congregational Church and they became the United Church of Christ.  And, so he had a church here in town and was very--it was a socially active church when he, when he came.  And it became even more socially active during his tenure.  And as part of that, he ran for city council from his church, but he kept his position as senior minister.  And, he had had several associates work for him.  And then, he invited my husband to come and work as an associate.  And then, one thing led to another, so to speak.  My husband has an interesting take on that part of the story.  He says what happened was, we came--we were going to be here for two years.  And then what happened actually was, after we'd been here about six years I got the opportunity to run for judge.  And that kind of, you know, caused us to be rooted here, more than we expected.
Story_ID: 70231
Speaker 1: Well that's what--I want to know--so you're at the corporation counsel, you're enjoying it, you're learning the city [Detroit, Michigan], you know, you're working on interesting things, you know, it's--a junior lawyer you're handling things.  But, then you were elected to the district court bench.  And I'm wondering why you sought election.  I mean, how did--were you involved, then at that point, with NOW.  I mean, what are the--I'm just trying to understand what's forming you.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I--when I went to work with the City, a woman who worked there was involved in--her name is Josephine Powell, a very good friend of mine, was involved in the woman's movement and she got me in NOW [National Organization of Women].  Part of what we did in forming our political action committee was to interview candidates for all kinds of positions, and make recommendations about them; and produce a slate.  And we happen to be interviewing one time, a person running for judge who did not have very much experience--a woman.  And after we finished interviewing her, the group of us who'd been doing that, one of them said, "Denise, you should run for judge, the next Sunday, 'cause you have more experience than this person, and more knowledge about how this court is gonna work."  And I was like, "Yeah right."  So, I went home from this meeting and told my husband.  And he said, "That's a great idea."  And I was like, "Oh, he's just one of my biggest fans, right."  And then I told his father, who'd been in politics by then, for many years.  And he said, "Well, yeah, but if you're gonna do that, we need to get started."  And I was like, "They're all taking this seriously," and I thought it was just, like, an off-the-cuff comment from someone who really was kind of a little bit frustrated that someone with really not a lot of experience at all, was going to run and be elected judge, even though that person turned out to be a very, very well-thought-of judge in our community; very bright, did a lot of good work, and the like.  And so, this was a court--the court--the [Detroit, Michigan] 36th District Court, they were--it was new.  And they were adding judges to it every other year--a group of judges.  And so the year--the next year that judges were going to run, my husband and father-in-law, we'd been involved in, you know, the NAACP [National Advancement for the Advancement of Colored People], Young Adults [Committee], and I'd been involved in NOW [National Organization of Women].  I'd worked on my father-in-law's campaigns.  My husband had run for Congress.  And so, we were kind of in that political kind of young persons arena.  And so, they asked me, "What are you gonna to do, what are you gonna do?" because people who'd lost the election before, were going to run again, because there were going to be, like eight open seats.  But I was pregnant, and I said, "We have to see if the baby's okay."  And my father-in-law's going, "We can't wait 'til then."  I said, "No, because if anything's wrong, we need to adjust what we're going to do."  But it turned out that I had a wonderfully healthy son, and so, I said, "Okay, I'm going to run."  Well, this was in April [1993], the election's like in August.  And they're like, "This is a real short time."  But we worked really hard.  And that's kind of how I got interested.  It's the low--it was the lowest, and is the lowest level of trial court in our state.  And they do city ordinance violations, things I was familiar with.  They do smaller lawsuits, civil law.  They do preliminary ex--preliminary exams for criminal cases, and traffic.  And so this is a good place for somebody to start off.  I'd been practicing about five years.  And there were a lot of younger people running in this race, who I think, intended to make judging a career.  And, and there had been the--the time before as well.  And some of those people have made judging a career.  I mean, they were thirty years old, or thirty-two, or thirty-five when they first became a judge and that's what they're going to do.  And, you know, there are some systems where that you choose a track to begin with.  In Japan you choose, "I'm gonna to practice law or, I'm gonna go on the judge track."  And in a way, it's kind of a good idea, I think, for a judges--people to become judges early on because then, they really work hard at--maybe not more than older people, but they work hard at perfecting the art of judging, and what they think about what their role is in being a judge.  And, I don't mean that when you're older and come to the profession you won't do that.  I think you just have a different perspective.  When you're younger, you come and say, "This is going to be my career and how am I going to work in that venue."  When you're older you know it's not gonna be, you know, your whole career.  You have a whole career behind you.
Story_ID: 70232
Speaker 1: Now, when you campaigned, were there surprises to that, or, did--was it, you know, you, your--was your father-in-law very--you know, helpful because he had been in the pol--political thing?  Were you (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, there were surprises too.  He was very, very helpful.  Probably the best piece of advice came from my husband.  He said, "Now, you can't run, if you can't stand to lose."  He said, "Because if you did lose, you know, the next day you still have to go to work.  And the next Sunday, you still have to go to church.  So, if you're gonna like, die because you lost, you can't do this."  Which I think is really true.  The other thing is, I think you have to approach it, that--I always approached it that it wasn't my judgeship.  You know, I was elected to this judgeship, and I'm elected for X number of years, and for that period of time, it's my job.  At the end of that, I have to run again, it doesn't belong to me.  It belongs to the public.  Anybody can challenge me, or challenge the whole group that I'm in.  And I have to put forth as much effort as I did the first time, in order to retain my position, because it isn't mine.  It's really an open position each time, even though I'm a--an incumbent.  But, there were surprises, you know, in our area it's really important and was important then to have union support, to have newspaper support, to have community support to get your name out.  And, you know, I didn't get the union support that I wanted to get.  And I didn't get all of the congressional district support I wanted to get.  Some of the people in those groups helped me anyway, because they thought I had good ideas and they liked me, or they liked my father-in-law, or my husband, because all of that goes into it.  And many of us vote, not just for the candidate, because we think they're wonderful, very often for judges, we vote for them because other people say they do a good job where they work, they'll bring new ideas, that kinda thing.  It's a--very much also a word of mouth thing.  And so there were surprises.  You know, some of the surprises when someone that you don't think is as qualified as you are, gets the support of a group that you think would support you, and so that's kind of a surprise.  It was a surprise for me that even though I didn't get some of that support, that I got some (unclear) newspaper endorsement, which was really good and very, very helpful to me.  You get surprise in this because you find out all your friends aren't political.  And, even when I was a little girl, back in Columbus [Ohio], a friend of our--one of my elementary classmates--a kindergarten chum's father was a city attorney and I'd gone to stuff envelopes when I was, you know, like in grammar school, or junior high for his campaign.  So, it wasn't--that wasn't foreign to me.  But, you find out that some of your friends really aren't political and they aren't gonna be the ones that you think are gonna work for you.  And what you find is somebody who really doesn't know you at all comes in and they're so helpful.  I mean, they're like--and they don't want anything.  They just, I think, want the joy that they get, or the satisfaction from--that they get from working for a candidate that they think has, has good ideas, and also participating in the democratic process.  And I don't think we really think about that all that much, all the time.  But it really is important for people to have that opportunity, and to take advantage of it, if they want to.  And what you find out is not everybody wants to.  And you have to, I think, learn that those people who're your friends, but aren't political, they're still gonna be your friends, and they're gonna go out and vote for you, and tell your--tell their friends to vote for you, but they may not go work for you.  And perfect strangers--it's the most humbling thing, to know that, you know, perfect strangers are doing it for free.
Speaker 1: Now, did you get bored in the time that you sat--you sat for six years?
Speaker 2: Did I get bored?  No, even though I did traffic for, for a, (laughter) for a really long period of time.  No, and I think it's because that court, more than any court I've been on--every single day you see people, you know, hundreds of them.  And, you know, when you're on your fiftieth traffic ticket, it would seem like you would say, "Oh gosh, this is another traffic ticket", but that person's only going to come to court maybe in their life, for that traffic ticket, or maybe another one.  You might be the only judge they actually have contact with.  And so you are always--at least I was always thinking what they think about the judiciary is going to be their contact with me.  And, if you're a person who's only gonna come to court on a traffic ticket, or you know, a rent violation, or small claim, that should be as good an experience as if you came to court on a big patent case.  And I think I did a very good job of that.  That doesn't sound very humble, but I--each day I try to make people who felt--who came into my courtroom, feel like their case was an important--as important as the one I heard at eight o'clock, even if they were at three-thrity.
Story_ID: 70233
Speaker 1: But, this whole thing where you were appointed to fill this vacancy in the Recorders Court (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --court?  Was it the Recorders Court?
Speaker 2: It was record--called the Recorders Court at the time.
Speaker 1: So was that where people placed--they record, that's (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --What is the Recorders (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: The Recorders Court had its name because there was a recorder of the court.  It was a special criminal court for the City of Detroit [Michigan]--for felonies only.  And, it is now a part of the Wayne County [Michigan] Circuit Court.  Everywhere else in the state, there are circuit courts, but there was, for a time, this recorders court.  They just did felonies in the City of Detroit [Michigan], but when I came, they also did felonies in all of Wayne County [Michigan], because it was probably the most efficient court in the country at the time.  It had a very good program for having the cases flow through the court in a timely fashion, and for people to get justice pretty quickly.
Speaker 1: And, that, what did--now you're practicing at that point, you're overseeing a different type.  You're doing--you then moving from civil to criminal, right?
Speaker 2: Well, in the, in the 36th District Court [Detroit, Michigan], we did preliminary exams on criminal cases and we did misdemeanors.  But you're right, I was really looking to go to the Wayne County [Michigan] Circuit Court, where they did civil and criminal, because I'd practiced civil law.  And, we had some people that went off the bench, and there were some appointments available, and I had my name in for appointment to the circuit court.  And, the governor [James Blanchard]'s office called me and asked would I be willing to take a position in the Recorders Court.  And, even though I knew the government--the governor, and felt like he knew me, I didn't feel like I could say, "No, that's not the job I want, I really want a circuit court position, no."  I felt like there was a reason for asking me to go to Recorders Court, and that I should do that, and so I went there.  I told a person in the governor's office, who called me, "You know, I'm really looking to go to circuit court."  He said, "Yes, yes, I know that, but will you go to Recorders?" and I said, "Sure, I'd be happy to go to Recorders Court", still with the thinking that my goal was really to go to circuit court.  But, Recorders Court was a really unique place.  At that time it was really just so efficient.  They had a wonderful chief judge named Dalton Robertson, who was on top on what his judges were doing.  And, I hadn't practiced criminal law, but criminal lawyers are different than civil lawyers.  First of all, both sides are--have a different relationship.  The prosecutor's office and the defense part know that they have to work together.  That everyday they're going to see the same lawyers over and over, and you can't really burn down any bridge, because it might not ever be rebuilt.  I think they also knew that that's the place in our system where every day people's constitutional rights come into play.  You know, I can do ten civil cases and we would never talk about the constitution.  But in every single criminal case, at some point, there might be a constitutional issue that you have to address, or, that you each, at least, want to know was addressed.  Even if it's nothing more than, "does the person understand they have a right to a trial by a jury of their peers", and they have a right to waive that if they want.  Even if that's the only issue, it is nonetheless those protections that each day come up.  And also, that--I think they know we're doing serious stuff here.  At the end of this case, somebody might go to jail, and that means that their freedom would be taken away.  Which is, you know--we don't think about every day when we get up and brush our teeth and go about our business, but--unless you're a judge or a lawyer--but, in fact, that's one of our most precious things, and we know we don't want to take away anybody's freedom unless it's really the thing that should happen.  And, yes, mistakes get made.  But basically, in that court, I learned that....
Story_ID: 70234
Speaker 1: --'Cause that was a fundraiser for a particular congressperson.  Yeah, that would be something that was beyond the edge of it being governmental versus political.  And that's kinda, I think the dividing line for people in the federal system.
Speaker 2: So now, you were--you went from the Recorders Court.  Did it still exist, or did it --(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: --or did it finally--and then you went to Wayne [Michigan], to the circuit court (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Right-
Speaker 2: --system.
Speaker 1: --I was in the Recorders Court, and I ran again to--for a new--for a full term, there.  And then some opportunities opened up countywide.  I told you earlier that Lucille Watts was one of the first woman elected count--black women elected countywide, because the county, you know, the [Detroit, Michigan] 36th District and Recorders are only elected by people in the city.  The county is a different demographic group, it's much more white.  You do need to win the city, if you can.  But, you have--there are different kinds of people in the county.  It's not just an urban area.  And so, there was an opportunity for me to run because there was not--there was a vacancy that had three seats in it.  There were gonna be three people elected, as opposed to just one, and I looked at it.  My youngest brother-in-law is an information guy.  And he pulled together some information for me on the women who had run countywide and where their vote was, and that kinda thing.  And we determined that I might not come in first in that election, as I had in the others, but--or second, versus second in the others, but, I maybe could get one of those top three seats.  At least I could get in the top six that would be elected in the primary, and then we could figure out what we'd do from there.  And, that was--an infinitely, a lot more work than running citywide, because in the city [Detroit, Michigan], I knew lots of people.  I go to a big church.  My husband's a pastor.  You know, I was in a women's-minister's wives group, and so I knew that base.  I knew the women's movement people.  I knew people that were in democratic politics.  But, now we're in the county and it's just a different animal, and it's bigger.  And so, for a whole summer I did nothing but run for office.  And, you know, I don't think I went to the beach one time, the whole summer.  And it takes up a lot of time and hard work, but you know, you have to be willing to do that.  And I was in a safe seat, which meant I could keep my Recorders Court seat while I ran for the [Wayne County, Michigan] Circuit Court.  So, I wasn't going to be out of a job, or out of my position.  I would still be able to be in Recorders Court if I didn't win the election.
Story_ID: 70235
Speaker 1: Now, was there--I want to know how you winded up--you name started, you know, emerging 'cause some people get--they get in a position, like in the Circuit Court system, and that's where they're going to exist.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.  (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --Not sure I understand exactly your question.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean they're gonna--they're, they're not moving--their names would never emerge (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to be considered for a Federal District (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Court position.  Maybe that's (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Okay.  You know, there are a lot of factors in--and there--I'm always grateful that I was even ever looked at because there are so few of these opportunities.  And there are, you know, we in our community it'd been--it had been like twelve years since there had been any minority appointed in the Federal system.  And, you know, there--in twelve years some people get to that point where they're no longer a viable candidate.  But I think--here would be what I think happened.  One was that--there are a lot of factors.  Some of them are merit and some of them are political.  One of the political ones is that we had two senators--and Senator Don Riegle and Senator Carl Levin.  And Senator Carl Levin and my father-in-law [Noah Hood] had been on the city council together.  And that's the political part of it.  I mean, I knew one of the senators that was going to be involved in this selection process.  And my father-in-law knew him well--had worked with him, and had been supportive of him.  So that's a political part of it.  What I think of is the merit part is, I would like to think that in 36th [District Court], in the Recorders Court, I had done a very good job, and that I was beginning to do a good job in the Circuit Court.  In 36th District Court I'd been involved with a project to reduce the case load and get rid of old, old cases called the--it was a case acceleration part program with another judge--Judge Pamela Harwood.  And what we'd done is, we'd gone through all the cases in the court and everything that should have closed because it was settled, or people had abandoned the cases--we closed those so that (unclear), they didn't keep showing up on the docket.  And then we expedited all the old cases in a lot of different ways.  For instance, if they were all collection cases, we just had a program where I said, "We should set ten cases for trial on Friday afternoon."  And my colleague said, "You're crazy."  And I said, "No."  I said, "Look, five of the cases are gonna settle, three are gonna show up, and maybe we're gonna have to try two of them and we'll have to two or three that get defaulted or dismissed.  And then we took the rest of the cases that were more difficult cases and worked them up so that they were ready to be tried and that they didn't get adjourned.  And so we kinda made the docket--compacted the docket and brought it up-to-date.  And the two of us worked on this project.  And so, people kind of knew that project was going on.  It got a little bit of attention in the legal community.
Story_ID: 70236
Speaker 1: And then I was also involved in a lot of bar activities, both the Wolverine Bar and the Detroit Bar.  I was president of the Detroit Bar the year that I got considered for a federal appointment.  And so, I knew a lot of lawyers and hopefully, they knew and approved of my work.  And then, you know, there was a citizen merit selection committee.  And that's one of those instances where you also don't know whose helping you.  In fact, later on I learned that there were some people that were on the other side of the state or, toward the middle of the end of our state, who were supporting me being considered for this Federal judgeship that, I don't really even know them that well, but they'd heard about me from other people--people in my church or other places, and that was favorable.  And so, I have to tell you that I put--my father-in-law encouraged me to put my name in.  I said, "I just got this position, elected.  My election made an appointment for the Republican governor [John Engler].  And I, I'm happy--I'm at the Circuit Court, that's where I want to be."  And he--he said, "You never would think of going to the Federal Bench?"  And I said, "Yeah, but the chances of it are so slim."  And he said, "Well, no one will even know you're interested unless you apply."  And so, I figured of all the people connected, that I'm not the most connected.  I'm maybe not even the smartest one of them.  But I filled out the application and put it in, and I actually was in trial during the interviews, but I think I had a pretty good interview.  And then they came up with a group names, and I frankly was astounded I was in the group.  But when you start to look at the group, you see they're gonna pick people--three people from ten names, and that, you know, depending on what the thinking of is of the senators, they want to do certain things with the Bench.  And that everybody's chance is really good of being selected.  And it was, you know, I talked to one of our magistrate judges here who was in the same group, and I talked to him and I--he said, "You know, I'm just like, honored to just be in the group."  And I thought about it, and I said, "So am I."  Just being in the group of ten, you know, just, is an achievement in its self.  But there are so many factors that you don't know what they are.  I mean, like one of the factors I'm sure, was that there was some interest in our senators who are liberals to have some African American presence in the Bench again, because there hadn't--there were gonna be people who were gonna be retirement age soon.  And so that's a factor.  And that's favorable to me.  You know, they also want to have some people that are women.  And those kinds of things, I think, worked in my benefit.  It's not--I would like to be able to, you know, everyone likes to say it's all on merit.  But, you know, I don't, I don't think they don't pick people--that they pick people who don't have merit.  They wouldn't pick anyone unqualified.  But in the scheme of qualified people, there are a lot of qualified people.  And so some other factors enter into it.  That's maybe being too honest about it, but I would be the first to say that I probably didn't get anywhere--that I'd been able to be of influence or successful because I just did it on my own.  In every single instance where I've been able to do something, somebody else has helped me.  Often, most often, people I knew--but lots of times people I didn't even know very well.  And, that maybe a merit part of it, that people look at you and say that that's a good person.  I think they have the right temperament.  I think they're concerned about people.  I think they'll work hard.  They know the law.  All that works together.  But there are those other things that, you know, that aren't necessarily that you're so good, or the smartest, or you know, you have to in, in the final analysis, be a little humble about it.  There are lots of people who could come here and do as good a job as I'm doing.
Story_ID: 70237
Speaker 1: Now, the other thing is--was you know, because you were a part, you were a [President William J.] Clinton, Clinton appointee.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was your appointment held up?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I was early on in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --I was pretty early.
Speaker 1: --that's pretty good then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: 'Cause (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: --I wasn't just sitting waiting and nothing happening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you remember the day of your, you know, of your swearing in?  And, you know, who was there?  And sort of the feeling (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --I mean I don't remember everybody.  But, I do remember the day very well.
Speaker 1: And, and how did you feel, because this is a big, I mean, this is, this is--I'm talking about (unclear) '77 [1977] to '94 [1994].  That's twenty (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --almost twenty years.  But, how--and you were the first elected in twelve years--first (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, the last African Americans had been Anna Diggs Taylor and Julian Cook, back in Carter--from President [James] Carter.
Speaker 1: Did they have any advice or counsel for you?
Speaker 2: They are always open to having you come in and talk to them and getting advice.  They were very supportive during the process.  There isn't one thing I would draw in particular.  I think that Judge [Anna Diggs] Taylor and I had a conversation where it was very clear that her position was, "You're qualified to be here."  And, and the inference from that is, "Don't let anybody tell you that you're not, you know, as good as the next person that's here."
Speaker 1: So how have you found it since, since, you know, since you've been sitting now for eight years, right?  Yeah, (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Almost eight years.
Speaker 1: Almost eight years.  And how've you found it because it is, you know, from Circuit Court to the Federal District is different.  (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --You have to learn--I mean you really are a judge in the--not that you weren't a judge before, but, (laughter).
Speaker 2: It is different.  One of the things is that it's much more formal.  Even from the day of my swearing in I could see that.  The day I was sworn in, you know, this is like a great moment in the history of my family.  So, a big group of my family came and, you know, all my church members, I mean I go to a church with over a thousand people in it.  They all want to come and you know, see their minister's wife made federal judge.  And even from there you begin to see some of the difference.  One is that it's much more formal.  The other thing is that people really do listen to you in a, in a different kind of way.  Like, I went into the room the first day when I was being sworn in and said, "I really need to--there to be more chairs here in the front because where my family's gonna sit there gonna be about--there gonna be more of them.  And, I was just kind of musing on that I needed more chairs.  And basically the people who work in the Court said, "We need to bring--someone bring more chairs up", and they just brought more chairs up.  As oppose to in State Court, you really have to work to get the resources that you want.  In Federal Court there are resources because they expect you to do your job in a certain way and there're just a lot more resources to get that done.  And, it's a separate arm of government and so it's less political in some ways.  So that was one of the first things.
Story_ID: 70238
Speaker 1: The other is that it is more formal.  For instance, in State Court, where, you know, the judges are involved in appointing people to represent indigent defendants, there is just a lot more contact with the lawyers that come through your court--informal contact, and not about cases, but just they're there.  It's also busier.  State Court you always have traffic going on.  You always have landlord-tenant.  You always have a lot of criminal defendants.  You have divorce when you're in the Circuit Court.  And so, there-it's just more people intensive.  And there're different things, like for instance, and this is local culture, I'm sure.  But in our local state courts in our county, when you come in to bring a paper, you bring it directly into the courtroom and give it to the Court in the courtroom.  It doesn't matter if there's a jury trial going on, or the like.  That's sort of the process that happens.  And so there's lot of coming and going even in the courtroom.  Here no one ever walks in the courtroom, and if they do, you know they've never been to Federal Court, because they would know to go around to the door to the chambers to conduct business while courts in session.  In this district we have far fewer criminal cases than I was used to having, and they're different.  I mean, there's a big difference from when you're trying every single day, murder, rape, armed robbery, drugs, guns, than when you're trying mail fraud, embezzlement, some bigger drug cases, conspiracies, that kind of thing.  It's just a little bit different.  A different kind of magnitude, I suppose.  Like, I never have done any, since I've been here, murder cases.  But, when I was in State Court, I did them all the time.  And, so you have a different concept of what it means to do a criminal case.  I mean I, did drug cases and yes, I do important drug cases, but--and people will serve long prison terms on them if they're convicted.  But it's not like where you have a person who has murdered someone and that person's family is there with them because they know they might be found guilty.  And also the victim's family's there on the other side, hoping that someone will be found guilty.  Those are kind of different mindsets that I think a judge has when they approach the work.  Not that you take the work any less seriously, but just that you know--I always know there're some other worse crimes out here that have been committed.  On the civil side, there is very often much more interesting work to do.  I mean you get patent cases, which are very, very interesting.  Some judges, I suppose, find them kind of boring sometimes.  But they are a different area of the law.  You get different kinds of constitutional claims, you know, everything from First Amendment claims involving textbooks to the right for a union to have their signs or inflatable symbols at a, at a work site, those kinds of claims.  Two, you know, a diversity case that is basically a slip and fall case that otherwise would be in State Court.  So there are some differences.  And, then there is collegial difference.  In State Court there are lots more judges.  So there's a bigger, a wider net of people that you could be colleagues with--close colleagues.  On my bench, there are fifteen, twenty people who you know you are going to work with probably the rest of your life.  And so, while you know that you may not agree on many things, it's kinda like the prosecutors and the defense counsel--even though we disagree, we have to be able to come back and work another day.  And so you have a different, I think, colleague base, as well.
Story_ID: 70239
Speaker 1: Now, you joined a court that had Judge [HM] Damon Keith on it.  And who--was that--is it the two--how many blacks?
Speaker 2: There's Judge Anna Diggs Taylor and Judge Julian Cook and [HM] Judge [Damon] Keith is on our Court of Appeals. (Simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Oh that's right (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --And he was on our Court of Appeals-
Speaker 1: That's right (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --when I came.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, that's right.
Speaker 2: Um=hum.
Speaker 1: That's fine, that's fine.  So, now are there any cases that you, or a case that stands out in your mind that either was a difficult case for you, you know, you struggled with, or that you're particularly proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I--that's one of the questions I thought might come up.  But, I think probably the most important case that I've come--that's come to my court, in which I can't talk in depth about because it's still pending, is the--that I've been the appellate judge on the Dow Corning bankruptcy.  Which has involved the (unclear) plants all over the world, and that I'll be the judge who is the judge that will oversee the settlement facility if the bankruptcy plan is approved.  And so, in the long run, I think that will have been my most important case, because it will have been the longest, and up to this point it will have been the biggest.  But there are so many cases, I think, that come to Federal Court that are really, really important.  They may not make history, but they are important to the litigants.  Or they're important to something that happens in our communities.  Some of them are cases that are civil cases that are business entities where you, you work something out.  You are able to settle the case and by doing that, you save the companies and citizens hundreds of thousands of dollars because something's been worked out so that they aren't in protracted litigation.  And then, you know, we hear prisoners' civil rights cases.  And while that may not impact but a very small segment of our community, it impacts those who are incarcerated and so, while they may not be cases of notoriety, they're cases, I think, sometimes where some right is secured for someone who's in prison.  Or, a decision is made that that is not a right that's secured to you while you're in prison.  And so it has, I think, a trickle down impact on everybody who's incarcerated, at least in the federal system and maybe in the prison community at large.
Story_ID: 70240
Speaker 1: Now, are you a good judge?  Or what do you, what do you, what do you think a good judge does?
Speaker 2: I think I'm a good judge.  I think a good judge is someone who does a couple things.  One is they take their work seriously; they pay attention to their cases; they're thoughtful and fair.  I had a case not long ago over, both sides--felt like--articulated that they didn't think they had a fair trial and I know that when someone says that--when both sides say that, it probably means it was fair.  But, each time--anytime that someone says that, it just kinda like grabs me, you know, right in the little pit of your stomach, or, you know, where you get heartburn because I say, really what I want is for people to feel like they came in and they were treated fairly.  And maybe there's a difference between whether or not you think you got a fair trial, meaning the verdict was in your favor or not, and whether or not you were treated with fairness and dignity.  And of course, you want the judge to know the law and to apply it appropriately, and I think I do that.  Judges aren't without error.  That's why there's the Court of Appeals.  And, sometimes I think judges do make mistakes.  I mean, you come out in court and everybody is there, and it really is not like television where you can take commercial break and keep going.  Sometimes judges really do make a decision as you're going along, and some days you look at that, usually when the Court of Appeals sends it back to you, and say, "Yes, that was an error, I should have caught it right then."  Hopefully, you don't make any that impact people negatively.  And very often the Court of Appeals can usually cure it if you do do something that might have a negative impact.  But, I think being a good judge means that you're diligent; that you take your job seriously, that you treat people with fairness and respect.  And that you do something to uphold the profession, meaning that, you know, you're appointed, people say, for life.  But, one of our judges reminds us that it's for the period of our good behavior.  But basically, as long as you're behaving and you've behaved, so far, to get here, you can keep staying a judge.  And I think, part of what you have to do is know that it's not enough for me to come into court and do my job each day.  Part of what I'm required to do, is to make the fact that there is a judicial system come alive for people outside of court, to let them know that there is a court and how privileged we are in America that you can come into court, and that you can have a jury trial.  My sister and I were overseas and we were in a courthouse, and she said, "Where's the jury box?"  And I'm like, "There aren't any jury trials in this country."  And she was like, "The judge decides!"  And I said, "Don't say it like that, that's not all bad."  But the truth of the matter is it is very different to have the opportunity to decide that, "I do not want this judge to try my case.  I want a jury of my peers."  You know, twelve people if I have a criminal case, or you know, six or eight or ten if I have a civil trial to listen to my case and to make a decision.  And, I think judges are compelled to go out and let people--bring that alive for people, either young people, or older people, as the setting might be.  And to also, because we have the privilege of serving our government, to use some of our time for community service, not our time that we should be spending in court, but that time that we have of our own to let people know that judges are just people too, and that they are required to make a contribution, other than their work.
Story_ID: 70241
Speaker 1: Have you been involved at all, in the issue of judicial reform?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure in what way (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Do you have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --you mean that.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you--do you have any thoughts about how the judicial system should be reformed, if at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I know there are some arguments about certain aspects of it.  For instance, because I'm now an appointed person, I get often the question about is an appointment better than an election?  And, you know, the states vary on how that--they do that in the state level.  And, our thinking is that if you're appointed you're more free to make decision.  I have never found that to be true.  I feel just as free now, as I felt when I was in 36th District Court.  And maybe that comes from thinking it's not my job.  It's really a job I hold in the public trust.  And so, since it's not mine, I have to be free to do what I think the law requires and what's right, in the context thereof.  But, I guess my view is, on that point, probably you get as many good judges elected as you do appointed, and vice versa--that, even in the appointment process, you get some people who are not as good as others.  And that--but for being appointed for the period of your good behavior, you might not get re-elected.  But there is I think, in our argument that sometimes the public elects people that they didn't really mean to elect.  So, that's kind of one of the areas where I think there is some question about judicial reform.  I think one of the other areas, has to do with--and maybe this isn't technically in judicial reform, but it has to do with the legislature making laws that in and of themselves, curtail the ability of the judiciary to do its job--cutting back more and more on discretion and the like.  And I think that's probably a pendulum.  I don't know if we're out as far as it will swing or not, but I think it must swing back, I mean, I don't think you can, by statute, legislate everything so that judges will have no power.  And we see that, I think, in the federal system in the sentencing guidelines.  We're really very constrained about the sentences we can give out, that being designed to give more uniform sentences across the country, so that if you're committing a crime in Wyoming, you'll get a punishment similar to having committed that crime in Michigan.  And, to some extent it's done that.  To some extent, what's its done is to take the discretionary power of those inequities and put them in the hands of the prosecutor, the U.S. attorney, as opposed to the judge.  So that, now, the issue is what you're charged with as opposed to what your sentence might be.  And so, I think probably we see that coming back into balance eventually, you know, that eventually we will maybe decide that minimum sentences are not necessarily the way to go all the time because sometime they penalize people more than we really want certain people penalized.  And we'll see that swing back a different way, I think.
Story_ID: 70242
Speaker 1: Now, are--do you have, (unclear) do you have an idea if what you're legacy of being a judge--what you want--you're still early, but you've been--do you have an idea how you want to be viewed?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd like to be viewed in history as somebody that was fair.  I would like to be viewed as someone who continually gave back to the community at large.  I think everybody would like to have something that they did that either motivated others or made some big difference in the way that we practice law, or we go about doing our work, and that's a very big task.  I think we see some people who, in fact, do that.  You mentioned Judge [HM Damon] Keith, and for sure Judge Keith has impacted at least, I think, the whole nation.  But, very particularly in Michigan, and among African American lawyers, how they look at themselves and their work, and his commitment, not only to doing his work, but doing other things besides his work.  And I think we would all like to see ourselves in that mold.  And so, basically I think I would want to be able to have the opportunity, if it rises, to do something that would make that kind of impact.  Whether or not you are able to do that is sometimes an issue of if you are at a particular point where something happens that allows you to do that.  I don't know if that'll come or not, sometimes you don't know that your cases do that or not.  And to the extent that you may not be able to do that, I think you have to, just each day, let everyone who comes into your courtroom know that their case--you know that their case is the most important thing to them.  And even if it isn't the most important case in the scheme of the important cases, that you give it just as much attention as you would a case that might be big in the scheme of cases.
Story_ID: 72423
Speaker 1: --But I think that's one of their expectations.  They expect me to participate in the church programming.  If I'm gone, we--a couple of Sundays in a row, someone will ask where I've been.  Usually my husband will just say where I am so it won't seem like I'm just at home reading the New York Times.  And they like it, I think, for the minister's wife to do something in the church.  They would never, however, require me to do anything, I don't think, except come.  They may, you know, the deacons might visit me if I never came to church for like, six months or something.  They'd maybe be worried.  But, there is some history of that.  For instance, my mother-in-law had a tutorial program.  I don't think she really held any elected church offices.  But, she had been a Sunday school teacher.  And she was very active in the community and they liked that, I think.  I think they like it that they have a minister's wife who--I think my church is very proud of the fact that I'm a judge.  They've been very supportive about that.  And I have some projects that I do, and I've been on some boards.  This is my second time on the Board for Christian Education.  I don't know if they like it, but what I like to project--my grandmother was a minister's wife, and she was kind of one of those "hat and glove" ladies.  And, what I like to project is a little more hands on.  Like, I want my church members to think that if we have a dinner and need people to clean up, that I'll be one of them.  And that they can rely on me to ask me to do any of the jobs that people do in our church family, just as they would any other member.  And, I wanna keep that open for them.  And then I do other things, like I'm part of a ministers--an interdenominational ministers wives group.  And, I have--one of--an older minister's wife that I know invited me to join this group, and at first I was like not really sure, but, I like to go there because the women in that group has so many different roles; everything from, you know, one who directs the choir and plays the organ, and one who has an office at the church rivaling any of the other offices at the church, where she has, you know, an office, and she has duties, almost like an assistant.  And so, its--I like seeing the different roles that we all play in that.  And, I also like it because there are unique things that happen.  For instance, it's kinda like--I think it's probably easy being a judge and kind of in a fish bowl where everyone's always watching you, because at church, people whether they admit it or not, watch you.  They want to know what you're doing.  One of the very big roles that I think you play is being a role model, not only for--as a Christian, but you know, as a wife.  I mean they want to look, "Does my pastor and his wife, do they have a good relationship?  And what kind of relationship do they have?  Is it one we want to model?"  And I think our church has a lot of couples.  Because of that, we do a lot of things with couples that are things that are fun and that enrich marriage.  And that, you know, my husband's really able to do that because he has a pretty good marriage.  So that is something that he can project out.  I think one of the interesting things about it is that being in a clergy family is kind of time consuming.  I don't say that negatively.  I, I--because I like it, and you know, I told you I went around with my grandfather a lot, so, I like church.  If you didn't like church it would be very bad.  But it does take up time, because you want it to.  And so, that--it's like you already have a big extra-curricular activity.  And so, that necessarily takes up a piece of the pie that you would spend outside the time that you're being a judge, that you could maybe spend on your work, or you could spend it on something more professional related activity.  You already have a big chunk over here that you've already committed to.  By choice, I mean, you want to do it, I mean....
Story_ID: 72424
Speaker 1: But this is what--how have you been able to manage, you know, of raising a family, the church, and a full--a really full-time career?  And that's when I--you know, because sometimes just being a minister's wife is a full-time job.  That's all I'm--I mean (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and raising children.  I mean, let's say (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --raising children.
Speaker 2: Well, when I first ran for office, one of the people on one of the bar associations groups that interviewed me, asked me a question that was kinda like, "How are you going to take care of your young children and be a judge?"  And they got into a lot of trouble about that.  I thought I had a really good answer then, but I don't remember it precisely, but it really has to do with the fact that, I think women now a days wanna juggle a lot of things.  And a lot of us want to do that, and so it's not extraordinary, particularly anymore.  I think it has been really, really helpful to me to have a church family because they help you raise your kids.  And your kids are already on notice that they're the preacher's kids and that their every move is gonna be scrutinized.  Which, it can have a positive and a negative effect.  On mine, I think, they in some ways look at it like, everybody in the church will be able to tell me what to do, okay, and I should just accept it.  I could be mad, but, I'm probably gonna have to do that.  I'm gonna have to go to church a lot.  And some of the goodness of people who come to church ultimately is going to rub off on you if you're there a lot, okay.  And it also makes you feel like you have all these other people that you see a lot, you know them and you can trust them, and it gives your kids all these other role models that they can have, and someone else they can go to and say, "my mom is making do this", and that other person say, "well, yeah."  And so, now they know, okay, two adults thinks that--thinks that is right, as opposed to just my mother.  So with your children, I think, it's nice to see people who are always worried about who will watch my kids while my husband and I go out on a date.  I don't have that problem, because there are a whole group of people that I know and I trust because they go to my church.  And they may not always be trustworthy people, but a number of them--a great number of them are.  So with your kids, I think it's a help, just as it would be for anybody that were active in their church.  Time wise, you know, every woman these days has to make judgments about time.  I make them kinda like this: do I want to do it; should I do it; is anybody served by my doing it; am I served by my doing it?  And then, also, what do I have give up to go do it?  Usually, that's housework, you know, if you come to my house there will be some dust, you know.  And, you know, we may be grocery shopping really late at night.  But I think that modern women just say, "Okay, I'm going to juggle this the best I can."  Sometimes the ball drops.  Hopefully someone will pick it up for you and throw it back into the mix.  But, I think for me, it's been good because that lets me have the spiritual outlet I already had in an easy way.  I'm there--I don't have to--I never feel like I'm giving up something else because, I'm--even though I'm not required to do it, I want to do it.  And so, if somebody thinks I should be making a choice, they can always say, "Well, golly, she has to go do that 'cause she's the minister's wife", even though I may have chosen to do it anyway.  I don't know if I'm articulating that very well.
Story_ID: 72425
Speaker 1: No, and the other question I want to ask you--I want to ask you another question.  Well I wanted to ask you a question about your grandfather, but I'll come back to that.  I want to ask a question about your involvement in the women's movement and how you know, it's, it's an area that you were involved in, you know, young.  And I'm just wondering as someone who's been active--who was active with NOW [National Organization of Women] and, you know, other, you know, other organizations associated with the Bar and the advancement of women.  Are you happy with, with where the state of women are today, as someone who was an active participant?
Speaker 2: We're better than we were, but we still have farther to go.  And I think you see that in a lot of ways.  One is that women still don't make an equal wage to men for the same kinds of work very often.  I often still see women saying an idea in a meeting, and people just acting like they don't exist.  And then a man says the same idea and it's suddenly, you know, something Thomas Edison talked a lot of.  And that really still kinda breaks my heart.  But on the other hand, I think that women have had an opportunity to have a lot more leadership roles.  We've advanced in corporate America.  There are many more women in firms.  Some firms--law firms still aren't women friendly.  I--you know what I mean.  They, you know, you're supposed to put in a lot of billable hours, and that's a very hard thing to do if you have one or two, or three children at home, or if you have ailing parents, or any of those things that generally fall to women to do.  I think we've changed the thinking of people about men and women's roles.  But I think if you go in most of the households in America, you will still find that women do traditionally women--women's work after they get home from work.  And maybe that isn't negative; maybe that's how we will have really worked it out.  But I think there is the opportunity for women to want something different and to say, "I want something different."  I think there are those firms that have said, "These women are so good that we don't care if they want to work at home, or if they have flex hours, or whatever, because they're so good we're gonna do whatever it takes to keep them."  And that they've said, "This is important, we gonna do that."  There're some places where that hasn't happened.  I thought we would be further along.  To me, further along means that for African Americans and for women, that, when you go--and when you're in a meeting, that someone will still remember when they bring out a slate of people to work on a project, that's supposed to represent a cross-section of the legal community, that if there're no women on it, someone other than a women, will notice that there're no women on it.  Okay, that I don't have to be in the meeting and say, "You know this is the committee of twenty--here we are in Wayne County [Michigan] and we have no women on this committee, or we have no minorities on this committee."  I want that to happen without those people having to be at the table, if necessary.  And I'm not saying that doesn't happen.  But, it doesn't always happen.  And I just will--I will feel like we've made a big stride when I know that people are concerned about the issues of people who aren't in the room when those people aren't in the room.  And so, I would say I've seen--have seen a lot of women who would be great in firms that have said, "I don't wanna do that."  And they've done other things.  And those other things are so beneficial to our communities that you can't really knock it.  So, I think we are getting ahead, maybe not at the pace that I would want us to.  And then I also think that, I mean, I'm from that part of the women's movement where they were still not pretending to ratify the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment]!  I mean, I feel that there are some women, if you ask, what is the ERA [Equal Rights Amendment]; they think that's something historical.  And in a sense, I suppose it is.  But I, I would hope younger women continue to see that we wanna have institutions work in a way so that women, if they decide they want to have families and work, and do everything else, have the opportunity to do that, that you don't have to pick one or the other.  And as long as that's happening, and as long as we would get to make an equal wage, I think that--I would be satisfied.  I would've thought--I envisioned that we would be as aggressive now, as we were, you know, in the '70s [1970s].  And that's--that didn't happen.  And I think it didn't happen because a lot of doors were opened and, I mean, I'm not disappointed.  I just think there is more room to go.  Like, you know, there could be--I don't want it to be a choice.  I don't want us to think about--I want us to be able to say, "Okay, here, we're going to put somebody else on the Supreme Court", and that we would think that a woman had--would have as much chance of getting that, even though there are already two women there, as any man.  Or that--I think you get where I'm going.
Story_ID: 72426
Speaker 1: Now, one--two other questions.  I wanna know what your hopes and concerns are for the black community?
Speaker 2: My concern is that we are getting to be very middle class and above, and very poor and below--very lower class and below, and that, that middle group shrinks.  And that it gets to be too wide a band that we don't cross.  It used to be that you lived in a neighborhood and, you know, a doctor lived up the street, or around the corner, because we lived in a small, contained area.  And that when there was integration, there were so many more opportunities that now we have mainly poor people living together, separate from other people, even in our own community.  And, I worry about that.  I worry about that those of us who have resources will get too far removed from understanding what it's like to not have resources, and that we'll forget.  My hope is that we--every child, no matter where they're born, has an opportunity to be educated and to be--to live to their fullest potential.  And that, gee, that role model would not be a drug dealer with a lot of money, that a role model will--would be somebody who was doing interesting work, even if it didn't pay very much, or, somebody who was really helping people, even if they didn't get paid very much, and maybe that we would pay those people more.  It's--I think it's developing more and more, at least it seems to be, into a class thing, even though, even as I say that, I know that, you know, when my teenagers get in a car and start driving around the-Detroit [Michigan], most of the people don't discern anything about that except there's a black teenager riding around in a black Ford Explorer, and golly, how did they get it.  And so, even though that band is widening in some areas, it's really just imploded upon itself in other areas, which means that, you know, I can have an Assistant United States Attorney stopped and questioned by, you know, white officers up North who don't believe that his ID is a real United States Attorney ID, stopped for no reason.  I mean, you know, it's kind of still a double-edge sword.  So my hope is that we would continue to attempt to have all of our race fulfill their full potential, and that we would continue to work to make our society one where we're not judged because we're black.  Assumptions aren't made because we're black.  And there are still--I mean, you know, when I go into the store, if I don't have on the right stuff, I look like I can't buy something, so that would be one--one of the things I would worry about.  I would worry that we didn't stay on guard to protect our rights; that we would give them up out of fear of other things, and that, if we don't protect them, that has a very, very adverse effect upon African Americans, or any people of color.  And I would hope that we would re-institutionalize those things that we had before there was integration, meaning that we would again strive to be in business, and to support those businesses.  And that we would again strive to have things that we uplifted in our culture that were uniquely ours, and continue to invest in them.  And that we wouldn't be uptight about doing that, that people would accept that there was diversity, and that it was good.

Speaker 1: How old was your grandfather when he, when he passed--oh, is he passed?  Is he still alive?
Speaker 2: No, he passed in '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], when you were just, okay.  I think you were now a (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had just gotten married.  He didn't even get to see me graduate from law school, although he would have really liked that.
Speaker 1: What do--that's why I wanted to ask, what do you think he would think of you, seeing you now?  And that the little child--I mean the child who accompanied him around, right?
Speaker 2: I think he would be very, very proud.  When I came and told him I was going to marry a minister, I think he was just like, "I can't believe she's doing this.  I like this guy, he's wonderful, and she'll be perfect at this, but this isn't what I had in mind."  (Laughter).  But, on the other hand, I think he was really intrigued that I was--and extremely supportive that--that I was going to law school, and that I'd be able to do that, and that I not have to be real uncomfortable doing that--that I'd be able to have enough money to do that.  And I think he would be tickled pink, he'd walk in here and he just would shake his head.  And I think he would have thought "it paid off, all those times that I had listened to her argue her point about how she was right about some obtuse religious point, and that the teacher was wrong, or at least that there was another way of looking at it, that the Sunday school teacher had not put forward."  And that he would see it as my granddaughter, who was always concerned that people be treated fairly, that here's her opportunity to work that out right in her job, and that's a really neat thing.  And now I think he would like it very much that--I think he always thought I would participate in my local church, but, when you were asking about being a minister's wife--so my husband doesn't want me to be in charge of everything.  So I've had some national church offices, and I think he would have really liked that.  He would have said, "Okay, all those times I drug her to those conventions and things and wanted to--her to participate.  Here's how it paid off, that she really did go and give back some of those skills that we were attempting to build.  She gave them back to her church, or to another church.  He might be a little disappointed I wasn't in the AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church (laughter), overall, I think, very happy.
Story_ID: 72428
Speaker 1: And is there anything else you would like to say?
Speaker 2: I do want to say that I'm really delighted that you asked me to participate in this project, because I always say that if we don't tell people the history we want them to know, they won't know, and it won't get passed down, and I know in many families, even in my own, some days I am talking to someone and I say, "My dad will know that person's name, and then I realize my dad is gone, and now we might not ever be able to pinpoint that name we were looking for.  And how important it is for us to say what we were like, and what we were thinking and those kinds of things, and that we don't do that, and we don't encourage people to do as much as we really should.  And we don't document it always very seriously.  Like, I really am a little jealous of my friends who have documented it all and they remember it.  And it's really important to--to tell our own stories.  To tell--even tell our stories in the slant of the questioner and, and to have someone look at it and make their own view, because they're our story, but really, it's the interpretation of others that is kinda the fun part of it too.  So I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity to participate.  You asked what our hopes are, and I, I--one of the things I always hope is that somebody's life gets--life gets touched, even if I don't know it, by what I'm doing, or something I've said, or something they read about me.  Or--and that that's most important, if we can even change one life for the better that, that's a really good thing, and so I thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Thank you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.

He was, at that time, an attorney at Dickinson Wright, along with Tom Kienbaum, but he is now an attorney in Chicago [Illinois].  And he was getting ready to be the incoming president of that group.  We were at our annual meeting.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right.  Okay, go ahead.

That's my mother, Nancy Page on the left, and my dad, Richard Page, then myself and then my sister, Teri Page, T-E-R-I.  And that's in the city county building auditorium of the Detroit City Council, and--which is now called the Coleman A. Young Memorial Municipal Center.  Actually, I think it's called the Coleman Young Municipal Center.  And I was being sworn into the Recorders Court.  My friend, Wendy Baxter, had prepared the program for the ceremony, and to our surprise, Governor [James] Blanchard actually came to the ceremony and brought some remarks.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Can you tell us the year for this?
Speaker 1: 1989.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go ahead.

Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a picture of--on the left, Judge Anna Diggs Taylor, Judge [HM] Damon Keith, Judge Ann Williams, and Judge Eric Clay and myself at the Just the Beginning Foundation meeting that was held in Detroit Michigan.  And I think that would be 1998.

Speaker 2: This is a picture of me on the right, and my mother-in-law--my husband's mother, Dr. Elizabeth F. Hood during one of my campaigns.  She had sponsored a program for me and invited a number of women in our community to come out to a reception.  And this is a picture of us from that reception.  And I think it was my campaign for Recorders Court.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.  Say that one more time.
Speaker 2: And it would have been early '90s [1990s].
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me.  I think it was in my campaign for Circuit Court.  And with me is my youngest son, Noah Hood, who you can see is only semi-excited about being on the campaign trail with his mother.  And that would have been in about 1992, probably.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Group of my college [Yale University, Connecticut] classmates at our--some reunion, like twenty-five or thirty--sounds like we're ancient.

Speaker 1: --It's the late '90s [1990s].
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, for that one I kept the camera rolling 'cause now I can just kind of just push them through.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me and my husband.  And this would be in the 80's [1980s].  And this--I was--a friend of ours had a birthday celebration and she had a caricature of us.  And that's a picture of us in our caricature.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, (unclear) go head.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me being sworn into Federal Court in 1994.  And I want to say the date is September 30th, but I'm not exactly positive.  And in this picture, on the lower--in the lower line of people that you see, kind of in the front, those are my relatives.  And then you'll see some people that look like judges in the back, and those are the magistrate judges of our court--two of my staff people.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  When you--we'll just reference this is the same, same ceremony.  And then you can add any commentaries pertinent to this.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is also my investiture to Federal Court.  And on the left, in back, is Congressman John Conyers, and over my--over on the opposite end is--the woman looking over the shoulder of the gentleman, is Isetta (ph.)

And it's a picture--on the left is my father-in-law, next is me in the blue and white dress, that's [HM] Andrew Young holding our son Nathan, and my husband on the right, in the tan suit.  And I think we were at a fund-raiser for my husband, in that picture.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And just because there are sometimes multiple variations of proper nouns--Moseley, we should spell.
Speaker 2: M-O-S-E-L-E-Y.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, great.
Speaker 2: Boy, I wish I could read those tags.  I could--let me see that a minute.  Maybe I could say what that was.  Oh, no, this is my father-in-law's twenty-fifth anniversary at the church.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, and when she just spoke, she's referring to this photograph--twenty-fifth anniversary at the church.
Speaker 2: This is my--this is my first campaign photo.  This is a photo that I used for my 1982 campaign for 36th District Court.  And I used it on my brochures and I also used it on my billboards.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, very good; okay, and then we'll get this down.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  We do a lot of --your contrast to your image off of a photo, but we can reproduce this.  So, let's spin through it 'cause it is historically valuable, and you said you liked it, so.
Speaker 1: Oh! That's--got it.  (simultaneous)-
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Maybe the--
Speaker 1: --Almost.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Maybe the, maybe the draft from a vent got it.
Speaker 1: Um-hum, okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, go head; we're rolling.  (Unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me on the left, in the middle my son, Nathan, and my husband Nick.  And it was an article in--on July 14, 1982, just prior--actually during my campaign for 36th District Court.  And it was about the names people give their children.  And we were being highlighted because--actually, both my sons have the--their, their middle names are my family name, "Page."  And it was a discussion about women hyphenating their names, or using just their family name along with their married name.  And in the article they were highlighting some people who had hyphenated, and some people who had not.
