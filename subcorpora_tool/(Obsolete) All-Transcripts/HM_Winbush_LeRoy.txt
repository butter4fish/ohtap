Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  And sir, can you please state your name for us and spell it.
Speaker 2: My name is LeRoy Winbush.  The first name is "L-E-R-O-Y" last name, "W-I-N-B-U-S-H".
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is the 29th of May.
Speaker 1: And can you give us the location today?
Speaker 2: And we are at--in Outer Drive East, which is 400 East Randolph in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  What we do when we get started there are a couple of questions we always ask.  They are people magazinish type questions.  And if you bear with me here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us your--oh first of all can you give us your date of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is December 7, 1915, 1-9-1-5.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been around for quite a while.

Speaker 1: What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food.  Mustard greens for one thing. Barbecue, polish sausage.  Oh I guess all the things you're not supposed to eat.  And right now I'm on a-- not really a diet, but there are certain things I shouldn't eat because we're thinning the blood.  And so nothing green.  No beans or teas or string beans nothing like that.  Lettuce has to be just plain lettuce, not fancy lettuce at all.  But I'm almost over with this whole medical thing.  I've been on it since November, the day after Thanksgiving.  And what happened, they discovered a blood clot in my left lung and they've cleared that up.  And they've been working on thinning the blood so there's no reoccurrence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now these are--there're about four more of these questions.  And, you know--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Go ahead.
Speaker 1: They just require short answers.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I don't really have a favorite time of year.  I used to enjoy Christmas more than any other season.  Because I was in the display business and doing a lot of Christmas displays.  And it was an exciting experience.  Of course, today's Christmas is totally different than it was originally.  People just don't care that much about it.  They'll dig something out of a trunk that they had twenty years and hang it up.  Nothing new.  No nothing.  Creativity is sorely shot.  And the quality of Christmas is shot.  I think the only place that's really doing anything is Fields, Marshall Fields and maybe Carson's.  Everybody else is--they're doing a few things, but nothing spectacular.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't have a favorite time of year but it used to be Christmas though.
Speaker 2: Yeah but--yeah I like the whole year all the way around.  Because I'm doing something in each segment of the year.  I ski, I play tennis and there's always something that I'm doing in one segment of the year.  And the swimming and the diving.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite what?
Speaker 1: Color.
Speaker 2: Blue.  Just like Duke Ellington.  He likes blue as a color and blue is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, because I've been all over the world as a diver.  And I would say I could pick out a favorite place and it would be Israel. The diving there is spectacular.  If they haven't already ruined it, you know.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I was there it was just absolutely gorgeous.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase.  No I can't really, you know.  I can't think of any one thing in particular.
Story_ID: 15636
Speaker 1: Sir can you give me the names of your parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother's name was Alberta.  And the last--middle--maiden name was Mebane, "M-E-B-A-N-E".  And my father was Lee or Leroy Winbush.  The same as min--I'm a junior I guess.  But then I like to spell my name "L-E-R-O-Y" instead of small "r".  Small "r" is Leroy, capital "R" is LeRoy.  And LeRoy in French and Spanish means "the king."
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you like that designation better.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I like LeRoy.  It has a better sound to it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any other--do you have any siblings?  Any brothers or sisters?
Speaker 2: No.  No brother and no sisters.  No--I'm the only child.  What you see is it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well let's just really talk a bit about your parents.  And had you--Can you tell us something about your mother and where she came from and--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well I--first of all I have to tell you that when we left Memphis, [Tennessee], my family left Memphis, I was living with my grandparents. My mother and father had separated.  And my mother had already gone to Detroit, Michigan.  And then we, as what was left of the family followed her to Detroit.  But they didn't live together.  My mother was still separated from my father at that period, when I was five years old.
Speaker 1: Sir can you tell us something about your mother though prior to her marrying your father?  And can you talk about, you know, where her family--.
Speaker 2: Well there wasn't much to talk about because of that separation.  I mean I can think of things of each individual person.  But not things that they did together.  'Cause they didn't do anything together.
Speaker 1: No.  I was asking you about your mother.  Just your mother.
Speaker 2: Oh my mother.  The only thing I can tell you is when I finally started living with my mother in Detroit, one of the things she told me when we got to Chicago, [Illinois] she said, "I want you to understand one thing.  You can't hang around on the corner with a bunch of guys.  And anybody that you meet--becomes your friend, you have to bring them to me so I can meet them."  She was very strict about that.  She was also strict about the time that I got home.  I had to get in the house early, not hang around late.  Had to be in at a certain time.  And one of the things that I remember vividly is telling her once I had decided I wasn't gonna go out that evening.  She said, she had news for me.  I wasn't gonna go anyway [Laughing].  You know.  No matter what I'd planned she was gonna destroy the whole plan.  And  one of the things I learned from her is just living and discipline and keeping things straightened out, and different things that you had to do in the house.  Chores like making up the bed, washing the dishes.  My mother and my aunt went on a visit once and left me to take care of the house. And when they came back it was immaculate.  Because that's the way they taught me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was your--what was your mother's occupation?  Was she--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] She was working as a maid in a hotel.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  And she at one time in Chicago worked at the Audy Home [Chicago, Illinois] with boys I think.  Isn't that what it's called the Audy Home?  I don't know what she did there.  But anyway that's where she was  working.
Speaker 1: And do you know how to spell that, the Audy Home?
Speaker 2: yeah, A-U-D-Y, Audy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Audy Home.
Speaker 1: That's more or less an orphanage?
Speaker 2: Sort of, yeah.
Speaker 1: [unclear].
Speaker 2: I think so.  It's a home for boys I believe.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then for a while my mother worked as a maid in hotels.  Different hotels around like the Palmer House [Hilton, Chicago, Illinois] and some of the others.  And she just was a maid.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about her childhood or her parents or--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah she talked about disciplines that her father taught her her and her life.  I think it was in Alabama.  I'm not sure.  And then my aunt, her sister and her moved I think to Memphis.  And then from there they came up north to Chicago and Detroit.
Story_ID: 15637
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your father.  What was your father's name again?
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: [Leroy] Lee "L-E-E" Winbush.
Speaker 2: And--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] And then sometimes he used Leroy.  But he spelled it with a small "r".  And--but the two names that he used, one or the other at different times, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did he ever tell you about his childhood or his parents or where he--Did you know--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] No.  He talked sometimes about his brothers.  He had two brothers.  One was Arthur, my uncle Arthur and I can't remember the name of the other one.  But it was two of them, two brothers that he had. Clyde Winbush and Arthur Winbush I believe.
Speaker 2: Now they--now where did they grow up?
Speaker 1: I think mostly Tennessee.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And  I did remember my mother [Alberta Mebane Winbush] telling me about Clyde who moved to Detroit [Michigan] and he was--he drove a taxicab.  Had an accident and the cab  was so torn up, they put it on display at Cadillac Square in Detroit.  And he got out and walked away from it.
Speaker 2: He was lucky.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: So did your father  have any stories at all about his background and his--?
Speaker 1: No not too much.  He talked a little bit about what he did which was a caretaker at the baseball park.  And I think he had another brother, Uncle John who was a caretaker at a baseball park.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: But did he do primary--. So that was his pri--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] That was his--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Primarily did he--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] he was--.
Speaker 2: Caretaker there--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] at a ballpark.  And in Detroit that's what he did.  And my grandfather worked downtown.  And I never did know specifically what he did.  But he did some kind of office work or something in Cadillac Square, the main part of Detroit.
Speaker 2: So how did your mother and father meet?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: I don't have any idea about that.  I can't tell you 'cause I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: So you were born in 1915.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But I do know this, that my dad went away to war in the--1913, 1914, I guess it was.  He was in the army when I was born.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And  so it was no--nothing working out between the two of them.  He wasn't even there.  He was in the army.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So did he ever talk about his experiences in the army?  In World War I?
Speaker 1: No. But he showed me pictures that he had.  I got one on the wall when my mot--right there hanging up on the wall of him when he was in he army.  And one  other thing.  I almost got killed with his automatic.  He was showing it off and it went off and missed me by inches.  I was on the floor playing with a sandman that they had bought me.  And the bullet missed me by six inches.  And he never did show it off any more after that.
Story_ID: 15638
Speaker 1: You lived in Memphis [Tennessee] until you--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well I don't remember much about Memphis.  Because  there wasn't anything--wasn't any activity for me to  remember.  You know, at five years old I hadn't started school yet I don't think.  And the only one main incident I do remember is I got on the bus and ran and jumped right up in the driver's lap, and you were supposed to ride in the back of the bus.  And  he says, "Oh isn't that little boy cute."  I guess I was at that time.  I probably made history and didn't know anything about it.  But  that's the only incident that I remember.  And then I remember another time  one of my uncles--oh I know.  Some boys chased me.  And I, I said, "I'll go get my uncle and get you for doing that, for chasing me."  So I got my uncle and they chased us both [Laughing].  And that was in Memphis.
Speaker 1: That's unusual.
Speaker 2: Yeah [Laughing].
Story_ID: 15639
Speaker 1: So when you moved from Memphis [Tennessee] to--you moved first to Detroit [Michigan] right?  You were five years old, you said.
Speaker 2: Yeah right.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And your father [Leroy Winbush Sr.] had already moved to Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Right.  And I came with my grandmother--my step-grandmother and my grandfather.  I was staying with them.  And when I went to school, I went to the school by the name of Wingert "W- I-N-G-E-R-T".  Wingert [Pre-Vocational] School.  That was grammar school.
Speaker 1: That was what grade?
Speaker 2: Ha?
Speaker 1: What grade?
Speaker 2: Well it wasn't first grade.  It was a little higher than that.  And I remember one incident of I had to bring my grandmother to school for some reason.  And the teachers--The teacher asked my grandmother, "Don't you give him anything to eat at home?  He's always eating the paste and the letters."  [Laughing] You know.  And, of course, my grandmother didn't think too kindly about that.  And that set off a dissertation between the teacher and my grandmother.  And she said, "I'll take him home and teach him myself."  And we left right after that.  And another incident I remember with my grandmother was, she kept telling me she was gonna take me downtown and buy a "union suit" she called it.  And I got excited about it 'cause I thought it was a uniform.  And when we got there, it turned out to be long underwear [Laughing].  You know, it was a big disappointment.  But that's what it was.  And she did take me downtown and bought the underwear.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Detroit though, your father had this job as a caretaker of a ballpark.  Can you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: The ballpark and what they did there?
Speaker 2: Well I remember a lot about the park.  Because I was there and had things to do in the park.  Like bagging the peanuts.  They came in a giant bag that I couldn't even lift.  And they'd take the peanuts out, put them in a bag and kind of close it up and then they sold the bags for so much.  Then we also had to go out and look for beer bottles.  And I remember collecting beer bottles where people would buy the beer and leave it under the grandstand and in the bleachers and like that.  And we had to collect up all the bottles.  And the kids in the neighborhood did a lot of--they helped me with it.  And the rule was if you found something under the grandstand, half of it belonged to me.  That was the rule.  And so this one day one of my friends found 5 dollars and he was reluctant about splitting it with me.  So I backed him up against the wall and he said, "Wait a minute.  I'll take you home.  I got a new football.  I'll give you the football instead of the money."  So that sounded alright.  So I went to his house.  It turned out that all he had was the cover of a football.  It had no bladder.  I said, "Oh well, I'll stuff it with paper."  So I took it.  Then he said, "Come and go to the store with me."  Guess what he bought with the five dollars?  Five dollars worth of jellybeans.  It was twenty pounds of jellybeans [Laughing].  We had jellybeans all over the place for months.  And that was one of the things I remember specifically.  Then I also remember next to the park, there was a dancehall.  And my grandfather worked--was in charge of the dancehall.  I don't know what all his duties were.  But he was in total charge of that dancehall.  And I had chores like turning the lights out in the boxing ring when they had boxing there.  They had dances and things like that.  And it was a regular dancehall.  And he took care of the whole thing.
Speaker 1: [unclear] Okay.  Who played ball at the ballpark?
Speaker 2: It was the team called the Detroit Stars was the name of the team.  And they played there on a regular basis.  And I didn't know that much about baseball and didn't care either.  They tried to get me to become the batboy or something.  The mascot they called it.  And they took the mascot's uniform and tried it on me and it swallowed me.  So I was too small to take that job over.  And I didn't really--wasn't interested anyway.  'Cause I never have liked baseball.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the park again?
Speaker 2: It--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Was it a Negro League team?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, it was a black team.  And--but it was Rose Inc.'s Mack Baseball Park.  It was on Mack Avenue in Detroit.  It's long gone I'm sure.  But that was the name of it, Mack Park.
Speaker 1: And do you remember anything else of significance about Detroit?
Speaker 2: I think I went to a--my father worked for a truck company at one time.  I don't know how long.  But I do remember a little bit.  That he was doing something for Mack Trucks I think it was.  From a company called Mack Trucks.
Speaker 1: He had all the Macks I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah right.  I'm going back a long ways.  But it's remarkable what your memory can do.
Story_ID: 15640
Speaker 1: When did the family decide to move to--or did you move with your mother [Alberta Mebane Winbush] to Chicago [Illinois] or your father [Leroy Winbush Sr.] or both?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No.  What happened is we were in Chicago, my grandmother and grandfather and I and my mother was in Detroit.  And she wrote to my grandmother and asked for me to visit her in Detroit, which I did.  And I stayed with my mother and never did go back with my grandmother.
Speaker 1: You mean in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Ha?
Speaker 1: You mean in Chicago.
Speaker 2: I stayed in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Chicago right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  Well no.  'Cause my mother was living in Detroit.  I went to visit her and I stayed with my mother from the time she was in Detroit and moved to Chicago.  We moved to Chicago together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the first day they took me to [Edmund] Burke [Elementary] School, 50th and King Drive.  And I went there for two or three days.  And they asked me what grade was I in and I just said, "eighth grade."  'Cause all these little kids running around I figured I'd be out of place.  So I said, "eighth grade."  But I wasn't prepared to be in eighth grade.  And I remember the teacher telling me that I was the dumbest student she had ever had.  "And where do you live?"  And I told her.  And she said, "I'm gonna transfer you to another school."  She sent me to Carter [Elementary] School at Wabash and 59th.  And that's Carter, "C-A-R-T-E-R".  Then they sat me across from a scholastic genius.  They guy knew everything about trigonometry, geometry and history, everything. Except art, he knew nothing about.  So the first spelling test we had thirty words to spell.  And I got twenty-nine wrong out of the thirty.  And when the [Laughing] report card came out, the teacher put a red "F29" on there to remind me of that report card.  And the guy across the way from me in the seat across the aisle took pity on me.  And he said, "If you come over to my house every night, I'll help you with your homework."  And I used to go to his house and do my homework every night.  Every night, every night, every night.  Once his mother asked me, "Boy don't you have no home to go to?"[Laughing]  You know how parents are.  But we became close friends.  And I told him, "The mistake that we're making is working as individuals."  His name was Samuel Gilmer, "G-I-L-M-E-R" Gilmer. And I told him, "The mistake that we're making is we're working as individuals.  We should be working as a team.  Things that you can't do, I'll do for both of us and vise versa."  That's how I got through grammar school.  He and I graduated at the top of the class of Carter School.  The other thing, I'm backing up a little bit.  But I remember Carter School; they put me in charge of ringing the handbell and all of the electric bells.  So I didn't have to do any studying at all.  All I had to do is manage the bells.  And sometimes I'd let the kids play an extra ten minutes giving me a feeling of power.  "Oh I'll ring it in ten minutes."  You know.  "I'll let them play a little bit longer."  But I had complete control of that whole thing.  And then we went to Englewood [School] and enrolled in Englewood together.  And I asked him, "What are you gonna take?"  "General science."  And like a dumbbell I took general science too.  'Cause I was gonna work the same system through high school.  It didn't work.  I failed in I think Latin.  And I needed Latin like I needed another head.  But I--that was a subject I failed in.  And I almost didn't graduate from high school because of that failure.  And I had to go to the assistant principal to get permission to take an extra subject, five subjects instead of four in order to graduate.  So the teacher--and I think her name was Manley, "M-A-N-L-E-Y" and when I went to her to ask to take the extra subject, she said, "Aren't you the boy that's always drawing pictures in the study hall?"  I had to say, "Yes ma'am that's me."
Story_ID: 15641
Speaker 1: When did you discover that you were an artist?  And when did you start drawing as a young person?
Speaker 2: I would say from my grammar school on.  All through high school.  But the real thing--and that's gotta go on the tape what I'm about to say now.  The real thing is by taking general science and failing one semester in Latin, I took two years of general science before I found out they had a full four year art course at Englewood [School, Chicago, Illinois].  And it shows you how even back then, there was no help or counseling.  'Cause I should have took an art course right at the beginning.  So what happened, I had to make up the full two years that I missed.  I took four years of art in two years.  I had to.  That's the only way I could get out of there.
Speaker 1: So what were your favorite subjects to draw?  I mean what would you draw?  What kind of artwork would you do?
Speaker 2: I remember being very proficient in pastel doing color on heads and different scenes and all sorts of things that I would draw.  It--with pastel colors.  And then I started doing black and white artwork for our school newspaper and the book that we had for graduation.  I did illustrations for all of that.  And then went on to--you know, I could tell that I had some talent.  And then I developed it by taking the four years of art in two years. That helped me.  But a week after I graduated from high school, I was working in a sign shop.  I wouldn't go to college or anything.  This--that has to go on the tape too.
Speaker 1: Sure.  It's all--it's all.  It's rolling.
Speaker 2: Oh I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: We're rolling.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But anyway, when I graduated from high school, as I said, a week after I graduated from high school, I went to work as an apprentice in a sign shop at 47th and South Park Way, which is now King Drive.  It's Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. And it used to be South Park Way.  The sign shop that I started to work in was formerly a miniature golf course.  And it was an abandoned miniature golf course.  But we set up the sign shop there and I was an apprentice in that shop.  And then we started doing work for the Savoy Ballroom.  It's "S-A-V-O-Y," Savoy.  And we did work for the Savoy Ballroom and the Regal Theater.  And Regal is "R -E-G-A-L".  And so we serviced both places.  And so I got a lot of things I had to draw for things that they passed out, to tell who was coming and posters and things of that nature.  And there was a poster that we put on muslin, that we hung across. The ropes were from one side of the street to the other, on 47th Street.  And the banner was on a net.  And we had to sew muslin on to the banner double sided with this curved needle.  And I had my hands all messed up trying to put--get up on to the net.  But I wondered why that was never done any more and how we got up the nerve to do that.  But I do remember it hanging over 47th street.  That's when I remember the South Center Department store.  That was in that same complex.  That whole corner was owned by the [Harry and Louis] Englestein brothers.  They owned all the property and just about everything that was there, including the South Center. And, of course, [S.B.] Fuller bought the South Center at a later date.  Fuller of Fuller Products.  And he bought it when it was too late.  They had wiped out all of the market.  I mean he couldn't make any money because there weren't--African Americans were starting to go downtown to shop. And previously they shopped in that one area.  And that's about where--everybody stayed in the same neighborhood.  So they became not neighbors, brothers and sisters.  Because they were locked into that area.
Story_ID: 15642
Speaker 1: Now is that different from where you grew up?  Because you said that you lived at 50th and--was that 50th?  Was it 50th and--From where you went to Englewood High School, you know?
Speaker 2: Oh when I went to Englewood High School, I lived at 58th and South Park Way [now Martin Luther King Drive, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was that an integrated neighborhood in those days? Or was it...
Speaker 2: No.  It was a black neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was mostly African--no whites lived in there at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Englewood High School?
Speaker 2: Ha?
Speaker 1: What about the high school?  Was that integrated or was that--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well high school was integrated.  We--Englewood High School was all white.  And then when I started going there, blacks--African Americans were just being entered there, including me.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So about how many were in the class that you graduated with?  What would you say?  Just a guess.
Speaker 2: I don't really know.  Because in the first place I wasn't in the book.  I wasn't sure I was gonna graduate.  I was running scared.  So I didn't get in on that.  I didn't have any, nothing on that.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But I did graduate though. Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: But was the neighborhood that you--I guess I'm kind of asking was this the neighborhood [unclear]?
Speaker 2: You know--well  at 47th--around 47th is where I was working.  But I wasn't living there.  We were living someplace else.  I can't remember exactly where now.  But away from there.
Speaker 1: But that was the--you're saying that 47th Street was a real close atmosphere where people felt like family.  There on 47th Street--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  But in the area bounded by Cottage Grove, State Street, 63rd and 35th.  That was the whole area.  And they had an amusement park called White City.  It was on 63rd.  And the friend that I was telling you that I went to grammar school with, we used to go there all the time and play the rabbits and ride the rides that they had.  It was a regular amusement park.  White City was the name of it.
Speaker 1: Where was that located?
Speaker 2: 63rd and King Drive.  And 63rd was the boundary of where African Americans lived.  That's as far as they went.  There were none living any further than that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was for quite a while like that.
Story_ID: 15643
Speaker 1: So you were an apprentice at a sign shop--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: Right after high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Well it was exhilarating, it was exciting.  Because it meant that I had a job in the field that I wanted to get in almost.  Sign theme was as close as I could get.  Because as far as doing art work for ad--advertising, that was impossible.  There was not one single African American in that field at that time.  And thinking back, it never got that much better.  And just recently we had a symposium honoring the pioneers in design in the Chicago [Illinois] area.  And from the '40s [1940s] up 'til now, we had seven people on the stage. That gives you an idea of the lack of scope of African Americans in  the design field.  And one of them is dead now.  Eugene Winslow just died recently.  His name was "W-I-N-S-L-O-W" Eugene Winslow.  And he was a good artist and a good--had a--books that he illustrated and things like that.  So I'm kind of ahead of myself.  So I guess we gotta back up a little bit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  We'll back up to the sign shop.  In those days most of the  signs were painted by hand.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  All of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] There was no other way that we knew to do it.  And you know, now, that's obsolete.  Nobody does--well I shouldn't say that.  Because Vernon Guider is still--he was my original partner and he's still doing signs by hand.  And he's complaining that he's tired and he doesn't wanna do it.  But he keeps doing it day in and day out.
Speaker 1: His--is he still located in Bronzeville?
Speaker 2: No.  He lives at--he does it at his house.  And it's about in the 80s on Jeffery.  Seventies and 80s.  I don't remember the numbers.  Seventy-seven something on Jeffery [Boulevard].  And he has a shop in his basement and that's where he does the work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--what was the name of the company you worked for?  The sign shop?
Speaker 2: Oh--well you mean when I first started?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh.  The guy that ran the shop, it was his shop Mentrell "M-E-N-T-R-E-L-L" Mentrell Parker.  And he had the sign shop and I worked for him.  And then he brought his son in and his son and I worked together for his father.  And so he was a junior, Mentrell Parker Junior.

Speaker 1: When you were at Englewood [School, Chicago, Illinois] did you have any instructors or teachers who were particularly inspirational to you or trying to take any time with you at all?
Speaker 2: Not really.  In all of the things I learned in high school, I had to relearn when I got out of high school.  It wasn't that beneficial at all.  It was the wrong.  I mean it wasn't the kind of thing that you needed to sustain you in that as a business.  It was just the wrong thing.
Speaker 1: Did you really feel--did you feel a part of social life in high school when you were there?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I was in the class where--you've heard of Charles White?  There's one of his paintings right there.  Well Charles White and I were in the same art class.  And Eldzier Cortor.  His first name is "E-L-D-Z-I-E-R" Eldzier Cortor "C-O-R-T-O-R" Cortor.  Those two guys were in the class.  And there was a guy by the name of--he spelled his name "L-E" small "r" Leroy Simpson "S-I-M-P-S-O-N".  Those are the guys that I was in the class with.
Speaker 1: That's at--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] At Englewood.
Speaker 1: That's some company, Charles White.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Well he's dead now.  But he was fantastic as an artist. You know.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: You've seen his work around I'm sure.  As a matter of fact, I have twenty-seven prints of his work that I've put on exhibit.  And it was given to me by the widow [Evelyn Salk] of [Erwin A.] Bud Salk of Salk, Ward & Salk, "S-A-L-K" Ward and Salk "S-A-L-K".  That was the name of the company.  And his name was Bud Salk, Erwin Salk.  And his wife gave me different things when he died.  And right there, you see those books?  That's twenty-seven volumes of  W. E. B. DuBois.  That was given to me by his wife also.
Speaker 1: Now did you stay in touch with Charles White you know, after school?
Speaker 2: No not too much.  'Cause we were going in different directions.  I was--all of my work was mostly displays.  And nobody did displays, especially African Americans, except me.  I was in a field all by myself practically. And, of course, he was more of an illustrator.  And that's the direction that he went in.  And he did realistic things like Norman Rockwell who was also one of the guys that I admired.  And back there is one of Norman Rockwell's signed prints that's worth about $16,000 right now.
Speaker 1: So were you and Charles like friends and--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yeah.  We were good friends.  And we did a lot of things together in school.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about him or anything that's, you know--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No.  Not much.  'Cause we were both struggling  to try to get started in the field.  And so we were off on our own thing.
Speaker 1: Did he live in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No as a matter of fact, I don't know where he lived.  Yes--I'm trying to think of where I remembered him living.  Some place like 42nd and Indiana. I remember I went to his house there in that area.  And that's all I remember.  We didn't have a lot of--I don't have a lot of memories from there.  But I do remember going there to visit him.

Speaker 1: As an apprentice in the sign shop [Mentrell Parker] was the owner like a mentor to you?  Or did he show you what [unclear]--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I'll tell you, the owner was very good at what he did.  And he was not much of a teacher at all.  He didn't care.  He wanted us to just work at doing what he had to be done.  And at that time the easels that they put outside to announce what's coming at the theater, we used to take the easel which was made with wallboard, wash those things off, repaint it and put more messages on there.  Our job was to wash the easels and get them ready to be laid out and lettered.  And then we did lettering for both the Savoy [Ballroom] and the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois].  So I learned how to make layouts and banners and posters and that sort of thing from him.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: He's changing the tape I think.
Speaker 1: No, we're still rolling.
Speaker 2: Not yet.  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh alright.
Speaker 1: I thought he might stop for the train.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In--so you're an apprentice at the sign shop.  While you were working the sign shop, I know you were involved with the Regal Theater things--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh what happened is we got the client--I mean I should say Parker.  It was Parker's client to do the Regal Theater.  And then he hired a guy by the name of Williams who was a sign painter.  And we did the actual work.  And all he did was kind of supervise what we did.  And then we started doing work in the basement of the Regal, which was under the stage of the theater.  And so finally we left Parker and just the two of us were doing all of the sign work for the Regal Theater in the basement of the Regal.
Speaker 1: So the two of you were new and--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] The two of us took over the client.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: You and who else?
Speaker 2: Williams was his name.
Speaker 1: Oh you and Williams.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And did you get a chance to work while the shows were going on upstairs [chuckle]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sometimes the moves would go on in the stage show.  And I'd just walk upstairs and I was on--backstage watching the show.  Big bands--oh it was a great experience.  Unbelievable experience.
Speaker 1: So you all were painting signs under the stage and you'd get a chance to go out and meet some of the stars and--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I did, yeah.  He was not sociable like that at all.  He just did his job and that was it.  And at that time, we met another guy who did gold leaf work which is totally different than what we were doing.  And his name was Nat "N-A-T" Taylor.  Nat Taylor.  Nat Taylor was the top gold leaf man. Couldn't think of anybody that would work better than him.  He was an expert.
Story_ID: 15646
Speaker 1: Can you explain what gold leaf work is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In other words, gold leaf is pure gold that comes in sheets and in a book.  And there's a brush, a gold leaf brush that you pick it up from the book with.  In order to get the static electricity, you wipe the brush across your scalp.  And that gave you the electrical field to lift that leaf up to put it on glass or whatever you were doing.  Now glass signs were done from the back.  In other words, you would be working on a window on the inside.  But the sign was read from out in the street.  And when you put the gold leaf on, it would adhere to the glass, and then you would back it up with paint and rub all the excess off.  And so that the letters would remain on the glass.  If that's understandable the way I'm explaining it.  And then there was silver leaf.  And the difference between the two I found out by doing it in failing to do what I had to do.  In other words, what would happen is you would put this gold leaf on the window and do a pounce pattern.  And that's spelled "P-O-U-N-C-E" pounce  pattern.  You had a little thing that was about like a fountain pen and it had a wheel on the tip.  And when you drew--when you took the paper, sign paper and you pulled the line, it would perforate that line, so that the charcoal dust would go through that.  And that was the pattern that you used to do your gr--your leaf work.  And you would pounce that pattern onto the gold that you had put on the glass.  And then you could back it up with the paint, and you took all the excess off with cotton.  You know.  That's the way that was done.  Now what I didn't--never understood really I thought silver leaf would do the same thing.  It didn't work.  You couldn't see through silver leaf.  So if you put it on there, you had to have the layout--just put the layout on top.  You couldn't see through the glass at all.  But gold leaf you could see right through.
Speaker 1: It's a lot thinner than the silver.  Oh, what other kind of things were you learning, can you think of any other--?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: I'm sure you learned a lot during this time period.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  I learned how to make all kinds of signs.  And some were watercolor; some were done with oil paint.  It depended on which--if you were doing a sign that was gonna go outside, most of the time you'd do it with oil paint rather than watercolor.  Posters like cardboard were done with watercolors mostly.  And those were the two mediums that you worked in.
Story_ID: 15647
Speaker 1: Who were your clients primarily for this kind of work?
Speaker 2: Well the banners were done for the Savoy [Ballroom] and the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois].  And then the--a lot of different sign work was done for the Regal and the easels to tell what was coming in the next two weeks.  And you had photographs on it and artwork also.
Speaker 1: Now when was it?  Now maybe I'm getting ahead.  But when was it like that you learned how to do photography? 'Cause you're a photographer as well.  Right?
Speaker 2: Most of my photographic experience was with Ebony.  I mean that's where--.
Speaker 1: But that's later on isn't it?
Speaker 2: Well actually I taught photography while I was at Ebony.  But it was just--came to me naturally.  As a photographer on how you should compose pictures and what is a good composition and what is bad.  I taught without learning it from somebody else.  I mean I--the top guy at that time was Gordon Parks.  You've heard of that name?  He was--he became a Life photographer.  I wasn't in the category with him.  I just knew photography that's all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I think you go from working in a sign shop to doing toy displays.  And how did you get involved in that?  I think you--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I guess I answered an ad that was in the paper and went to work for Goldblatt's designing toy departments.  You know, they had a department in the store that was for kids and for toys.  All of those images, I worked on that sort of thing doing the toy department itself.  The Boston--the Boston Store--.
Speaker 1: We're rolling.  Okay, the Boston Store.
Speaker 2: You heard of the Fair Store?  "F-A-I-R" Fair Store.  The Fair Store and the Boston Store were similar but different locations.  And the Boston Store was very similar to any--like Sears and some of the others.  And they needed signs and sign painters and that's what I was going after, is a job in the Boston Store.  But I never got the opportunity.  But I started as a helper in the sign shop in Goldblatt's.  And I became the Art Director of Goldblatt's, the whole chain of stores.
Speaker 1: When was this?  What time frame was this?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of what year.  It was in the--around '39 [1939].  In the '30s [1930s], '38 [1938], '39 [1939].  That's when I guess it was.
Speaker 1: So this is pretty rapid progress then, that you're making.
Speaker 2: Well I think I did what I knew how to do. You know.
Story_ID: 15648
Speaker 1: We're in 1939.  We're--you applied for a job at the Boston Store [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: The Boston Store.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: "B-O-S-T-O-N".  And it was a store similar to Sears and similar to Montgomery Ward and family type shopping.  Every--anything that you wanted to buy.  And I was excited about getting the position there.  And I stayed up all night preparing my samples, so that I'd know that I'd get that job.  And what happened, because of discrimination, and I didn't realize it at the time, but as soon as they saw me the guy said, "The position is filled."  It couldn't be filled.  Because we --you know, it was just in the paper.  The next day their ad was in the paper again.  So I knew that, that was what happened.  So I was absolutely rejected at the Boston Store.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: So then I think it was maybe a couple of weeks after that.  I wrote a letter to Goldblatt brothers and I was able to go in.  The store was right across the street from the Boston Store.  And they gave me an opportunity to meet the guy who was a display director at Goldblatt's.  His name was Ray "R-A-Y" Biachi "B-I-A-C-H-I" Ray Biachi.  And he interviewed me.  He looked at my work and he said, "We don't need anybody.  But I like your work and I like your attitude.  And I'm gonna give you a chance."  And, of course, giving me a chance was giving all of us a chance.  Because at that time, there were no African Americans in that field whatsoever.  I was by myself in it for years.  And so he said, "I'll give you a chance."  And I told him, "That's all I need is a chance."  So for quite a number of--couple of years I was in that sign shop as a helper.  I was not in charge of anything.  And then I worked my way up until I became Art Director of the chain of stores.  And I was in charge of all--and I created their central display department.  A system and everything was created by me.
Story_ID: 15649
Speaker 1: Now this is almost time for World War II [1929-1942].  And what were your feelings around 1940, as the war was approaching?  What were you thinking about?
Speaker 2: Well what happened, World War II was good for me, in the sense that I was able to get jobs and get into places that I wouldn't gotten into normally.  Because the guys that were doing it before were gone off to war.  So they needed somebody to do something. And if I said I was an artist.  The guy would run and embrace me almost.  You know.  So I'm just saying opportunity was really much better by that being the case.  And I was supposed to go to the Navy.  But I didn't go.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: What happened is I went to the induction center at 4:00 in the morning.  And I don't know why they picked out the time of 4:00.  But that's what time it was.  And we went through all kinds of examinations.  And they had a line that you would stand in to say what branch of service you wanted.  And when you got up to the desk, whatever  you said, they would give you the opposite.  If you said, you wanted Navy [clap] they stamped Army on your papers.  There was a psychological reason.  And there was one guy that started jumping up and down.  He was raising sand.  Because he didn't like what he got.  So then the guy that was writing and taking the notes said, "Look Mack, I don't wanna be here either."  You know [Laughing]. It was quite hilarious.  But that's the way he did it.  And they took us in a room.  And they said, "All you men are now in the U.S. Navy.  Those of you who wish to go, you eat your breakfast and you go today.  The rest of you have sixteen days to clear up all your business."  And I didn't wanna go anyway.  So I took the sixteen days.  And that's how that came about.  And I kept waiting and waiting.  And pretty soon I said, "Why should I wait for these guys?  I'll--I'm not gonna wait any longer."  And sure enough, I never heard another word.  So I didn't go.  That's why I didn't go to the Army.
Speaker 1: So did you consider yourself lucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I sure did.  I sure did.  And I as I said, it sort of gave me an opportunity to do work that I never would've done before.
Story_ID: 15650
Speaker 1: What sort of opportunities did open up for you [because of World War II]?  I mean wha--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] There was a company that did booklets that you had to write and subscribe to.  And they made illustrations that you could cut out and paste into an ad.  Well I made the illustrations that went on to that original book.  And it was--the name of that company was Meyer-Both "M-E-Y-E-R, B-O-T-H" was the second name.  Meyer-Both.  And they made these clip-art books and I did the illustrations for the clip-art.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  You also did some work for Hearst newspapers I think?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh I did a drawing for--no.  What happened was I did an airbrush illustration and I set up a system.  Then I would mail it to different publishers. And then when they rejected it, and they sent me a rejection letter, I would look in my file and send it to another one.  I kept sending it over and over.  And I finally sold the illustration to King Features Syndicate.  "K-I-N-G" Features Syndicate.  And they sold it to the Hearst chain.  And they used it in the inner magazine section  of their  newspaper and it went all over the country.  All over the  United States, that one illustration.  And that was on the cover.  I can remember it just--it was in 1944.  That's the date that I did that '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: What was the subject matter?
Speaker 2: It was a little guy coming down like the New Year's guy.  And he said, "I'll bring our boys back."  And it had 1944 within, you know, mixed in the design.
Speaker 1: So it was related to the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then in the background you could see a paratrooper coming down with a parachute also.  And it was an airbrush illustration. But it was done in a design theme.  It wasn't realistic at all.  'Cause that--I worked in a design mode all the time.
Story_ID: 15651
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with Johnson Publishing Company?  I think this is about 19--this is the late '40s [1940s] right?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  Well what happened is--I'm trying to think of how I--oh.  I got tired of working at Goldblatt's.  That's what it was.  And that was during the war [World War II, 1939-1945].  I got tired of doing the white sales and different things.  We would just change the copy a little bit and you weren't doing any creative work at all.  So I wanted to get into something else.  And I wanted to get some--into something that would keep me in 4F instead of 1A.  And classification with 1A was you got drafted and you went to war.  4F meant that you were essential to somebody's business and you--they couldn't draft you.  So I was a 4F at Goldblatt's because I was running that whole system.  And so I wanted to look for another job in 4F and I looked and I looked.  Couldn't really find anything much.  And finally, I found a job doing punchboards.  Have you ever--you know what a punchboard is?  A punchboard is--I don't see them around any more.  But it was a board with an illustration on it.  And you punched out a number that came out of the back.  And you could win a prize when you opened it up.  Or sometime--most of the time you got two or three pieces of candy or something.  But you had to pay for that--to get the thing out of the board.  And they had different designed boards and different classifications.  And I did the designs for that.  And I can't remember the  name of  the company.  But it was owned by a guy by the name of [George D.] Sax, "S-A-X" Sax.  He built the Saxony Hotel.  He also owned and opened the first drive-in bank in Chicago [Illinois] which was Exchange National Bank.  And Exchange is "E-X-C-H-A-N-G-E--"G". Let's see, Exchange.  Exchange.
Speaker 1: We got it.  That's okay.
Speaker 2: Exchange National Bank.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what happened with Johnson?  Did John Johnson come and talk to you?  Or did--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] He came--Nah.  That's what I was about to tell you.  I le--I wanted to leave Goldblatt's.  And I decided what I would do is open an office at 47th.  And I went into a partnership arrangement with Vernon Guider at 47th Street.  And Johnson came to my office to talk me into working for him.  That's how that came about.  And I told him I'd decide--I'd have  to think about it.  And then I decided I would work for him three hours a day.  And I worked for a company called Consolidated Manufacturing Company that made those punchboards.  Consolidated. And that was owned by Sax--Erwin Sax [sic].
Speaker 1: So you did both jobs at the same time.
Speaker 2: Within a six hour period, yeah.  Um-hmm.  And I still had a couple of hours for myself.  And that worked out pretty good.  And you know what Johnson said?  I remember it vividly.  He said, "I would rather have somebody work for me three hours that knows what they're doing than have somebody work eight hours that is in the learning process."  I remember him telling me that.  I also remember one of the artists that's still with him now that's been with him for fifty years. Herbert Temple is the Art Director at Ebony.  And his name is "T-E-M-P-L-E" Temple.  Johnson told Temple, "Nobody will ever do what Winbush did.  Nobody."  In other words, he wouldn't allow that to happen.  But he did respect my ability and me as a person.  Johnson and I were never real good friends.  We were together every day.  But not--just on a working basis.  We were never close friends.
Speaker 1: And what kind of person was John Johnson?
Speaker 2: Well he was--.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Is John Johnson?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well he was friendly, liked telling jokes and things like that.  But generally speaking.  I mean a one-on-one thing he was not for at all.  And when we'd get in a meeting and I would come up with a plan, he never did like what I was--wanted.  We never saw eye-to-eye.  I wanted him to start a savings plan for the employees.  He wouldn't do that.  And he just-- everything I thought of he would wanna go the other way.  Because I told him, I said, "Why won't you sometimes put a story in about somebody white or Latino like Life magazine does."  His answer to me was, "Then I'd be competing with Life."  I said, "How can you compete with Life when our circulation is only 350,000 and theirs is umpteen thousand a week?"  I said, "You can--there's no comparison."  So we never saw eye-to-eye on that.  But I still even now have never seen him do a story on anybody except African Americans.  Totally African American.  My thinking was totally different.  I said, "If they do it like you, there would never be a black guy in Life magazine."  Right?  That's the way I saw it.  And [chuckle] that's the way I see it now.  And I've never been reared that color conscious.  What I mean by that, I operated as a person the way you're supposed to operate.  And I was fortunate enough to be able to do that.  Like when I was Art Director of Goldblatt's I never thought about color.  I thought about getting the job done.  And, of course, I was reminded many times.  But then that's the way it happened.
Story_ID: 15652
Speaker 1: What specific things did you do for [John] Johnson that we would recognize I mean in terms of art?
Speaker 2: Oh the whole layout of a magazine.  You know, I'd lay out the pictures and where everything was gonna--where the ads were gonna be.  And with each issue of the lay of the magazine was a different layout.  And my job was to see that they got done.  And one other--for a while there were two or three other artists in the Art Department besides me.  But I was the Art Director.  And I would come in work my three hours and leave.  You know.
Speaker 1: And could--so you were responsible for design of Ebony and [unclear] and all that?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, right.  I did that.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So you were the first Art Director at--with them.
Speaker 2: I was the first Art Director.  Right.
Speaker 1: Jet as well as for--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I'm sure that I did.  There're many a days I look back and find magazines in sto--you know, with my name in it as Art Director.  And I remember when we did Tan Confessions.  A magazine called Tan Confessions, and then what did we do?  A magazine called Copper [Romance] and Jet.  All three of those were launched at the same time I think.  And whenever somebody would come out with a magazine, he'd come out with one similar with another name.  Knock them out of the box because they didn't have distributing possibilities or anything.
Story_ID: 15653
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other artists and photographers that Ebony and Jet and Tan [Confessions]?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well there was a guy by the name of [David] Jackson who was the main photographer.  And a guy by the name of Sutton "S-U-T-T-O-N" Sutton may--I think he may still be with the magazine.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Isaac Sutton.
Speaker 2: Isaac Sutton.  And there's another guy that I can't remember his name.  But then they used mostly freelance photographers.  They worked along with me and along with the editors of the magazine.  And I can't think of--there was a guy here recently.  They just had an exhibit of his work, a white guy.  But it was one of the photographers.  I can't think of his name now.
Speaker 1: What was the toughest thing about working for [John H.] Johnson?  And what was the best thing about working for Johnson?
Speaker 2: Well there was no worst.  I enjoyed doing it.  Because working with the people was like another family.  That was just enjoyable. And then getting along with Ben Burns  was the next thing.  That was the Ebony part.  You know, he was a driver.  You had to really produce to work with him.  And that's the one thing that I learned from Ben Burns is the development of the capacity to do a lot of work.  You can do more if you just do it.  And it takes some ingenuity to put it together.  And to have that capacity, you develop the capacity.  You're not born with it, you develop it.
Speaker 1: Now Ben Burns was what?
Speaker 2: He was the Executive Editor of the Ebony.
Story_ID: 15654
Speaker 1: You worked for them how long?
Speaker 2: I was with Ebony for ten years I think.  I left there in about 1960, '59 [1959], '60 [1960].  Something like that.  And they did a story about me called "The Banker of Barnum Row."  And that was about 1958.
Speaker 1: The Barnum of Banker Row?
Speaker 2: 1958.  And I don't think that there's anybody that ever had a story written about them with Ebony that worked at Ebony.  I can't remember a soul except me.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I guess the excitement of what I was doing at the time warranted a story.  Somebody talked them into doing it.  He didn't do it on his own.  But they did do it.
Speaker 1: Now what was the story about?  Something about your activities on LaSalle Street [Chicago, Illinois] or--?
Speaker 2: No it was about me establishing a business with employees and a building and our own truck and servicing all the banks with displays.  And I had the article.  I'm trying to think of what I did with it to give you.  And I don't know what I did with it.
Speaker 1: We got it.
Speaker 2: Oh you got it.  Oh.  Well it says in there what it's all about.
Speaker 1: We're trying to--okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Alright.  The story was nicely done.  It was called the "Barnum of Banker's Row."  And it explained exactly how I realized that banks needed advertising and I supplied it.  There had never been a display on LaSalle Street.  I put the first display on LaSalle Street, and the year was 1947.  I'm sure of that.  Because Wright Institute just did a story about it.  And that was the first display that went on LaSalle Street for American National Bank.  And then I started developing display themes for all of the banks.  And at one time I did all the banks and the savings and loans.  At the same time.
Speaker 1: Now Mr. Winbush, were other banks in other cities using display advertisement at all?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So let me get this straight.  You're saying then that you were the first.
Speaker 2: I was the first one to do financial displays.  And I was the financial display person.  And I didn't even think about anybody doing it anyplace else.
Speaker 1: Now this is important.  This is your idea too.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nobody came to you and said, "I need a--."
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No, no, no.
Speaker 1: "Why don't we do this?  Why don't we have bank displays?"
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You thought of it.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I walked up and down LaSalle Street and couldn't find anything.  And I started the display field on LaSalle Street.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Here's what happened.  When I worked for American National Bank, they were my first client as a bank client.  I worked with a guy by the name of Robert Lindquist "L-I-N-D-Q-U-I-S-T" Bob Lindquist.  And Lindquist was a Vice President at American National.  He moved to LaSalle National Bank.  And every time he moved, he took me with him.  And that's how I got LaSalle Street.  Because of Lindquist.  Then he moved from LaSalle Street, LaSalle National Bank to Harris Trust [and Savings Bank].  I picked up Harris Trust.  Every time he moved, I moved.  And when  I was telling you about Exchange National Bank being the first drive-in, it just happened that I worked for [George D.] Sax who owned Exchange Bank, Ba--National Bank.  So that became my client also.  And I just kept picking up clients.  And then I took the guys who worked for me and we established a business called Winbush Associates.
Story_ID: 15655
Speaker 1: What I'm hearing then is you're creating your own work.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you are sort of the pioneer businessman as well as an artist.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And were there any black agencies that--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Not at that time.  There was nothing.  Not in the whole United States.  And again, I keep telling people, I probably was the first corporate art director in the country.  I can make that statement.  'Cause there was nobody.  I was just by myself.
Speaker 1: So you kept up with--you kept track of the people you worked for and names and who they were associated with to try to make those connections pay off that you--.
Speaker 2: I didn't get your question.
Speaker 1: No well, it's just a comment.  But you were saying--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh.
Speaker 1: You kept track of the connections that people had.  Like the guys who had the connections--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh as far as the guy that went from one bank to the other.  Oh we were close friends.  So when he went to--from one bank to the other, he needed displays.  And he wasn't gonna go get somebody else and he got me.  And then when he went to Harris [Trust and Savings Bank], I picked up Harris because of him.  So that's three clients right there that I got because of just that one man.
Speaker 1: And [George D.] Sax was associated with Exchange [National] Bank and so you got that bank.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was already working for him, but with another company though.  He owned both of the companies.  And he thought that because he was paying me from the one company, that he didn't have to pay me for doing Exchange.  But that's where he made a big mistake.  We worked it out.  But then I had to explain that it was two separate things.
Speaker 1: Now did you play a role in the establishment of the black ad agency here in the city [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Not really, no.  Because what happened is that came about by guys doing ads in Ebony and realizing that if white agencies can do ad like that, then we should be able to do it.  And then you had [Tom] Burrell and some of the other people that got into advertising.  And there was a guy that lived at 62nd and Green Street where I lived at one time.  A block from Halsted and a block from 63rd.  I lived there for quite a while.  And this guy start--I interested him in advertising.  And he got into it.  And he interested his cousin in advertising.  That's how it all started.  And they started these black agencies.
Story_ID: 15656
Speaker 1: I was asking you about some of the other Chicago, [Illinois] artists and the development of the  of some of those artists  in terms of their putting together ad agencies and working together on projects.  We were talking about Jay Jackson of the [Chicago] Defender.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you--Did you have  any association with the Defender at all  with all the ad work--?
Speaker 2: No.  I never did much for them at all. There was a guy in town by the name of David Ross, "R-O-S-S".  David Ross was an opportunist.  [chuckle] I say that because at--that's what he was.  I mean he was trying to put things together at the South Side Community Art Center [Chicago, Illinois].  He was there for a while.  And we--he liked to do--consider himself as an advertising person.  And David Ross had me do a cover design for the music festival that was at the [White] Sox [Comiskey] Park.  I can't think of the year that, that was.  But it was a booklet, an eight and a half by eleven.  And I did a wheel coming out of the park like a baseball and that was the cover design that I did.  And then there were different--there were a lot of different things sprouting up and trying to get started.  Like one of the dentists.  His wife started a magazine.  And I think she got me to do a cover or something.  Like that.  You know, there was just--I'm trying to think of names.  But the name doesn't come to me.
Speaker 1: Well now you were talking about Jay Jackson of the Defender a little while ago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you know him?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were good friends.  Close friends.  But we never did any work together.  It was just that we were friendly.  And I still someplace have it.  I still have a couple of his things in my warehouse someplace.
Speaker 1: You mentioned the South Side Community  Art Center.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I was its President at one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when did South Side Community Art Center start?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I know it was right--it was during the time that the WPA [Works Progress Administration]  came on the scene.  About '39 [1939].  1939.  And Mrs. Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt was instrumental in helping getting South Side Community Art Center started.  And it was Margaret Burroughs.  She was the one that started that art center.  She also started the DuSable Museum [of African American History and Culture] in her house in her front  room.  And I knew her when she was married to [Bernard] Goss.  Her name was--last name was Goss "G-O-S-S"  Margaret Burroughs--well Goss Burroughs.  She married [Charles] Burroughs after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were you active in the South Side Community Art Center [unclear]?
Speaker 2: What happened is I became President of the South Side Community Art Center and I was still with Ebony.  And I would go by the art center and check everything out and then go from there to  Ebony every day.  And I had a secretary there and everything.
Speaker 1: And was Charles White still in town then?
Speaker 2: I don't remember him being in town then.  No.  I remember the other guy Cortor.  'Cause he used to hang out all night with me and joke about, "Ha, ha, ha.  It's daylight again."  You know.  He was a funny guy.  I had a lot of fun with him.  And he was an excellent painter also.  The two paintings you see on the bottom there, that's Eldzier Cortor.  That's his work.
Story_ID: 15657
Speaker 1: You just mentioned your social life.  You know.  You had some social life when you were working under the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] .  And I guess you always had some social life.  But what did you--what did you do to enjoy yourself?
Speaker 2: Well I went to a lot of parties.  You know.  People--students would--we were in school together.  They liked to have parties.  And that's where I met a lot of people.  Because that's all there was to do.  Well you couldn't go anyplace.  It was all just house parties.  That was about it.  And I remember I met some other people too like--I remember--if you ever remember a guy by the name of Austin Powell, "P-O-W-E-L-L" Austin Powell.
Speaker 1: What [unclear]?
Speaker 2: He had a group called The Cats and the Fiddle.  And they played at 51st Street and--I think Michigan [Avenue].  It was a place called the Pioneer Lounge.  That's where they played.  They were really good.  And when the Mills Brothers first came out, it was a lot of groups that came up.  I had one called the Melody Mixers.  And Eddy Johnson, Jimmy Jones and I had a trio.  And Eddy Johnson is a saxophonist.  Have you heard of him?
Speaker 1: I think so.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well he plays tenor sax.  And he was the other member of the trio.  And there was--.
Speaker 1: They were patterned after the Mills Brothers?
Speaker 2: Similar.  Wasn't the same but similar.  And we sang at the World's Fair in 1934.  I remember that specifically.  'Cause the fair was '33 [1933] and we were there the year after that.  We sang at the Swift Bandshell.  Swift and Company with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and it was exciting.  We would sing--it was a body of water between us and the audience.  And you could hear that playback when you--the sound would go out, you could hear it bounce back.  It's exciting.  Exciting period.
Speaker 1: And you were in high school then.  Right, in '34 [1934]?  Right?  Or are you talking about--you're talking about another year?
Speaker 2: No.  Let's see in '30 [1930]--yeah I was still in school.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And here this great thing had happened.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah.  And we'd go to school.  They'd say, "We heard you last night."  You know.  Yeah.  I was still in school.
Story_ID: 15658
Speaker 1: Now when did you meet your wife?  Your first wife.
Speaker 2: At one of the parties I was talking about.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And we saw each other, liked each other and got married.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Henrietta.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And my second wife's name was Frances.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And we were married seven years the first time.  And I had to go visit my wife, 'Cause she had--there was a Tuberculosis Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] at the end of the car line.  The streetcar line.  Go all the way out to the end of the line--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Is this south or north?
Speaker 2: North.  North.  And I'd go visit her  twice a week.  I was at Goldblatt's then.  I'd go twice a week to visit her and take care of my stepdaughter that I had at that time. And then when she died, I married Frances.  And we were married for over thirty years.  Great.  It was really a great marriage and, you know, I enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 15659
Speaker 1: You had a pretty full life with all the [unclear].
Speaker 2: Definitely.  There's no--I just jammed everything in it that I could jam in it.  And that's the way it turned out.  You know. And the other thing was always--even now I have the what should I say?  The desire for learning new things.  It's just like right now I'm getting into digital technology and I wanna get into trying to put together technology with creativity.  'Cause the creativity is what's missing right now.  People do things without knowing what they're doing.  And they gotta almost relearn the sequence of things.  So I'm working on that.  Plus I'm writing a book of my life.
Story_ID: 15660
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about the Art Directors [and Copy Writers] Club of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The what?
Speaker 1: The Art Directors Club of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, definitely.  I had the desire to join the Art Directors Club of Chicago, because it was a prestigious group and it symbolized a peak that you might get by being an artist and an illustrator.  And I wanted to belong to it.  And I couldn't get in it.  They gave me all kinds of id--you know, excuses.  None of them meant anything.  Because it just meant that there were prejudices, you know.  And I couldn't get in it.  And it took me seven years to become a member of the Art Directors Club of Chicago.  And I met a guy by the name of Jones who sponsored me and got another--you had to have two sponsors.  So he got someone else to work with him and they sponsored my membership in the Art Directors Club.  And then we published a booklet that--about the Art Directors Club.  I think it came out every two months or something like that.  I became one of the editors of that booklet.  And I got a chance to do work on that.  And I became Treasurer, Vice President and ultimately President of the Art Directors Club.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: And all they can remember is, I was one fine president.  That's all.  There was no racial thing that I got into there with this.  That's the way I operated, as a person.  You know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You're also part of the national--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh there in the--.
Speaker 1: The National.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well--.
Speaker 1: [unclear].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What happened is I was already at that time President of the Art Directors Club of Chicago.  And I flew with the president who was before me to St. Louis [Missouri] to participate in the National Society of Art Directors of which I became Treasurer.
Speaker 1: Now these are the art directors of the top agencies--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah, absolutely.
Speaker 1: In the United States.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.
Speaker 1: [unclear].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Let me--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] And I have an interesting story right there on this Art Directors Club thing.  The guy who was--who was the president ahead of me, he and I flew in his private plane from here.  Chicago to St. Louis [Missouri].  And while we were about halfway, he asked me if I had ever flown a plane before.  His name was Herb Pinzke, "P-I-N-Z-K-E" Herbert Pinzke.  And I said, "No.  I've never flown a plane before."  He said, "Put your feet here."  He showed me where to put my feet.  "And you do this.  And I want you to keep at 3000 feet."  He said, "How does that feel?"  I said, "Great."  "Okay, [clapping hands] you got it."  Just like that.  And I was flying the plane.  And then after about half hour or so, he said, "Where are you going?"  I said, "I'm going to St. Louis."  He said, "Like heck."  That ain't the word he used.  But he said, "You're on your way to Jamaica.  Turn this plane around."  [Laughing] So I had to turn the plane around and start in another direction.  Then finally we hit St. Louis.  And I was able when they put us on hold because they--we had to fly in a holding pattern.  Because two jets were taking off in front of us.  And that was a real sight to see, jets taking off at that vantage point.  Here you're up in the air looking down at jets coming up into the airspace.  A wonderful experience of which I had many.  That was just one of them.
Story_ID: 15661
Speaker 1: What do you think is the most rewarding aspect of being an artist and designer?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well the thing that was exciting to me, number one. To become President of the Art Directors [and Copy Writers] Club of Chicago.  And the people I met and the things that happened as a result of that.  For example, I had one of my friends to call me, and said, "I need help at the Art Institute [of Chicago, Illinois]."  And I started teaching at the Art Institute where I taught for four years as an assistant professor.  That never would've happened without this Art Directors Club thing.  And that was one of the rewards of being a member.  And there was a lot of other things.  In other words, you were there all the time meeting with people and they needed different things.  They may need an art director. They needed special projects.  And you were there to fulfill a need.  And that's how that came about.  So it was wonderful being a part of it.
Speaker 1: And you continue to design and develop projects now.  Right?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I would do much of that. I could do it.  And it's just that I have to decide what direction I wanna go in.  Because I have--I don't know.  I'm kind of a funny guy to the extent that I get excited about something and do it for a while.  Then it's no longer interesting and then I gotta go on to something else.  And so I became an underwater photographer.  I've done a lot of--had my work shown all over, of underwater photography.  And I still do it.  But not as much as I used to.  And I have to decide, "Is that the direction I wanna go in?"  Right now I could stop designing and don't ever design anything and just do underwater photography.  And shoot excellent things and bring them back here and put them into lithography and market them.  And spend every other month in a different place shooting pictures underwater.  But I haven't reached that point yet.  I still like some of the other things I'm doing.
Story_ID: 15662
Speaker 1: Now how did you get involved in scuba diving?  I know if you shoot underwater you gotta scuba dive then.
Speaker 2: Well what happened is I became President of the scuba club at Lawson [YMCA, Young Men's Christian Association].  I was their president for fifteen years.  And we had--and we had--we had a meeting--I mean we had an election every year, and I was there for fifteen years.
Speaker 1: I wanna go back a little further.
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: To when you tried to learn how to swim.  That was a big story.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh.
Speaker 1: The first time you and Vernon Guider--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  But that--what happened is we were at Wabash YMCA.  And I do a lot of work with the YMCA 'cause I was interested in basketball.  I developed a team that was sponsored by one of the companies I worked for.  Consolidated [Manufacturing Company], they sponsored one of my teams.  And I was with the Y all the time.  So Gleason was gonna take on teaching me how to swim.  So this one particular day he said, "I'll tell you what.  If you jump in the deep end of the pool, swim down to the shallow end, I'll buy your breakfast."  So I took this beautiful dive and then started up.  And then when my feet started falling down--I wasn't kicking or anything.  I just panicked.  And he had to pull me out at the half-way point of the pool.  So I didn't make it to the end.  And I missed the breakfast.  So that was a total disaster.  And I had made out--made up my mind, "I'm gonna just forget--I'm not gonna learn how to swim."  And then I met the guy who was the aquatic director at Lawson YMCA.  Lawson is "L-A-W-S-O-N" Lawson.  And I met a guy who was at that time the Aquatic Director at Lawson.  And he took a real interest in teaching me how to swim, which was very difficult.  His name was Leo Darwit, "D-A-R-W-I-T".  He did everything.  He put inner tubes on my legs [laughing], and he had me holding on to things.  Oh!  He had to try everything to get me to learn how to swim.  Finally my first thing was learning to do the basic backstroke.  He taught me that.  So finally I went to him.  I said, "Look I gotta know something besides the back stroke."  And then he started teaching me free style.  And he's the guy that I attribute my learning how to swim and my whole scuba career I would say I attribute to him.  He and I traveled to Jamaica together and that's how close we were.  And I owe all of my swimming things to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And once you learned how to swim, you took it one step further. Am I right?
Speaker 2: Well once I learned how to swim, I study--you know, we had the scuba class there at the Y, and I became the president of the class.  Of the scuba class.  And that's how I got into scuba in the first place.
Speaker 1: Now have you received any notoriety for your scuba diving?
Speaker 2: Oh, I won awards in scuba.  And--see that plaque up on the wall over there?  Those are--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Laughing] No.
Speaker 1: [Laughing].
Speaker 2: You can't see it from there.
Speaker 1: I can't see it.
Speaker 2: But anyway I have--I won diver of the year, YMCA  diver of the year. And also I have one there that tells about me being president for fifteen years. And I've become what I would say nationally known because of Our World Underwater.  I was one of the originators of Our World Underwater.  And Harry Shanks is the other part of it.  And I handled all of the public relations for Our World Underwater.
Story_ID: 15663
Speaker 1: Now what is Our World Underwater?
Speaker 2: It's a seminar.  A two-day affair where people have booths, sell equipment, have different kinds of study groups.  Like--well we could say, "If you wanna learn how to--."  Well anything you wanted to learn in scuba you could learn at the two-day conference.  If there's any new techniques in diving, it was presented at that conference.  And underwater photography, camera companies, they had exhibits there.  They still do.  And they try to sell programs from there.  And then they have a film festival, underwater film festival that's sometimes with slides and sometimes with 16mm and different methods of shooting.  And we have people that we feature like Jean-Michel Cousteau was one of the featured people.  Not this year, but last year when I received the award from Our World Underwater, Jean-Michel Cousteau was on the stage with me.
Speaker 1: So this is not just a local event?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh it's international.
Speaker 1: So here you're being honored as an internat--as a local scuba diver or--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Nah.  It was internationally.
Speaker 1: Who else was--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Well Our World Underwater is all over--people come from every place, all over the world to attend Our World Underwater.  It's a weekend festival and a film festival besides.  And then they have a booth that takes care of dry suits, one that features wet suits, one for--different things. And there's different diving organizations that come on those particular two days.
Speaker 1: So I just wanna make this clear that you are the cofounder--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Of Our World Underwater.
Speaker 1: Our World Underwater.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it's international.
Speaker 2: Now it's owned by a guy.  They sold it to a guy Pat Hammer "H-A-M-M-E-R" just like the hammer that you use.  He is now the owner of Our World Underwater.  But out of it came the Our World Underwater Scholarship Society.  Where we awarded a $10,000 scholarship to a college student interested in oceanography.  And we later upped it to about $15,000 to a student.  And they are able to pursue careers in diving.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  This is important.  And--.
Speaker 2: Now I am a--still a board member of the Scholarship Society.  I still belong to that in narrative.  I'm not, you know, an active voting member.  But I'm still on the board.
Speaker 1: This is the same group that honored Lloyd Bridges and Jacque Cousteau and--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.  That little booklet that you saw, that explains about Our World Underwater.  It's got everything in it. And then it's got the student that received the award this year to study with famous people who are in oceanography.  And it's usually sponsored by a watch company.  You know.
Story_ID: 15664
Speaker 1: Your encounter with the 160 pound shark, can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh.  What happened is that shark was caught by a friend of mine.  I wouldn't cat--I was with him when he caught it.  We were fishing for just fish and caught the shark.  And we had to shoot the shark.  Because he was not quite dead yet.  And so we did.  And  rather than just dump him off the boat, I took--brought the shark and stuffed him.  And I have it in my warehouse right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so where did this happen?
Speaker 2: That was in Islamorada, Florida.
Story_ID: 15665
Speaker 1: Your role in a movie called 'Bog.'  Can you say that name and spell it for us and tell us what it is?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was this movie made.  The name of it is 'Bog,' "B-O-G," 'Bog.'  And the name of it--why it's named 'Bog' is we were solving a monster that lived in a Bog Lake.  And that's how that came about to have that name.  My job was to look for the monster, which I found and got killed by the monster.  I have the movie, a copy of the movie.  And, of course, it's kind of hilarious.  But it was a real movie and it was quite a thing to be in a real movie. And it was shot in Wisconsin.  Because the story takes place in a small Wisconsin town.  So why build a set when we rented everything at this--we rented the police station.  And that was the headquarters in Wisconsin.  So we just rented everything.
Story_ID: 15666
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about New Year's Day--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh.
Speaker 1: And the significance of the New Year's Day--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yeah. Alright. The New Year's Day Dive was conceived quite by accident. We were at a New Year's Eve party and it was 4:00 in the morning and this guy, Keith Cassello, "C-A-S-S-E-L-L-O" that's how you spelled Cassello's last name. He said, "Hey, Why don't we go diving now?" And I said, "Four o'clock in the morning! Hell yeah!"  "Well let's go." So three of us, he and another guy and I decided that was a good idea. We went home, got our stuff and we went diving in the lake [Lake Michigan]. And that's been twenty-five years ago that we did it the first time. And it's become traditional. And last year--this year I put seventy-four divers in the water. Now I structured and ran that whole thing for every one of those dives, even this one. I didn't get in the water this time because of the medicine I was taking. But I put it together; made it work and I got an 8 x 8 picture in the [Chicago] Sun-Times [Chicago, Illinois]. And everybody covered it. And if you can get full coverage while all the ball games are going on and everything that's going on, you gotta know what you're doing. And I feel that I know what I'm doing. And I know how to get that done. Everybody was there. The other important thing was we used to do this dive at Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois] all the time. And one of my divers called me and he's on the Coast Guard. He says, "You can't dive at Navy Pier anymore." I said, "Why not?" "Security. Can't dive there." So I had to move the whole operation into the Shedd Aquarium, which I like even better. Better place, better vantage point, parking, everything was a thousand times better. And so from now on that's where it's gonna be, at the Shedd Aquarium. And so I actually structured, put it together, create the thing for the media, give them the information and check on the day before the dive to be sure that they get there. And that's what you gotta do. It's an eyeball-to-eyeball type thing. And if you don't know how to do it, you send a release goes in file thirteen. Forget about it [chuckling].
Story_ID: 15667
Speaker 1: You play the guitar too.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I play guitar, play at the guitar [chuckling].
Speaker 1: At the guitar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So--.
Speaker 2: Oh. I've always wanted to play guitar. And like many other things in my social activities I run into people and things that I like to do. And the guy that I started taking lessons with, we were on a boat--cruise and he was playing with a group on the boat. And I went over and introduced myself and ask him if he gave private lessons. His name was Dave Baney,  B-A-N-E-Y". He said, "Yeah." He said, "Then once I sign you up I don't want any clowning around. Be there and you gotta be there for each lesson." So I took lessons with him for quite awhile. And he taught me a lot. But then here again I'd reached a point where, "I want to do something else." You know. And I haven't played guitar in about--I don't know, you know, pretty soon it will be a year. And I just haven't--and I just bought a new guitar. And I plunked around a little bit but not really.  I'll play again, but I'll just have to wait until the mood strikes me, you know.
Speaker 1: You're also--you're a pretty good tennis player, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Racquetball, handball--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about some of that too?
Speaker 2: I'd say a B player. I haven't reached the A point and I probably won't by now. But at least I got to the point where I became a B player. And it felt pretty good.
Speaker 1: Do you still play?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Soon as I get--I think in about another month I'll be playing again.

Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things you've done, what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: I think it will be in art. Only because of what I've done in art, I guess. I mean I've put other people in it. I've been responsible for--when you look at the Vince Calders (ph.) and the other guy that--[Tom] Burrell--Burrell never would've been in advertising if I hadn't talked his cousin into it. And then he talked him into it. That's how he got in it. And then--let's see who else can I think of? Well most your people that you think about. This guy used to work for Coca-Cola Company and he was in the advertising department. And he got other African Americans into it. Bill Sharp is his name. "S-H-A-R-P" Bill Sharp. And he's the one that talked his cousin and all these other people into advertising.

Speaker 1: Now [Robert J.] Dale--you've heard of [R.J.] Dale Advertising [and P.R.]. Have you?
Speaker 2: Bob Dale?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I didn't even know him personally. I know he's in the advertising business. The only thing I remember doing with him is we did a Kraft promotion at the DuSable [Museum of African American History and Culture, Chicago, Illinois] that he was involved in. But I never saw the guy. I mean we did it through his agency. But I heard him on a TV show. And he was mentioning it to the commentator that, "We don't seem to be going anyplace with advertising." Partially his fault too. Do you have anybody that you're teaching? Nah. He's just talking that's all. And it's just like I said, all of the guys who have black agencies should get together. And get together with the other organizations of black designers. Have you heard of them yet? It's the Organization of Black Designers. And we can put this in here 'cause I don't mind telling how I feel about--I would never have named it black anything at this juncture. I think we've harped on that enough. Let's do something else besides that. But, of course, that's just my opinion. They'd say I was totally wrong 'cause right now they have something like 400 members. Now I don't know whose all this and whose art directors--whose what? I don't know. 'Cause I'm not really that close to them. But they're going to be involved in a meeting at the NeoCon Show that's coming up pretty soon. I think it's--I don't know.  It's probably next Saturday. I don't know.
Speaker 2: I have a question.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'm kind of confused. You said that you think that all the black agencies should get together and--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] They should--.
Speaker 2: And become a part.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] They should get together--.
Speaker 2: That they should get--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] together with--for example an organization of black designers should get together with the organization of agencies, and work together on whatever they're doing. I don't know what all they're doing. But they're not together. They're working as separate entities.
Speaker 2: Okay. So I see.  So you're saying that the black designers are not involved in the--.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] What I'm saying is the agencies are not involved with them. And they should be. A few are but not totally, not as a group. And see the thing that I look at--there was an organization called the--what were they called? It's the Four--It's the 4X or the four something.  I can't remember now. But it's advertising.  An advertising group, and this is a white organization. And then [Bill] Sharp got in it and he got other blacks in it. I don't know who's in it now or if it's still operational. I don't know. But that's the thing. They gotta try to get people in as beginners and, you know, trainees and they train people to do things.  And--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] You definitely believe in training people.
Speaker 1: Right now one of the paper companies came out with a survey that told what percentage African Americans are in the advertising field today. You know what it is? Seventeen percent. That's the percentage.  Which is nothing. And when you think of how many workers now it's a whole different thing. You don't have an art directors' club anymore. It doesn't exist anymore. Today's art director couldn't care less about anything except, "How much money can I make?" You know?
Story_ID: 15670
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's hard to say. I just want to be remembered as a design person that had a real desire in many fields to be successful in whatever I did. Whatever I did it's just me. And that's the way I look at it. And there's nothing--no one thing in particular that I like better than the other. I just do it and then I go on to something else. And like the story that they wrote at the Art Institute [of Chicago, Illinois] newspaper--it says, "Designed for four decades" or something like that. I can't remember the title. They did a very good story. And it was a question and answer thing like we're doing right now.
Story_ID: 15671
Speaker 1: Did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: My mother [Alberta Mebane Winbush] a little bit. But not my father [Leroy Winbush Sr.]--I never did much around my father. My mother knew about me being at Goldblatt's. And she knew about some other things I did and I would share a project. She knew about me as a designer. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents see you?
Speaker 2: No. Uh-uh. No. When I was with my grandparents I hadn't even thought about becoming an art director. That was way back then. You know, I worked in a grocery store at 40th and Indiana [Chicago, Illinois]. And the guy's name was Wills, "W-I-L-L-S". Right now if you go by there, there's a little store that has become a restaurant right at what used to be the El track. And that store was about oh I guess about five times as big as this room. It was real small. It's still--that building is still there. And I went in to--this is a funny part.  You gotta write it.  I went in there to ask for a job. And he asked me, "Do you know how to dress chickens?" And I said, "Yeah." So he took the apron and put on me and doubled it up and tied it in the back. 'Cause I was pretty small. And took me in the back room. "This is your area right here." And he got these crates of chickens that he sold. And I'm sitting back there by myself hoping that nobody buys a chicken [chuckling]. Which is [chuckling] impossible. So pretty soon a lady comes in and they introduce each other and she says, "I think I want a nice fat hen." And I said, "Here we go." So he takes the hen. And weighs the hen. And waits on the lady. Puts her name on a tag and on the foot of the chicken and feeds the chicken to me. And sit it right up--and the chicken and I looked at each other for about ten minutes [chuckling]. You know. And finally I took the chicken out in the back in the shed. I had the knife in one hand and the chicken in the other. And the guy came out and said, "You don't know how to dress chickens. But I'm gonna show you." He showed me how to kill the chicken and how to do everything else. And I used to do like fifty chickens a day. So that was my only real job. I never--I haven't done a lot of work with jobs with people very much. It's always been in my own field, you know, mostly.
Speaker 1: Okay. What would your--what do you think your parents would say about the life that you lived?
Speaker 2: I think my mother would be elated. And my grandfather I could remember he would also. My grandmother I don't think that the scope of her learning was enough to appreciate it. She would if she knew about it. But she had no way of being exposed to it. And it's one of those things. It's just like I can show you ads where things that are done, and you've already seen things. But you don't even know how it happened. You know. Most people don't know how it happens. They don't understand that there's a digital computer thing that goes on now that didn't even exist before. You made layouts. And you did key lining. You heard of this key lining? You had to know how to do key lines in order to paste everything and to cut it out. And it was a matter of that's what an artist did. Artists don't do that anymore. They work with the computer. And you cannot beat the computer for doing key lining. What it took us ten hours to do, you can do in a half hour on the computer. So it's an advancement. But the only place where there's no advancement is the work prior to what you're getting ready to do. They just do it. And they over-printing when they should be reversing, when they should over print or mixed it all up and put all of the technology on one page. You can't do it that way. And I'm against that. I really don't like that. But I know what you're asking was what I wanna be remember as? It's hard to say just as a guy who loved challenges. And who knocked down a lot of them. And thought about other people besides himself as far their progress is concerned. I feel I've been responsible for a lot of people around the country even, that I don't even know.
Story_ID: 15672
Speaker 1: What do you think about this oral history project that you're engaging in right now?  This particular--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] That you're doing with this? I think it's great. I think it's wonderful. Because if students are looking for--are doing research on different people and all they have is a name and an address and a phone number, they can't learn anything from that. I think this is a step in teaching. And it has a lot to do with the future of students. I think it's a great thing. And other people too. Just like if I'm writing--if I wanna go and look up Jay Jackson, if he's in the--is he in it?
Speaker 1: Well I don't think so sir.
Speaker 2: Well you haven't gotten to him yet.  Ha?
Speaker 1: See I wouldn't know.
Speaker 2: What about E. Sims Campbell?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No!
Speaker 1: See these are people we need to do. You know?
Speaker 2: Now first of all I wanna try to get the museum to do an exhibit on E. Sims Campbell. I probably won't be able to do it now 'cause we have a different curator. You know, Ray Price died. And the one we have now is Selean Holmes. Have you met her? E. Selean Holmes that's her name. For some reason she wants to be secure. And she looks for her security in controlling everything that happens. I can't make a move unless I ask her. That's the situation I'm in right now.
Speaker 1: You've been volunteering for the DuSable Museum [of African American History and Culture, Chicago, Illinois] and working for them--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneous] No I'm not--.
Speaker 1: You're working for--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Oh yeah. I get paid for everything I do.
Speaker 1: Okay. [unclear].
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm. And just recently I gave them a series of cases that the Art Institute [of Chicago, Illinois] gave me. I gave it to them for nothing. That's about $10,000 worth of cabinets and stuff that I gave; just donated. And I've always tried to lookout for the future of the museum. And I'm that way. If I'm working on something I give it my best shot. But I'd like to be doing something else right now. But I'm having to [Chuckling] stick with that for a while. You know.
Speaker 1: Is there a last thing you want to say before we end, sir?
Speaker 2: Oh I'd just like to say I'm interested in what you're doing. I think you're doing a good job. And I didn't know you could get me to remember so many things. And, of course, I have to ask you if I can get a tape of what you're doing to help me with the book that I'm doing? 'Cause I'm stuck around--I got fifty pages and I gotta know how many more I gotta do. But I'm stuck in one area. And I wanna finish the book.
