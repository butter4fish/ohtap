 Wilson  Taylor  Today is July 16, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with the  Oklahoma Oral Research Program at Oklahoma State University  Library. I am at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art today talking with  Ann Taylor. Ann is going to be telling me about her memories of the  1930   s, so thank you for joining me today. Let   s start out by having you  tell me when and where you were born.  I was born in Shattuck, Oklahoma in the middle of the winter time and  delivered by the famous doctor, whose name escapes me at this point.  He was famous for being in Shattuck and also being at the Mayo Clinic,  so that was fun.  And what   s your birth date?  My birthday is February the 16, 1926.  And what did your family do in Shattuck?  My father was a civics teacher and mainly a basketball coach. In that  part of the country girls basketball was more important than boys     basketball. So that   s what he did.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  I did, but unknowing to me we moved to Waukomis, Oklahoma, and my  brother was born there. He is not quite two years younger than I am so  we were coaching in Waukomis when that happened.  Did you stay in Waukomis very long?  No, and I am a little fuzzy. I should have talked to my mother more  about exactly how long we were where, and I am trying to write that  5  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  down for my children so they will, if it ever makes any difference, they  will know. But, I think we might have gone to Omega, Oklahoma, which  is just west of Kingfisher. My father in the summertime worked for the  man who owned most of the granaries that were up and down the  railroad, in that part of the country. We   d go back to different places in  the summertime, and sometimes when he would be working doing that,  we did, at some points in time, go back to Edmond so that he could work  on some hours for his more advanced degree at Central State. It was a  teachers    college at that time, but I remember being at my paternal  grandmother   s house in Dover for a lot of the time. I guess it was mostly  in the summertime, because that part of it escapes me a bit.  So, were your parents from Oklahoma?  No. I saw that on the sheet to fill out and I have their birth certificates,  and I don   t recall. It   s quite possible that both were born in Kansas  before they came to Oklahoma. So, I better check up on that.  So did your family usually live in town when you were growing up?  My mother   s family lived in town. My father   s family lived on the farm,  because his mother had homesteaded that in one of the runs that they  had. Not    89, but there was another run or so after that, and she  homesteaded the land. We have a copy of the piece of paper given to her  that she was given that piece of land, as long as she stayed there for a  certain time and improved it and did some of those kinds of things. So,  my father was mostly raised there, and his older brother got involved  with the Ku Klux Klan, I am told. That wasn   t very good. He wasn   t  mean or bad, but somehow he got in with bad folks. It was a bad  situation, so he went to California. Actually, he never came back. My  dad wanted to go to college. His father wanted him as soon as he got out  of high school to go to work. He moved to   oh, I am not going to be  able to think of the name of that town. Still along that highway that goes  up to Enid from Dover.  We can add it in later.  So, he lived with his mother   s father there and they let him finish high  school and then start to college. That was how he was able to be  educated.  Where did he start to college?  At Central State. That   s where he went to college.  Did he play basketball?  6  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Oh, no. I don   t think he did. Early on in his career he coached football.  For some reason he liked basketball better, and so that   s what he  continued in was basketball and girls    basketball, which was the thing in  that part of the country.  When you were growing up did you live in town generally?  Yes. We never did live in the country. I have gone to visit people who  lived in the country. I thought it was wonderful because they got to ride  the school bus back and forth to school and I never did. So, I was really  impressed with going to visit them.  Did you have to walk to school?  Yes, but I always lived in town so it was just a matter of blocks. I never  walked six miles in the snow or anything like that.  Did your family raise a garden?  I don   t think so. Maybe tomatoes or some certain things like that. They  didn   t raise a garden. My mother wasn   t really very interested in  gardening and my dad had done that longer than he wanted to remember,  so we didn   t have to do that. I do remember at my paternal  grandmother   s house in Dover that she had a garden, and she had  chickens, and she had pigs. All in this backyard, and I think everybody  along there did that, because it was something that just was done. I  didn   t get along very well with the chickens or with the pigs, and so I  was not allowed to even climb up on the fence back there. I had to just  look through the fence and see all those animals and things. But I  brought that on myself. Anyway, the chickens jumped on me, the pigs  jumped on me, so I evidently looked tasty or something. (Laughs)  Where would your family get their groceries?  At the grocery store.  Do you remember if there was a charge account?  I think probably everybody had charge accounts, but I don   t remember  exactly about that. I don   t remember that part of it.  Did you have a milk man that came by?  We did have milk man, and we had an ice man who came and brought  us ice for our icebox. Up until when we were living in Kingfisher, and I  7  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  must have been in about the third grade, my mother got a refrigerator,  which was a great big thing. I think it was a Frigidaire. It was really  wonderful. My brother and I were tempted to open the door and stand  there and just gaze at it. We got caught several times so we didn   t do  that anymore. We had great big trees in our yard so we could always  climb trees. There were always sidewalks, and so I could skate and I  always had the scabs on my knees to prove it. (Laughs) I fell a lot and I  would skin up my knees. That was something fun to do. One of the  things that I do have that is pretty exciting, I believe, is the 1922  yearbook from Dover High School. In that, my mother is a senior and  my father is a coach, so he is in there. My uncles on my mother   s side of  the family, who were the Ankelsons, are in there, and my father   s  family, who were Eatons, are in there. Then my mother   s younger sister,  Mary Abarney, and they are all in there too. It is unbelievable to our  children that they can have all of this in one book. I bet it happens a lot  in little towns like that though, because you didn   t know anyone else.  That   s a pretty old book now to still be preserved.  Well, when you lived in Kingfisher and Dover and people talked about  going to the city, they meant going to Enid.  So, would you go to Enid?  We went to Enid, Yes.  Was that on Saturdays, or only on a rare occasion?  No, we went often enough that I remember it, quite a few times. I  remember going to the movies there, in Enid, so it must be a big  wonderful place. They had theaters. It was pretty great. They had a big  park there with a swimming pool that was really very wonderful, and I  do remember that. Government Springs Park, whatever that means.  Do you remember some of the first movies you saw?  Oh, I remember seeing cartoons like Mickey Mouse, and then I am not  really sure. It was some point along that time that we started getting to  see Shirley Temple, and so we always got to go to those movies. I think  that all the movies must have been okay for children because there was  never any concern about it.  Do you remember how much it cost to go to the movies?  Ten cents.  8  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Would you get popcorn or soda or anything?  We got popcorn. We paid extra for that, but it was probably ten cents  too. My brother and I usually shared a bag of popcorn. I don   t know  whatever year it would it be, I was in the fifth grade and he was in the  fourth grade, we moved to Oklahoma City. My dad was no longer  teaching because the last year he taught, they couldn   t pay the teachers.  They gave them warrants and they still haven   t been about to make good  on the warrants, so he had to go find jobs doing other things. He did that.  We lived in Oklahoma City not too far out of Fourth and Walker. In the  summertime   Fourth and Walker is not very far from away here.  Anyway, in the summertime we were allowed, and it was perfectly safe  for us, to go downtown the long way and go to the movies and then  come home the long way. It took all day, I think. We stopped. We went  down Fourth Street and peeked into the St. Joseph   s Church. We never  would have been brave enough to go in there, but we could at least smell  the incense if we opened the door.  Then we stopped at the post office because we had an uncle who worked  as a registry clerk, I believe. I was tall enough to see up over the ledge,  shelf there to let him know we were here. My brother wasn   t tall enough  yet, but anyway, we saw him. Then we went to the First National Bank  which we thought was probably the most wonderful building in the  whole world, and we rode the escalator a lot. I would still ride the  escalator, I don   t know whether they have it or not. It was such fun.  Then we would go either, usually to the Criterion or the Midwest  Theater for ten cents and see movies. I don   t remember much about  which ones we saw at that point in time. It was great fun, and then on the  way back we walked through the new area where the municipal  buildings are back here. In front of one of the buildings, which I think it  is the municipal building, there was a great big pool that had all kinds of  lights on it and a waterfall. So we used to walk around the edge of the  pool which we were not allowed to do, and we would do that two or  three times and then come on home. So, it was a pretty exciting day  when we got to do that.  Sounds like it. Did you have a radio in your home?  Yes, we did.  Do you remember radio programs that you liked?  There were children   s programs but not much, maybe just one. Then  after World War II started there were always H.V. Kaltenborn at six  o   clock in the evening. And, everybody I know of sat and listened to  H.V. Kaltenborn from London and if he said it, it was so. That was very  9  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  interesting, I think. Otherwise, if we wanted to know anything about  World War II, we bought Life magazine and we went to the movies  where they showed the newsreel. We could hardly get excited about big  things that had happened because we didn   t know about them until a day  or two later, but that was an interesting experience, as well. Life changed  in this city all the way around because of the war. Everybody remembers  where they were when they heard about Pearl Harbor. I even remember  where I was when they had D-Day, which was a big day in our life.  All the young men who were the right age went to war, and there were a  lot of   Tinker Field had a great big situation going on there. Because  the weather was good here for flying, they had lots of little flying fields  all the way around here where young men went to get their basic training  in flying. On the weekends, it was very crowded in downtown  Oklahoma City. You could barely walk, because they all had no place  else to go except Oklahoma City and to the movies, or go to Katz Drug  or V.C. Drug. That was pretty exciting for younger people to have. I was  fortunate in high school to have a history teacher who made us look at     well we did things that were happening now every day in class for a few  minutes before we started the other history, and she explained to us why  things happened they way they did. Otherwise we would not have  known that. Our parents probably knew that, but they did not discuss it  with us at home. So, I was taught to listen and watch things and then  make up my find and find out what else was going on. She was  certainly    Well, I just had to have her every year for different kinds of  history because she really made you think about the history.  That   s wonderful.  That was really very good.  What school did you go to in Oklahoma City?  In Oklahoma City, in grade school, I went to Emerson. That was at the  time an elementary school. It used to have on each side a black metal  tower. They must have been four feet across and they were round. What  they were is fire escapes. They had a slide in there, so if you were on the  second floor you could jump in on there and slide down and somebody  would be at the bottom to take you out. But anyway, that was great fun  and I was sorry when they took them away, but I am sure they had a  better plan. The municipal buildings were new and they had Christmas  programs. I remember one year, choirs from the different churches or  different schools, I am not really sure which way, were part of the  musical program at Christmas. I got to lead one of the groups out from  the side. Not because I could sing better or anything. I was shorter, so  we did that shorter, build up to the taller. So, we thought we must live in  10  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  the most wonderful place in the world, and I think at the time it probably  was one of the best places in the world. They had rationing during the  war and people, oh they grumbled about it, but I don   t know people who  would cheat then like they do know.  What all was rationed?  Gasoline was rationed, oil was rationed, tires, sugar, meat was rationed.  You got stamps and then you used those when you went to those places  to get things. We had a wonderful thing here. We had street cars and  they were just great. They went everywhere, and then part of the  streetcar, the enterprise were the interurbans, they went all the way to El  Reno and they went to Norman. Because there were two Navel bases  down at Norman, on the weekends they put two interurbans together and  they came up hooked to each other. They had to do that because of the  number of people who wanted to come, and I am sure the ones who  wanted to go back when it was ten o   clock or whatever. That was very  exciting. This town and this part of the country that I knew anything  about buckled down to win the war, and that   s mostly what we thought  about. We mourned the boys that were killed, and things like that, but it  was still like a family thing. That was the nice thing about growing up  here. You maybe couldn   t go a lot of places and do a lot of things, but  all your family lived here, not far apart. They might live in Kingfisher or  Seminole, or Edmond, and so you could get together with them quite  often and it was lots of fun. I had thirty-three first cousins. So when we  got together with the family it was a lot of fun.  We didn   t have any money. We were poor but nobody knew it. At least  the children didn   t know it until you got into high school and had to  have something that cost a lot of money, you didn   t know you were  poor. The war is what changed the Depression here. I don   t think there is  any question about it.  Oh, and one of the things in roaming around with my brother, one  summer when we were in Edmond when my brother and I were down  meandering around on the campus, we went into this building and the  auditorium there and there was a young Indian man in there painting on  the walls, so we had to go back every two or three days and see how he  was doing. It turns out that I much later found out that was Acee Blue  Eagle, and he painted murals on those walls which would go like with  your exhibit now. Somebody, later on, painted over all those and they  were lost. Which I think is tragic. But anyway, it was safe for kids to go  roaming around anywhere. You wouldn   t let your children do that now.  We were perfectly safe.  What did your parents do for entertainment?  11  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Well they played cards. The dads went fishing, not very exciting fishing  because it was around here, but whatever was in the creek is where they  went and got fish. The mothers cooked it and we had a fish fry. That  happened quite a bit in the nice weather. That was fun. Church was a  very big part of our lives, and a lot of the things that were entertainment  or education, outside of school and everything, were at the church. So I  was certainly brought up that way.  What church did you attend?  My family was Christian Church, Disciples of Christ. Like when we  lived in Omega, the only church there was the Baptist Church, so we  were Baptist. They used to have the Easter Ceremony out in the country  up on a cliff or something like that. I remember that we always went,  because my mother was a singer and they would need her to sing. So we  would go and when the sunrise came up we could celebrate Easter. That  was fine with us little kids because we could sleep all the way back  home. I guess we didn   t have much at all but we didn   t know it, so it  worked out pretty well.  Would you do anything special for the Fourth of July?  Yes, everybody had picnics like they do now, and they had fireworks.  We could have fireworks to do ourselves. We had those fireworks that  you throw down and they explode. We weren   t allowed to have big  fireworks that would hurt anybody, but we had lots of others. We had  sparklers which was a really nice way to end it all, to have sparklers. So  yes, we did do Fourth of July, but that   s all I remember about it. There  must have been some ceremonies.  I do remember when my great-grandfather died that he was buried at  Banner Cemetery, which was a cemetery that everybody owned different  plots in the cemetery. He was taken there to be buried, and because he  was a veteran of the civil war, somebody in the service came out and did  Taps while they had the service. That was something new that we had  never had before.  Did you hear many stories from your grandfather about the Civil War?  No, not from him because he didn   t like me. He had a cane and he  tripped me with his cane at every opportunity. He didn   t like me. He  liked my brother, so that was okay. He was evidently raised in a German  community where they still spoke German because he had quite an  accent. I didn   t hear anything about the war that he told, but he probably  told it to my father, one of his favorites. One of the things we had   I  12  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  think it   s in the museum in Enid. Anyway, we have some kind of piece  of paper that honors him with a medal because he was taken captive and  sent to Andersonville, which was a big prison, and he escaped, which  was considered a great feat. The Negro people and others helped him get  back up North where he could be free again. I didn   t know about that  until I saw this piece of paper commending him for doing that. I am sure  he must not have been the only one, but he was the only one I knew. I  always thought of him as a wicked old man with an accent, but that   s  about it. (Laughs)  Do you know what state he lived in where the German community was?  It was here, I think.  In Oklahoma?  I think they came here from Missouri, but the community here where a  lot of the German people lived together, they still spoke German at  home. During the First War that I don   t know about and the Second  World War, they were very careful not to speak German in public  because that was what the enemy was. They had always spoken it in  their community, so I thought that was interesting. I had never been  around anybody that spoke another language. That was a big deal to me.  Were you around much diversity in Oklahoma City? African Americans  or Native Americans? Did you encounter people of other races in  Oklahoma City growing up?  We did. That happened quite a bit after World War II. I got married. I  was in nursing school, and I got married. My husband was in the Naval  training down at OU in B-12, and as soon as he graduated he was going  overseas. The war was just over but they needed fresh officers to go  there and let the ones who had been there so many years come back  home, so that   s what he was set to do. We went ahead and secretly got  married so that we could have a little time together before he went there.  Then I, of course, got pregnant, so I had to go tell the Sister at the  hospital that I wouldn   t be back after summer to go to school. (Laughs)  She didn   t like me to be pregnant. She didn   t even want me to be  married. So that was something that went on at the time and we were  fortunate that he got to be where he was experiencing a lot of things  about the war that had gone on in the Pacific, but he wasn   t there when it  was the shooting war. So, that part was pretty wonderful.  How did you meet your husband?  A blind date.  13  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  And it worked out.  Worked out. I was told by my friend who I had gone to high school  with; he was down at Norman in B-12. He took his yearbook down there  and let the guys who didn   t have girlfriends pick out pictures in there  and they called them on the phone. It was triple dates, so I figured you  couldn   t go very wrong with six people in a car because you had to use  all of the car if you wanted to get your car for the weekend. I was told  that he was an engineer and he was a junior in college. I thought that  was pretty impressive. He came and he was just cute as could be. So that  took care of that. It was one of those love at first sight things, I think.  Come to find out he was a junior in engineering at OU. He hadn   t had, at  that point in time, he was still seventeen. He didn   t have his eighteenth  birthday until the next week. So, that   s the way that went.  Did that make him younger than you?  Yes, two months and six days, which we counted off all of the sixty-six  years we have been married, so it was a big deal. We moved around the  country then afterward with the oil companies. Glad to be back in  Oklahoma City.  Do you have secrets to a long and happy marriage?  That secret might have been that is he wasn   t home very much. He was  always gone. (Laughter) So, the children and I   I could be the boss.  They had to do what I said.  How many children do you have?  We had four. One of them was killed in a motorcycle accident so we still  just have three. We had two boys and two girls. Most people we knew  had children, so it was a nice life.  When did you move back to Oklahoma after moving around?  1970.  And where did you settle then?  In Nichols Hills, and it   s a really great place to live and raise children.  I understand you know a lot about Nichols Hills.  You have a lot of people that live there and they do a lot of intermixing  14  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  with each other and friends. I have told many people that come there to  be careful if they criticize anybody because they are all related. And so  you have to not do that, but it   s a wonderful place to raise children. They  could walk to school. We had a carpool that if it was below thirty-two  degrees and raining or something like that, then one of the designated  days you got the station wagon out and rounded up all the kids on our  block. There were more kids than there were seatbelts. We didn   t know  about seatbelts. We took everybody to school. One of the families on our  block had a nice big dog that we all liked, and he followed the kids to  school. The street guard who helped the kids across Wilshire to get to  school, when the school bell rang and everybody stopped he left then he  put the dog in the back of his truck and he brought him home. (Laughs)  You wouldn   t find that just anywhere.  We have a lot of fun. We have a wonderful Fourth of July parade. It   s  really for the children. It has been going on for about fifty-three or -four  years. Lots of people come to that. It   s a great thing. We have a gazebo  and a band. It   s a volunteer band. Jim Knorr plays in it and lots of people  got their instruments out of the attic and started practicing, and were  glad to be able to play in a band again. So we have a band and we do the  big Fourth of July thing. That   s about it.  Where you mayor of Nichols Hills at one point?  Yes, I was.  How did that come about?  Well, we had a group of people who were trying to get the parks adopted  by the city so that they would be some help and have some  responsibility, because we were trying to adopt all the parks and get  them all fixed up. Because, we have lots, I don   t know, twenty-five little  parks around. I was on that committee. We had one councilman who  would never vote yes for it, so the time came and he was up for election.  They came to me and said we want you to run against him and we will  see that you get elected. They did and I did. The reason he didn   t want  the city to do that, because he thought until the city had all the streets  fixed and all the water lines fixed and all the sewers fixed that they had  no business getting into the park business. After I had been on the  council for a few months I knew he was right, but it was too late. We   ve  had a very great success with the park system and we all enjoy it a lot.  That   s how I got there. I was the first girl to be mayor. We   ve had two  since then. Girls do a good job.  What years were you mayor?  15  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  I never can remember. In the eighties.  Okay.  In the eighties.  So you paved the way for female mayors?  Yes. There was just no reason why. My only saving grace was that I  belonged to All Souls Episcopal Church. Almost everybody on the  council had always belonged to the Episcopal Church. That gave me one  good point. It was at the time when somebody contested our   we had an  act on the   it was a rule that you couldn   t have a pickup parked in your  driveway after ten o   clock at night. That was an intent to keep the people  who were working on things and would have lots of junk and everything  in their backyard from leaving it there, I guess. We had always abided  by that. We had a woman who belonged to Nichols Hills, she had a  horse farm and she wanted to have a pickup so she could haul things  around for the horses, which made a lot of sense. And so, she said,    You  either change that rule or I will sue.    We got to thinking about it and we  thought we better change the rule. Anyway, we had to the national press  come down and interview me. They couldn   t believe we had such a silly  rule, and it was at that time we had an invasion of the Kites. That was a  big deal too. We still have Kites but not like we did at that time. They  came for the grass because the things they like to eat are in the grass. We  thought they came from the trees. They attacked a lot of people on the  golf course and have very sharp claws. But, they are a protected species  because they are migrating birds so you can   t do anything about them.  You have to have the federal man who takes care of those things come  and move the nest. You can   t move it yourself. You can   t do anything  bad to any of those birds. It   s still a little bit of a problem, but we are  getting more used to it all the time, I think.  And you are an art lover?  Oh yes.  When did you start collecting art?  My husband is the art collector. He started I don   t know what, I guess it  was something he wanted to do. When he started making enough money  where he could buy paintings and things like that he started doing that.  At that point in time we had a house with big tall ceilings so he could  buy great big paintings. They were just great. He built up quite a  collection. Then when we moved from the big house to a smaller house,  we couldn   t very well keep all those pictures. There were too many. We  16  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  talked to the Christie   s people about sending them there. Somehow   Oklahoma City Museum of Art Director  Carolyn  Hill  and  Chief  Curator  Hardy George found out about it, so they came to see us. They  said,    We would like to talk to you about some of the pictures. Wouldn   t  you like to give us some of the pictures?    So we worked out a deal  where they bought some pictures and we gave some pictures, and they  are all right here on the second floor. It has been a lot of fun to have  them here. It has been wonderful to see this art center grow like it does.  Do you have a favorite piece that you have owned?  Yes, in the museum there is a picture, one of the large ones, of little boys  fishing. You have probably seen it.  They have  been fishing with their  fishing stuff down here on the ground and they   re resting, but that   s my  favorite one. I like them, too. I turned out to be the curator so I have to  keep track of everything, because if you sell everything, the internal  revenue  service  wants to know how much you made or if it paid less  than what you got it for and all of those kinds of things. I have had to  keep all the records for that. We still have one great big one at home and  some smaller ones we are very fond of, but we are glad to have them  down here. It   s been a lot of fun. Oklahoma City is a wonderful place.  You know, how many people here will donate things and do good for  other people and all of that. I don   t think that goes on just everywhere.  I   m always pleased to know that I live in a city that acts like that, so I  am very glad to do that. We have a son that lives here. We have two  daughters who live on the West Coast. They come and bring their  children and children   s children and we have a wonderful time, and I  really like living here. We didn   t want to live anywhere else, so this  worked out just fine.  What would you say Oklahoma means to you?  What does it need? It   s a place where anybody that wants to can make a  name for themselves, or if they want to make money they can do that.  They apply the rules and regulations and there are always people here  who are glad to sponsor people that do that. You know from your school  that you have lots of scholarships that go on in your college and that do  that at all of the colleges, not to mention OU. Those things are all very  good, too. Maybe they do it in lots of other states but we can certainly  hold our heads up that we do it as much as anybody else. It is very good  that we offer that opportunity to so many different people, and now if we  can just get those people who are obese not to each so much, I guess we  would solve all of the problems. We certainly can enjoy the football and  the basketball. Sports are in it even though small towns around this state  are devoted to their children and the sports, so that   s a really good  healthy thing. It keeps all the families together.  17  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Did you play basketball in high school?  No. They didn   t like girls to play basketball in my day. We played  volleyball, we played baseball   I guess it was softball   volleyball and  tennis. But during that little period of time, I don   t know what they  thought was going to happen to girls but they didn   t think they should  play basketball, so I didn   t play basketball. I played volleyball, softball,  and I really liked to play tennis. One of the things I think attracted Jack  was the fact that I could beat him playing tennis. He didn   t think girls  could do that. I love the way that the town is progressing now, and doing  different things than you would have thought they would have done  before. They   re building new buildings and fixing up the sidewalks  downtown and making it so that it would be more friendly. The river is  just such a divine thing, and who would have known that? I have lived  here most of my life, and we mowed that river. We certainly didn   t sail  on it or anything like that. So this is a really great place to live with a  family. We   ve lived in San Antonio and Dallas and Houston before they  were great big cities. They were nice then, too, but I don   t think I would  want to live in any of those now. We lived in Lake Charles, Louisiana,  we lived in Mount Vernon, Illinois, and we were very glad to come back  to Oklahoma. It   s a good thing to be in. I am happy to see OSU do a lot  of new things to get them going. As long as they have Burns  Hargis   and Boone  Pickens  I think they can do a lot of things.  Yes.  Don   t you?  I do.  I don   t know Boone, but I have known Burns a very long time. He is a  wonderful treasure for you to have.  Yes. He is good at making things happen.  He really is. He really is.  Well when history is written, what would you like for it to say about  you?  Well, that I tried to help, and I have been very active in the symphony  organization, worked on the show houses and worked on the Republican  committee, done a lot of   Ronald Reagan kissed me right there. I have  had a lot of enjoyment doing all of those kinds of things. We had our  youngest child born without arms and only leg stumps. We still don   t  18  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  Taylor  Wilson  know why, so I got immediately into the area of children with  disabilities. I have spent a lot of time working on that in Oklahoma. I  was president of one of the national organizations, as well. There are a  lot of great things that are being done in that area that never were even  considered before. It is a wonderful thing to have happen. Some of it  goes on here, I am happy to say. The most wonderful thing is the  medical school and all of the things that go along with that. Out there  with all the buildings that do special things like cancer and the children   s  hospital. Those people are dedicated and make a difference. So we are  most fortunate to have all of that going on out there. I think we will be  the leaders in the cancer fight before very many years. You won   t have  to go to M.D. Anderson, you can stay here. Those are wonderful people  that come from everywhere and they like it here so a lot of them stay. I  just want Oklahoma to be noted for taking advantage of the blessings  that come along so that they can make things better. If you do all the  things that need to be better here, then we can go someplace else and  make them better. It   s a good place to start. It   s a good place to end.  Is there anything else we haven   t talked about today about the 1930   s or  anything else that you would like to talk about?  Probably. I recall those times as being very   I didn   t know how special  they were because it was at a time when everybody did what we did.  Parents got together and I learned how to play bridge when I was  probably eleven because the parents would get together and play bridge  at night, the ladies played in the afternoon, the couples would play at  night. They put the kids to bed and I knew they had dessert at ten o     clock, so I stayed up. I was very quiet and I watched all the bridge that  went on, so I learned how to play contract bridge when I was about  eleven. As long as I didn   t cause any kind of trouble I was allowed to  stay up, and of course the television is what I would take away if I could.  It has lots of good things and also it   s like everything else, too much is  too much. This is a great place for people to have grown up in and to  live. Even in the thirties when nobody had any money. We didn   t need  money, I guess, because we had each other. It was a good time. It was a  good time.  Great. Well thank you very much for talking with me today.  I hope my rattling off will be of some concern.  It was wonderful. Thank you.  -------  -------
