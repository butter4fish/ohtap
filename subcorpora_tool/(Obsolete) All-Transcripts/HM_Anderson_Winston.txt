Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we ask as sort of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's a traditional food in Jamaica, which is ackee and saltfish.  That's food from the poor people, but it's great stuff, looks like scrambled eggs, but it's great stuff.

Story_ID: 27322
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll do 'em separately.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Mother's full name is Ruth Elizabeth Gray, G-R-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 16, 1907.  She died at ninety-nine years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in St. Mary, in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, how far back can you trace your mother's ancestry?
Speaker 2: Yes, mixed ancestry.  Her father was a slave and her, and he doesn't know who his mother was.  Her mother was a mulatto woman who can trace all the way back to England.  The English minister named Williamson came and married a Jamaican, and she is the progeny of that union.  Her name is Adina Gray.  And she was a farmer, a very successful farmer.
Speaker 1: Dina Gray.
Speaker 2: Gray.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you say that your grandfather was a slave--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I mean, well, slavery was over--
Speaker 2: Great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Great-grandfather, yes.
Speaker 1: That still would, I think before, I think slavery was over in Jamaica--
Speaker 2: 18--yeah, 1833, but he's descendants of slaves--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Of slaves, okay.
Speaker 2: --descendants of slaves, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His names was James Gray.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, James Gray, okay.  Now, are there any stories passed down in the family about the emancipation of slaves or what slavery was like in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Not really, not in the family.  I think--of course, we always knew who those Bogaus and the great heroes, all the way down to, as I say [Marcus] Garvey, even though he was after slavery, but, you know, the great emancipators of the island.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Jamaican history is taught fairly consistently--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --when you--(unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --especially now.  In my days, going through high school, it was always British history.  I knew more about what went on in England than I knew in Jamaica, but things have changed.
Story_ID: 27323
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Ruth Elizabeth Gray] have a chance to go to school and go to college?
Speaker 2: Mother was a brilliant lady.  She, she went to a school in Kingston [Jamaica] called Wilmer's High School, which at that time was primarily for the children of the expatriates, the white expatriates who came there.  But she excelled to be one of the most outstanding students of the time.  She won the West Indian college--West Indies scholar.  And she, she wanted to do medicine, to come to the United States, but those were not in the books at the time.  And she tried to go to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] where her uncle was chairman of the chemistry department, a fellow named Williamson.  But at that time, they didn't think it was comfortable for her to go to Tuskegee, Alabama during the '30s [1930s] and so on.  But she became a teacher, and excellent teacher and taught for the rest of her life in high schools throughout the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so her uncle, this is your--her mother's brother?
Speaker 2: Her mother's brother, yes.  He was the first black graduate from a place called Kalamazoo University [sic, College, Kalamazoo, Michigan] which is the Michigan State, I think, the origin of Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know exactly where that is.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's right off of I-94 [Interstate 94] between Chicago [Illinois] and Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) There you go.
Speaker 1: I've driven past it, I--yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, and so he was one of the first black graduates in chemistry there, and then went to chair the department at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was, this would be in the 1920s, I guess?
Speaker 2: '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s], yes, '20s [1920s].
Speaker 1: '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s], okay.  First black graduate of Kalamazoo College, okay.  All right, okay, so your mother, she--so she taught school in Jamaica then--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Taught school, teachers college all over the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she finished teachers' college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was it a, do you think it was difficult for her to go higher because she was a woman in those days, you think, or--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course, you know, the society was very, very racial.  You couldn't, at that time, even when I was in high school, you had to be of a certain color and a certain class to get a job in a bank or something like that, you know.  So it was very, very difficult for her at that time.  But she, she was a strong lady.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Jamaica was very British--
Speaker 2: Very class conscious.
Speaker 1: --place, (simultaneous) class conscious, and then when you add like race, I mean color conscious--
Speaker 2: Very much so, very much so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --on to it--
Speaker 2: That was very strong in my mother-father relationship.
Speaker 1: Now, was the United States seen as some place where those distinctions didn't matter as much or--
Speaker 2: I don't think that they, you know, those were the times of serious problems in the United States, so.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  Okay, so it didn't make any difference really, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No real difference at all--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --no matter where you were--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --pretty much the same problem.  Okay, so, all right, so did your mother have any other talents or abilities?
Speaker 2: Oh, just a brilliant painter, a painter, yeah, painted until she was eighty-eight.  She came, came to the states here to live with me, and she lived with me for twenty-one years, you know, and she was (bad?) very, very happy in the end.  Put it that way.  She had a chance to see her children grow up and be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she passed away then in 2006?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27324
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you give me his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Laurel Charles Anderson.
Speaker 1: Laurel?
Speaker 2: Charles.  And they called him Lal for some reason.
Speaker 1: Okay, L-A-L?
Speaker 2: L-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: 1908, April 15th, and he was born in a place called Moneague in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: M-O-N-E-A-G-U-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, since then--now is there a story behind his first name, Laurel?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  But I don't know.  But this is a horse of a different color, put it that way.  He, his ancestors came from England.  They were among the first Anderson's to come to Jamaica.  And the earliest Anderson was a physician, working in the country parts.  And he, this fellow married, I think an Indian lady, and as I say "a horse of a different color", these people grew up with straight hair and blue eyes, some of them, and, and very, very light skinned, put it that way.  So that puts you automatically in a different class at the time, okay.  But he eventually became an agricultural instructor, in, in Kingston [Jamaica], and did all sorts of jobs, farming, block making and everything.  But the story is that my mother who came from a relatively affluent background and very educated background, would ride a horse and --from her home in a place Maiden Hall to Moneague and, to play the violin and to play the piano at church services.  And she had to (shoot?) at this fellow who was studying to get to the agricultural school in Jamaica, and at that time it was very unusual that he, of so-called, high color, would marry this lady who was very dark, you see.  And so I think that he married for affluence, and she married for acceptance as far as color is concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm giving you too much information, I know (laughter).  That's the story.
Speaker 1: It's interesting, okay.  So it did--so people who were dark could have some means, they could get some--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --means, but they were still considered lower because of--
Speaker 2: The class line, class levels, yes.
Speaker 1: Color.
Speaker 2: You know, they aspired to, for her children to come out mulatto-like, and favored.
Speaker 1: So he was an excellent candidate to provide those kind of (genes?) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, he was, he was.
Speaker 1: All right, now, Laurel, this name, and I keep coming back to, we were just at the Marine Corp yesterday.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And their restaurant is Globe and Laurel, it's called because the Laurel represents victory, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in battle and that sort of thing.  So that's what I-- I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know where that name came from.
Speaker 1: But you hardly ever see it as Laurel in a male's first name.  It's usually Lawrence as a name, you know--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but a Laurel, signifies it's victory, victory and medal.  So, okay, now, your--so your father became an agricultural instructor.  Did he go to the same teacher's college?
Speaker 2: No, he went to Hope School of Agriculture in Kingston [Jamaica].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the first and the only member of his family that, I think, went on to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, he had, he was descended from a doctor, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It goes way--about how far back was the doctor?
Speaker 2: Three generations back, three generations, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and so they met at church?
Speaker 2: Met at church, in Moneague [Jamaica].
Story_ID: 27325
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about their [parents'] personalities, their dispositions, their attitudes, how they walk, talk, and how they look, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: More mother [Ruth Elizabeth Gray], more mother.  She was a very determined, very strong, education-oriented and very caring for her children and for many others who were not her children.  They owe their success to this lady.  Father [Laurel Charles Anderson], he was, he took things for granted, put it that way.  You know, he, he was there, but did not, push you towards education and that sort of a thing.
Story_ID: 27326
Speaker 1: Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Very successful brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: How many are there and can you name them--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and put yourself in order for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Abraham St. Aubyn, A-U-B-Y-N, I think.  He was the first to come to the United States.  He went to Calabar High School [Kingston, Jamaica].  You want me to go that far?
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 2: Went to Calabar High School, a very, very bright fellow.  Today he is an obstetrician and gynecologist in Norfolk and Virginia Beach [Virginia].  And he sort of followed my uncles, my mother's brothers who came to the United States to, to study, eventually study medicine.  A fellow, his name is James Gray.  He had a great--opened a hospital in Wilmington, North Carolina during the time of the segregation period, and it was the only one that accepted blacks at the time.  His name is James Gray.
Speaker 1: That's one of your uncles that--that's an uncle--
Speaker 2: My mother's brother.
Speaker 1: My mother's brother, okay.
Speaker 2: The other one went to do medicine in McGill [University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada] in Canada.
Speaker 1: So James Gray opened a hospital in --
Speaker 2: In Wilmington, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: In Wilmington, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Rafael Gray went to McGill, and he did--he returned to Jamaica to do, to practice.  Now, that's one brother.  The sister, her name is Shirley, S-H-I-R-L-E-Y, Payne.  She went to London [England, United Kingdom] to do nursing, and then she returned to the United States after that.  And the younger brother, Bernard Bradley Anderson, he followed me to come to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], and he's a very, very successful surgeon.  He spent ten years in Bessemer, Alabama, the only board-certified surgeon at the time in that region near Birmingham.  He spent ten years in the Kingston Public Hospital [Kingston, Jamaica] doing surgery, came back to help--to Washington to head the, the Department of Surgery at--that hospital in the North--Southeast.  I can't remember the name right now.  But anyway, he has immigrated to Ethiopia where he's building a hospital there, and seems to be very happy in the Ethiopian society.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so he's building a hospital there now?
Speaker 2: In Ethiopia, yeah, a fifty-five bed hospital there.  Essentially, he's an Ethiopian (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, does he associate at all with the Rasta movement--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, they're in a different part of Ethiopia.  Yeah, they--he's up north with, in a place called University of Gondar [Gondar, Ethiopia], Amharic area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, old Kingdom of Gondar.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And he's a professor there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so is that the, all your siblings, sir?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's the extent of the family.
Speaker 1: And you're between your sister, Shirley, and Bernard?
Speaker 2: And--yes, I'm number three.
Story_ID: 27327
Speaker 1: Now, this is your family growing up, this is the household--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, did any grandparents live with you or uncles and aunts or--
Speaker 2: For very short periods, short periods.  Yeah, visit, but not live with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, can you describe the household you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course, mother [Ruth Elizabeth Gray] was essentially head of the household and she taught in Kingston [Jamaica] at the time.  And my father [Laurel Charles Anderson] was in the countryside's, working.  It was a close family.  We all were able to go to good high schools, and we, just a regular lower, middle-class family, I think, put it that way.  And just a very, very, very tough times, but it was interesting and pleasant times.  I don't know if I can say anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, what did you house look like and where was it situated at?
Speaker 2: Situated in Kingston, and a place called Elgin Road, and the, of course, it was all-family home, and lots of visitors from Rafael who would come in from the countryside and spend the weekend there, and others who would just drop in on both sides of the family.  So it was sort of like the central mailstop for the (laughter), for the relatives coming into Kingston at the time.
Speaker 1: Is it a large house?
Speaker 2: About three bedrooms, I think, and wasn't all that large.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you grow up in the same place the whole time you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, I think we moved around, especially towards the period when my father left Jamaica and went to England [United Kingdom] to, to seek, I think, employment and seek his fortune.  That time, we were alone with the family.
Speaker 1: Did it make it difficult for--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Very difficult, very difficult, because mother had to bear the brunt of everything.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when your father left?
Speaker 2: When he left, I'd say sixteen, sixteen years old.  And, but she, she made sure that, and even at her own expense, that we were able to go to school every day and provide enough lunch money so we could have lunch every day, even if she had to walk.  So she was, as I say, just a--just the shining star in the family.
Story_ID: 27328
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up, one of the great sights for us was every Sunday, if we could, we would go to Hope Gardens [Kingston, Jamaica] and listen to--it was beautiful garden and, national garden on the island, and listen to the band concert.  These primarily, English-type persons with their bands playing underneath a kind of a gazebo.  That was, that was wonderful.  The, you say sights and sounds.  The, the rivers that we would go to in St. Thomas [Jamaica] and, of course, it was lots of fun just laying in the water and going over the falls and that sort of a thing.  That was a lot of fun.  That was interesting.
Speaker 1: Now, are these the famous falls--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Not Dunn's River.
Speaker 1: Okay, not Dunn's.
Speaker 2: No, these were little rivers.  It's called Negro River.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Negro River, and that was fun.  The, you know, when one could, one enjoyed the beaches around Kingston.
Speaker 1: Now, the way you say that, "when one could", I mean does it mean that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It wasn't a regular thing.  It wasn't a regular thing.  It was occasional going to those places.  I know I'm forgetting a couple of things that impressed me as a kid.  Of course, you know, there were always wonderful mango trees, and we had many in our (laughter), in our yard.  And bicycling to school, and everywhere else, and with my friends.  It usually is a gang of about three or four of us riding bicycles to school and so on.  And, you know, even, various--some of our colleagues are driving to weekend parties and so on.  We always had our bicycle (laughter).  So, of course, had it out of sight 'cause you didn't want 'em to think that you couldn't, you had to get there on your own, you know, and so it's interesting.  Yeah, those are wonderful things, bicycling over the whole island, you know.  We used to do that, ride into the country and back, you know, much to the trepidation of our parents, you know, they didn't particularly like that.  But we did it anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --it was interesting.
Speaker 1: What about sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Of course, the best, best smells that I can remember are the little, they called them--fried fish, fried fish.  They're little, small little sardine-type fish that they would, they called it fry-dry.  You know, it was absolutely fantastic, not just the odor, but the, but the taste.  And, of course, to eat those with Bemis, which is a product, Cassava bread, which is also a national taste and dish from the island.  Taste, is driving over the mountains away from Kingston and the fellow on the side of the road, selling roasted yams that you ate with saltfish or it seems like saltfish was real, a real staple food in the island at the time, roasted yams.
Speaker 1: So up in the mountains, they had a lot of salted fish, I guess--
Speaker 2: You know, there was, there were--if you went by the bus, there were bus stops, and you'd stop at that little outdoor type of a market, and, of course, you know, you'd take the opportunity to get off and buy your little yam and saltfish as you road back towards your destination, you know.  It was a, it was a cultural thing, and my--after me, they would, of course, they would love to serve stews and soups from the head of the goat, and lots of pepper in these little outdoor, outdoor areas.  There was the, this park that had lots of ground provisions like corn and yams and so forth along with whatever came from the head of the, the brain of the goat and lots of pepper.  So really, what you were drinking was a good pepper soup, and that was good.  It was fun, you know, the things that you liked to do as a child, or young person or an adult.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about sounds?  Any--
Speaker 2: Sounds, always at night.  The crickets and the frogs, always at night.  And, you know, they're not scary, but good stories.  An Italian friend of ours went to Jamaica, and she couldn't sleep in the house because there was this little frog that was always going [slurping sound].  And she thought somebody was outside calling her, you know.  And that was an interesting (laughter), interesting experience that she had there.  And I think for me, what I remember most is most of the little houses had zinc roofing, metal roofing.  And they, and the drops of rain whether it's a light rain or heavy rain, it's always knocking on the top of the roof, a distinct sound.  It's a, calypsos have been made about this, this rain drops, "Raindrops are falling on your-"but these were falling on the zinc roofs.  It was very interesting.
Story_ID: 27329
Speaker 1: Alright, you were telling us about the absence of television, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, we didn't have a television, and our neighbors had, some of our neighbors had TV.  And it would be, it was very interesting but my mother and my--mostly my brother and myself, younger brother, would walk through the community and look at all the lights with televisions in the various peoples' homes and so on, especially the walks were very interesting during Christmastime to look at all the Christmas trees that were in the neighbors' homes and so on.  We always had a Christmas tree, but that Christmas tree was made of sticks and cotton, you know, we made our own Christmas tree.  But that was a custom of the island anyway, and so that was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay, you were talking about a radio show--
Speaker 2: Well, we, we were addicted to the radio.  We had the little Philco radio, a big Philco radio, and we would listen to the, the stories, the serials, and one I remember was 'Rex Morgan, M.D.' who lost his love and can he find true love again?  You know, that was the catch.  And so, my mother and us would be glued to that radio, along with the helper that we had at the time.  We would all--would never miss it, you know.  So that was fun, and, of course, the other thing is listening to, "On an old cross, in a hill far away," every Sunday.  You know, you'd have these Evangelists programs--
Speaker 1: 'The Old Rugged Cross.'
Speaker 2: 'The Old Rugged Cross' (laughter), and we were there listening to those sermons, you know.  Those were the times when we could essentially be closest.  We'd get together listening to those, to those programs.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, then you had to learn the words.  It was interesting.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--now, Calypso was big when you were growing up, right?
Speaker 2: It was big, but it was the old-time Calypso [music] and not the Shaba Ranks and the, what you have today.  It was old, old Calypsos which was one or two people with the guitars and so on.  And then after that, you had the emergence of people like Bob Marley and, of course, Calypso changed in a different direction, you know, still a good direction.
Speaker 1: You know, when you were growing up.  That's what I'm really (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Before, just before Marley.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the--Calypso was, who were the stars when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't, I don't think there was that, those stars that I know of.  It just, but the scene would be a group of about five musicians that would come around, and they'd be playing and so, at your house, and maybe you give them some money and that sort of thing.  But then, I think it really got big with Marley.  And before Marley, the others before him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just trying to figure out who was a star when you were a kid, growing up, and--not now, you know, and, or even in the '70's [1970s], you know, when you came here.  But--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but Calypso was big, but, you know, the, as a child, a young person, it was really oriented towards the United States, music.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, we knew all about Bill Haley and the Comets and Elvis Presley and those, so then those people were really reigning at the time, even though Calypso is in the background.  Those, those singers were really--you know, Perry Como and the 'Cruising Down the River,' and that sort of American orientation.
Speaker 1: The 'Moon River'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and all those (laughter), that sort of thing.  And so I, so I'd say that Calypso was there in the background and got big after I left with, with Marl--oh, what's his name, with Bob Marley.  But it was an orientation, I think, towards the American music, even jazz.  They were listening to that sort of a thing.  And, of course, times changed and went back to Bob Marley and that group.
Speaker 1: I know the most famous entertainer in the black community for a while was Harry Belafonte, you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, again, you see, that sort of brought a lot of pride to hear him sing 'Dao, Dao' and 'Carmen Banana,' 'Back to the Market' and so on.  It was very, very rich, and, but I say, I think that was in the background in the Jamaican society.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think later on it made it big.  For example, when I came to the United States, of course, you know, the person you could talk most about was Harry Belafonte, you see.  But, and the other singers of that time.  But in Jamaica, growing up, I don't think that it was--our orientation was towards the United States--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --music of the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27330
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?  What's the name of your first school?
Speaker 2: Got to a good high school.  It was called Calabar High School [Kingston, Jamaica].
Speaker 1: Now, this is your first school?
Speaker 2: Ele--you know, elementary schools are there, you know, central branch and so on, Mico Elementary School.  But, you know, we were in what third grade, fourth grade and so forth.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was asking about the early school.
Speaker 2: In those days?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, went to school.  Initially, when my mother [Ruth Elizabeth Gray] came to visit in the United States, I spent time with my grandmother and aunt in the country, and we went to school in the country, a school that was built mostly by my grandmother.  And my grandmother would provide the soups and everything for the students and the teachers because she was the landowner at the time in that region.  And--
Speaker 1: This is Grandmother Gray?
Speaker 2: Gray, Adina Gray.  And I remember we all had shoes, but I remember taking off the shoes to go to school to put the shoes on when you get to school, walking on that rocky, rocky streets at the time, dusty streets.  But that was to preserve the shoes (laughter).  That was very funny.  And, but that was in the country.  Then, my mother returned and went to live in Kingston [Jamaica].  And then we joined about three different elementary schools there.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when your mother went to the United States?
Speaker 2: I was, I would say about ten years old, ten years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then went to elementary schools.  I remember one is called Central Branch and another one called Mico, M-I-C-O.  And these are schools that my mother didn't teach at, but those were rough times, that, you know, you had a lot of--if you're late, you would be caned.  And, you know, it was a very rough time in those elementary schools.
Speaker 1: Now caned, with what kind of a, how heavy a stick were you hit with?
Speaker 2: A strap.
Speaker 1: Strap.
Speaker 2: There's a strap, and I sure got caned once at Mico because I was late to school.  And, of course, my mother took me out of that school and sent me to a second school; sort of, not uncivilized, you know, but that was the custom at the time.  You know, you could cane bad kids, you know, even if you don't think that you were bad.  And--
Speaker 1: Were your teachers Jamaican for the most part or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this caning was done by a student of my mother, who was the principal there, and she just couldn't understand why this man would, would be so rough on me (laughter), you know, but, but they were mostly Jamaicans in the elementary school system.  It changed when we went to high school.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a little kid, were there, did you have any indication or did you have any ideas about being a scientist when you were little?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It just didn't, think that we were just immature, kids just running around, you know, not particularly interested in anything, just at that point, at that point.  Later on, the interest came in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, were you keenly aware that you had relatives who were doctors and chemists and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and very proud, very proud of it.  You know, but as I said, at that level, I think these were just heroes that we heard about, very proud of the guy in North Carolina, or those that went away to, psychologists and psychiatrists that went away to Edinburgh [Scotland, United Kingdom] to study.  You know, those were just, those heroes, but not, not really delving deeply into their significance or what they were doing.  And I, I just think that we were just immature kids.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers at the elementary level that you remember that you really-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: None, none, none.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not at the elementary level.  I mean I remember the hard times better than I do remember the good times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'm sure there were good times because I think that we were just a little playful, playful, (laughter) immature kids.
Speaker 1: Now, how were your grades in grade school?
Speaker 2: I think, I think barely making it, barely making it at the time.  I just, I think that, I didn't take it seriously.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grades go down when your mother went to the United States?
Speaker 2: No, but the social life did go down, you know.  It just wasn't a very happy time.  It was a time when myself and my younger brother [Bernard Bradley Anderson] were struggling.  My sister [Shirley Payne Anderson] was boarded in the city, and my older brother [Abraham St. Aubyn Anderson], he spent most of his times with an aunt that was more affluent 'cause we sort of ended up with our father [Laurel Charles Anderson] too.  And times were rough.
Story_ID: 27331
Speaker 1: Now, so then in high school, at Calabar High School [Kingston, Jamaica]--
Speaker 2: Right, Calabar High School.  My older brother [Abraham St. Aubyn Anderston] went to Calabar, and performed very, very well.  Calabar was a Baptist--set up by white Baptist missionaries.  And most of the teachers were expatriates.  They were very good teachers, very strict, and I think me, personally, got into Calabar based upon the performance of my older brother because he was very bright.  And they said, "Oh, give this fellow a chance (laughter).  He has some sort of a pedigree," or something like that.  So anyway, Calabar, there is where I met my best friend.  He was a fellow named John Livermore.  And I met him because, he's a nice guy, but I had a bicycle.  And I would bicycle to and from school.  John didn't have a bicycle.  So I would tote him on my bike to and from school.  Then we remained great friends, not just with John, but his family, for the--all during our lifetime.  They, I, the classmates were also fascinating in Calabar, the high school.  And that's where you made the greatest relationships, memorable relationships in your--that's where my, where we got, we gained maturity that way.  We had a wonderful sports reputation at this school.  And we all did track.  Just like you have Mr. [Usain] Bolt as a track star today, well, we always had track.  Track was our avenue out, and prominence in the school system of the time.  And we were fort--I was fortunate to have people like Herb McKenley who was the, I think the four hundred meter Gold Medalist at Helsinki [1952 Helsinki Olympics, Helsinki, Finland] and, as our track coach.  And that was a very, very important part of our lives at Calabar.   Swimming was also very important, and we all tried to join the swim team there.  Academics, I, I think that not until I was about fifteen years old that that became very important to me, sort of a maturity and sort of had to get serious.  And I was able to pass the Cambridge High School Certificate examinations and the London High School Diploma.  And--
Speaker 1: So did you excel in math and science in those (unclear), (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, excelled in, in the humanities--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, but loved science, and especially the biological sciences.  But there was only one member of the family who went as far as the high school, London Diploma, and, you know, that's your, your entrance into university, by having those kinds of degrees.
Speaker 1: Explain, what's the difference between the--if you would, British system and the American system?
Speaker 2: Right, if you finished high school, with a high school diploma, you could immediately enter a university of West Indies or a London [England, United Kingdom] university.  And you could probably take, say if you did medicine or dentistry, it would probably take you three years to finish.  You could enter into professional schools at the time.  That was the basic difference.  You hardly could go to the one in Jamaica, University of the West Indies.  Competition was very, very stiff.  And you also had to have the funding because if your parents didn't have the funding, you could hardly get into those, into the University of the West Indies [Kingston, Jamaica].
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And so that is why many of us who didn't have that kind of background and funding and so on, even though we probably had the ability, would immigrate to the United States because there's where you would find sort of a little bit more egalitarian type of a society.  You could work and send yourself through school.
Story_ID: 27332
Speaker 1: Back to the high school, the, we had wonderful teachers who were expatriates and others who were not expatriates.  They were Jamaican.  I remember the best class that all high school kids at the time liked was a Latin class.  We had to do Latin by a Jamaican whose name is Mr. Grant.  They called him Grantus, and, of course, you know, steeped in declining verbs and nouns and that sort of a thing, you know.  So we did Latin.  Of course, it was a Baptist school.  So we had to do religion and, which was strong.  But one year towards the end of my career in high school, a young lady who got her Master's degree from the University of Indiana came and taught science and taught biology.
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Her name is Townsend, T-O-W-N, Townsend.  And she, I think she inspired most of that class to do science and mathematics.  She sort of brought a new, a new view on the scientific method, a new view of learning and in stimulating the students, other than the old, dry British teachers would teach there.  So very exciting, you know, and that was one of the greatest moves of my high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was a Jamaican?
Speaker 1: She was Jamaican.  But she got her, she got her--she's a half Chinese lady who got her degree from University of Indiana [Bloomington, Indiana], came back home and married a Jamaican.
Story_ID: 27333
Speaker 1: You entered at Calabar [High School, Kingston, Jamaica] at what age?
Speaker 2: At about fourteen, I think.
Speaker 1: Fourteen, okay, so this is 1954, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah, around that time, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did you, you stayed until you were--
Speaker 2: Six years, until I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's three years at Caliber.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, there's a big difference between the students who were boarded and those who were day students.  The boarded students were the children of ministers and Baptists--and Methodist ministers, and they lived there and had their lunches there every day, whereas the day students would, okay, would always get to school and the staple meal midday was the patties and the coco bread and a box, a box of milk.  I remember that.  That's what I remember all through, through high school, a little box of milk, a patty and a coco bread.  But that kept us.  But that still wasn't the kind of nutrition that you needed to be a track star or athletic--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --success.
Speaker 1: --we need a little translation here because unless we've been to Jamaica, we don't--what do you mean by a patty and--
Speaker 2: Patty is a, you see them here, at the Caribbean restaurants.  It's a little beef, ground beef-type stuff within a crust.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the coco bread was just simply a roll that would accommodate the size of a patty, and as I said, that and the box milk would suffice for lunch.
Speaker 1: It's almost like a little hamburger and a box of milk.
Speaker 2: But the patty has a crust around it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a nice, buttery crust.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it tastes better than a hamburger? (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, it tastes--and, you know, they sell it here all in the high schools for lunches.  In Kansas City [Missouri], they call them meat ball-meat boys or big boys and so forth.  But that's still a staple right here for the students in, at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  They go to the Negril Restaurant down the road and they eat their patty and their coco bread or maybe some soup for lunch.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this, so--
Speaker 2: So, we're at high school now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, did you run track so--
Speaker 2: Ran track and my biggest success, I'll put it this way, was to be a part of the high school track team that won the national track meets.  And I remember the outline was "They brought home the cup".  This is a big thing, you know, because it's these top schools that go to the pen relays and so forth and produce the great runners.  And I remember that, "They brought home the cup."  I was probably one of the biggest boys there, and I don't think that I contributed many points.  But my team still won.  I've been trying to find that magazine or newspaper article so that I can show my children, to say, "Listen, I was a track star at the time" (laughter), can't find it, no proof (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, what did you run?  What do you think you ran (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Ran in the relays, four by--at that time, it was four by one hundred yards.  And also threw the discus and the shot put at the time.  As I said, the rest of the team was probably better than I was.  I don't think I--but I contributed many points, but we still won the championship.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are four men on the team each running a hundred yards?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, you have the eliminations and so on, and then you have the, from all the other schools, you have about five or six in the finals.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were fast, you were a sprinter.
Speaker 2: Was a sprinter at the time.  You wouldn't believe it now, but I can't prove it (laughter).
Speaker 1: That article's there somewhere, but that's, yeah, that's interesting.  So you were really--did you play soccer too, or anything?
Speaker 2: Play soccer, played cricket, and you sort of had to play those games because, you know, you had intercollegiate competitions, and there was meets and so on.  But I think that track was my--was motivated to do track, especially since we had such stars that went before us, Herb McKinley, Arthur Went, these Olympiads and so on that came back to school, to the high school, to help develop the track.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, very much like what they're doing with people like Usain Bolt right now, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Usain Bolt, the fastest human for the--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: --last ten years, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He's one of the fastest men.
Speaker 2: And so we were lucky.  Usain grew up in the country, but still, you know, it was the same impetus to do a lot of track and to, and to train.  But we were very fortunate with our coaches.
Speaker 1: Okay, there's an image in my mind of Jamaican track men running down the beach.  Was that--did you all practice on the beach or anything?
Speaker 2: No, we don't (laughter), no, no, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: no, like, 'Cool Runnings,' remember 'Cool Runnings,' we did not (laughter), you know, training,  getting used to the cold by sitting in a refrigerator and so, no, no, we didn't do all that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: Very formal relationships.
Story_ID: 27334
Speaker 1: Now, you say you were one of the first in your family to pass certain tests that--
Speaker 2: The Cambridge and London exams.
Speaker 1: The Cambridge and London exams.  Now, with all of the doctors and scientists in the family, you were the first to pass those exams?
Speaker 2: The first to pass those.  But--
Speaker 1: How common is it for anyone (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But they were brighter than I was
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think it's just that I just was fortunate to go further than they did in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so did these, by passing these exams, were you qualified for any kind of financial assistance or scholarships?
Speaker 2: If you were more outstanding, yes, you could get things like scholarships to go to the, the university there.  But as I said, that was still based on the, on class, to get into those, to get into the University of the West Indies [Kingston, Jamaica] and on money.  If your parents didn't have enough money to pay your tuition and so on, you couldn't get in.  It was easier and more practical to come, to immigrate to the states.
Speaker 1: So, so there's no, no financial scholarship that--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There were, there were.  But you had to be really exceptional to qualify for those.
Speaker 1: Well, it seems like--so passing these two tests is not exceptional enough to--
Speaker 2: Enough to go to school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but not enough to give you a scholarship to the University in the West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so your relatives who did not pass these--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were able to take their degree and come to the United States and get into school--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --in the United States?
Speaker 2: --absolutely.  This was considered the savior at the time.
Speaker 1: Now, it's been said, I know a lot of people, in fact, they used to debate it in the historical associations about the, whether West Indian students were smarter when they came here than (laughter) the people--
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --I mean or had a better education when they arrived in the United States than the Americans?
Speaker 2: That's what you'd think, you know, but when I came here, even though I'd passed these exams, maybe it was the accent or something like that, but I still had to take a course in remedial mathematics, and a course in remedial English, even though I think I spoke as--English as well as anybody else.  But this was the system.  You come here.  They put you in those areas because they, I don't think they understood.  Things have changed, I think.  I think now that you can get exemptions from taking those remedial courses.
Speaker 1: So you think you were pigeonholed to go to those courses because you had an accent, rather than--
Speaker 2: Yeah, in part, in part--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --because of any written tests or anything?
Speaker 2: Right, there was no, in my time, there were no written tests.  It was automatically put me in remedial mathematics and remedial English.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know so many of the men of letters in the early part of the century, in New York and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the East Coast were West Indians.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And like W. A. Domingo and [Marcus] Garvey and all of his associates--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --J. A. Rodgers, and all these writers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Cyril Briggs and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you would think that--and most of these men just had a high school education--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --from Jamaica.
Speaker 2: And people like Garvey had a lot of experience in writing for the newspapers and so on at the time.  You know, they were brilliant and not given the credit for their abilities, you know, here.  You know, but of course, Garvey, of course, he was able to expound his philosophy and so forth and, but this must have been a peculiarity for the young person at the time, coming into college here.  And let me say, though, that I appreciated taking a course in, in English, a beginning course in English.  And I appreciated the American system because it sort of broadened your mind.  It was not the pinhole view of Britain or even Jamaica.  Coming here, for example, I enrolled in a course called, simply 'Social Sciences,' taught by a half-blind professor named Chancellor [James] Williams.  That was the best experience I ever had 'cause you're able to sit down and listen to new perspectives in education and to really learn about the U.S. culture.  I had a course with a woman named Lorraine Williams.  You probably have heard of her.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chancellor Williams too?
Speaker 2: Chancellor Williams.
Speaker 1: He was the chairman of the history department, here, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, and tremendous, you know, chancellor.  He was, he wrote a book called 'The Raven,' and I'd never sat in a class using a book or reading a book that a professor had done, you know.  Later on, here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], I had the best group of teachers I could ever find.  I had English from Toni Morrison, you know.  She was a young writer and, at the time, but it was just absolutely wonderful, just listening to the young people.  She was sort of like that lady, Ms. Townsend, I told you about in the high school.  And so, Howard and I imagine many of the historically black schools, was an area of enlightenment, enlightenment for many of us who had good backgrounds, getting into maturity where you could feel that you, you loved something, and you could really immerse yourself in something.  This is what Howard did for me, and I'm sure many of my peers at the time.
Story_ID: 27335
Speaker 1: I just wanted to go back and have you describe your, how you made the transition from--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, Calabar [High School, Kingston, Jamaica]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school at Calabar--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --did you have college counseling from anyone?
Speaker 2: Nothing, nothing like that.  I, you had two choices, people in my situation.  My brother [Abraham St. Aubyn Anderson] was already in the United States.  My sister [Shirley Payne Anderson] had gone to London [England, United Kingdom], and there was no money to really do much with me.  So after Calabar, I worked one year in Jamaica at a job at the mail office, pulling bags of mail.  Then my uncle got me a little job in new accounts at the bank, and I think just fouled up a lot of people's bank books (laughter), because I didn't, wasn't very good at it.  But then, I had a choice.  My type of person in this family setting would either be a teacher or a preacher.  And they're all ready to send me to the Methodist Man School to become a Methodist minister.  And my mother [Ruth Elizabeth Gray] made the mistake of asking me, "What did you want to do?"  And I said I wanted to come to the United States to be a dentist, to prepare to become a dentist.  And that was a ploy that we all used because at that time, the island needed dentists, and you could only get off if you said you wanted to be a dentist.  And so I used that ploy, but you had to show some monies to back it up, and so my mother and her sister and a couple friends of mine, the Livermore's, got enough money to let me get to the United States.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and I came here, and I remember, it was on the old BOAC [British Overseas Airways Corporation] airplanes.  And I remember my father [Laurel Charles] didn't see me off, and that was the last time I saw my father.  But on the plane, I saw him driving a little truck, coming to the airport.  It was too late.  And my mother gave me two things.  She said, "Here is a little bible, and here's fifty dollars.  Go see your uncle in Wilmington [North Carolina]" and then to my older brother in Washington [D.C.].  So I still have the bible.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is in 1958?
Speaker 2: 1958.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Seventeen years old, going on towards eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's the transition.
Story_ID: 27336
Speaker 1: Of course, I came here [to Washington, D.C.] in the winter, and I hated the snow.  And my brother had the little room in northeast Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Now, did you have a coat, a good coat?
Speaker 1: I, I got a coat, yes, I had a coat.  And, and I had a hat, you know, old man's type of a hat (laughter), from wearing that in the states.  But came here, and lived in the room with my brother who had a switchboard job at Winthrop House in Washington.  And I remember no money to, to do very much, and my brother took my fifty dollars, bought groceries and took me to a store, a place called York Haberdashers here and got a coat, bought a coat, a plaid coat, you know, saying, in the United States, you have to look good (laughter), you know.  So I carried that plaid all through my career at Howard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and even, took it even to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  But the fifty dollars was essentially gone.  And so he got me a job that same week at the Winthrop House.  And I think the manager was just very sympathetic because he was a good employee there at the switchboard.  And he, then she let me dig weeds between certain stones in the cold, but I was able to make some money there and did that for about a year, working there.  Then I, eventually, when my brother finished the switchboard, I took on the job at the switchboard from--it was from eleven o'clock until seven o'clock in the morning on the switchboard.  Of course, it was an open lobby, and everybody would come in and sneak a couple of bits of sleep when you can.  And I, my younger brother [Bernard Bradley Anderson] inherited the job when I left.  So we had that job for almost twelve years.
Speaker 2: Now, this is at the--where is this at?
Speaker 1: Bernard.
Speaker 2: No, the place of employment is called?
Speaker 1: It's Winthrop House.
Speaker 2: Winthrop House.
Speaker 1: Winthrop House, and it's right there at 1727 Massachusetts Avenue--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --near DuPont Circle [Washington, D.C.].  And so after my younger brother left, he gave it to one of his friends.  So thank God for Winthrop House, and that switchboard job.  Seven o'clock, we would leave the job, rush to Howard [University], go to a deli and get some sandwiches from a little Italian fellow who sold sandwiches up there on the Howard's [University, Washington, D.C.] campus and go to classes, then go back home after classes, five, six o'clock, get some--get a couple hours of sleep, and then go back to work the next day, next--eleven o'clock.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So as a switchboard operator and, so that was, that was rough, you know, but, you know, I remember not having enough money to get to school.  And my brother's ears would be frost bitten, you know, with all the cold because we had to walk a couple of miles to the university.
Story_ID: 27337
Speaker 1: So it's within this context that you, you know, start classes and--
Speaker 2: Started classes.
Speaker 1: --and, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --and meeting some of the great faculty and students at Howard.
Speaker 1: And you were telling us during the break, you were talking about Mordecai Johnson and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you said you could watch him--
Speaker 2: Right.  We're talking about 19--, in the '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s].  Mordecai in his gray or black suit and coat would be walking from his house, which was on the campus, to the chapel every Sunday.  And the girls' dormitory was right next to the president's house.  And one of the interesting sights I remember is when, every Sunday, they would be walking in their white dresses and white gloves, little ladies, perfect ladies, walking from the dormitory to the chapel, really a memorable sight.  You don't see that much anymore.  That even continued to when Cheek, President James Cheek, was here.  And since then, they tore down the president's house and that formality, I think, ceased.
Speaker 1: So, now, there were so many great teachers on the campus--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and I just--
Speaker 2: Yes, and this you can't forget.  As I said, even having to take the remedial courses was good for me 'cause it sort of brought the sense of maturity, not just, you know, Franklin Frazier and all those guys were here.  Unfortunately, never took a course from him, but, you know, they were great physicists at the time, [Halson] Eagleson and Branson in physics, and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Dr. Herman Branson, yes.
Speaker 2: Branson is the closest that we have had to getting a Noble Prize in medicine, is the work of Branson, and Linus Pauling.  We had a great scientist in Lloyd Ferguson in chemistry.  He wrote the first wonderful textbook of organic chemistry, used not just at Howard, but at white schools, brilliant guy.  Percy Julian had just left.  We had people like Harold Finley who, who was the last head of the department of zoology and the zoology department is important because it was founded and, by Ernest Everett Just, favorite--famous, black developmental biologist or cell biologist.
Speaker 1: Now, the building we're in is named for Just.
Speaker 2: Right, and that's one thing when I came back to Howard and became chair, I fought to get this building named after Ernest Everett Just, just like I'm fighting right now to get the chemistry building named after Percy Julian who used to be here.  The great--what my memories are like off, taking time off, and going to the fine arts, School of Fine Arts and listening to Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee who used to come down and would give courses and would chat with the students.  That was memorable for me, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee.  They, listening to and getting to know people like, later on in life, like Lucius Walker, who you know.
Speaker 1: Dr. Lucius Walker, yeah.
Speaker 2: Dr. Lucius Walker--
Speaker 1: Engineer.
Speaker 2: --who came to town.  I think he got his Ph.D. at nineteen years old or something like that.  And he came here in his little car that had no top, a convertible.  You know, he was a young man in town, you know, very fascinating.
Story_ID: 27338
Speaker 1: For me, the experiences are meeting somebody like Stokely Carmichael and SNCC [Student's Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], the organ--the civil rights organization, and for, imagination an immigrant kid in college going with another immigrant leader like Stokely Carmichael to North Carolina to boycott restaurants and, and that sort of action.
Speaker 2: So did you do that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with, with--but, of course, Stokely was the leader.  You know, we were just followers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's from Trinidad.
Speaker 1: He's from Trinidad, you see, and, you know, great experience.  Only at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] would you find this, that you would have Malcolm X here, and you have the guy who, actor who played Malcolm X, and Al Freeman just died.
Speaker 2: Al Freeman, Jr., right?
Speaker 1: Just died, you know, but here at Howard.  I mean I don't know where else you would find this kind of a history, just, just tremendous, especially the College of Arts and Sciences, you know, where they'd get you the breath of education.  I mean how fortunate I was to be able to go to hear, the 'I Have a Dream' speech, which is just down the road from the university, you know, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and the others.
Speaker 2: In 1963, yeah.
Speaker 1: '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: The March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were, those were experiences, as I say, where else but Howard would you find that?  I mean you did have it Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and you did have it at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and all those places, you know, but Howard is just so centrally located, in capital and such a, greatest diversity of students that you could ever find.  And I'll call Howard the--I call Howard the equalizer, if you're rich, if you're poor.  If you're, whatever ethnic group you belong to, you're all the same, you know.  Howard was the equalizer.
Speaker 2: Now, do you remember Dr. [William Leo] Hansberry?  Was he there when you--
Speaker 1: Hansberry?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Tremendous, tremendous, and Hansbrough,  which was the student of Ernest Everett Just, great developmental biologist who got his degree from Harvard [University], equally brilliant people, all on campus.
Story_ID: 27339
Speaker 1: All this wealth of information and ideas here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], how did you decide what to major in?
Speaker 2: I had great mentors.  And there was a fellow named Howard Finley who was among the first black graduates from the University of Wisconsin [Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], and he had a younger faculty along with him.  His name was Charles Brown, also a graduate from the University of Wisconsin, prominent biologist.  There's no greater protozoologist than Harold Finley and cytologists like Charles Brown.  But not just that.  There was a professor here, his name is David Lincicome.  He was German, who taught parasitology.  And all together, those people really encouraged you to do sciences.  These were mentors.  If they felt that you had a motivated student or somebody with some--showed some sort of passion, they would really gear in on you, focus on you and help you.  When I finished my Master's here with Charles Brown and Finley, I wanted to stay at Howard because we already had a Ph.D. program here.  And they say, "No, you can't stay at Howard; you gotta move on."  And so I moved on to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].  And--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: But that's still, just--I didn't mean to interrupt you but I just wanted to, I know like, what was it that turned the spark in you that made you want to study biology?
Speaker 2: The ability or impossibility to invent, find new things.  Working with Lincicome, for example, he worked with blood-born parasites, trypanosomes, sleeping sickness bugs.  And, of course, his, he was highly motivated, highly accomplished in the physiology of these animals.  But nobody knew the morphology.  And so I was given the task to do the morphology of these, and to apply morphology to function.  And it was with the guidance of Finley, and a mentor at Brown whose name is Richard Ellis that allowed us to find in these trypanosomes the largest deposit of mitochondrial DNA.  And you will recall that, at this time, mitochondrial DNA and its discovery was in its infancy.  They didn't have the techniques to show in a cell the mitochondria in there.  But by chance, I had lucked up on finding the largest deposit of mitochondrial DNA in these things.  At that time, they called this body, they thought that this body was a parasite.  But it might have been an evolution, this parasite that got integrated into a regular eukaryotic cell.  But the cell became dependent upon the mito--the parasite for its own survival.  The parasite, mitochondrial DNA provided essential RNA's and proteins that the eukaryotic cell did not have.  So there was a sort of a symbiosis, symbiotic relationship between them.  And then, of course, it's not known anymore as a parasite.  It's part of the cell, cell that now contains huge deposit of mitochondrial DNA.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, let me just bracket this.  Now, this is when you're in--
Speaker 2: As a graduate student--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: As a graduate student?
Speaker 2: Undergraduate and graduate.
Speaker 1: Undergraduate and graduate--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --working with David Lincicome.
Speaker 2: David Lincicome was a professor here.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, all right.
Speaker 2: Charles Brown and so on.  But they--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --gave us the opportunity to discover, to work independently and guided to do research on whatever subject you wanted.
Speaker 1: Now, had you declared biology or zoology as your major--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes,--
Speaker 1: --before--
Speaker 2: --I had, I had.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just understanding--
Speaker 2: Major in zoology--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and a minor in chemistry and physics--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and tried to get as much math as you could.  So I had declared that because this was the love that I had, you know, for, for the science.  I think they detected that there was some sort of a passion and commitment, and they pushed and pushed and pushed.
Story_ID: 27340
Speaker 1: So this is in--we're talking about 19--
Speaker 2: '62 [1962], '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: '[6]2 [1962], '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: '63 [1963], yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: So then we move on to Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island].
Speaker 1: Okay, but, all right, so that's the focus of your research is this discovery of--
Speaker 2: At that time.
Speaker 1: --this large concentration of mito--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: At that time.
Speaker 1: --chondrial--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: DNA.  That sort of brought us into the literature, the national literature.  You know, when you published your first citation, citation index among the best articles of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is--what you're actually saying--and I'm gonna slow this down just so anybody watching this understands what you're saying, is that this research here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --uncovered this, I guess the, a large concentration of mitochondrial DNA that was--I mean people were trying--knew about it--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but they didn't have a proper specimen to study it then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --is that what you were saying?
Speaker 2: They were localizing it in plants and in other animal cells.  But it's just that we localize the largest deposit of this mitochondrial DNA in this special bug that we were studying.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the first time this had been done anywhere?  And this is--, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: On this system, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said, done at Howard, and continued at Brown.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right, so they, when you--so you went to Brown to work on your Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Yes, by chance.  You know, you reach a point when your mentor says you gotta get away from here.  And I looked at the little flyer.  It was an ad about Brown University.  And I looked at other places like Wash-U [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri], and I said, "Oh, well, maybe I ought to go back into the British system," and we looked into schools in Ireland [United Kingdom] and Heidelberg [Germany] and so forth.  But why leave the country when you're sort of at a small high in your career.  Now, Brown accepted me, and I'm not so sure that was, what they call it now--I think they accepted me because of my abilities.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It wasn't--
Speaker 1: --graduate with honors when you got your Master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And so I think it was on my abilities, but, you know, right now, they're talking about quotas and that sort of a thing.  But I think that I was doing well enough, grades were good, consistent, and I think they accepted me.  But that, I thought that I'd go to the promise land at this New England university.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was, again, a bitter-sweet experience.
Speaker 1: So this is Fall of 1963, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is right after the March on Washington--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --took place here, and all--
Speaker 2: Yes, this is--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're on your way--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --right before, right before [President] Lyndon Johnson's thing, you know, marches, or presidency, you know.  It sort of sort of opened up the whole Civil Rights era.  As I said, I don't think that it was affirmative action that got me to Brown.  I think it was, I think that I had the skills.
Story_ID: 27341
Speaker 1: Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island], this is 1963, well, go ahead, go ahead, I'm caught up now.
Speaker 2: The skills.  The university, at that time, the department that I went into had accepted two blacks and an Asian, a fellow named Unacar from India.  You hardly found any blacks in the field there, which was in biomedical sciences.  Living was awful because you got the impression that Brown would accommodate you in some dormitory or something like that.  But then you would go to the various--you had to go to the city to look for rooms, and, of course, you were denied the opportunity to get into the rooms; finally ended up in a rooming house filled with people from Turkey and some old Irish men.  This rooming house had an old lady who sort of took care of it, very little heat, and seven of us would share a bathroom, lots of problems because of the cleanliness of the bathrooms.  You know, the old Irish guy would shed his hair and the Turks would, whatever, do their shavings or whatever there.  There'd be fighting over that all the time.  Cooking was on a little hot plate at the time, very little heat from the hot plate.  You would get into the room and then you'd go underneath the covers with your clothes on until you warmed up (laughter), you know, so it was, it was rough times.  And I would walk from that rooming house to the university.  And at night, walking back, there was always a policemen in his car, walking behind, riding behind me and watch me to get to the, get to the rooming house, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, Brown's in what, Providence--
Speaker 2: Providence, Rhode Island, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Providence, Rhode Island, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, you still had a lot of segregation and problems there.  But the university had the best academic program of the time.  They were about to form a medical school, and you had the geniuses of the time working there to form this new medical school, which I think broke down the fantastic biology program that they had, biomedical sciences program that they had.  They, they--thirteen people got accepted into the class, and it was divided into six-week sections, segments.  We had six weeks of biochemistry, six weeks of biology, cell biology and molecular biology, taught by the great guys of the time.  And I never got a grade from Brown during these times.  They, they would charge you based upon your performance in the classroom, and every morning from nine until twelve and then the afternoon until five o'clock, you always had four faculty members with their specialties sitting in the room with you, looking at articles, current articles, old articles, discussions, you know.  So they got to know the students, and they got to know the--the students got to know the professors and so on.  It was absolutely a fantastic relationship.  I met some of the best scientists at the time.  Then at the end of two years, or the end of a year and a half or two, they said, all right, you're accepted into the Ph.D. program.  Go and write your dissertation.  And I did my dissertation on a subject called 'Compensatory Hypertrophy of the Kidney' after, after cutting out the kidney.  You'd look at the growth of the remaining kidney, how the cells grew and how they functioned.  That was the dissertation topic.
Speaker 1: And okay, now, it's--does this have to do with the action of estrogen.
Speaker 2: That's later.
Speaker 1: That's later, okay.  So that's--
Speaker 2: They're showing the difference is that here you're involved in trypanosomes.  Here you're involved at the same time, doing work on growth and differentiation of the kidney cells, and at the same time, I got interested in what you call spermatology, the organism that help form the sperm, the mature sperm, the differentiation of the sperm.  And we found in simple organisms like the earthworm sperm, as it developed, there was a system of tubules called microtubules that sounded the nucleus and the rest of cytoplasm and actually formed the shape of the original, the final sperm structure, would be--the system of microtubule is called the manshettes, absolutely fascinating.  So all that was going on, and I think I had about six publications in my graduate career at Brown, all due to good mentoring and the ability and the opportunity to do research at the area.  Of course, you had to teach, and so when I got there, they put me in a class by a teacher called Paul Weiss, and he was a horror, you know.  He was tough.  He had just written his book on zoology, and so it was absolutely scary because working with him and also working with the brightest bunch of students you could ever find, I'm talking about undergraduates at Pembroke [College, Oxford, United Kingdom] that were there.  You had to keep in, keep ahead.  That was very, very difficult, but sort of, you had to learn a lot real fast.
Story_ID: 27342
Speaker 1: We, we went over your dissertation kind of fast, so, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --can we go back?  What was the title of it again?
Speaker 2: 'Compensatory Hypertrophy after Renal Ablation.'
Speaker 1: Hypertrophy--
Speaker 2: Growth.
Speaker 1: Okay, after--
Speaker 2: Renal ablation.
Speaker 1: Renal ablation, okay.
Speaker 2: The area was in vogue because they were interested in things like liver transplantation.  When you remove a lobe of the liver, the cells divide and hypertrophy, and they form another--they don't form another lobe, but the cells that are there, they got larger and they were--and they maintained their functions.  We wanted to know if this was the same in the kidney.  So you eliminate one kidney, and then the other kidney has to do all the functioning for the body.  What happens there?  We found out that the cells did not divide as they did in the liver.  But the cells hypertrophied.  They grew, they got larger, especially in certain parts of the tubules that were doing a lot of work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's what our results showed from this dissertation.  It was important at the time because there were great guys like D'Arcy Thompson who wrote books on growth and form, great, great, growth, developmental biologist who studied growth and form.  And so I had a professor, his name is Richard Goss, who pioneered this area, this field.  He was interested in antlers of deer's, and you cut one off, and then he looks at the growth of the cells and that division of the cells in the other antler, that sort of thing.  So anyway, the kidney was just a good model to see what happened.  It didn't do exactly what the liver did, but it remained, maintained its function by having some of the cells get larger--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, so playing this back to you as a layman who knows nothing about any of this, what you're saying is that in the liver cells, if the liver is damaged or is diminished, the new cells grow.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But in the kidney, if one kidney is lost--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --then the second kidney does more work, just gets stronger--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Gets stronger.
Speaker 1: --and the cells don't increase.  They just become bigger and stronger.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the liver you had a population of cells that were absolutely fantastic.  They are close to the blood supply, and those cells are the first, the last to die if you give them liver poisons, and the first to regenerate, and they just grew and grew and grew.  And they made bigger lobes and inside the--lobules inside the liver.  The kidney just grew, just enlarged.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious though.  What did Richard Goss's deer antler study show?  What happens if you cut off one antler and--
Speaker 2: The same thing, lots of mitosis, lots of growth, division.
Speaker 1: So the one antler gets bigger?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: It's much bigger, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it from new cells, I guess (simultaneous)--new cell growth?
Speaker 2: New cells.
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess it would have to be with antlers.
Story_ID: 27343
Speaker 1: Now, before we get away from Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island], tell us about Elizabeth LaDuke?
Speaker 2: Right, you know, Brown allowed you to have many mentors, Richard Ellis, Richard Goss, Elizabeth LaDuke.  She was the, the product of a professor there called J. Walter Wilson.  A building is named after J. Walter Wilson.  She was a great cancer biologist, and she would spend every summer at labs in France called Village Reef in France.  And she was the person that said, "Winston, what do--would you like to go to France and continue your research?"  I said, "Why not?"  You know, I didn't have anything else to do at the time.  So I got an American Cancer Society fellowship to go to France to work with, at her recommendation, work with a fellow named John Andre.  John Andre was the most charismatic scientist you could ever find and a good scientist.  And at that time, he was involved in identifying mitochondrial DNA in different protozoa and in different plants.  And he was one of the first to isolate the mitochondrial DNA and look at it as single DNA particles, isolated from the cell.  So it was really wonderful.  But John Andre was a generalist as a cell biologist.  And again, just like Brown [University], they allowed you to work on what you wanted to work.  So he knew that I was interested, as I told you earlier on in the manchette, those microtubules that have formed heads of sperm.  And then we took off, and we became, founded a society there called Society for Spermatology, International Society for Spermatology, groups from Italy, from Sweden, Europe, all over and the United States.  And with one prime person, his name is Don Fawcett who was to become one of my most important mentors, Don Fawcett.  Now--
Speaker 1: Now, what year is the society formed?
Speaker 2: This is '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: In '66 [1966], okay.
Speaker 2: '66, we're dealing with now, '66 [1966] to '68 [1968].  At the University of Paris [Paris, France] I think I came out with about twelve publications on spermatology, structure, function of sperm.  On stuff dealing with mitochondrial metamorphosis, during spermiogenisis, the differentiation of sperm and identifying things like DNA in the sperm mitochondria of different animals and looking at the impregnation of the egg with sperm.  In other words, use the electron-microscope to watch where the sperm binds with surface of the egg, how it gets incorporated.  That's important because not only could you--the question was, does the sperm DNA in their, in their mitochondrial, contribute to the differentiation of the egg and the embryonic system?  In most systems, it seems like the sperm DNA just breaks down.  But in our system of the sea urchins that we looked, we found that the sperm mitochondria with its DNA fused with the egg mitochondria with its DNA and was carried on into the embryo.  So we believe that the sperm or paternal mitochondrial DNA had something to do--or just not eliminated.  It may have had something to do with the differentiation of the embryo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those were interesting years.  You met some of the great scientists of the world, and made the best connections that you could ever have.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned John Andre--
Speaker 2: John Andre, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Emanuel Foray, Ferme--
Speaker 2: Fremiet.
Speaker 1: Fremiet.
Speaker 2: Fora--Fremiet was one of the protozoologist of the time, and he worked very closely with John Andre.  He was an old man, so he used John Andre's laboratories and really sort of one of the great advisors of the area.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about--there's a person called "Person"--
Speaker 2: Paul Personne.
Speaker 1: Personne?
Speaker 2: Personne, he was a student of Andre.  And he and I specialized in a very unique spermatozoan.  This spermatozoan, and most sperm have the head, where you have the nucleus and the DNA.  And then they have a body that just contains mitochondria, and the mitochondria provides the energy for the motility of the sperm.  But this unique sperm had in its body a compartment that contained glycogen.  And it used that glycogen to make ATP or energy for the sperm, and the difference of the mitochondria for the sperm to move.  So it was a very, very unique thing, and you know, and it was time where we would develop techniques.  Very few people knew how to demonstrate the presence of glycogen.  We found glycogen everywhere in these cells, in the flagella, in the mitochondria, all over.  So we hypothesized that they were, this was a source of glycolytic ATP.  In addition to the ATP coming from mitochondria for the propulsion and movement of these sperm.  And that was fun.
Story_ID: 27344
Speaker 1: You mentioned, you mentioned Don Fawcett.
Speaker 2: Don Fawcett.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So after I left Paris [France], I got a post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 1: This is '67 [1967] or '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: '67 [1967], yeah, '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: '67 [1967], okay.
Speaker 2: Post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard to work with Don Fawcett.  Now, Don Fawcett is the Rembrandt of cell biology.  Every--he made an atlas of every known cell, and this same atlas, right now is being used throughout the world as the model for anatomy of all cells.  He was a physician, but totally dedicated to research, very dramatic fellow, very wonderful fellow and a great mentor.  And he, he was interested in me because of my interests in sperm development and differentiation, as well as in those microtubules that I told you about.  And so with Don Fawcett, I guess the great contribution was to identify the structure and the function of microtubules as it related to sperm differentiation.  So he was there--I was there for one year as a post-doc.  Then he gave me an instructorship in the Department of Anatomy at Harvard Medical School.  And from then on, I went on to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, and lots of people mentioned here on the outlines.  I don't wanna let 'em go by without some kind of reference, but Harold Amos, Sanford Palay, Betty Hay, Torsten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Weisel,--
Speaker 2: Yeah, those were some of the great professors at Harvard [University] at the time.  And you should know that Harold Amos in my career, was the only African American scientist that I came across as I was going through academics at the time, occur at the time.  He was a physiologist and he became the dean of the graduate school at Harvard.  So one didn't work exactly with him, but he was there all the time that I was there as a real serious model.  Others there, Torsten Wiesel and the others were very important in the development of programs that accommodated blacks and Latinos in the sciences.  It was their strength that brought the first, brought a bunch of black students into the medical school and into the graduate school there.  And the greatest among them is a fellow named Morris Carnovsky, probably not mentioned there--
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Morris Carnovsky, an immigrant from South Africa.  He became chairman of the department of pathology, but, of course, there was Apartheid in South Africa and so forth, but he was one of the great mentors and the people who believe in education of underrepresented minority groups.  He was always thinking.  He was a creator of things.  You know, he could, he could solve the puzzle of cells and one of the best scientist that I have come across.  He's still alive in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what about, I know Arnold Seligman is (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: At Harvard [University], Seligman was a professor in New York, and he helped us with the bad chemistry of the, of different cells and in developing different techniques that was to prove important in my later career.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --he and a fellow named Jacob Hanker helped us do the diaminobenzidine reaction to show respiration in mitochondria as well as the localized different enzymes in the cell, different peroxidases in the cell.
Story_ID: 27345
Speaker 1: In '75 [1975], this is like 1975 when you--no, when you come to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], it's '75 [1975], but--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you teach at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in the department of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, teach at Harvard--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --anatomy.
Speaker 2: In anatomy
Speaker 1: In anatomy, okay.  And what year--that's from '6--
Speaker 2: '69 [1969], no, '68 [1968], '70 [1970], I think, '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 1970, and then had to find a job.  And so I had three choices.  One Stanley Bennett invited me to go to University of North Carolina [Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] as a professor there.  Morehouse Medical School [Atlanta, Georgia] was just being formed, and Lou Sullivan invited me to chair the department of anatomy at Morehouse Medical School.  But then I had the chance to take the lab of a fellow named [William] Bloom who was a famous histochemist and anatomist at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So I took that job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: University of Chicago.  And took the job there and in five years, made tenure, one of the four black tenured faculty members there, including John Hope Franklin.  And I left Chicago for Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] in 1975.
Speaker 1: Now did you know, had you known John Hope Franklin at Howard when he was at the history department?
Speaker 2: No, I knew him in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Speaker 1: So that was somebody, though, that you--did you ever talk about Howard days with him?
Speaker 2: No, no, no I (unclear) didn't take any courses.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he was, he had tenure there too, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, any stories about the University of Chicago in these days--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were there from 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970] to '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970] to '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: You know, being fresh out of, out of Harvard and so on, you occupied a very interesting position there.  They put me to teach the freshmen medical class, and in cell biology and histology, about one hundred and fifty students or so.  And those are good experiences because I learned on the job about how to teach.  And the students created the first outstanding teachers, teaching award for professors in the area, which I, in fact, got.  Chicago, absolutely, the most magnificent place you could ever find for research and academics.
Story_ID: 27346
Speaker 1: I had a chance to work with the Ben May Cancer Center, and there is where they first identified something called the estrogen receptor where estrogen bound to a protein in this cell, and then from there on it created its activities.  But I also had a chance to work with a fellow named Charlie [Charles] Huggins and, and [A.] Hari Reddi.  And he was a Nobel Laureate.  And they were interested in the formation of new bone called ectopic bone, and what we did is we ground up old bone and teeth and all that sort of stuff, stuck it underneath the skin of an animal and watched it develop into new bone.  They needed to know the process, and so they called on me as a cell biologist to say, "What's going on here?"  And so we were able to find that the bone grew by a process called endochondral ossification, where if-- the material that was impregnated--was put inside the animal induced stem cells to form cartilage.  And from cartilage, it grew up into bone.
Speaker 2: So this is--is this useful bone?  So it was inserted--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --near the bone of the--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: It was inserted near a diseased bone or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, the whole idea is that if something got wrong with your bone, you could use that same material to produce new bone.  If you lost a limb or something like that, you could put that, and it's still a very, very important field right now, how to repair the damages of bone, how to get the long bones in your body, for example, to continue to grow.  They didn't know the procedure, but the procedure was by this endochondral ossification.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So right now, it's a big field, where they're trying to develop new bone from hydroxyapatite and collagen and all that sort of a thing, very big field right now.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it would seem, and I'm not--as I said, I'm just a layman, and I'm listening to this, but so is the major problem with this trying to control the growth of the bone or, or you know, direct the growth?  I mean I--you know, so--
Speaker 1: So I cut a skull, and I want to replace that skull with bone, you know, replace the hole in the skull.  I can put this material in there and get it to go over and recapture the--
Speaker 2: And the skin will knit with the bone--
Speaker 1: Knit with the old--
Speaker 2: --old bone.
Speaker 1: Knit with the old.
Speaker 2: It would seem like in a long bone, it'd be more difficult to do.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, what you do is if you, if you--what they have done is they've been taking old pieces of bone and then they insert this material and watch it grow back.  So it's the bone replacement, whether in the skull or whether in the long bones or anywhere else.  It's huge in orthopedic research labs at this point.  But Huggins and Reddi wanted to know what--how it did this, and it did this by this process I mentioned endochondral ossification.  And actually what happened is the cartilage that is formed gets invaded by blood vessels, and then stem cells from the bone marrow insert into the new bone area, and form new red cells, new white cells and so forth.  Just imagine if you had sickle cell anemia and somehow you could obliterate all the bad progenitor cells for sickle cell red cells and then induce new red cell formation by some mechanism in the new bone, you could somehow solve or help the problems of sickle cell anemia.  Some people are working on that still.  But we left that subject.
Story_ID: 27347
Speaker 1: But it was in Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I think I, I did much of the early work that was significant.  Working with people like [Jacob] Hanker and [Arnold] Seligman we, we perfected the technique to show hormones and--to show enzymes that are, that are peroxidatic or peroxidase type enzymes and so on.  We were able to show that in every tissue of the body that has receptors for estrogen--I told you about [Elwood] Jensen identifying these estrogens, every tissue of the body that had estrogen receptors also produced, most prominently a bad chemical marker called estrogen induced peroxidase.  So we were able to show in the vagina and the uterus and all sorts of estrogen-dependent breast cancers, and lately in the cells of the hypothalamus, that have estrogen receptors, they also produced this estrogen-induced peroxidase.  And you could see it biochemically, and you could see it histochemically.  And so we're prominently involved in the identification of bad chemical markers for estrogen dependence, including breast cancers.  So they gave me the Langer Award for that at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's where we continued here, trying to study the mechanism of action of estrogen and growth factors in the body.
Story_ID: 27348
Speaker 1: Are you, are you married by this time?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Married with two children.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us how you met your wife.  We haven't gone over that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're in Washington in 1962.  And she came to visit family.  Well, she came from Kansas City, Kansas to visit family here.  And my brother introduced me to her.  And we kept in correspondence, and then she went on to get her Ph.D. at Boston College [Boston, Massachusetts].  And then we were married in Providence [Rhode Island] in '66 [1966] or so.  I remember August 14th, but I can't remember the year (laughter).  So anyway, she worked at the, eventually worked at the First National Bank of Chicago as an economist, and then with the, the Federal Reserve Bank here in Washington.  And then, unfortunately, she developed multiple sclerosis and is an invalid at this time.  But she was a very bright lady.
Speaker 1: And she was an economist?
Speaker 2: Economist, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so, I'll ask you about your children later on when we, towards the end--
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 27349
Speaker 1: You received the Langer Award.  Now, is that an award from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: Yes, from the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did they--what's the--
Speaker 2: It's for outstanding research in the area of breast cancer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you--now, you're doing fine at the University of Chicago.  Now, a lot of people would consider this the dream position.  You've got tenure at the University of Chicago.  You win the Langer Award--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --now--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was a very tough decision to make.  You know, I was reaching people at the University of Chicago, had the best opportunities to do any kind of research you had and you would get--and among blacks at the time, this was an apple pie situation, you know, because they were not in the sciences at the level that I was at the time.  My family didn't wanna leave Chicago.  But the chairman of this department, the head, Harold Finley, was, was no longer head, and he looked around, and he said, "Who could replace the head here and tried to build the department like, say like a [Ernest Everett] Just."  And so after listening to him for a while, I decided that I could do more for humanity and for underrepresented minorities by coming to Howard [University, Washington D.C.].  As I said, my family didn't want me to do this, but they came, and this was a very, very rugged time.  It was a time of great turmoil at Howard, especially in biology.  They didn't want to see new people come in, and even before I came here, somebody wrote letters saying that I didn't like James Cheek [Howard University's president], and that James Cheek was doing all sorts of funny things.  And so they even tried to burn a portion of the department here.  Somebody set fire.
Speaker 1: Now, what, I mean what kind of--
Speaker 2: Just mean, just didn't want to change, you know, they're--
Speaker 1: So these, this kind of, this antagonism is being generated within the department itself?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That really sounds like a desperate--they tried to burn the department?
Speaker 2: Burn part of the offices and so on.  For example, they burned the electron microscope that was downstairs.
Speaker 1: So you think this is one individual doing this or--
Speaker 2: I think it may be a little cluster.  They didn't wanna see, didn't wanna lose their jobs, and they didn't wanna see somebody new come in, you know, so it was the atmosphere at the time.  I had given a talk in Hamburg [Germany], and I was met by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations], and they said, "Look, you--you know, we're here to protect you and your family," and came in here.  And they--Lorraine Williams was then the vice president for academic affairs.  And she was, of course, concerned if I was talking badly about--in some meeting at the cancer center, badly about James Cheek.  And she said, "Well, did you do it?"  I said, "First time I'm hearing about it".  And she said, "Well, I just want you to know that you have some enemies here that would go to any length to block progress in the department."  That was Lorraine Williams.  So it settled down a bit.  I took the job, you know, most importantly because I thought it was a real, a real opportunity to make some changes here; very difficult to get rid of the old faculty that were tenured in here.  It didn't have the power of a head of a department.  You were chairman.  You had to work with persuasion and support from the dean to make changes in the department.
Story_ID: 27350
Speaker 1: Just going, this tremendous opposition to you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --now, did you know James Cheek [Howard University's president] at all at this point?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, but, you know, at a different level.  You know, he was president, and I had not met him, worked primarily with the, with Lorraine Williams, vice president for academic affairs and the dean.
Speaker 1: Did you know him before, you know, before Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] days or--
Speaker 2: No, no, but what I--I saw him, but I never, never connected.
Speaker 1: He went to theological school up near Boston [Massachusetts] at some point.--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if you'd ever come across him?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, so what were they, what were they saying that you were saying about him?  I mean, where did this come from?
Speaker 2: Just, I think, you know, I think I knew who the professors were who did this, you know, wrote letters and so on, that at one meeting of the Howard University Cancer Center, Anderson gave this talk about we should eliminate the president.  And as president, you know, was incompetent and so on.  And so they, it just had that sort of a talk, and submitted the anonymous letter to the president, who was concerned that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a new incoming faculty was talking bad about him.
Speaker 1: Now, we've interviewed other professors in the sciences on black college campuses and there've been quite a few of them who have discussed a problem of, as science advances, you know, you have people that may have been, that haven't kept up with the times--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and, for instance, you know, we're getting into computational biology now, nowadays--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.  And these kind of ideas, do you think the faculty was frightened, some people were actually frightened by these--
Speaker 2: I think it's fear.  In one case, one protozoologist, he was a student of Harold Finley.  His major job was to do real estate, and his minor job was to be here between his real estate dealings.  You know, and I didn't like that, you know, because--and he got offended there.  Another lady, she was, I guess very busy, but, you know, she would put on a video in class and then fall asleep in the class, that sort of thing.  Another fellow who was teaching old physiology, you know, just no research, nothing.  And you, you know, you try to move those people along.  But just, just fear, antagonism.  They wanted to hold onto their job.  They wanted the status quo.  And so there were very few friends in the department at the time.  And so one had to be tough and it got, got tougher as time went on.  Let's see, I only lasted nine years as chairman of biology.  But, but during those nine years, I was the one that brought in the research grants, to continue my own research and to develop programs at the university that were, in my case, very, very--highly successful and fantastic.  So in spite of the dissent and the antagonism, you know, we got rid of some of some of those faculty by retirements or death and, you know, the department was able to build anew.  The problem then came.  How do you find accomplished faculty who would come to Howard?  See, that was a big problem.  And because of the ethnic status of the university, you'd like to find accomplished minority faculty who could be role models to the students here.  That was very tough.  And so, you could only get individuals who were, who were white, who couldn't find a job elsewhere, put it that way.  But they settled at Howard, you know, because it's not a big pearl or peach that they would want to come to Howard automatically.  But they couldn't find jobs elsewhere, and so we had to hire them because we had to get teachers, the students taught.  And some of them did wonderfully well, wonderfully well.  Others, they would work, as my experience, function well as teachers and researchers for three years or so, and then the game then is to become politicians.  And that's the sad part on all kinds of campuses, there would--the commitment to teaching and to getting monies for research and so on is not as strong as it should be because they evolve into politicians rather than, than great teachers.  Some do, you know, as I say, some are magnificent.  Others pose a problem.
Story_ID: 27351
Speaker 1: But my greatest contribution, I think is I've been successful in getting research grants, but more successful in getting educational and building grants over the last thirty years.  And through my contacts with MBL [Marine Biological Laboratory] Woods Hole [Woods Hole, Massachusetts] and so on, met individuals who were head of the Rockefeller Foundation, for example, and got a grant from Rockefeller and created something called HWROCK Centers, Howard Rockefeller Centers.  And we had--these HWROCK Centers concentrated on training high school science students in the twelfth grade to become scientists.  And we would set up these HWROCK Centers in places like Duluth, Minnesota to serve the Chippewa group of kids or Latinos in San Diego [California] and in Texas.  And centers at most of the prominent black schools in the South, Talladega [Alabama], Tuskegee [Alabama] and so forth.  And fortunately, all the students in this program went on to graduate and to go on to college.  We had about fifteen hundred students in the program at the time.  And to introduce minorities to places like the MBL Woods Hole where there were very few black professors or students at the time.  We were only able to get in there in that we had the funds to rent a laboratory and to bring the students to work in that laboratory.  So that was--you want me to go on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so HWROCK was the first great success that we had.  So then we got grants from the NSF [National Science Foundation], and--
Speaker 2: Well, give us a date for HWROCK, what--
Speaker 1: HWROCK was around 1976, '77 [1977].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we had grants from the NSF.  One is called the Research Careers for Minority Scholars, and here we would identify the brightest minorities that we could find and to try to educate them in STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics] research, primarily research.  And we had that for about four years.  Then we had Pugh Foundation funding to do the same thing, but to concentrate on high school students here who would come to Howard and this grant was with Herman Branson.  He had retired then from president of Lincoln [University, Chester County, Pennsylvania].  And he was here in Washington [D.C.], had nothing to do, so I hired him to help me run the Pugh grant for the training of minorities and others in mathematics.  After the Pugh, we had funds from NIH [National Institutes of Health], MARC [Minority Access to Research Careers] and MBRS, Minority Biomedical Research, training the students, and this would encourage undergraduates here at Howard to do research in the sciences.
Story_ID: 27352
Speaker 1: And that's MARC [Minority Access to Research Careers], then we were fortunate to have Howard Hughes invest $1.6 million in the development of innovative programs to, for undergraduates in biology and chemistry and mathematics, to become leaders in the field.  And it's a very fascinating program where we would identify high school teachers and students and based upon their performance in high school, they would be admitted as freshmen here.  And we have a twelve-point program where the students would immediately be placed in innovative research laboratories and as freshmen, taking the general biology course.  They would also be taking an advance course and only with the help of their mentors and peer mentors would they succeed there.  Every--the requirement of the course is that they work six hours a week in research laboratories.  But every summer, from a freshman summer to a sophomore summer, to a junior summer, they would spend ten to twelve weeks, doing research at, in laboratories at research intensive universities.  And we had great relationships with [University of] Wisconsin [Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], perfect relations.  MIT would give a course called quantitative biology, and these students had to take it during their career.  And finally, the, based upon the, those mentoring activities--I'm ahead of myself here.  We got a grant from the NIH called Minority Health and Health Disparities program.  This allowed us to send about three hundred medical students, undergraduate students to laboratories in Europe and mostly, in laboratories in Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali and Nigeria, and in the Transkei in South Africa.  So we had this great international experience for these students.  And based upon all those activities, we had thousands of undergraduates and graduate students getting all this training.  The president recognized, or NSF [National Science Foundation] recognized me as the, they gave us the award of Presidential Award [for] Excellence in Math, Technology, Engineering and Sciences and--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: --mentoring [Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That was 2011.
Speaker 2: 2011.
Speaker 1: So one of eleven of us, over the nation, got this (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So this is an NSF award?
Speaker 1: NSF, it's the presidential award, but it's run through NSF.
Speaker 2: Presidential Award.
Speaker 1: Yeah, for Excellence in--
Speaker 2: Now, this is an award you actually go to the--
Speaker 1: White House--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --White House.
Speaker 1: --and do your thing, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, it's from the President of the United States.
Speaker 1: Right, so, so what's important here is I think that even though I'm continuing science, I think coming to Howard allowed me to have a different profession, but a more meaningful profession than one in just doing research.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Couldn't do that at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 27353
Speaker 1: Tell us about becoming a Howard Hughes Professor [of Biology] here [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Howard Hughes is an open competition.  And I proposed something called 'The Twelve-Point Plan' for accomplishments and training in STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics].  And I sort of went over it a little bit.  The students identified as freshmen, watched for four years, given opportunities to do research in laboratories here, take courses, more math.  Better math students would major in mathematics, but also minor in biology.  Biology students and chemistry students would major in their fields, but minor in mathematics and so forth.  And then that broad exposure to a research intensive laboratories at, as I said, MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So the Howard Hughes Professorship is linked to the program that was--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I thought it was a chair, endowed chair that, something like that.
Speaker 2: No, no endowed chair.  It's Howard Hughes' special--I think they choose about twelve to be given professors and ours, we completed the first four years successfully, and they extended it for another four years.  And it's one of their prize programs.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  I understand now.  So what, now, you, you've been able to attract a lot of money for, you said for building, and this, the Ernest E. Just Center, how old is it, and did you--
Speaker 2: This building here?
Speaker 1: Yes, did you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, 1954, this building was--
Speaker 1: Okay, this has been here for a while.
Speaker 2: It was built in 1954, the building, but Ernest Everett Just came here and he was first an instructor in the Thirkield Hall in physics building over here, where he taught biology, and he also taught English.  And he was here to build the Master's program in biology--in zoology.  But he had a conflict with Mordecai Johnson, and Johnson wanted him to move on and develop a Ph.D. early.  But Just didn't want to.  So he moved from biology and went to anatomy in the College of Medicine. But Just, as brilliant as he was, he really didn't want to be here.  They didn't treat him the way he wanted to be recognized here.  And, you know, he was a star, but away from Howard, like most of us are on the faculty here, not usually recognized at your home institution but by outside.  So Just didn't really want to be here, I think, and he went to Germany.  He came back.  He taught courses, a class that, he spoke in German for an hour and then would leave the class, you know, the poor bad kids there, they didn't know too much German.  And he went to Woods Hole [Marine Biology Laboratories-Woods Hole, Woods Hole, Massachusetts] where he was really recognized and loved and did a lot of great research at Woods Hole.  He always referenced Howard, but he worked with the greats in developmental biology at Woods Hole and in Germany and, you know, amassed a great reputation.  Now, based on that reputation, and so I worked with the chairman of the board of trustees to find a name for this building.  And we named it after Ernest Everett Just.  It was very difficult naming of buildings at Howard because as much as we work hard to name the Percy Julian Building, we have had very little success or Herman Branson Building, in physics, very little success.
Story_ID: 27354
Speaker 1: Have you been able to upgrade the laboratory facilities here, and I think that's part of the story too, right?
Speaker 2: Right, it's upgraded to a point.  And what, in this building, what we're concentrating on in this department is building good science.  And we lost to retirement and people leaving about six faculty.  We had twenty-one faculty to service eight hundred undergraduates and over fifty graduate students.  So this is the greatest major in "Death Valley" [nickname for a section of Howard University's campus], is biology, you see.  But we can't, we really don't have the faculty load to really do good, good service for these students.  So we decided that with the help of Howard Hughes, we would take a segment of the freshman class, and instead of putting them in the traditional laboratories, we put them in the great laboratories like Phage Genetics, introduce them with the whole philosophy.  You're using student-centric, lab-centric, wet lab activities.  And that has worked out absolutely fantastic.  We have the first class of forty-four students doing all this phages-- isolating bacteria, isolating the bacteriophages, sequencing the bacteriophages and other techniques to study these phages.  So, that's one way we can introduce modern and progressive techniques for the training of these minority students here.  The developmental biologist, instead of just talking about stuff and doing some old, dead animal-type research, she's now working on different kinds of worms that they utilize in places like NIH [National Institutes of Health], to study and develop things.  So new science taught by minority scientists as well as white scientists, as well as I'm calling the Indian and the Bangladeshi, also minority-type sciences and to improve the science here in the building, even though the department is not as well kept as it could be.  Laboratories need to be renovated, especially, the research laboratories, but renovation is very expensive.  We have two new faculty coming--three new faculty coming in and so just renovation alone is $525,000 of their laboratories.  This university doesn't have those resources.  And each person that comes in has to have a start-up cost--fund so that they can start up their own research.  Well, the start-up fund is late and not very much.  Each person gets about $150,000 to spend in three years.  But remember, a purchase of a good microscope is $40,000.  So $150,000 doesn't go as far as if you were at Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] where you can get $500,000 in start-up funds.  So we just don't have the resources, you know, but the intention is there.  We have a new provost who is excited.  He's a surgeon, but he's still the provost for the entire campus.  He's excited, and I think that we're going to be improving from here on in.  The faculty are applying for more grants, which is great.
Story_ID: 27355
Speaker 1: Are you able to do enough or were you able to do enough research really to, in this, on this job [professor at Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to really satisfy your need to do research?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  We were fortunate to carry out what we started at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and at Harvard [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  But in my field, it's a versatile field.  You can do many, many things with the techniques that you have.  And, for example, we just bought a new electron-microscope for $800,000, good, state-of-the-art, very little money to service it.  It costs $39,000 in service costs for this equipment, you know.  And so if it gets broken, hard to get the people to come in and service it.  But the tools are here.  The department is well equipped with tools, and we're going to get more as time goes on.  And I think, better equipped than any of the medical school science departments.  This department is doing well.  This department, for example, produced thirteen doctoral degrees in the areas of microbiology and physiology and cell biology whereas all the science departments in the College of Medicine, together produced thirteen, in over two years, which we just--one department equaled what they did.
Speaker 1: So that, as a two-year period?
Speaker 2: Over a two-year period.
Speaker 1: Okay, thirteen Ph.D.s--
Speaker 2: Right, and we want to keep pace in doing this.  So, so, yes, the collaborations between say, biology and say engineering, doing things like nano-sciences has allowed us to expand our opportunities to get research dollars and to get state-of-the-art research being done on our campuses.  And, and I think this is aided strongly by the new provost and past provosts, I think.  And I think we're getting back on track.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just that we need more faculty in this department with greater skills to help us with the move forward.
Speaker 1: Now, have you continued to publish as a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, yes.  Oh, I was trying to say that it's a versatile field that we're in.  We're also involved in things like natural products.  We're concentrating on identifying medicinal plants, for example, that we've collected in Ethiopia and Nigeria and other places, identifying the extracts from these plants and seeing how they kill cancer cells and what--by the mechanism that they kill cancer cells as microorganisms like trypanosomes and other sleeping sickness and malaria organisms.  And so under our program I told you about earlier on, they have this practice program.  We support a student--a bunch of students.  We call them "Malaria Fighters."  They concentrate on (just on?) malaria and cerebral malaria and other diseases in Africa and continue to do the research here in the, in the United States.  But a great, bunch of modern scientists are here right now.  They're young.  You have a Vernon Morris who has a grant in atmospheric sciences. (unclear) NOAA [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], has $12 million to work with, you know, which he could do a lot with.  He's interested, one of his interests is in mapping the clouds of Saharan dust particles as they go trans-Atlantic to the Caribbean and to Florida and to identify the species of bacteria found in that African dust and to see if they are related to disease, emerging disease like asthma and other fungal diseases and so forth, very exciting stuff, you know.  It allows him to travel all over the, Mali, where you have all the problem right now and we have to close down the Mali sights.  And he is a chemist who works with biologists here, Dr. Eribo, and they're getting a lot done on this kind of research.  We have a young microbiologist from [University of] Wisconsin [Madison, Madison, Wisconson], and she's interested in the microbiota, the system of microbes found in the gut of humans and to see if you can correlate those microbes with gut diseases.  So she's working with people in the College of Medicine and that sort of a thing.  So the collaboration is good.  They're a strong medical school, pharmacy, engineering, biology.  And we're doing okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Not of me, but of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you feel a part of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a resurgence in science here--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at Howard on a number of different levels?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and they just gave me, this year, the Outstanding Alumnus Award from Howard University, and this is for the first time that they're looking in to what's going on at Howard rather than giving the prize to individuals who are there in industry and so forth.  So myself and Les [Leslie] Hicks in psychology are the recipients of this Outstanding Alumnus Award.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that does mean that the rest of the community here at Howard is starting to recognize what you're doing?
Speaker 2: They either recognize it or (laughter), or object to it (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Well, an award means they kind of recognize it, so--
Speaker 2: The award does.  The university essential does, but, you know, you have nay sayers around, I'm sure (laughter), though that doesn't really matter.  It doesn't matter.
Story_ID: 27356
Speaker 1: When you look back on, I guess on your years here at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], what would you consider to be your major accomplishments?
Speaker 2: Making opportunities for undergraduates, medical students and graduate students, to transcend my, my achievements.  And I am pleased when I looked at my first two M.D., Ph.D. students from [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  One is Dennis Slayman.  Dennis Slayman, if you recall, he is the guy who identified something called Herceptin, treatment of breast cancers that are not dependent on estrogen.  You see him on CBS and all those places all the time.  Other students who I think are, absolute--you know, the potential is here, the students are so strong.  There's a fellow named David Gilmer, who decided that he would want to do medicine if we could get him in the medical school.  He decided to go as a graduate student to Rockefeller University [New York, New York], and he just received the Rockefeller Award from Rockefeller himself, not the old one, but his descendants, this year.  Students who have gone on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  One student, he got admitted to the top universities in the country.  And he chose Columbia [University, New York, New York], even though he did his research at MIT.  A young girl who last year got again into the top universities and Howard Medical School.  She is now a freshman at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  So what I'm saying is that the expertise and the ability is here, and we just have to harvest it and really guide the students, not just in the medical type sciences, but even in the environmental sciences where students are doing fascinating things in the area of plant biology and plant molecular biology.  The students are here, and I think that is my--you know, as I move into the twilight of my own career, I think this is what I am most pleased about, the research and also the ability to somehow impact on the training of students in science technology, engineering and mathematics.
Story_ID: 27357
Speaker 1: Once again, in terms of your research, what would you consider to be your major findings and--
Speaker 2: Major findings, identification of biochemical markers for breast cancer, and for the uterine cancer and that sort of stuff.  Second one is the, I would say the development of, study of ectopic bone formation in tissues.  Now, we're embarked on programs for studying things like cerebral malaria in children in Ghana, and effect of medicine or plant extracts on parasites as well as on cancer cells.  That's about where my career stops, I think, in science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27358
Speaker 1: Do you have a strong working relationship with Howard Medical Center [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: I have a good relationship.  I'm, when I got here, at first, I collaborated with a fellow named Clive Calendar.  Well, Clive Calendar is the person who was responsible for renal transplants, the renal transplant center.  And we worked very actively on the development of blood substitutes for the preservation of organ tissues.  And so we pioneered the formation of something called stroma-free hemoglobin from outdated blood.  We'd get the hemoglobin and we would use that as a, as a substitute for blood.  For example, using this kind of oxygen-carrying agent, we were able to keep animals alive for three to six days, just on the perfusate itself and, and some measure in preservation of kidneys of dogs that Clive Calendar worked on.  So the whole idea is if we could just isolate that and purify that hemoglobin, we could have something like a coffee, coffee, instant coffee, and you will just have to supplement water to it, and then you can perfuse your animal, your body with it.  This money was support--this research was supported initially by the Army, but ran out of interests and money and so we never followed up any further.
Speaker 1: So this is a--let me just go back and underline this.  You, what we're talking about is an instant blood substitute--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --add water, and--
Speaker 2: You just mix it up like coffee, and so--I wish we had the time to pursue that once more.  But, because I think now that the techniques are so good, but you see the hemoglobin in hooked to some protein called stroma, and if you could eliminate the stroma from the hemoglobin, from the red cells, then you just have your hemoglobin.  And pure hemoglobin offloads, picks up oxygen and offloads CO2 [carbon dioxide]  to the rest of the body, which would be perfect in the military areas and so forth or even with the Jehovah's Witness people and so forth.  And so we worked with mixing blood substitutes with other--hemoglobin with other oxygen-carrying agents and so forth.  And they were quite successful.  The kidney looks good, the liver looks good.  The animal eventually dies simply because we weren't able to keep the blood inside the blood vessels, so we terminated the experiment.  But for short term storage of organs, no reason why it can't, it couldn't be very good.  But we sort of stopped that research.
Speaker 1: So this, something to be ingested by a person or how would they--
Speaker 2: Put it in your blood.  You perfuse your vascular system.
Speaker 1: Meaning, how it would be introduced through a--
Speaker 2: Through injection--
Speaker 1: Injection.
Speaker 2: --to perfusate into the blood, and it worked.  It's just that we just somehow, Clive got busy, and so forth.  We worked with people like a woman named Georgia Dunston, Willie Turner and Sandra White, and a fellow named Jack White, to build the Howard University Cancer Center, which is there, now, you know, and it's possible that with new leadership and so forth, the cancer center can be as good as the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown [University, Washington D.C.].  It's just that poor management and whatever assistance we could get from the university, we didn't get.  But the provost is going to hire a new director of the cancer center, and so we hope that it will really be glorious.  And we work with neuroscientists in the College of Medicine to really helping her to get her research done well and others.  So there's good relationship between the college and the medical school.  And many of our students do internships in the medical school, medical faculties laboratories.  So that's working okay.
Speaker 1: So, we interviewed Georgia Dunston and--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --the name Jack White, you know, hearkens (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Came up?
Speaker 1: --back to the surgeon, Jack White, one of the original, one of the old--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, good.
Speaker 1: --surgeons here back in the days of Charles Drew and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  You see people like Georgia Dunston and I mentioned, Willie Turner and Sandra White and so on, these are the unheralded pioneers in the area because it was on their science and our grants at the time that allowed the cancer center to be built, you know, allowed Jack White to go forward to the government, along with Leffall to build that cancer center.
Speaker 1: Dr. LaSalle Leffall, right--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --a great surgeon.
Speaker 2: But the unheralded ones are in the background, you know.  As I said, like Georgia Dunston, you know, but, so there is, there is history there akin to that and not just relationship with the, the post--the best relationship right now is with the School of Engineering because nano-medicine and nano-science is taking place and with the School of Pharmacy.  There's a fellow there that we work with who is involved in drug discovery as well as the drug synthesis, you see, and also delivery of drugs, where he can package whatever active agent we get from plants or wherever, package them and find a way, what he calls stealth molecules.  So these molecules, these little packages, envelopes that will avoid being recognized by the immune system in the body, and they were able to float freely in the vascular system and to bind to certain receptor sites in the, say it's cancer, and so deliver the drug directly to the, to the cancer cell.  So all that's going on right now, a fellow named McCullough (ph.) doing wonderful things.
Story_ID: 27359
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back again on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would undo or wish you hadn't done?
Speaker 2: No, as, in retrospect, the move was good.  If I had stayed at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], I think that my career would take a different, a different path, and I would never have been able to do things as far as training and teaching as I could at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  You know, I had opportunities.  I spent two years at Hunter [College, New York, New York] to help them build up their cell biology and their science.  But that was including--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In New York?
Speaker 2: In New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was good while it lasted because we had a tremendous president, Donna Shalala.  But when she left, the impetus sort of died and so I returned to Howard.  I was on leave from Howard.  I returned to Howard where I thought that it was a better place for me at Hunter College.  So in retrospect, the move was good for building a different pathway, didn't take advantage of my opportunities earlier as far as history is concerned, you know, I could be a great scientist possible in quotations (laughter), you know, with lots of money and be inundated with lots of NIH [National Institute of Health] study sections and NSF [National Science Foundation] sections and teaching in medical school.  I just felt that I did more by coming to Howard than to, than to stay where I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You still have contacts with Rockefeller and the Mayo Clinic and all those places anyway, you know.  At this point, I'm just too old to fight the fight anymore.
Story_ID: 27360
Speaker 1: In 1988, you founded the Sandy Springs Slave Museum and African Art Gallery [Sandy Spring, Maryland]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us now, how did you get involved in this?
Speaker 2: Okay, after visiting about fifteen countries in Africa, I said, "You know, the greatest thing that we could do is to show them how to use modern techniques to provide proteins for the village."  And so I came to Washington [D.C.] and looked around and found that some very interesting African American communities existed, follow any little dirt road and there was an African American community back there with maybe successful families.  And one of the most interesting ones I found was a place called Holly Grove, with about twenty homes.  Then right next to Holly Grove was Sandy Spring [Maryland].  Now, Sandy Spring was founded by Quakers around 1728.  They came here from Baltimore [Maryland] and from Maryland Eastern Shore.  They came with workers.  Some of them had slaves, the Quakers had slaves, even after the wonderful things they do about abolition.  Mr. Thomas lived in Ashton [Maryland].  He had one hundred and something slaves-one hundred and fifty slaves.  He emancipated those slaves in 1801, but the slaves didn't leave the plantation of Mr. Thomas until 1833.  Then Sandy Spring became the oldest free, black community in the area.  Slaves would be coming in from Washington [D.C.] and from, from Rockville [Maryland] and Annapolis [Maryland] and all over to join the Underground Railroad and to go North.  So they built this community that we found unrecognized because it was on a, primarily on a road called Brook Road where they really meant to call it the Black Road or the Back Road.  And the community existed.  They produced, as I mentioned earlier on, great guys like the Mitchell's, Clarence Mitchell [Jr.].  He was born just on the outskirts of Sandy Spring, and (Merv Fisk?) with the African American newspapers came out of Sandy Spring.  The council member right now in Washington [D.C.]--what's her name?  She's in Congress--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Congressional representative of--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --oh, gosh, I--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't think I remember the name either right now.  But her father was in Sandy Spring.  Bill Cosby's wife came out of Sandy Spring, and so they were, you know, they're an interesting community, but they were unrecognized.  So anyway, we went to that community.  I said, "It was a nice place to settle down."  My brother and I brought an acre of land there, first the farm.  We fenced this acre, and we leased a piece of land next to it, and we had something like twenty-eight goats and cattle and donkeys and something like thirty geese and a lama and other animals.  And to show that that one acre of land, if you use modern techniques, like feeding them and carrying the feed to them, that you could maintain them.  And if the village maintained these animals, they could have enough food for the, for the community.  Well, that lasted about three years, got too hard for me to be there because my brother, as a surgeon, was too busy.  And so I would be there in the snow and in the muck, trying to take feed to them, and then my children said, "This is dangerous."  You fell a couple of times and you broke your toe and, you know, these animals could be romping all over your body, you know, especially, Ferdinand, the lama, because they would call me from home, from work, and says, "Ferdinand is playing tennis on the tennis court across the street."  So I'd rush here to try to get Ferdinand back into his enclosure.  But every night Ferdinand would get back into this enclosure.  And it was too much.  So I asked the community, many of the people there, "What would you like to see?"  They wanted a swimming pool, and I said, "No, there's too much liability here, you know, who's gonna maintain it?" and so forth.  So my brother and I decided we're going to make a museum.  We had the land.  It's an acre right on the main road.  And we started out by building.  It took me eighteen months by hand to build a cross section of slaving tipper ship.  And so, you know, I had to make the mannequins on the inside of the plaster of paris and absolutely interesting because it got a lot of attention in the community.  Then after that, we said, "Look, they have to live some place."  And the Hollow Well Plantation had a cabin that they were gonna burn; paid five thousand dollars for it and built this cabin, post-by-post in the, at the new site.  This cabin was occupied by tenant farmers, a family named Johnson.  And he and his wife and about thirteen others lived in this cabin, upstairs and downstairs.  The children would sleep on little mattresses up in the attic.  And so that was built.
Story_ID: 27361
Speaker 1: Then Nelson Mandela got released from jail, and we said, "Listen, we've got to do something with Nelson Mandela."  And we made an African hut, a hut from the tribe, exactly like what Nelson Mandela grew up in.  And that's there, and in it, has the African Art Collection, a collection from the Diaspora that I've been collecting for about thirty years, and that encloses all of that.  And so those three edifices were built on the, on there for a while.  Then we said, "Look, we need to do some more." Didn't have any money.  So after three years with a little money from the state, we built the main building that houses all the relics related to Civil Rights and slavery, and to culture, achievement and one room for the local, the local society, their artifacts, their pictures and so on.  And in the basement of this building, we have a display called 'Building of America,' all the tools that blacks and others used to build America, but these were collected from black homes in the community as well as a church.  We, it's really a lecture room, but I got twenty pews from the Thirteenth Street Baptist Church that they broke down in Washington [D.C.], stored them for about twenty years and then finally found a home for the, for these pews.  They have to, fellowship there every Sunday from ten until twelve o'clock, with a choir and everything, you know; average age about eighty, the people that go there.  And we see about two thousand people every year, you know.  You don't have to go through Reginald Lewis Museum in Baltimore [Maryland] or Blacks in Wax, can have it right here.  And you don't have to wait until the museum on the mall is built, you know, it's right here.  And so we have people coming in from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and from other places, Annapolis [Maryland], to see our museum and the artifacts and so forth.
Speaker 2: Now, the museum's at Montgomery County and how far is it from Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: From Howard, oh, it's about forty minutes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Forty minutes.  It's located in the Eastern part of Montgomery County, and which is right at the border where Howard County and Prince George's County is, and so, you know, all the blacks from these other counties would come over to Montgomery County as well.  The, so this project is essentially complete.  The museum is complete.  It is recognized by the County Council Chairman and the council, and so--even though they gave not a penny towards building.  The building came primarily out of private pockets and retirements, stuff like that.  So it's there.  But the last project that we have taken on is the renovation of the Odd Fellows Lodge.  This Odd Fellows Lodge is the last remaining building that blacks built in this part of Montgomery County, totally destroyed in the '50 [1950s], unoccupied, of course, no roof and that sort of thing.  Now, we had to get the funds from the state who allowed us to renovate it, and it's almost complete at this point.  But here is the lodge, the Odd Fellows, it's a, primarily a black fraternal organization.  When the Sharp Street Church burned, the lodge gave lessons there, and really just services there.  It served as a school.  It, it serves as a place to, to bring the community together.  You know, after all, they had no place to socialize, and they could not go to the Quaker homes to have tea with them.  You know, they had to go to a certain place where they could have parties and congregate and the lodge, as members of the lodge, they would help with funeral arrangements and burial and that sort of a thing.  So it has been a fantastic organization.  Now, most of the members are dead.  So there're only about four members right now, myself (laughter), Eribo, Dr. Hollis and a man named Mr. Green.  But so we, and we're going to fix this lodge up as a community center again for teaching kids out of school, for whatever the community wants to do with it.  But it will be preserved.
Speaker 2: And how far is the lodge from--
Speaker 1: The lodge is about a mile and a half from the museum--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in the same Sandy Spring area.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, this is wonderful.  I mean I saw, the pictures--well, we'll get to them in a little while, but it's really something--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to see, and that you had the initiative to do this yourself, without--
Speaker 1: Yes, this is a avocation (laughter), but coming to an end.  It's coming to an end.
Story_ID: 27362
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, you've got two--
Speaker 2: Three children.
Speaker 1: Three children, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a daughter--two daughters and a son.  They, they're--they didn't wanna come to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.].  You know, they, affluentia (laughter).  They suffered from that disease.  The older girl, born in Chicago [Illinois].  She, in Boston [Massachusetts], she's a lawyer from Washington and Lee University [Lexington, Virginia].  And she is one of the three counsels in the University of Maryland system [Maryland].  She handles all those litigations and administration of problems at the University of Maryland.  The second girl is a social worker from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and she works with the VA [Veterans Administration].  And the boy here, he graduated from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], and he works at Howard as a manager of the new engineering facility.  He works with the dean and he oversees--I call him a curator, and he doesn't like that.  But he's essentially the person that you call to get the building repaired, buildings repaired, and offices and labs repaired and so forth.  So they're doing okay.  They're doing okay.  They're very supportive of me.  And I'm very fortunate in that situation, especially since my wife is not, is not around.  You know, she has had MS [multiple sclerosis] for thirty-odd years, you know, so she's in the nursing home around there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they're stronger than any men.  You know, that's why the youngest daughter can't find a good man to, (laughter) to hook up with (laughter).  She doesn't like me to say that (laughter).  She's too strong for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, all in all, it's been a great, a great, great family, yeah, surviving.
Story_ID: 27363
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: To continue provide opportunities.  That's the greatest expectation, to continue to provide opportunities at an early age, early entrance into college and to do meaningful things like research, not just mock research, but to do real research and to follow what the AAAS [American Association for the Advancement of Science] and Howard Hughes and NIH [National Institute of Health] and NSF [National Science Foundation] say, do, they have an article called 'Vision and Change.'  Student-centric education, lab-centric education, heavy mentoring and principles, learn principles of biology, not just everything in biology.  Some places just use a textbook, and they go over the whole, all the chapters in the textbook.  But you go with the principles of biology.  If you follow those four things, mentoring, lab-based education, student-centric, you build it around the students, and you teach principles of biology or chemistry or whatever, you would have a fantastic population who are skilled and ready to go on.  They, we have the, you know, in my days, we didn't have many opportunities, but now the undergraduate students here whose a minority has lots of opportunities.  Take advantage of these opportunities.  We can't teach the kind of good science in the summer here that Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] has, you see, or [University of] Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] has or MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] has.  So we have to take advantage of these opportunities and get them there, get them the exposure early into those peer--with their peers, competitive peers.  Let them see what science is, teach more quantitative biology, do more interaction with bioengineering and nano-physics and nano-sciences and pharmacal sciences, and I think that we'll have a population that will be fantastic, not just for the workforce, the scientific workforce, but these people will be well, well trained, ready to join the workforce, the same work force that [President Barack] Obama is talking about, a skilled population.  That's what we need right now, and you can find it, not just at Howard, but at many of these historically black schools, and other schools, the white schools too.  Brilliant students, given the opportunity, they can rise to the top and they can do great things.  That's what I would like to see, you know.  I think that people, give them the opportunity and you stay with them, it's gonna be okay.  We have eight hundred students here.  We selected, as I told you, forty-four to do state-of-the arts research in bacterialphage, phage genetics.  Now, it will be fantastic if next year, we have eighty-eight and the next year we have twice that.  And we give them this advanced study, this opportunity to do advanced studies in current fields.  That would absolutely, it would be fantastic, but I'm not sure that we have the resources to do it.  But it can be done at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and other places as well, Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Spelman is doing it.  So just--and also we have to look at the faculty level.  I think it's too late for the old faculty to learn new tricks.  I think they're already imbedded in what their philosophy is and so on.  We have to look at young faculty who are coming aboard, assistant professors, to come aboard with skills and the motivation to train in.  But I don't mean just black faculty or Indian faculty.  I mean all faculty.  So if you can find the committed people, then education in America is gonna be okay at the college level and if you can find the skilled ones.  I know the administration will provide the resources.  You see, that's the big problem.  The administration doesn't have any--the university does have financial problems.  And as I said, whereas Brown [University, Providence, Rhode Island] is giving an assistant professor $500,000 a year for start-up funds, we give, lucky to get $150,000 over three years, you know.  And two--five years ago, they would probably have gotten $70,000 over three years, and before that, nothing, you know.  People like me came in with no financial support from the university, but that's improving right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think that the state of black education is promising if we focus on providing, as I said, opportunities and resources to train undergraduates, graduate students and medical students.
Story_ID: 27364
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Someone who was committed for the advancement of education and research in the biological sciences.  That's all.  Somebody who was committed, and that's done as much as possible to advance the education and the training of students, especially in the area of STEM [science, technology, engineering, mathematics].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's it.  No great prizes, you know (laughter).

Speaker 2: That's the other logo on the left, the logo for the museum.
Speaker 1: Oh, that statute.
Speaker 2: Yes, that statute.  That statute, when I saw that statute, it has an eagle on the top, a book and two people, holding the book.  And to me, that meant knowledge equal freedom.  And I thought, even though it was found in Africa, it represented the greatest dream of America, "knowledge equal freedom".
Speaker 1: And that's the inside, those pictures, those are fabric in the ceiling.  Yeah, you look up and you see the fabric.  You don't see the--then you have some stained glass in there.
