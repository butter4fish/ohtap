Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm-up, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --they only require a short answer. First one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food, oh, I'm one who loves to eat, so it's kind of hard to say, my favorite food, but if there was just one thing only I could have, I guess, it would be a red velvet cake.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I would give up even fried chicken for red velvet cake.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or if I couldn't get there I would take New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't think I really have a favorite phrase or saying but hm, no, I don't think I really have a favorite phrase or saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing comes to mind.
Story_ID: 517661
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Levester Hall] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Daisy, D-A-I-S-Y, and her middle name is Lee and her maiden name is Hortman, H-O-R-T-M-A-N--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and then Hall [Daisy Hortman Hall].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born July 5th, 1927.  And she was born in Louisiana, Sondheimer, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Sondheimer?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: S-U-N--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --H-A-M-M-E-R [sic.]?
Speaker 2: That sounds good to me.
Speaker 1: Is it all one word?
Speaker 2: All one word, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sondheimer.  That's, is there a story behind that name that you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know the story behind the name I just know it's northern Louisiana because again loving to eat I will say, "Why don't you make gumbo, Mom?"  And she said (laughter), "In the northern part of Louisiana we were not by the water so we didn't come up cooking things like gumbo," so they were more into just southern cooking but not the creole cooking.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is that, is that near Grambling [Louisiana] or--
Speaker 2: Near Tallulah [Louisiana]--
Speaker 1: Tallulah, okay.
Speaker 2: --and we would always go to Tallulah first and then over to Monroe [Louisiana] which is near Grambling.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought so, okay.  All right.  Well, can you tell, so there's no, Sondheimer, that's an interesting name.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I do know that my grandfather was a sharecropper in Louisiana.  And he had nine children and they worked hard from sun up to sun down.  And they picked cotton and they planted everything that they ate just about, the beans, the greens, the sweet potatoes, the peanuts, the pecans, and they canned enough to last for the whole year.  So I've heard those stories over and over about how they had to work hard, everyone had a job from the time they almost started walking (laughter) and so it was like work hard, hard, hard.  So her father was the kind of man who could do or fix just about anything.  She tells the story of how he took an old Chevy [Chevrolet] car and turned it into a truck.  So to me that's amazing (laughter), they needed a truck and couldn't afford a truck so they took the car and turned it into a truck, how he did that I do not know but my grandfather was a man who was very resourceful.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess with nine children you had to be back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So that was like during the Depression [Great Depression]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --he was raising your mother (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and--
Speaker 1: --so.
Speaker 2: --so she talks about even now how, when I tell her, I have this bad habit of holding on to things because I watch her hold on to things and she said it probably goes back to when we didn't have much and we just didn't throw away things so I think growing up during that time probably had a lasting effect on her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: His name was Alex, A-L-E-X, Hortman, H-O-R-T-M-A-N, Sr. [Alex Hortman, Sr.].
Speaker 1: That's an unusual name too--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Hortman.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You hear Hartman a lot but hardly ever (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, but it's with the H-O, so a lot of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Hortman.
Speaker 2: --people will, the H-A-R.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And when he came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] he worked at the brewery and lost his sight.  And for a long time while he was losing his sight, continued to work and it was just amazing to me how he could do things, go in the kitchen and cook.  When we were little he would babysit us once he did lose his sight completely and couldn't work anymore, he was our babysitter, so we would go to Grandpapa's and he would say, "Get the door," and I said, "The doorbell didn't ring," and as soon as I would say that, ding-dong (laughter).  I was, "How could you know that?" But he had such a keen sense of hearing and keen sense of touch and he could just do things that just always amazed me being a blind man how he could still go in that kitchen and fix us lunch and never burn himself and I was always just watching him move around that kitchen and I guess once you lose your sight those other senses just become so keen.
Story_ID: 517662
Speaker 1: What about the other side of your mother's [Daisy Hortman Hall] family?  Can you, do you know anything about that side?  Your grandmother's side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my grandmother was Pearl Smith [Pearl Smith Hortman] and her family had 225 acres of land that they bought.  Her, her father bought and we heard stories all the time of how they tried to take that land away, but how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, where was the land?
Speaker 2: This was in Gibsland, G-I-B-S-L-A-N-D, Louisiana.  And they referred to it as the Smith Settlement [ph.] so every time we would go home down south we would go to the Smith Settlement and hear the stories of--
Speaker 1: Can, can you tell us some of those stories 'cause there, this is interesting history 'cause we know that after the Civil War there, you know, some black people did acquire some land but it was tough to hang on to it in those days.
Speaker 2: It was very tough to hang on to, they would burn like the cotton gin, they would burn the crop, trying to force them off the land so they wouldn't have money for the taxes.  And my grandmother would say they ate biscuits and sopped syrup (laughter) and things like that, they only had meat on Sunday just so they could save money.  I mean, it was very hard for them, my grandfather [sic. great-grandfather] and his, I think it was like fourteen of them.  And they really had to like fight off people who would try to come on the land and run them off but they just refused.  They couldn't get loans, they couldn't sell their crop, people were just trying to make it so hard for them but they continued to hold on to this land.  As a matter of fact they still have it today.  And--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and that is something that the younger generation now has come together trying to find out ways of making the land more profitable.  They have people who have, I guess, they come and look for oil on the land or buy the, the trees.  And so that money, now that we have so many descendants, the little check that my mother gets, it's not a big check but again the fact that the land is still there is what they're holding on to so hopefully that is something that the younger generation can look into more because with everyone spread so far out, I think there's only one or two families who still live on the land.  And it's been even now hard because people want to buy it off and they're just determined to keep it in the family.  So we were down there for a family reunion this past December, the first week in December, and went by the Smith Settlement.  But it's a--
Speaker 1: Are there any family members still living on (unclear)?
Speaker 2: They do have about two family members who still live there.  And, and so they're trying to figure out so, so many have moved away, California, we had people who came down from Seattle, Washington, family members from Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and Chicago [Illinois], Detroit [Michigan] all--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I got a couple--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --questions about this.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First of all, is there a story passed down in the family, an, an explanation of how they acquired that land first of all?
Speaker 2: And there is a story--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --about how they acquired the land because my, I guess, it would have been my great-great-great-grandfather when they were set free from slavery, him and his brothers came together and purchased this land and I guess because it was something that they really held dear, people tried to buy it back and they just refused to.
Speaker 1: So this is your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Great-great-grandfather who purchased the land (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) great-great-great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Purchased the land.  And do you know his name by any chance?
Speaker 2: Dillard Smith, Sr. [ph.].
Speaker 1: Dillard, okay.  Now, Dillard that's interesting and there's a Dillard University in Louisiana [New Orleans, Louisiana], in Louisiana but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, but I don't think he has anything to do with that. But his name was Dillard Smith.
Speaker 1: Dillard Smith, Sr.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he and his brothers--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --pooled their money--
Speaker 2: And purchased the land.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Unclear) and we're talking about really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And so for years they all lived--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on this land.  And so when they would have children then they would get grown and they would stay on the land.  And so it was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, yeah, that was the second question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So it was an extended family situation--
Speaker 2: Right, so--
Speaker 1: --so once they bought the land then all the rest of the Smiths--
Speaker 2: Just stayed there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) would, would develop a, a--
Speaker 2: Couple of plots.
Speaker 1: --a place--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on the, on the--
Speaker 2: On that land, so--
Story_ID: 517663
Speaker 1: So when we go back to my mother's father [Alex Hortman, Sr.], she remembers as a little girl growing up there [Gibsland, Louisiana] and then after her mom married and they moved away, they would always go back she would say for holidays and what they called the graveyard working, the first, and that's why we have family reunion the first Sunday in December, first weekend in December because they still go back and work the graves.  And I thought work the graves?  But I guess then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They have to be maintained.
Speaker 1: --blacks were not allowed to be buried in the white graveyards so they had their own.  And they would then have to go and pull the weeds up and keep it in good repair so I guess that's every first Sunday in December, people would come back and do graveyard work.  So when we went down for the family reunion we went to the cemetery and got a chance to see a lot of the old grave markings of ancestors.  So it was quite interesting 'cause I had not been back since I was a teenager so I went back this past year for the family reunion and vowed that I would take my child back next time (laughter) to actually see this because it was amazing to walk through the graveyard and see the Smiths and some of the stones were like hand carved or makeshift headstones and so it was just quite a history.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's quite a story of survival because I know there are whole parishes in Louisiana where blacks--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --were run out of the parish, their homes burned up, I mean, you know, land confiscated (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) well, one of my mother's [Daisy Hortman Hall] cousins told the story of how they were sitting one night in the house and men drove, well, rode through on horses, rode through on horses, her dad had been warned though that they were coming and he had left but they were coming to kill him and they all hid and they set the place on fire and so they had to get in the wagon and just leave in the middle of the night.  And to me that was just, she's in her nineties and she was telling this story to us while we were there this past year, so just to hear her say it and like it happened yesterday, the memories she had of the color of the horses, what the men had on, I mean, she was just so vivid how afraid she was and hiding under the beds and just being so fearful when the fire started and having to get in the wagon and ride away and they never--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --went back so.
Speaker 2: Now, so this is your grandmother, Pearl, Pearl Smith [Pearl Smith Hortman]?
Speaker 1: This would have been one of her--
Speaker 2: Oh, one of her--
Speaker 1: --sisters--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --right, who was telling the story, so.
Speaker 2: So it's like a great-aunt?
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 517664
Speaker 1: So it was just amazing to hear her [Daniels' maternal great-aunt] tell that story and to have it so vivid in her mind as a little girl, she said she could still just hear the crackling fire and being so afraid and knowing that they would never go back to the others (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So they never, they never went back?
Speaker 1: Her family never went back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But she lives in Louisiana but they never went back on the settlement [Gibsland, Louisiana].  But there are others who just refused to go and refused to be afraid and stayed, so it's amazing that--
Speaker 2: Now, there's a film, as we speak there's a new film out that'll be released to the general public in February called 'Banished' ['Banished: How Whites Drove Blacks Out of Town in America'].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: About black people who were chased out of Forsyth County, Georgia, Harris, Arkansas--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it's, I think, Pierce, Missouri [sic. Pierce City, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And their attempts to go back and reclaim graves--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and land and, you know, there's a Forsyth County, there's a, there's a place where there's a huge settlement like the Smith Settlement [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --where a family has gone back to try to get reparations for the land 'cause--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --they, they weren't allowed to come back to the land so the land was eventually sold and confiscated by the county--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --basically illegally, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --transferred to other white people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I think this is what they have tried to do.  Right now we're trying to raise money to get, I mean do a survey of the land to just make sure that other people have not even come onto and taken over some of the property because with a lot of people who have left now, they are afraid that people are trying to just come and claim that this is my land and they've gone to government officials and nobody wants to do anything so they say you have to have a land survey to prove that where your line, line, I guess, your land line goes before they can do anything.  So again, if you don't have money to do that, then you're just at the mercy of people who will just tell you we can't do anything.  So, so these are the kind of things that we talked about at the family reunion because the younger generations said we just cannot, knowing what our great-great-greats went through to get this land let people just come and take it away, so.
Speaker 2: Now, this is important.  It's a good thing that we did interview--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you for this story right now because this is, this is happening to a lot of people.
Speaker 1: Right.  And they're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) and to people--
Speaker 1: --saying that even today land is being taken away that people are not being given fair value like when they come and chop down the timber, how do you know that you're getting a fair value, they just say we'll give you X amount of dollars, but family members in the past never thought to say well, "We need to get estimates to see how much other people are paying," they would just take, whoever was on the, living there would just decide for the family, okay.
Speaker 2: I think a lot of families don't even see what the timber looks like even leaving their property or they don't know how much is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Property, right.  Or how much they're taking.
Speaker 2: --is being taken.
Speaker 1: Yes, so these are things that the younger generation was saying, "We need to be on top of it," so I was glad to hear them speaking up and telling the patriarchs of the family that we'll step in and help take care of these things so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was very-
Speaker 2: So I, I would take it that the majority of your family is, are, are urban dwellers now--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and not associated with farm--
Speaker 1: Right.  Like I said most of them--
Speaker 2: --work (simultaneous)"
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) have moved away.  And so and being so spread out, it's easy then to be taken advantage of because you only have a, like I said a couple of families who still live on the land and some of them are way up in age and so when people come to talk to them they're not really sure if they're getting a fair deal, it sounds good to them but they may be comparing prices with ten, twenty, maybe even fifty years ago (laughter) so we don't, not sure, that you are getting fair value market for the timber or even for the oil drilling.  So one nephew or grandchild, 'cause he's younger than I am, so he's maybe a, a grand of one of the members is a lawyer in Louisiana and he was at the reunion so he was saying he was going to take it upon himself to look into some of this.
Story_ID: 517665
Speaker 1: Let's move on to your mother [Daisy Hortman Hall].  Did, did your mother have any special stories about growing up and what, and that explain like what, what it was like for her growing up [in Gibsland, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Well, the segregation in the South, I think that's one of the reasons they came to the North for better jobs because there were things that they could not partake of like education, they had the inferior schools that they got the books after the white schools were finished with them.  Although the one-room schools and one of her teachers I had a chance to meet.  And so she was always proud to be able to get the education she received although they didn't have the best of books or the building but she said the teachers were always loving and caring.  Teacher lived in the neighborhood so they knew everyone.  And so I think a lot of times she compares that to the education young people are getting now and how they don't take advantage of it where they were eager to learn and glad to go to school 'cause that also meant they weren't working in the field when they could go to school (laughter) but once it came time for harvest and all that they had to leave school so that was always something she stressed to us to get an education and not to take it lightly 'cause it was something she always wanted, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: No, I think she went to the tenth grade in her education.  And then when we moved here, she did go back and take courses at the technical college, Milwaukee Area Technical College [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] here (background noise) and also at our church campus [Holy Redeemer Christian Academy, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] she took some courses but I think that was something she always regretted not being able to go further with her education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I going to pause for a second, we're hearing a phone in the background there.
Speaker 1: It probably is a phone.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  You were, you said your mother took courses, courses in Milwaukee Area Technical College and she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, and then Mason, we had a Charles Harrison Mason Bible College [Charles H. Mason Bible College, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] who offered courses so she attended there also.  But for her children it was something that she wanted us to do well in school and always stressed that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did, did she work when she came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she worked and retired from the Milwaukee County Hospital [Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  She was there for I wanna say like over twenty years maybe as a hospital attendant.
Story_ID: 517666
Speaker 1: Well, let's go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Levester, L-E-V-E-S-T-E-R, and Powell, P-O-W-E-L-L, Hall, H-A-L-L [Levester Hall].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth would have been, well, 12/08/1926 [December 8, 1926].  And he was born in Prentiss, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-R-I, Prentiss, P-R-I-N-T-E-S-S [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's near Jackson, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt used to tell the story of, and she just called him Old Man John [ph.] who married her great-grandmother.  Old Man John was a white man who married my great-grandmother [sic.] in Mississippi and dared anybody, dared anybody (laughter) to, to bother her or touch her or say anything negative to her so she often tells that story (background noise).  And now that's my cell phone going.  I'm so sorry maybe--
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We were talking about Old Man John--
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: --marrying your, your--
Speaker 2: My grandmother who was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This, this would be your--
Speaker 2: --my great-great--
Speaker 1: --your grandmother, your great--
Speaker 2: --well my great-great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Great-great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so down in Mississippi and--
Speaker 1: And what was her name, is it--
Speaker 2: Her name was Zarah, Z-A-R-A-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So you don't know what John's last name was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't because that's the only way my aunt referred to him as Old Man John (laughter) and so I often thought that we really, and I hope, hope that someone does have a tape because she would sit around at family reunions and tell us the story about my little short grandmother and how he was so protective of her, my great-great-grand, great-great-grandmother she would have been, yes.  But my dad father's, Margo Hall [ph.], again they had a farm and did sharecropping also in Mississippi.  And then moved from Prentiss to Louisiana after my dad's mother died.  So my grandma--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --passed away when my dad was very small and then my grandfather remarried and moved to Louisiana and that's how or where he met my mom [Daisy Hortman Hall] when they were married in Louisiana.  But the Hall-Hortmans, my dad married my mom, my dad's a Hall, my mom's a Hortman.  Then my dad's sister who was a Hall, married my mom's brother who was a Hortman.  And then my dad's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, okay.  So you got--
Speaker 2: --so we have all the Hall-Hortman's intertwined.  My dad's other sister married my mom's first cousin who was a Hortman, so we often have a Hall-Hortman family gatherings because we're like double first cousins or we have become so close over the years it's hard to tell who's related how but we just all say Hall-Hortmans, so if you're a Hall or a Hortman we just consider you related but on both sides.  So we have enjoyed that relationship for many years here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] the Hall-Hortmans so people just kind of put those names together, the Hall-Hortman Family. So it's--
Story_ID: 517667
Speaker 1: Did your dad [Levester Hall] have a chance to finish school in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: No, he only, I think, went up to like the eighth grade in Louisiana and then when he came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] he got a job in a factory, Rexnord [Rexnord Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or Chain Belt [Chain Belt Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] it was called then.
Speaker 1: What was it, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Chain Belt, C-H--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --A-I-N, B-E-L-T, the name of it now was Rexnord though.  And he was a spray painter.  And they would spray, he would spray paint trucks, cement trucks.  And he passed away in 1984, my dad.
Story_ID: 517668
Speaker 1: Describe your parents' [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] personalities for us and, and what were they like or what are they like--
Speaker 2: Personalities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) well he (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, my dad was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's passed.
Speaker 2: --a very soft-spoken person but once he told you to do something (laughter) you knew he meant business, he didn't have to raise his voice, he didn't have to tell you twice, he was just a very strong person who did not do a lot of talking but once he asked you to do something you knew to do it.  He was very big on family, brothers and sisters, he brought his mom and dad [Margo Hall (ph.)] up from Louisiana, they stayed with us when they first came then bought a house right across the street from us, so family was always important to him.  And being the youngest, or one of the younger kids he did have a younger sister, but, and a younger brother, but he really looked after family, he just thought family was important and he put that into us that we always had to support one another.  If a family member was doing something you were to be there to be supportive, so I think that's the thing I remember most and appreciate most about him, how he put that love for family in us.  And then he was also a very strong believer and deacon in the church [Church of God in Christ] and that was very important to him.  He did not let anything get in the way of going to church.  And again family, we all went together if there was something to be done at church, we were all there as a family to, to support.  So I think until this day we have a first, the, the team is called Team Number One [ph.] but it's at the church that he, we grew up in, he started the team concept where membership was divided into teams and they would raise money to support the church, all the things that needed to be done in the church and he would always start out that drive.  And so after he passed away we all came together as a family and continue, and now every February, even though we go to different churches, we go back to his church and celebrate him by starting off that drive with Team Number One.

Speaker 1: Tell us something about your mother's [Daisy Hortman Hall] personality.
Speaker 2: My mother is a little different than my dad [Levester Hall] she is a very outspoken (laughter) person.  And so she, she, if she didn't like something you knew it right away because she was going to let you know.  And she's also the kind of grandmother and mother who loves her family and will do anything to help, if I need someone to babysit, I could always call on her.  She was the kind of grandmother and mother who was always there for you.  And so we just celebrated her eightieth birthday in August and it was just heartwarming to see all the family members come out because she has grandkids who can say what, Mama Daisy they call her, Mama Daisy would say, everybody knows what Mama Daisy would say in certain situations.  If you have on something that's not appropriate she's gonna let you know that that dress, they cheated you out of your money, it's way too short, (laughter) you paid that much money (laughter) and that's the only material you got, you take that back.  So the grandkids know that Mama Daisy is going to let you know exactly how she feels, so, it's just been a blessing though to have her here for eighty years and she still drives, still gets around, still is a person you can just count on.  She, again, tries to encourage the grandkids to do their best because she feels that they have opportunities that she wish she could have had and so she has been their supporters, their cheerleaders, telling them they can make it, they can do it, so.  And again very involved in the church, very--
Speaker 1: This is a Baptist church, right?
Speaker 2: No, it's the Church of God in Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bethesda Church of God in Christ [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And she goes to Memphis [Tennessee]--
Speaker 1: What's the name of it, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Bethesda.
Speaker 1: Bethesda, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She goes to Memphis every year for the church international conventions and the women's convention, she won't miss those and she is very involved.  To get her to miss a Sunday would be, had to be something very important.  We had a cousin that was married last week on a Sunday in St. Louis [Missouri] and it took a lot to get her there because she just didn't wanna miss her service.  And they told her we have churches in St. Louis, (laughter) I can find you a Church of God in Christ, just come on down for the wedding.  And so she did but it was something that she does not put much in front of her church services so the kids know that also.  And respect her for her beliefs because she will tell them when they're wrong and even if you don't agree with her I say you have to listen 'cause one day you'll come back like I have to say that she was right.  A lot of times we don't think our older relatives know what they're talking about, times have changed, the young people will say but a lot of the things that she will tell them like your friend is not your friend, you know, Jesus is the only friend you really have (laughter) and you need to know that now so.  Friends have gotten them into trouble so they come back to say, all right, I should have listened to what Mama Daisy said.  So she is the one who keeps us on the right path.
Story_ID: 517670
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I think they actually met at a church, and again that was their--as they would say, they would go to town on Saturdays and to church on Sunday, that was their outings, their social life.  And there were only two churches in the little town that they lived in and so everybody went to those two churches, even if you were different denominations or weren't really raised that way you went there more for your social outings.  And so that's where my dad [Levester Hall] met my mom [Daisy Hortman Hall].  And--
Speaker 1: Is that in Sondheimer [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in Gibsland [Louisiana], in Gibsland.
Speaker 1: Gibsland, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And my dad and mom were married December 3rd, and she took off her wedding dress and then gave it to my dad's sister and she was married in it (laughter) that same day (laughter).
Speaker 1: The same day?
Speaker 2: Same day, same dress (laughter).  And my aunt made the dress for them so they tell that story.  And then the other sister, my dad's other sister got married like a week or two later in that same dress so they, like I said, were very, very close right from the beginning and had their first child a day apart, so I guess that Hall-Hortman bond like I said started right from the beginning and still exists today, so.
Story_ID: 517671
Speaker 1: Now, who do you think you take after the most of your two parents?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a, I have always been a daddy's girl so I'd like to say that I'm just like my daddy now.  People may not agree with that (laughter), but I have always been a daddy's girl and so I would say I'm more like my dad [Levester Hall], um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've learned to appreciate my mother [Daisy Hortman Hall] though once my dad passed away she was the rock that held us all together so I have learned to appreciate her more but growing up I was a daddy's girl and just thought again if I could just get him to stop listening to my mother (laughter) things would be so much better here (laughter) because I thought I could just get anything from my dad but she would always step in and say no, you're not doing this or you're not doing that so she was the one who laid down the law.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 517672
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory, well, having two older brothers I can remember wanting to be like them and read and have homework before I could even go to school.  So I, I think that's one of my earliest childhood memories just trying to follow after my brothers [Samuel Hall and James Hall] and do the things that they were doing.  And because of that I think I just wanted to read so bad that I did start reading at a very early age and dialing the telephone for them because I could do those kind of things because I just wanted to be a big girl so badly.  And so I think we lived on 2nd Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and having relatives all around, my dad's brother was three houses away, my [maternal] grandparents [Pearl Smith Hortman and Alex Hortman, Sr.], once they moved out, right across the street and so just having them around us I think too was a, a memory that goes way back, having family always around, having grandmother to come over, if my parents [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] had to work she was right there to help look out for us.  I can remember washing the greens and putting them on, being the oldest girl, having to do things like that.  And having my grandmother come over and say I didn't wash them well enough because there was grit in the bottom of pot and had to be thrown out.  And I was thinking about that one day because even today when I wash greens I just wash 'em until almost the green is gone because I don't (laughter) want any grit in the pot because I still remember how she fussed at me for messing up that whole pot of greens.  So having family around to teach me things like that would be some of my early memories.  And I wonder why were they letting me wash greens that early, so I must have been a very responsible young lady because I couldn't have been more than eight or nine when that happened.  So now when I look back at that, I think, I must have really been responsible, I was willing to do things like that.
Story_ID: 517673
Speaker 1: Now, you were right across the street from your [maternal] grandparents [Pearl Smith Hortman and Alex Hortman, Sr.], what, what street did you grow up on, and what neighborhood was it called (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On 2nd Street, 2042 North 2nd Street, so that was right in the inner city.  And my parents [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] owned that home and have, my brother just recently sold it because now they're taking those old homes and making them into condominiums, remodeling them, stripping them, and selling them for big bucks.  So but back then it was like the inner city, 2nd Street.
Speaker 1: Did, did it have a name, the neighborhood have a name?  What did they call it?
Speaker 2: Brewer Hill is the name that it was known as and even now, that they're revitalizing that area it's called Brewer's Hill [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And it's like a historical era, area now where you have to get permission to do any changing of the outsides of the homes.  So but I think when we moved there a lot of the Jewish people were leaving and we were coming, they were selling the homes to blacks there so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it was a Jewish neighborhood before?
Speaker 2: Neighborhood originally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Story_ID: 517674
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, sights and sounds and smells.  We always had good cooking.  My mother [Daisy Hortman Hall] is a very good cook.  So smells would always be things like pots of greens and black eyed peas and pinto beans.  Birthdays we always had the same thing, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and green beans, that was, I mean, green peas, that was your birthday meal.  Sundays we always had big meals.  My mother could make the best dressing to this day that I've ever tasted, fried chicken, candied yams, she'd make sweet potato pudding now that is very good so, she was, always been a good cook and so those smells when you walked in the house, we always had plenty of food, it may not have been the best of foods but it was always plenty of it and we could eat, the seven kids, and each have a friend or two over and still have food.  So I can remember kids saying we're going to your house, I know there's gonna be enough food to eat so that was something we always had, plenty of food.  And then sounds, gospel music was the thing that my mom would play a lot of, she loved to sing and so she would have the gospel music playing.  And, of course, whenever she left home my brothers [Daniels' older brothers, Samuel Hall and James Hall] would bring out other kind of music so, but--
Speaker 1: Now, was there an official conflict about the music?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely being Church of God in Christ and everything in our house was sanctified, we did not play anything but gospel music on the sanctified record player but (laughter) like I said as soon as she left the house my brothers had other plans and so they would have all the latest Temptations [The Temptations] or Four Tops.  So that kind of music would come out when she left.  But you wouldn't dare play it if she was home so she had very strict rules and so there were things that we were not allowed to even put on her record player if she was there that had to come off.  So but I have brothers who loved to sing and my brother was a dancer, he loved to dance so teaching you how to do the bop and all those things that were forbidden, we did when she wasn't around.  So I guess those are the things that I remember growing up.
Story_ID: 517675
Speaker 1: Do you think that youth are just gonna do those things anyway regardless of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so.
Speaker 1: --what adults tell them?
Speaker 2: I think there's going to be certain things that you forbid that kids will still do and just experiment with I think because that peer pressure is there.  And so I have had friends who know how I was raised and so they knew when they came to our house certain things were not going to be allowed but they also knew that if they weren't there, my parents [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] were not home that there were certain things we would also do.  So my parents had very strict rules and at the time I just thought it was very unfair that we had to abide by them.  But now I look back and say that that made me who I am today.  Those rules are some of the same ones I've embraced now so.  It's hard on kids growing up so with my children [John W. Daniels III and Inez Daniels] I kind of understand when I say, "No, you can't wear that," how she may still sneak behind my back (laughter) and put it on, I say that's payback.  So, you know, when I was coming up it was the hot pants so we could not wear them, my dad would have a fit but sometimes we would have them on under that skirt and once you got out the house you would do what you had to do but never would you leave the house with that on so those are the things I remember about growing up.  And I think kids are that way today that they will do certain things, hopefully there is a limit though, there were some lines I did not cross growing up so and I'm hoping that the teaching I'm putting into my children there are lines they won't cross but--
Speaker 1: Now, now was, was, were you allowed to watch television and go to movies?
Speaker 2: TV, yes, movies, no.  Even when 'The Ten Commandments' came out and I wanted so badly to go (laughter) and see 'The Ten Commandments' and they just said, "No, we're not going to the theater to watch 'The Ten Commandments' because you would be sitting in the seats of the scornful."  So we had very strict rules like that.
Speaker 1: So though, that, that was the language that as sanctified--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you, you were considered sanctified--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because you're a member of the Church of God in Christ (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Church of God in Christ.  And back then the rules--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --were a lot stricter than they are now and so--
Speaker 1: And then, then the scornful are those who are not members or, or--
Speaker 2: Well, just that people who didn't believe and so even though they've put 'The Ten Commandments' in a film we know the ten commandments, "So why do you have to go and watch it there," she would say so.  I said, "But the people are saying it's a wonderful movie."  To this day I don't think my mother if you told her, unless it was gonna be Jesus probably at the theater (laughter) I don't think she would go.  She is just set in those old traditions, so.
Speaker 1: But would she watch, she would, she would watch television?
Speaker 2: She would watch TV because then you control who's around you.  I think that it wasn't, wasn't so much that it was the movie but going to the movie theater and I don't know what she thought was going on there but there were people who may not be believers or some of the movies she had heard about I guess were not--
Speaker 1: And you can't turn them--
Speaker 2: --particular things that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I guess you couldn't turn, turn them off.
Speaker 2: --turn, you had no control or if something came on that was objectionable you couldn't switch the channels.  So, so she was very strict about that so there were a lot of things that I had to do without telling her I guess I would say or if I wanted to go to a movie it was not something I could say, "Let's all go to a movie as a family," and that was just not allowed.
Story_ID: 517676
Speaker 1: Did you like to read when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved to read.  They called me [President] Abraham Lincoln's sister because (laughter) well, why they thought his sister read a lot, I don't know, but that's what I was nicknamed sometime because I would read until she [Daniels' mother, Daisy Hortman Hall] would have to say, "Turn the lights out, it is time to go to bed, no more reading," but I loved to read.  And to this day if I have time with nothing to do that's my first choice, give me a book and let me just curl up and read.  So that was always one of my passions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have favorite reading material?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was growing up the Doctor Dolittle stories, I remember going through those and 'The Good Earth,' Pearl S. Buck that was always one of my favorites.  So, I just even now we have a book club, a group of young ladies here and we try to read a variety of books but a lot of the African American writers, so I just enjoy reading.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what else did you like to do growing up?  Did you have any other favorite pastimes?
Speaker 2: Well, having two older brothers [Samuel Hall and James Hall] sports was something that I was exposed to because they played football and baseball, so I liked to go and watch so I ended up being a cheerleader in high school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and a cheerleader in college [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] so to this day I enjoy a good basketball game and baseball just takes too long but I will go if I have to 'cause I married a fellow [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] who loves sports also so we do a fair amount of that.  I like to travel and that's something that I just hope I'll get to do more of now that I'm retired, would love to go to Africa, would love to go to Spain, places like that, that I've just haven't had a chance to visit but have read about so that's my love to travel.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were, when you were growing up, [HistoryMaker] Hank Aaron was a big baseball star here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes, and my daddy [Levester Hall] loved baseball, so maybe that's another reason why.  He would take off from work for the World Series.  And I can remember when Milwaukee was in the World Series and that was something that he just loved.  He would schedule vacation time to watch the World Series so and it was good because he could also then be home with us, we would come home to good smells, he would fry the best potatoes and smothered potatoes, he knew how to make potatoes so many different ways so we would just love to come home, creamed potatoes, every day would be a different type of potatoes he had fixed and it was just great to have him home but he would be there to watch that game, the World Series, so growing up with Hank Aaron those were some good days.  We hated when the Braves [Milwaukee Braves; Atlanta Braves] left Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Right, right, and that was in the, yeah, early '70s [1970s], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's a, was it earlier, I'm not--
Speaker 2: Well, it must have been earlier--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I would think because I don't know the exact year but I do know it was a sad day in Milwaukee when they left.  And I must have been in grade school though when they were in the World Series.  And I just remember being very young.  But when Hank Aaron came back to the Brewers [Milwaukee Brewers] and hit that home run, you know, his record home run that was again I thought of, the good days were back so that was a good time.  I got to meet Hank Aaron personally and that was one of the things I told him the good times my dad had listening to him on the radio.  And I remember one Father's Day getting that transistor radio for him so that he could listen to the ball games and, and so those were some good memories, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were the Green Bay Packers important, I know, I know they were champions and, and when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, to my brothers, my father was not a football fan but my brothers both played football in high school so they loved watching the Packers but that was not the sport that my dad really loved.  Baseball was his sport, so.
Story_ID: 517677
Speaker 1: Now, how many of you are there?  Now, you're, you're, you've got older brothers but how many (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have two older brothers, there were seven, seven children, so we had four girls and three boys.
Speaker 1: And can you name all your brothers and sisters and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Sam [Samuel Hall], James [James Hall], then I'm the third, Irma [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] the first girl, then Dolores [Dolores Hall Lenora], Debra [Debra Hall Martin], and Andra [Andra Hall Brown], and I have a baby brother, Ricky [Ricky Hall].  And I have one brother who passed away about three years ago.  And the rest of us are all here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] so Thanksgiving was a big gathering, all six of us and our children at my mom's [Daisy Hortman Hall] house and we all had a big spread so those are traditions we carry on every Thanksgiving twelve o'clock, dinner is served, every Christmas twelve o'clock, dinner is served, so we all know to be there.
Story_ID: 517678
Speaker 1: Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school at Palmer Elementary School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and that was one of my happiest days 'cause like I said having two older brothers [Samuel Hall and James Hall] and watching them go off to school, when I finally became a big girl to go to kindergarten that was wonderful.  And then--
Speaker 1: So this was about 1955 or '6 [1956], I guess?
Speaker 2: Probably '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And then we moved in 1961 I think to 10th Street and then I went to Twelfth Street School [Twelfth Street Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I finished up elementary at Twelfth Street and went to Robert Fulton Junior High [Robert Fulton Junior High School; Robert Fulton Middle School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then North Division High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  North Division was about 98 percent, I would say, black at the time and in the inner city so it was a school with a lot of tradition though, basket, great basketball teams, and some of my best memories in high school so it was a good time.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any favorite teachers in grade school or any mentors?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Johnson [ph.] was my third grade teacher and a teacher that was very strict but very, very good teacher and I always remembered her as a teacher that I admired.  And then when I got to high school I had a physical education teacher named Sarah Grant and she was not only a teacher but a mentor.  She was over the cheerleading squad but her thing was always be a young lady and so that was something that I think she had a big impact on a lot of the girls in that school because she was from New York [New York], so she had a lot of style and a lot of class.  She graduated from Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] but she always impressed on us to be young ladies no matter what.  And because our school was a school full of minorities, a lot of times they got bad raps and sometimes they were earned but her thing was you can be whoever you want to be but you make your own decisions and you have to suffer the consequences when you make bad ones so she really tried to steer us into making good decisions, so I, to this day thank her for that education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there any subject in particular that you gravitated towards?
Speaker 2: I loved math and wanted at one time to be an accountant but that changed after I had a teacher named Miss Fox [ph.] for advanced math and I think she was a new teacher, I didn't realize that at the time but she was intimidated I think by being in a school full of minorities and--
Speaker 1: Was she white?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  A young white teacher.  And spent most of her days frustrated I think as I look back now as a teacher I can see that that was her problem, not having good discipline and letting kids take advantage of that.  And when you're a kid, you don't just stand up to other kids (laughter) and say, okay, "We're here to learn, sit down, be quiet."  But I think that was one thing that impressed on me though the importance of having good class management in a class when I did start teaching, that I would never let a class get out of hand the way that class did because it just kind of turned me off then to math all together because she was not able to teach unfortunately.  And she might have been a good teacher but if you didn't have control of the classroom and even those who wanted to learn had to suffer because of that.  So, so that was the end of my love of math after having that class so.
Story_ID: 517679
Speaker 1: Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, always on the honor roll, always enjoyed learning and, and was always a good student.  I had a brother right over me who was a very challenging student.  And I remember going into Miss Johnson's [ph.] class, the third grade teacher that I loved so much, but the first day I came in she said, "Irma Hall [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels], are you related to James Hall?"  I said, "Yes."  "Then your seat will be right here in front of me so I can reach you (laughter)."  And then after about two weeks she came back to me and said okay, "I'm sorry that I prejudged, you can have any seat in the room you want because you are not the student your brother was when I had him."  But he was the student that would challenge a teacher's nerve so I loved her class though because she was a very strong disciplinarian and I think back that she was just letting me know right from day one, "If you think you're gonna come in here and act up, you're not going to do that," so, and knowing my brother, I'm sure he challenged her many a day so I could understand that but I loved school.  Had perfect attendance many a days because I just didn't wanna miss it.
Story_ID: 517680
Speaker 1: Now, you were a cheerleader [at North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And were you involved in any other class activities?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had the booster girls [girls booster club], we had the Future Teachers of America.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: So you, had you, had you identified that as your occupation, as, as a career goal?
Speaker 2: After, yes, after I decided I wanted to be a teacher, once I decided I wasn't gonna go into accounting, that teaching would be my next goal.  But we, but back then I changed a lot because I thought at one time I wanted to be a physical therapist.  I wanted to work with sick children but then I didn't have the stomach for that.  So, so then I decided teaching and because Miss Grant [Sarah Grant] had been my cheerleading coach and I loved her so much I decided to go into physical education and health so that's what I majored in in college [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin].
Story_ID: 517681
Speaker 1: What was the process by which you chose your college?  I mean was there, was it, were you offered a scholarship or did somebody come along and suggest, or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I wanted to go to a school that was close by and unfortunately if I had to do it over I probably wouldn't have had that in my mind, I didn't wanna go too far from home but being the family-oriented person I was, I didn't wanna go too far away from home.  And so I had friends of my brothers [Samuel Hall and James Hall] who were at Oshkosh which is only like an hour and thirty minutes maybe away from Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and they were playing football up there and they would come home and talk about what a good time they were having at the school and they really liked it and suggested I apply there.  And so I did but--
Speaker 1: This is Oshkosh College?
Speaker 2: It's University of Wisconsin--
Speaker 1: Wisconsin, okay.
Speaker 2: --Oshkosh.
Speaker 1: Oh, university, okay.
Speaker 2: It's one of the UW [University of Wisconsin] branches.  So at the time that I attended though it was called Oshkosh State University [sic. Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But now it's UW Oshkosh, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh [Oshkosh, Wisconsin].
Story_ID: 517682
Speaker 1: What was Milwaukee [Wisconsin] like when you were growing up?  I mean, what was, you know, how, well, what were the, what was the racial climate here in, in, in--
Speaker 2: And when you say racial climate here, I think where I lived it was always basically in a black neighborhood.  There might have been one or two whites in the area on the block but not a lot.  So it was basically families like my family, they had lots of children, we all interacted, we had good times, we had our little falling outs but we made up and kept playing with each other.  So I think we had a lot of strong families back then and our families had very similar values.  And so I just remember my childhood as being a loving kind of time where I could go to friends' house and play and have a good time.  They didn't have always the same rules that I had because like I said we were the strict family but still the families that had strong Christian values so we were allowed to visit and play and have a good time.  And parents didn't worry much about things that were going on that would be detrimental to your life, whereas I think today things have changed in that sense where I don't ever remember going to anyone's house where their father had a gun out or they knew where the gun was and let me show it to you.  Now, my father [Levester Hall] hunted so we had rifles but they were never anywhere where we could reach them, so, so those were things that you didn't have to worry about as a parent.  So I have fond memories of my childhood growing up.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any black elected officials when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do remember [HistoryMaker] Vel Phillips as an alderman.  She was the first black lady elected here in Milwaukee as an alderman.  And I lived on 10th [10th Street] and Clarke [Clarke Street] right up the street from where Father Groppi [James Groppi] was the priest and he would have his meetings for fair housing marches at St. Boniface Church [St. Boniface Roman Catholic Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that was on 11th [11th Street] and Clarke and I lived on 10th and Clarke.  So there were things that we knew needed to be changed in this city.  There were places you knew you couldn't live if you wanted to, you were not allowed to have homes there, that people did not welcome you there.  But still I think we felt that we could work hard and achieve certain things in the communities so I don't think we looked at it as being restrictive to the point that you could not go into that neighborhood.  I mean, we would go places that we knew we couldn't live but I guess it wasn't something that was really stressed.
Speaker 1: So you didn't feel terrorized or anything (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I didn't feel terrorized or like my life was different from anyone else's because of that.  I think our parents shielded us a lot, from a lot that was going on also where they didn't talk much about the people who lived on the other side of Capitol Drive [Wisconsin Highway 190] other than--
Speaker 1: Was that the dividing line between white and blacks (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, a lot of blacks did not go past Capitol Drive.  So when you--
Speaker 1: So very clear--
Speaker 2: --moved to Capitol Drive, when blacks finally did move past Capitol Drive then that was a big deal if they bought a house on the other side of Capitol Drive.  So, yes, so I guess we knew there were areas 'cause Milwaukee's always been a very segregated place but it wasn't like you couldn't go to Capitol Court [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which was the shopping center, you could go there and shop but you just didn't expect to see anyone going across the street to that house to say, "This is where I live."

Speaker 1: North Division High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was the only black high school in town?
Speaker 2: No.  Lincoln, our rival, they had a large black and Hispanic population, Lincoln High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Yeah, even when you were growing up there--
Speaker 2: Even when I was growing up.
Speaker 1: --there was Hispanic?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and then the other high schools had some blacks but they were all, the rest of them were majority white students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were in school were most of your teachers white or black?
Speaker 2: I would say we had still mostly white teachers.  We had a fair number of black teachers but I would say the majority was still white.  And a lot of the black teachers there were very concerned about students, I must say that that I think is one thing that really helped out knowing that you had teachers who were looking out for you.
Story_ID: 517684
Speaker 1: Now, we were talking about how you chose Oshkosh State University [sic. Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] then.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: I mean, it's now known as University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh [Oshkosh, Wisconsin] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my brother's [Daniels' older brothers, Samuel Hall and James Hall] friends who were there told me it was a good place to go so I applied because like I said, I wanted to stay close, so I never even considered looking at things like Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And then you have guidance counselors who would say, "There are other places you should be looking," and so I really hate that I never looked into those options but no one really, I had a cousin who went to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] so I knew about Fisk but again to me that was so far away.  I just wanted to be close but if she had maybe even told me more about it I might have considered going to a black college [HBCU] or going further away from home.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Never even thought of that even with my teacher [Sarah Grant] who was a cheerleader there and often talked about it, but I think I just wanted to be close to home and so I didn't really look into those options and maybe if my parents [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] had been more aware of different schools too they may have given me more input to look other places.  And then I think probably with the money issue maybe that was another reason they wanted me close to home too because tuition, of course, for out of state would have been a lot more than in state so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So this is 1967 you graduate from high school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were--
Speaker 2: I graduated a year early.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's a year.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How, how did that happen?  You skipped a grade?
Speaker 2: I did skip a grade in sixth grade and or a half semester and then I went to summer school so that I wouldn't have to graduate in January so that put me into the 1966 class.
Story_ID: 517685
Speaker 1: So I was seventeen going away to college [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] so I guess that was a good thing that I was close to home.  And Oshkosh [Wisconsin] was a whole new awakening though because I had never been away from home like that and then to go to a community that was all white and some of the people were not very welcoming so it was like the first time where you would be called out of your name--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --walking down the streets so.
Speaker 2: So people would, would call you the N word?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that to me was a whole new, a whole new awakening.  And so Oshkosh took a lot of adjusting for me.  It was not a, a friendly place.  There were some people who were friendly but--
Speaker 2: In retrospect when you look back, back at it--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and you, you said your brothers [Daniels' older brothers, Samuel Hall and James Hall] had a good experience there.
Speaker 1: My brothers' friends.
Speaker 2: Your brothers' friends.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so my brothers did not go to college, they started out at MATC [Milwaukee Area Technical College, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] but the pull of A.O. Smith [A.O. Smith Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and working they decided to take the money and work the jobs so that's what they were doing.  And so fellows who had played on the football team with them, who were good friends of theirs were at Oshkosh.  And, and again when you're on the football team maybe you have a different experience so maybe they were more welcomed and didn't have to endure much of that but--
Speaker 2: What would you guess, I know you don't know exactly but what was the percentage of black students there would you say roughly?
Speaker 1: At Oshkosh--
Speaker 2: Or how many say--
Speaker 1: --the population was like ten thousand and I think, I can actually tell you that we had maybe about, and it was the record number of blacks at Oshkosh the year that I attended, I think there were ninety-six.
Speaker 2: Okay. Out of ten thousand?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so that was the highest number of blacks they'd ever had there.  And so I think it was an eye-opener and a lot of kids were from rural Wisconsin and so had never even gone to school with blacks, some had never been up close with blacks so we would have girls who would come in the room, we would sit around and talk and they would just out of curiosity want to know things, if you're doing your hair they would just come and sit and (laughter) look at you like okay, "Let me see how you do that."  So it was a learning experience.  I can remember having a roommate my sophomore year because my freshmen year my, my good friend from high school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] we roomed together, my sophomore year though a girl from Illinois and they put us together as roommates and I had an early morning class and I can remember coming back and she was telling other girls I was a great roommate if only she could bleach me (laughter).  I thought, what (laughter)?  So that was the end of us rooming together so after I confronted her on that 'cause I walked in on her saying that, I said, "What do you mean, if only you could bleach me, what does that mean that you wouldn't mind me being your roommate if I was white, I mean, you wanna bleach me?" So she went down and asked to be moved, and I was glad so I got to have a room to myself for the rest of the semester but I just thought that showed her, the way she was thinking coming from Chicago [Illinois] area I would have thought she wouldn't have had those views but I guess prejudice was just there.  So there were girls like that and there were other girls who I think just genuinely wanted to know more about me because they just had not been around blacks and so their questions and concerns were just genuine so I just tried to take it for that, to think not everyone was prejudiced but there were definitely some who were.
Story_ID: 517686
Speaker 1: Did you have any black professors there [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: No.  I think maybe my junior year we had a dorm master whose husband was going there for grad school.  And so she might have been the first black adult that we had on campus but I don't recall having black professors at all.  So, so it was a place that was very different and so we started a Black Student Union and, of course, there were Black Power movements going on and in '68 [1968] they did have an uprising at the campus and ninety-four of the ninety-six were expelled so--
Speaker 1: Ninety--okay, so this is '68 [1968] is this after the, the killing of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: King was killed in April--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and this happened in November of '68 [1968], so I think I would say it was after his assassination but I don't think the uprising, I think it was just--
Speaker 1: It wasn't a direct result but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) a direct result of that.  I think it was more just that we're tired of the way people are treating us on campus and they were making certain demands asking for things on campus, to have black history classes and, and just not be--
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in, in the Black Student Union?
Speaker 2: I was involved in the Black Student Union.  That morning I had an early class and just happened to be coming by the administrative building and saw people there, actually I had missed that meeting that they were supposed to meet so I was just going to see what was going on and before I could get out they had the building surrounded so I was there, although I was not involved in any of the disruption so it was either try to leave the building with all these people surrounding it in riot gear or just stay put, so I chose to stay (laughter) put so I just--
Speaker 1: So, so let me get this straight again, the, the black students had took over a building?
Speaker 2: Took over the president's office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Okay.  And so--
Speaker 1: And so this is the--
Speaker 2: They called in the National (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) security, okay.
Speaker 2: --Guards [National Guard] and so they had the building surrounded.  And so I was on the second floor, I was not in the president's office but I was on the second floor talking to a friend about what was going down when she said, "Okay, you're here now, because (laughter) you're either gonna walk outside and they're gonna get you anyway or you might as well just stay here with us," so I thought, "Oh, my god, okay.  So this is what I'm going to have to do just stay right here."  So we were arrested and expelled, all of us from school, they didn't wanna hear who was involved just because you were in the building you were--
Speaker 1: This is incredible ninety-four of the ninety-six black students--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were expelled?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Okay.  Now, and there might have been more than ninety-six at that time 'cause I was saying, well, I think it was ninety-six my freshmen year but, but yes, but ninety-four of us because it was called the Oshkosh 94, we were all expelled, yeah, so.
Speaker 1: That I've never heard a story about that many--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --students being expelled (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Expelled from the school, so it was an awful thing.
Story_ID: 517687
Speaker 1: And then I came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and tried to go to UW-Milwaukee [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: So wait, wait a minute now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I just wanted to go back over that.  I know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you were expelled and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but, but did, did anybody try to fight it or anybody try to defend you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, we went to court, we went to court--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Lloyd Barbee [Lloyd A. Barbee], a civil rights lawyer here in Milwaukee--
Speaker 2: Lloyd Barbee?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was our attorney and, and he took depositions from all of us and tried to say to them, "How can you expel all of them when some were not even inside that office?" So, you know, "How can you just say everybody is guilty," but they decided then to, I think they just charged us all with disorderly conduct or assembly without permit, refusing to leave the building, all those things they put there and, and so they still had a right they said to expel us, so we were all expelled for the rest of the school year.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Just for that school year?  For the rest of that school year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) we were, this happened in November so we couldn't come back until, and they had to fight for that, for us to come back the following year.
Speaker 2: So they didn't, they didn't extend that you could come back that you had to fight to get back in?
Speaker 1: Well he, Lloyd Barbee, fought for the right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fought for the right, okay.
Speaker 1: --for us to come back.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  To say that--
Speaker 2: And so, so--
Speaker 1: --they could not keep us out forever.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That the suspension then went from that semester until the following September we could return.  But a lot of the students just refused to go back so.  I was a junior at this time so if I had to transfer it would have meant losing a lot of credits so I just decided just to go back and finish so that's what I did.  'Cause I had some very good teachers, now, I must give them credit for that because a lot of my teachers, this was November, right before Thanksgiving break, so let's say November 20th, I don't remember the exact date, it may have been the 20th or the 21st of November and so we only had maybe three or four weeks left of school when we came back from Thanksgiving a couple of weeks before Christmas break and school would have been over so a lot of my teachers because of the grades they had for me already allowed me to complete the semester which I was grateful for so I didn't lose that semester I only lost the semester that I was out, January to June.  And I tried to enroll at UW-Milwaukee so that I wouldn't lose that and was called to the office one day over the loud speaker, "Is [HistoryMaker] Irma Daniels in your class?  Have her report to the office."  And they said that my suspension was for all UW [University of Wisconsin] schools so I couldn't go to any UW schools, after standing in line going through registration, buying books and all of that, being told that because of what happened at Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] that I was not even in the president's office, no one would listen to that though, that I was unable to continue there.  So then I had to go to work so I went to apply at my high school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for a position as a teacher's assistant and they gladly welcomed me back, so that was--
Speaker 2: So by this time you were in education?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, so I worked there for the semester and then went back to Oshkosh in September.  But went back a bitter student and just wanted to get finished and get out so I think that's how I felt about Oshkosh and to this day (laughter) I have bitter, bitter feelings about Oshkosh 'cause I don't think they treated us fairly at all.  I had been there and had even witnessed panty raids where students were coming up in the dorms breaking through windows asking girls to throw out panties and they were not suspended from school.  So to suspend all of us for just being in the president's office or for me just being outside the president's office I just thought was grossly unfair so.  But I think it was the sign of the times, they wanted to make sure that they dealt with us so that they wouldn't have any other uprisings, I guess so--
Speaker 2: Now who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) we would know to stay in our place.
Story_ID: 517688
Speaker 1: Who were the student leaders?  What, what were their, do you, do, do you remember the names of the leadership?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had several student leaders.  One was Glen Ross [ph.], I think he might have been the president of the Black Student Union at the time.  And there were some students from Racine [Wisconsin], I'm trying to think of Bootsy's [ph.] real name.
Speaker 1: Somebody named Bootsy?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think that taught us a lesson though about the justice system and how unfair it could be.  And I think a lot of the students who refused to go back to Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] realized that although they had talked about wanting to make us feel welcomed that that was not really their intentions so after that I think a lot of the students just, some did go to school, I know I had classmates who went south to school to finish up.  And others unfortunately didn't go back at all so that was unfortunate too.
Speaker 1: Did the university change any of the policies to match the demands of the Black Student Union?  I mean, after the crisis was over did they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --did they hire more black professors or did they--
Speaker 2: --I have talked to young people who have gone to Oshkosh since I was away and so I think there have been some efforts made to bring in black professors to include courses that are more diverse so, so I guess it wasn't all in vain in that sense because I think the university did take a look at itself and they did try to make some changes.  And in that sense I guess maybe it wasn't all in vain but, but that's something that I will never forget just going through that whole experience, the court--
Speaker 1: Did, did you go to court for this?
Speaker 2: Yes, going to the court.  And, and a lot of the students even on campus were divided, some who felt we should be suspended and not let back in or glad to see us go (laughter).  And others who came to our rally and said, you know, "This is not fair, they should not, you know, be put out like that."  And even some of the teachers, like I said, I was very grateful for some of my teachers who contacted me and just said, "I know they said you're suspended but if you do this I will make sure your grade, you know, gets recorded so."  And for some of them they had to wait until I came back to actually do it but they made that effort so I really did appreciate them going that extra way to do that so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Lloyd Barbee [Lloyd A. Barbee] took the case.  Did he, did he do it as a pro bono thing for you all (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, we couldn't pay him much so I remember like having to take twenty-five dollars for a retaining fee (laughter) and so I'm sure he had a lot more, a higher retainer fee than that but so it was probably mostly pro bono because a lot of our families were struggling and, and it took a lot of work to take all those depositions and to go up to Oshkosh [Wisconsin], record the hearings, and but he was a very dedicated lawyer who was willing to do that for this group of students.
Story_ID: 517689
Speaker 1: --You know, with all that being said, you said there were, there were some teachers that helped.  Who were some of the, the teachers that you remember that that that were helpful to you, you know, just in general and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --maybe in that situation too?
Speaker 2: Well, the teachers in the physical education, physical education department and health education were very helpful and to call their names right now--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm drawing a blank but I must say that for Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] I really kind of have put that out of my mind. A lot of times they will call me and once or maybe twice I've been up to the campus 'cause they even celebrated Black Thursday where the black students on campus would have speakers to come back and talk about how life was on the Oshkosh campus.  And so I was invited back (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so they call it Black Thursday--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the day that, okay.
Speaker 2: So I would go back and, twice I did that but then I just said no more.  As a matter of fact, that's forty years ago, I didn't realize that until one of the professors and a student called me wanting to do a documentary about it for the fortieth anniversary.  And I just, that's coming up, you know, in 2008.  But I just, just didn't wanna talk to Oshkosh anymore but hopefully some of the other students took the time to be interviewed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said I have not good feelings for Oshkosh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after, well, was, was there anything special about graduation or you were just trying to get out and move on?
Speaker 2: Just tried to get out.  I graduated in January '71 [1971] and, of course, my family was just glad that I was graduating.  And at the time MPS [Milwaukee Public Schools, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was on a strike with their teachers so I couldn't get a teaching job here, they weren't hiring any new teachers because of the contract dispute so I got a job teaching in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, which is another all-white community.
Story_ID: 517690
Speaker 1: Just before we leave the whole Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin] thing--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did your parents [Daisy Hortman Hall and Levester Hall] have any wisdom about that did they share with you or, or feelings?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I can imag-, I just wonder.
Speaker 2: Well, I must say I was scared to death because we had a bail set, I'm not sure what the bail was maybe two hundred dollars, and all while I was sitting there the jail at Oshkosh [Wisconsin] could not hold all of us, they took all the girls to a gym and had us there with women sheriffs guarding us in this big gym.  And all I kept thinking, that my dad is not going to be happy (laughter).  And my mother will be even more unhappy.  But I must say they were very supportive.  My dad wired the money for me to get out and a principal whose daughter was there he was coming to pick her up for Thanksgiving, he had told my dad he would bring me back, so they picked me up and brought me home and I was just waiting to hear this big, "What are you doing, this is not what we sent you to school for," lecture but they were very supportive so I was very, very surprised and very glad that I did not get the wrath I thought I was gonna get when I got home but they were very supportive.
Speaker 1: So, so I take it your family didn't talk about civil rights much as--
Speaker 2: They did not.  They did not talk about it as far as things that you couldn't do or shouldn't do, it was just always if you work hard you can achieve, that get your education that's something they can't take away from you but it was never people are not going to, well, I guess they did say things like, "You had to be twice as good," or, "If you want that job or people are gonna be watching you," they would say things like that but I don't think they talked a lot about, well, I can remember going south one summer and my aunt who lived there had a neighbor named Eva Dale [ph.], which I thought was a strange name.  And Eva Dale and I went into town to get some stamps so I could mail my postcards and we also stopped at, I think it was like a Montgomery Ward store, and I went to the bubbler to get a drink of water and I did see the sign white but my parents had never told me that white meant only whites could drink water out (laughter) of that bubbler, so I just went to the water to drink it and this man told me, "Gal, what are you doing drinking out that white bubbler?"  Or, "Can't you read, gal," I think he said, "that says white."  I said, "Yeah, that's the kind of water I want."  I had no idea that there was (laughter) a bubbler for white people and color.  I saw a sign colored and white but I just thought people had colored water down here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We have the pause here--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to change tape again.
Speaker 2: So Eva Dale thought I was gonna get us both killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She grabbed my arm and said, "Are you crazy (laughter)?"  I said, "What did I do?"  So when she got back and told my mother that then my mother pulled me to the side and said, "I guess I should have told you that down here they have bathrooms where it's white only, bubblers where it's white only, you know, things that only white people," and that was the first time I had ever heard that, so.
Story_ID: 517691
Speaker 1: So you went to, to work in Fond du Lac, Fond du Lac (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and that was also a different experience.  I would be walking down the street and people would roll down the window and say, "Where are you dancing tonight?"  I said, "Where am I dancing?" "Aren't you a go-go dancer?" Because that's the only time they said they saw blacks, either they were go-go dancers or on work release from Taycheedah [Wisconsin Home for Women; Taycheedah Correctional Institution, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin] the state prison for women (laughter).  I would say, "No, I teach here."  "You do what?"  "(Laughter) I teach, I'm not dancing." So, so that was a whole different experience also.  And again there were some people who were very friendly and welcoming.  And I taught at an elementary school so my, my students were wonderful for the most part.  They were just curious again to see somebody black up close and with my Afro, of course, they all had to pat it and I had to tell myself, "Okay, don't get upset they're just trying to see how your hair is so."  But it was a learning experience too just adjusting to people who again had not been around blacks at all and were very curious so.
Speaker 1: Was this an all-white setting?
Speaker 2: All-white setting, um-hm.  So--
Speaker 1: So did you live in Fond du Lac too?
Speaker 2: I lived in Fond du Lac, had a roommate who was also a teacher at the high school so we roomed together and, and I was glad to leave there also but--
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay?
Speaker 2: Just one year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just one year.
Story_ID: 517692
Speaker 1: Did you come back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] then?
Speaker 2: No, then I was married [to HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] in 1972 and went to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was the time that they were going through their, segregating their schools so.
Speaker 1: In South Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], yeah--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --crises.
Speaker 2: --yeah, so I was put in a school [Clarence R. Edwards Junior High School; Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, Boston, Massachusetts], Charlestown which is on the south side of Boston and it was in a basically Italian and--
Speaker 1: Irish?
Speaker 2: --Irish community, um-hm.  And they were not to glad to have blacks (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So is, is that in Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts]?  Is it (unclear)--
Speaker 2: This was Charlestown, Boston.
Speaker 1: Charlestown.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Charlestown.
Speaker 1: Charlestown, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So well, did you ever, you know, feel in physical jeopardy there in those, because those days were--
Speaker 2: They were rough and there were people who were even students who would write the N word on the blackboard when I wasn't looking, I'd (laughter) turn around in the back you could see where somebody has, "We don't want a nigger teacher."  And so again some very prejudiced, very prejudiced people.  And there were three blacks in the whole school who were teaching, so we at night time would make sure that we walked together to the cars and make sure that things were not always said but sometimes kids were bold enough to even say things to you as a teacher which I thought was really unfortunate they felt that free but some students were that way.
Story_ID: 517693
Speaker 1: Did you get involved, involved in any of the black community organizations at that time in Boston [Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really, I--
Speaker 1: 'Cause I know you had Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King] and look like [HistoryMaker] Sarah-Ann Shaw--
Speaker 2: Right, all of those--
Speaker 1: --a lot of people in Boston, yeah.
Speaker 2: --were doing, a lot of community meetings and things.  But I went to work and started coaching the girls' basketball team and I think that was my saving grace because once my team got behind me they did stop a lot of the negative behavior that some students wanted to display.  They would stand up and say, "You're not gonna talk that way to my coach so," so that was something that made it a little more bearable.
Speaker 1: So you were basically the phys ed [physical education] teacher?
Speaker 2: Yes, physical--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --education and health.  So and when our team won the championship that really made it even better.  So I was there for two years.  And first year--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Charlestown [Boston, Massachusetts], it was called--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Charles Edwards, the Eddies [ph.], Charles Edwards Junior High [sic. Clarence R. Edwards Junior High School; Clarence R. Edwards Middle School] was the name of the school, um-hm, in Charlestown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all won the championship that year?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So our girls, we had some very good athletes, they were girls who were used to playing street hockey (laughter) and, and basketball, those are their two sports so, and they played like they were the Bruins [Boston Bruins] and the Boston Celtics.  I mean, they were athletic girls so they were an easy team to coach because they had such good talent so.  And that was my first coaching experience so I can't really take a lot of the credit but they were, they came together as a team and really had a good year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, this is the time when, is that Title IX, is that it?
Speaker 2: With the girls--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --basket--
Speaker 1: That was starting to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, starting to--
Speaker 1: --I think that was just starting--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --then.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: Requiring educational institutions to provide for girls sports (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Girls sports also.
Speaker 1: --opportunities.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was a good thing, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, did you, were you, were you particularly aware of that legislation in those days?  Were you keeping up with that or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, a little bit, I was aware because a lot of the girls who were in sports wanting to apply for scholarships to schools and a lot of the colleges now were offering more teams and more opportunities for them to have scholarships.  So, you know, I was a little aware of the changes that were taking place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was encouraging some of my girls to just hang in there, you know, keep up your grades, you have some talent and this could be your door for a scholarship.  Because at that time although I went back to Charlestown maybe five years ago and again it's going through a big change 'cause when I was there a lot of the kids were very poor, from very poor families and now they're changing those homes into condos and the yuppies and buppies are, are moving in so it's a different environment.  But then it was a very poor population.  And so I was aware of that legislation changing and, and glad to see that happening.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause when you were in high school there were few opportunities--
Speaker 2: Very few (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) for girls in sports.
Speaker 2: Right.  And we had GAA [Girls Athletic Association] it was more like an afterschool activity rather than girls having teams and being able to compete like that.
Speaker 1: Right.  And they certainly wouldn't lead to any scholarships.
Speaker 2: Scholarships and things--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Let's make that point.  So, okay.  So you were there two years, right, you said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And then, then where did you go?
Speaker 2: Then I came back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Story_ID: 517694
Speaker 1: Before we leave there let's talk about you getting married.  Now, well, where did you meet your husband [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.] and what happened?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That goes back, actually we were both raised in the Church Of God In Christ so we've known each other since grade school.  And in junior high he was the representative for his junior high [Wells Junior High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for the inter-cities student council [Inter-City Student Council] and I was the representative for my junior high [Robert Fulton Junior High School; Robert Fulton Middle School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for the student council so we were both at this meeting.  He was running for president and he likes to tell people I was the only one who voted against him but he won with just one vote against him which was mine but (laughter) it was supposed to be a secret ballot but he knew that I was the one who voted against him.  But we were going to be playing each other in high school, his team [Custer High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was playing my high school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], my brother was the quarterback and he made a bet with me that, "If your team wins since you're so sure, then I'll go to your victory party and if my team wins, you go to mine."  And I said, "Sure, 'cause my brother is quarterbacking there is no way we're going to lose."  Well, unfortunately someone, my brother threw an interception at the last (laughter) play of the game that his team ran back and won the game by one point so that was the beginning of our, I was so upset though after that that I didn't even look for him to go to the victory party so he called me up to say, "I looked for you after the game and you still owe me a date," so we did go out and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna say it seemed like a win, win for him--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --what, whatever happened, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't look at it like that.  I should have not made that bet but in any case that was our beginning so although we had known each other that was, never thought I would go out with him because we were always opposites so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So we dated starting in '66 [1966] and by the time we were married in '72 [1972] people were saying, "It's about time," so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a, yeah, that's six years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, okay.  So now, now he went to Boston [Massachusetts] to go to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] right?
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was where we started our marriage in Boston.  And I would tell him if we didn't have to eat (laughter) I would not go back to that school [Clarence R. Edwards Junior High School; Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, Boston, Massachusetts] tomorrow because I can't stand it, but that was my incentive so I think that was another reason I did not get that involved in Boston.  It's the worst place to find your way around trying to get directions to go places was just awful, so I soon gave up learning to do things too much in Boston unless I was going with a group because the traffic was awful, just driving there many a days I wanted to pull over and just cry.  I was parked at the gate for the railroad track, the train was coming and this man behind me is just blowing his horn and cursing up a storm and I'm saying the train is coming what am I supposed to do?  Well, he wanted to go around me because I had pulled to close, he wanted me to back up so he could around and go the other direction.  I had never heard of someone doing that so he kept telling me to move back, I thought he was saying go, but he was saying go back so I finally figured it out, so because he was coming around me anyway so I (laughter) backed up to let him go through but there are crazy drivers in Boston and that's a nice place to visit, I would never ever wanna go back and live there.  So I did not venture out to much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you were there through his graduation from law school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then, then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then we came back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 517695
Speaker 1: So did you immediately start working for the public schools [Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS), Milwaukee, Wisconsin] here?
Speaker 2: First, I worked for City Hall [Milwaukee City Hall, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for a year and then I went to teaching.
Speaker 1: This is about 1974 or '5 [1975], (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It would have been '74 [1974] that I worked for City Hall, it was '74 [1974] to '75 [1975].  And then--
Speaker 1: Okay.  So 1975 then in the public schools?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did, did you stay at the same school the whole time that you taught (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, first three years I moved around, '76 [1976] and '77 [1977] I taught first at elementary and then middle school.  And then '78 [1978] is when I started at Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: And in 1970, now, this is the school you were at for twenty-five years, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's called Lady Pitts?
Speaker 2: Lady Pitts.  And--
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: --it was named after--
Speaker 1: --P-I-T-T-S?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is a real person whose sister was a minister and she started, first of all a home for pregnant girls to go to when they were put out of their homes, they would go and stay in this home that she had.  And then because they couldn't, at that time they would put you out of school if you were pregnant, you had to leave.  And so she started a school for the girls with the help of a social worker, Lucinda Gordon, who was very instrumental in starting the school and was the first principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Lucinda is still very involved with the school.  For her eightieth birthday she had for her birthday party people to come and the money they paid went for scholarships for girls who are at Lady Pitts.  And so she started that scholarship.  And then for her ninetieth birthday they did the same, so it was--
Speaker 1: Now, are these African American women?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, and because they saw so many African American girls missing out on education they had the vision to do something about it and got MPS to take it on as part of, first it was an independent school and then they got MPS to make it part of the Milwaukee Public School system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's interesting, that's, that that hardly ever happens where--
Speaker 2: No, (unclear).
Speaker 1: --a school starts independent and becomes--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --part of the public school system.
Speaker 2: Right.  The Milwaukee Urban League is where Mrs. Gordon was a social worker so they were also very instrumental in helping to, to get it started.
Speaker 1: Now, that that seems to go against the grain in Wisconsin.  From what I understand this is the charter school heaven here--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --but so is it, yeah, a lot of public schools, well, a lot of schools are becoming, well, a lot, lot of charter schools are being formed with--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the philosophy, this charter school philosophy.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: With money, some critics say it's leeching away money from the public schools (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From the public schools and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and unfortunately that is a constant battle because some people feel that our schools are worse, the public schools because of the charter schools.  And it's, I have mixed feelings about it.  I think MPS was already doing such a terrible job with some students and something had to be done so the charter schools gave parents options and parents who had tried to get changes and the union fought it so I guess that's where I kind of have a, a problem with them now crying that all the money is being taken away because they had a chance to make some changes and they wouldn't so I just think we have to do something that will make sure our kids are getting good education and some of the schools just don't seem to be about that unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So Lady Pitts is an all, all-girl school?
Speaker 2: All-girl school.  And--
Speaker 1: Are there any all-male schools in, in MPS?
Speaker 2: They used to have Boys Tech and so it was a tradition, Boys Technical School [sic. Boys Technology and Trade School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And then they changed it to just Milwaukee Tech [Milwaukee Trade and Technical High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and now it's Bradley Tech [Lynde and Harry Bradley Technology and Trade School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] where they have boys and girls.  But they have just approved an all-boys school and also an all-girls school for the next school year because some parents have requested that they go back to that.
Story_ID: 517696
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a certain phi-, specific philosophy about this yourself or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, my son [John W. Daniels III] went to an all-boys high school, a Catholic school, and I have no problems with an all-boys school or an all-girls school I think as long as it's equal treatment where they don't get more money than the other schools but everyone's treated equal I think it's all right.  He had a very good experience at an all-boys school, he had plenty of girls at church who could call his number more than he needed them to call so I don't think he suffered that way from the interactions with the girls and he had been in mixed schools from kindergarten to eighth grade so to have an all-boy high school I thought was good.  And I think in some settings it would be great to have all-girls schools because even at Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] although our reason for separating them was because of the pregnancy and they did have boys who were parents who could come to some of the classes, they had a certain time that they could attend.  But I think it was good to have all girls there where they could address issues that were related just to the pregnancy and things that they were going through as mothers so.  So I don't have a problem with the different sexes or even if there's a school where students who all are interested in math I think would be great or science if that's their focus.  And well, like we have the High School of the Arts [Milwaukee High School of the Arts, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] for those who are interested in the arts so I, I don't have a problem with the different schools.
Speaker 1: So you think it, you, are, are you saying that you, you think it's good to have choices?
Speaker 2: Choices is what I'd like, the idea of choices and as long as they're giving everyone, 'cause some schools, like the High School of the Arts at one time they were saying they were getting a lot more money than other schools because again they had programs that they had to put on, instruments, things that they needed, but so certain people would complain about that but I just think maybe having a certain amount and then schools can do fundraisers to complement their budget if they need to.
Story_ID: 517697
Speaker 1: So you taught physical education at Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] too?
Speaker 2: Well, at Lady Pitts we had prenatal health classes so I taught the prenatal health class and it's a very small school.  At one time we may have had an enrollment up to 200 but I think, a 125 may have been the enrollment when I left.  So a very small school, very small staff.  We have a day care, we have a full-time nurse, full-time social workers, and teaching classes that they would have in a regular school along with parenting and prenatal health classes.  And so I enjoyed working with that population.  It was a group that you could see changes taking place.  Girls who had very poor attendance, girls who very low reading scores but to see them improve.  So I think that's one of my fondest teaching experiences would have been at Lady Pitts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have any stories from Lady Pitts you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Oh, lots of stories--but I think how girls were just so naive about things, my girls, because for some of them this was a pattern in their life, their mothers were teen mothers, their grandmothers were teen mothers, so to have that cycle broken was something that I really preached you might say (laughter) that you don't have to continue in this cycle.  And, and so having the opportunity to tell them that and to point things out to them.  One girl came in one day just upset because a lady on the bus stop was looking at her and asked why she was so young and pregnant and, "It's none of her business."  And I said well, you know, "She probably is concerned because it is a little bit of her business because the tax dollars have to pay for people who have babies without insurance and are you in that category?"  She said, "Yes.  But I don't see why people always throw it up at me because you get your money back anyway."  I said, "We do what?"  "You get your money back."  "What money?"  "Your tax money."  I said, "How can you say that?"  "Well, my sister she got all her money back."  I said, "Okay, where did your sister work 'cause I wanna go (laughter) and get all my money back."  Well, her sister had a, the first one to have a job in the family really at like a McDonald's so because she made so little--
Speaker 1: She got income tax returned?
Speaker 2: --she got all of her, all of her income tax money back so she thought all of us got all of our money back that she didn't see why we were complaining about our taxes.  So I had to give her a lesson that no, people, we don't all get our tax money back, that this is the case with her sister because of the low amount she made just working part time but for most people a lot of us pay more taxes at the end of the year and she just couldn't even believe that.  She just thought I was making this up, that it was not true but she had never had anyone in her family who worked and paid taxes, so she had no idea how that whole system worked so we had to actually show her a tax return that said you owe money because she wouldn't have believed me if I hadn't brought it in to say okay, people get tax bills sometimes thousands of dollars, so then she could understand why the lady going to work on the bus stop was upset looking at all of them standing there pregnant.  So, so we would talk about issues like that to get them to understand that it wasn't just being nosy or people not liking teenage pregnancy just because they thought it was wrong morally or something but it was also something that was tied to the tax dollar and people were concerned about that also.
Story_ID: 517698
Speaker 1: Do you think that they ever realized the link between teen pregnancy and, and just hard-core poverty?
Speaker 2: We talked about that also a lot in class [at Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], about how statistically girls who have babies at an early age without finishing school your options for job opportunities are a lot less and you're almost certain to be in that poverty range with what you're going to be making.  And so I think that was eye-opening for a lot of them.  They had been living there then when Governor Thompson [Tommy G. Thompson] then decided that you won't get more money just because you have another baby.  And again they thought that was so unfair and I said, "Well, people," I was pregnant, my kids are far apart, I have a thirty year old [Daniels' son, John W. Daniels III] and a seventeen year old [Daniels' daughter, Inez Daniels], so at one time I was pregnant there while I was teaching and I was saying to them, you know, "Just because I'm pregnant now I can't go to the principal and say, 'Okay, look I'm having a baby, I need more money, I have to buy more diapers, milk, I didn't have to buy this last year, give me a raise.'"  And I was like, "What do you think she will say?  (Laughter) She will not give me a raise just because I'm having another kid.  You have to adjust, I have to adjust my budget now to live within what I make."  No one just gives you more money because you're having a baby.  And so people have to make, you know, changes in their budget and so this is I think what Governor Thompson was trying to say that we just can't continue to just say because you have another child you automatically get more money but they just couldn't see that, they just thought it was so unfair.
Story_ID: 517699
Speaker 1: Can you generalize, I guess, what compels, and we, we know that teenagers are gonna have sex but what would compel a, a young girl to, to want to have a baby in high school?  I mean, I just, I've always, I just wondered what feedback you would get?  'Cause some people seem to, it seem like maybe that's what they want for some reason.
Speaker 2: It is.  And I think that unfortunately for some girls, not all girls, but for some girls in their families this is the one thing that you can be proud of that you have produced.  I think for some of them they had such low expectations of what they could accomplish in life that being a mother was one thing they knew they could accomplish and they could, no matter how poor they were they could still comb that hair and dress her up.  I mean, I would have girls bring the baby to school [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] with Jordan tennis shoes on and take the baby down to the day care and bring the shoes back with them.  And I'm like, "Why are you doing that?"  You know, why would you, so to them it was just this is something that I could provide for my child.  It didn't matter that I didn't have the job to do it, they didn't look at it that way unfortunately that it was somebody else's money you're doing this with.  And we would talk about things like that in class and it was hard to get them to see that this was not a good thing.  I mean, I guess, I was not a very popular teacher (laughter) but they couldn't say that they didn't know certain things because Mrs. Daniels [HistoryMaker Irma Daniels] just didn't come out and tell them, okay.  And a lot of my students would come back years later though and say to me and I think that's some of my proudest moments, if I'm at a banquet downtown and one of the waiters will come to me and say, "You're Mrs. Daniels, you were my teacher."  And then tell me, "My daughter did not have a baby.  She's in college and I preached those same things I got mad at you about (laughter) to her."  Because I think some girls in their families it was like this is what you're expected to do, I mean, that there were no other high expectations for them to go to college, to go to school, to even get a good job, it was just have a baby.  And I think that was something that was just acceptable.  Now, other girls, I think for some it was just not knowing how to protect themselves to not get pregnant and then once they had the baby it was, if you were woman enough to have the baby then you just have to keep it and raise it and that's what they were faced with in their family.  Because we talked about that too what it takes to make a baby and to raise it is two different things also and you need to be aware of that.
Story_ID: 517700
Speaker 1: I know [HistoryMaker] Reverend Eugene Rivers of Boston [Massachusetts] always says that we're our, we have a generation who's come, that's come along now that's more disadvantaged than, than people were when they came over here from Africa--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --during slavery.  'Cause those people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's sad, that's real sad.
Speaker 1: --those people knew how to raise children--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they had intergenerational transmission of knowledge.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now we don't seem to have as much of that do you, do you agree with that?
Speaker 2: I agree and that's what I would tell my students [at Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that that's one of the reasons why I cared so much I said, "Because it's your baby who may be the one when I'm an old lady grabbing my purse or knocking me down because you have not taught him the values of work."  And so, I mean, it was not to put anybody down but to say we have to turn this cycle around, we can't just be people who are just out there looking for a handout or to get it the best way I can without doing it honestly and with a job so that was one of the things I wanted my girls to understand, because for some of them they had come from homes where like I said people had not worked.  And that was such a strong, I mean, my mother [Daisy Hortman Hall] always said, "If you don't work you will steal," so that was her thing that she taught us, you have to get a job, we're not going to let you just sit up because you have to know how to care for yourself because if you don't care for yourself, I mean, with seven kids my dad [Levester Hall] did what he had to do, if he had to work long hours he did that, he was willing to do whatever he had to do to take care of his family.  So we learned that you're supposed to be responsible for yourself and I don't think every child grows up in our community with that kind of teaching.
Story_ID: 517701
Speaker 1: Is there a particular story of a student [at the Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that stands out that you can tell us about?  You know, you don't necessarily have to mention the name but is there any particular story that that that you're proud of?
Speaker 2: Well, I have several students like this who came in with very poor grades, very poor attendance.  I would give out attendance awards by the week, if you made it the whole week I had something special for you on Friday, we would have a little, little things, it could be something for you or something for the baby but it was something just to say okay, I appreciate the effort you put in, you were here every day doing what you're supposed to do.  And several students would tell me, you know, "When I went to school two or three days, you know, it was a big deal and now you want me to come for a whole week?" But once they got into that practice of doing that and even though they were only getting something out of my class since they were there they would stay the whole day and they would see their grades going up in every class.  And I think that's the thing that turned them around.  A lot of girls there said, you know, "If I had just done this before I got pregnant I wouldn't be here, if somebody had said to me, you know, be in school every day, I care that you're here.  And I may not have, you know, made this mistake," but I think that's how they get caught up 'cause I don't think they go out a lot of them with the plan of getting pregnant like the girl who told me she did plan it, but a lot of them I think just got caught up in the moment and did not have the knowledge to or the will power to say, "Okay, I can't go all the way now because I'm not prepared," and so once they were pregnant it was something that they decided to live with.  But to see them change that whole lifestyle where they wanted to come to school and they wanted to do better and started to make plans, we would start out with short term goals and long term goals and then to see them actually, you know, strive to achieve them.  And I think that's what we have missing a lot in our community where girls have not had anyone in the household say, "Okay because if my daughter is not in school," I mean, I would have a fit but there would be days I would call a home and say, "Your daughter is not in school," "Oh, yeah she's back there in the bed she didn't feel like getting up." "Is she sick?"  "I don't think she's sick, she just didn't feel like getting up."  So to me a parent who would allow that and if she allowed it before she was pregnant, I mean, then you could see why some of our girls end up in this situation so it's, I think it's a sad thing that we've let, and I guess parenting skills are something that really needs to be taught.  We have so many parents, we get licensed for everything else but not to be a parent and I think that would make things a lot better if you had to go through some type of training because I think a lot of parents just kind of let the kids do what they wanna do.
Story_ID: 517702
Speaker 1: Is there a, a big gap in knowledge in terms of a girl that go, would go to Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and learn prenatal care between someone who did not, you know, who does not go, I mean, do you--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I've even had the hospitals, we would take a hospital tour and I would have nurses tell me that they have had girls who had stayed in the high schools who were pregnant come in and they could tell the difference because the girls from Lady Pitts were prepared.  We would go through all the terminology for labor and delivery and show the movies, visit the hospital, so they would be aware of what was going to happen.  And a lot of the girls even in the high school if they had insurance they wouldn't go to their prenatal visits, so unfortunately they would have babies born premature or sickly and, and they would have complications so on several occasions I've had talks with different hospitals to say that what the girls receive from Lady Pitts they could tell how much more prepared they were.  We would go through the breathing and the whole bit, so they were prepared, they knew what was going to happen when they got there so it wasn't as much hollering and screaming and being upset about the whole situation because they knew why the nurses were doing things and so they were a lot more prepared.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you, you taught there for twenty-five years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Which--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --made me really feel old like I said when people were telling me, "My baby is in high school or college," and I thought, "Okay, it's time for me to leave (laughter)," so.  And then a few instances where I would have girls coming back saying, "You had my mother here," so then that's when I knew it was time for me to leave too because that's just a heartbreaker when you're, see that cycle continue, you know.
Speaker 1: So, so did you, were you, was there, there any professional associations for the people teaching prenatal care and that sort of thing and were you part of any black teachers or organizations or any--
Speaker 2: Hm.
Speaker 1: --teachers' organizations for that matter?
Speaker 2: Well, not for just prenatal care.  We had a organization that dealt with teen pregnancy and so we would go to conventions and take the girls to the conventions 'cause they would have classes for the girls and for teachers who were teaching girls like in some of the bigger cities, Green Bay [Wisconsin], Madison [Wisconsin], Racine [Wisconsin] they have schools or places for girls to go who are teen moms.  And so we would all come together and meet once a year.  But I think now a lot of the girls because it's not a big deal anymore are just choosing to stay in their high school unfortunately and so you're having the enrollment drop at Lady Pitts.  And I would be happy if it was dropping because they were no longer a need because girls weren't getting pregnant but I do feel it's sad when they do need the school and just choose to just stay with their friends at the high school.
Story_ID: 517703
Speaker 1: Is your assessment that, or would you say that it's so commonplace now that, I mean, Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was created at a time when if you got pregnant in high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you got pregnant you were put out of high school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, or it was a shame.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And you were--
Speaker 1: Considered a shame.
Speaker 2: --talked about or made to feel that, you know, you had been a bad girl or, yeah, so that was the way it started out but now I don't think girls feel ashamed or out of place, I mean, I think it's almost like a badge of honor unfortunately that I have a baby and, and that, that saddens me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: But I think when you have the change in society where even adults choose to have babies out of wedlock so again it's not a stigma anymore.  You know, you have the movie stars and so I don't think girls look on it as something, you know, J.Lo [Jennifer Lopez] is pregnant and although she is older but I don't think they see themselves any differently, so it's not a bad thing.
Story_ID: 517704
Speaker 1: Do you have any particular causes that you volunteer for or things that you do other, otherwise that, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --outside of your professional (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I work with the youth at my church so that's a big part of my volunteer time, I'm the youth leader there.  And we try to do youth bible studies, we have the youth choir and other ministries.  But then also take the kids on outings and things and try to talk about issues that they're dealing with so, Holy Redeemer [Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] has a school [Holy Redeemer Christian Academy, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and so I will go and volunteer there also sometimes.  And then I'm a member of the Milwaukee [Wisconsin] chapter of the Links [The Links, Incorporated] and do volunteer work there, work on raising money for scholarships for youth.  And a member of Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated].  And--
Speaker 1: Did you join at Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin]]?
Speaker 2: No, I joined the Milwaukee chapter up at, the year that I graduated is when they started the chapter at Oshkosh of Delta Sigma Theta, so they do have a chapter now.  And I'm on the Bethesda senior citizen board [Bethesda Community Senior Citizens Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and that deals with the elderly which is another thing that's close to my heart because I think a lot of our black elderly have had to work so hard that they don't even know how to enjoy their senior years, they just are so accustomed to working that that's all they want to do or keep babies (laughter) after they, you know, they're babysitting for grands and great-grands.  And so trying to get them to come and do something fun or go on outings at the senior citizen center, I'm just trying to encourage them, even if you can't come every day, you know, to even have a day where you bring the grandbaby with you if you have to and let them play with the other kids and you do something for yourself because you've lived your life helping others for so long that you need to at least enjoy these last golden years once in a while so.  And just to come and sit with other seniors and have a meal, have someone else serve you for a change is I think just so important.  So that's something that close to my heart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now anything else?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm surprised we've talked this long (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, we're not done, I've got a couple more questions.
Story_ID: 517705
Speaker 1: What are so-, some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: One of my hopes is that young people will stop the violence.  I think that is the thing that I am so disgusted with, how we have no regard for life, how we are willing to take a life over the least little thing.  And that, I mean, even in sports the, the fighting, the street fighting, I mean, we just have so many young people who are so angry and so violent, so if we could get them to, and I think it starts in the home again where we have to teach our young people.  I mean, I had brothers [Samuel Hall, James Hall and Ricky Hall] and sisters [Dolores Hall Lenora, Debra Hall Martin, and Andra Hall Brown] and we fought but there was always love there, I mean, you fought with love, you didn't wanna hurt someone or take someone's life and so the violence is one thing that I'm hoping we can get a handle on in our communities.
Story_ID: 517706
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Yes, I probably would not go to Oshkosh [Wisconsin State University-Oshkosh; University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin].  I would probably try and go to a historical black college [HBCU] if I had to do it all over again.  And then, I don't know where that would have taken me but maybe in a different road all together also but I think basically though most of my decisions I probably would have kept them other than my college choice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think education in the end really was the right profession for me although maybe accounting would have been a good thing after all though but I think that would be my major change though, I would not have gone to Oshkosh.  When I see students who have gone to historically black colleges and the pride they have in their schools and the relationships they've kept with kids who they went to school with, see I don't have any of that, if you would say, who are you, even with the black students we get together now and again but we still don't have that closeness that I see the other students who have gone to historically black colleges, so I think I would have loved to have had that relationship.
Story_ID: 517707
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you say or, or would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Helping youth, I think either at Lady Pitts [Lady Pitts School; Lady Pitts School Age Parent Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] or with my young people at church [Holy Redeemer Institutional Church of God in Christ, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and trying to get them to make good choices and to think about setting goals and reaching them, so I think that would be the thing that I am most proud of.  Had some awesome young people at church and at Lady Pitts that I can say have done some great things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And just having a small part just that I encouraged one person I would say that's great.
Story_ID: 517708
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family.  Now, you have some children and you have two children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I do.  Proud mother of a son [John W. Daniels III] who is thirty and is married to a lovely young lady [Erickajoy Daniels] who's from Baltimore [Maryland], they've been married for two years.  He works at the church school [Holy Redeemer Christian Academy, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], although his love is music.  He would love to write and conduct choirs, gospel choirs so that's his love.  And he graduated from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And his wife works at the Brady Corporation here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And then my daughter [Inez Daniels] is seventeen, she's a senior in high school and she is planning on going to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], although I'm still stressing Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I would love for her to go there but she's looking at other schools also but she was crowned Miss Debutante 2007 at the Christian Business and Professional Alliance [Christian Business and Professional Alliance, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] on Friday so I'm very proud of her.  And I guess that's my proudest accomplishment being a mother.  And I think I've done a pretty good job.  So I am proud of the two of them.
Story_ID: 517709
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I have not asked you that you think that we ought to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Hm, no, I think you've covered everything, I'm just waiting for this last question (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I hope I will be remembered as someone who cared about people, young people, old people, just cared about people and wanted to help others, so if they can say I tried to help somebody, I think that's good.  That would be a wonderful legacy.  Helped people and loved my family, so I think those two things would be a wonderful legacy for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 517710

My baby brother, Ricky [Ricky Hall], on the bottom, and my baby sister, Andra [Andra Hall Brown], and then Mary Ann [Mary Ann Caesar (ph.)] and Brenda Kaye [Brenda Kaye Caesar (ph.)] they lived across the street.  My mother used to say we could throw out dish water for each other because they were over so many, so much and we were over at their house so, Mrs. Caesar [ph.] couldn't throw out dish water, and we couldn't throw out dish water without our families not being together.
