 Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library, and I   m here in Oklahoma City today, May 24, 2011. I   m on the  campus of Oklahoma City University speaking with President Robert  Henry, a good friend of Henry Bellmon, the subject of our talk today.  This is part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Project focusing on Henry  Bellmon. So thank you for having me today. Let   s start by having you tell  a little bit about yourself. Where you were born, your childhood, and  then we   ll work our way forward.  Well, my name is Robert Harlan Henry. I was born in 1953 in Shawnee,  Oklahoma, which is a good place to be from. It   s the center of my  childhood universe, and Shawnee was an interesting place. The two  primary motivators, I think, in my life, other than family and teachers,  were the First Baptist Church of Shawnee, which I didn   t realize it at the  time but it was a liberal Baptist church and a high music church. We had  a wonderful pipe organ and a lot of faculty from Oklahoma Baptist  University there. So the church and the university community,  Oklahoma Baptist University and St. Gregory   s College, were big  influences in my life.  I went to the University of Oklahoma as a university scholar, graduated  from there in three years, and then went to law school at the University  of Oklahoma, College of Law. In my last semester of law school, at age  twenty-three, I was elected to the state legislature. I served there for ten  years and then was attorney general of Oklahoma. I was reelected  attorney general, and then became dean of the Oklahoma City University  Law School. President Clinton later nominated me to the United States  Court of Appeals, where I eventually became chief justice of that court,  and I left that position after sixteen years to become president and CEO  of Oklahoma City University.  I grew up in a political family, and so, consequently, even though I was  5  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  Henry  only nine years old in 1962, I knew about Henry Bellmon   s remarkable  campaign to become the first Republican governor not only in  Oklahoma, but in the Reconstruction South, in the United States. I still  can remember   and you   ll pardon my cold   I still remember women  walking the streets, strumming ukuleles, singing, I believe,    Yes, sir,  we   re for Bellmon. No, sir, Henry Bellmon. Yes, sir, Bellmon all the  time.    I remember that, over and over and over again. Those were the  famous Bellmon Belles. So as a nine year old I had my first connection  with Henry Bellmon. Little did I know that I would later become his  lawyer and one of the five people that he considered his best friends.  Let   s back up a little bit and learn more about your childhood. Did you  have brothers and sisters?  I did. I had a brother who was three years older and a sister who was  three years younger. My father was a decorated veteran and then the  assistant county attorney, and then was elected county attorney. Later, he  went into the private practice of law and became a state district judge.  He was chief judge of his judicial district. My mother was from Spiro,  Oklahoma, and she and my father met at Oklahoma Baptist University.  My father passed away in 1985. My mother remarried and still lives in  Shawnee. My brother is a retired judge himself and is now practicing  law again in Tulsa. My sister is a school teacher who is, as best as I can  tell, dedicating her life to her daughter   s bakery at this point.  Okay. (Laughs) Thank you for sharing that. Do you recall when you first  met Henry Bellmon face-to-face?  Absolutely. The first time I actually met him face-to-face was in 1971. I  was one of two people selected by the William Randolph Hearst  Foundation to be a delegate to the United States Senate Youth Program.  That was the greatest honor I   d received in my life. It required surviving  a regional test and then writing an essay. Once I won the region, then the  six of us who won the regions had to go have personal interviews and  write an essay. I was one of two selected. Each state had two. I got to  spend a week in Washington meeting with everyone. President Nixon  had to cancel his meeting with us, and so we met with Melvin Laird, the  secretary of defense at that time. I actually met J. Edgar Hoover, the  legendary and scary director of the FBI and a number of interesting  people including Justice Harry Blackmun of the Supreme Court.  But on the Wednesday of this full week in Washington, where we were  put up at the fabulous Mayflower Hotel, which was certainly the nicest  place a little eighteen year old kid from   actually, I was seventeen     from Shawnee, Oklahoma, had been, I spent some time in Henry  Bellmon   s office. Fred Harris was our other senator, and I spent some  6  Finchum  Henry  time with Fred Harris   s office. I never got to meet Fred Harris, who was  really a hot property in Washington then, and then I got to spend the  other half of the day in Senator Bellmon   s office, and he did have lunch  with me and the other delegates. At the time, Harris was kind of this  idealistic, very gregarious orator who was really exciting, and I was not  so excited with Senator Bellmon, who was older and was not known for  rhetorical flourish. I was a Democrat, he was a Republican, but in  retrospect, a couple of things come to my mind. First, how incredibly  kind it was of him to give time out of his day to somebody who couldn   t  give him any money, couldn   t help him in his campaign. Not every  senator did. Indeed, today, I   m still active in the United States Senate  Youth Program. It   s very difficult to get senators. Senators don   t have  lunch scheduled with delegates, so it   s intriguing and, perhaps, presaged  the relationship that we would have in the future.  He was a good and kind person. We talked about the Vietnam War. He  asked me what young people thought. I was trying to be diplomatic,  because I didn   t know what his position was, and I said,    Well, Senator,  a lot of young people want peace.    And he said,    Well, young man, a lot  of old people want peace, too.    So I think I learned a little bit about him  then. And then the other thing is neither one of us knew the adventures  we were going to have together when I got to be, essentially, his attorney  when I was Attorney General of Oklahoma. I was an independent  elected official, but I was also his lawyer on many, many occasions, and  we went a lot of places and did a lot of things.  From the time you met him in    71 until you were campaigning for  attorney general, did you cross tracks?  I didn   t really cross tracks with him much. We may have written a letter  or two, but when he came back after his service in the Senate   now, of  course, like so many people, I became a fan of his through, perhaps, his  most controversial vote in the United States Senate, and that was his  vote for the Panama Canal Treaty. The reason that I initially became  attracted to him because of that is because I grew up in a political  family. We were very active in politics. My father was an elected judge.  My uncle was an elected state representative and judge. My cousin,  Brad, has just been governor of Oklahoma. I was elected attorney  general of Oklahoma later, but my family was just political, and  regardless of the merits of that issue, Panama Canal Treaty, the courage  that someone would take to cast that vote   and so many people were  unencumbered with history or thought or realization of the character and  background of Henry Bellmon, and they just viscerally fired all sorts of  bile and nastiness.  They didn   t realize that this guy was on Iwo Jima, that he essentially had  7  two tanks blown out from under him. The heroism and difficulty of what  he endured   how anyone could question his patriotism and not be struck  by lightning astounded me. But I just was attracted to the courage, and I  just intuited,    This guy is smart enough to have made the right  decision.    I later found out that he had, in fact, consulted the generals in  charge. He had carefully thought through this position and determined  that if the United States didn   t take some action that a possible war or  conflict was in the offing and that it would come at a tremendous cost of  human, of American life, and prestige in disabling the area. He said all  of these terrible things that are going to happen will not happen if we do  this, and, of course, he   s been absolutely correct.  So, initially, I was just attracted by his courage and by the intellectual  and thoughtful way he explained his vote. And later, I learned about  Edmund Burke   s great speech to the electors that selected him. I actually  think he had already won one election when he said this to the House of  Commons, but he said something along the line of,    A representative  owes his constituency not only his industry    (that is his work and effort)     but his judgment. And he betrays his constituency rather than serving  them if he sacrifices his judgment to their opinion.    Now, that   s  absolutely right if the representative is the right kind of representative. If  you have selected an intelligent, thoughtful, capable person, our framers,  I think particularly Madison, had in mind that this representative is a  filter. Yes, his constituency is able to talk to him, and he or she should  review and think about what they have to say, but you betray them  instead of serving them if you sacrifice your judgment as to what is right  merely to the popular opinion of the day.  Henry Bellmon  epitomized this  more than any other political figure I  have known with the possible exception of maybe Barry Goldwater (and  I didn   t really know him, we had some tangential relationships). But he  had a sincerity, a homespun, humble intellect that allowed him to just  develop a big bank account of credibility. And he had to use that up a lot  because he was quite capable of casting controversial votes, of taking  difficult positions in every aspect in his life and managed to have  remarkable political success. So I think it   s interesting, when he ran for  governor, I remember someone flew an airplane over the political  stadiums and it had a little trailer,    Bus Bellmon to Panama.    That   s the  kind of crap that comes out in political campaigns.    There   s always an  aroma in Oklahoma,    people say, around political time. That   s the kind  of stuff that a decorated veteran who had two tanks shot out from under  him at Iwo Jima had to put up with, and it never phased him.  Many times, he would tell me later as we got to become close friends  and colleagues, he   d just say,    Well, let   s just let them stew in their own  juices.    He would not respond to critics. He   d just say,    They   ll take  8  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  Henry  care of themselves.    I wish I could talk to him about this now, because I  think he would agree with me. I think his vote on the Panama Canal  Treaty, his research about it and his vote on it, probably played a key  role in his later success as governor. I think he picked up enough  Democratic votes and independent votes and thoughtful and progressive  Republican votes for having the courage to do what he thought, with  considerable experience and judgment, was the right thing to do.  Interesting. When you were campaigning back in the    80s and he was  campaigning at the same time, do you recall election night for either one  of you?  Well, I do. Can I just go a little bit before then?  Sure.  I was completing my ninth year in the legislature in 1985, and I decided  that I might run for a higher office, attorney general, lieutenant  governor, maybe governor. I had become friends with Governor  Bellmon, then   well, Senator Bellmon. He had come back from  Washington, and Governor Nigh had drafted him to direct the  Department of Human Services. That was a clever and creative move by  Governor Nigh, and Bellmon did not disappoint. He put together a good  staff. He, again, I talked about that bank account of credibility, he called  on that credibility, because this is the welfare department in conservative  Oklahoma. I mean, a lot of people think welfare should be abolished and  all of its ramifications. But that   s aid to families with dependent  children. That   s hospital authorities. That   s children and youth services,  adoption services, all those sorts of things.  There are many, many, many things that the Department of Human  Services does that are absolutely vital, and Senator Bellmon lent his  credibility and his skill and got that troubled organization on steady  footing again. There   s a fabulous photograph around, I think, Henry  Bellmon had a touch of narcolepsy. He was an activist and a person who  really liked to work hard and did not twiddle his thumbs well. I don   t  think Governor Bellmon could ever have taken up cross-stitching.  There   s this wonderful scene of him hearing Governor Nigh   s State  of  the State  address just absolutely conked out asleep on the front row of  the House gallery.  Then he decided   well, people came to him. The GOP, the Oklahoma  Republican Party, was kind of in shambles. It was defined, at that time,  by just being an again-er, by being against stuff. It wasn   t for anything.  It was just against stuff. And, unfortunately, there   s a bit of a time-honored  tradition of just being again-ers in Oklahoma, but rarely can  9  you define a successful agenda by what you   re against. So some of the  party stalwarts sought to get Senator Bellmon to leave the farm and put  the plow down and come back and pilot the ship of state.  About this time, I was on the board of St. Gregory   s College in  Shawnee, a Benedictine college there. And I decided that in order to  raise money for mentally handicapped children that the college should  reactivate this Benedictine medallion that they gave to actor/entertainer  Danny Thomas many years ago. At a board meeting I said,    I think we  need to bring this back, give this Benedictine medal for service to  mankind. I have the perfect person to receive it, and that would be  Senator Henry Bellmon.    People were kind of surprised. Here I   m a  lifelong Democrat. I   m thinking about running for political office, so is  he, and I   m suggesting that we have this guy and give him this medal,  and it   s probably going to be filmed and    Well, we did it.  We decided to do it, and Oklahoma Education Television Authority   OETA  decided to tape it, and you should get a copy of that. I imagine  you do have it, for the archives. I was the master of ceremonies. It was a  black tie event in the Skirvin Hotel. We were oversold. Then, the Skirvin  had a huge ballroom. I think we had 1500 people. I mean, we were  absolutely jammed, and we had State Senator Denzel Garrison and the  Republican stalwart from Bartlesville and Edward L. Gaylord, the  publisher of The Daily Oklahoman, Cleta Deatherage, who was a state  legislator then. She was a progressive Democrat, then. She   s changed a  bit now. Let   s see, and George Nigh, the Governor of the State of  Oklahoma. Well, at that time Governor Nigh and Mr. Gaylord were kind  of at odds with each other, and so to see them both, with their well  announced public rivalry, meet at a black tie event to honor the same  person was just really something. It was a funny, wonderful evening  that, I think, played a good part in launching the Bellmon campaign.  So he decided to run, and I decided to run, and we both liked each other.  And I have to say, I am convinced he put in a good word for me with a  few folks. I got some support from some people, and I remember two of  the big political giants in terms of the business community at that time  were Kerr McGee and Conoco Phillips. Both of those entities supported  both Henry Bellmon and me, so they sort of split the ticket, then. We  went to a few events together, and I think people knew we were friendly  and cordial. I actually had a little pencil that I put out for a meeting with  Oklahoma teachers, and it said,    Robert Henry for Attorney General, the  other name in Henrys,    or something like that. I was linking my name up  that way.  Later, in the legislature, after we were both elected and we worked so  well together, people that were mad at us sometimes referred to us as  10  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  Henry     Henry one and Henry two.    I don   t remember his watch party, but I  remember, particularly, my watch party in the Democratic primary  where I tried to be in both Tulsa and Oklahoma City, and so I started in  Tulsa and then had a plane to fly me to Oklahoma City. Right after I got  in the plane, the mother of all storms broke out. We were in a cabin that  we couldn   t communicate with the pilot, who was an old friend of mine,  and I could sense   I   ve flown enough to sense that he was veering out  of the storm. Then, Glenn Johnson, who is currently our chancellor of  higher education in Oklahoma, he was a state legislator and friend of  mine. He was on the plane with me, and after a very long and distended  flight, we landed, and I said,    Well, we   re either in Oklahoma City or  Wichita. I can   t tell.     By the time we got there, the election was over, and I had won the  primary, and all the people from Tulsa who had driven were already  there. In the general election, I led the Democratic ticket in the major  categories in attorney general, lieutenant governor, and state treasurer.  Auditor and inspector actually got more votes than I did, but Governor  Bellmon and I communicated right after the election and, indeed, began  working on some things together.  And that bring us up to swearing-in day.  Well, let   s see, swearing-in day we had worked on a couple of things  together. We agreed that he   d have a hotline to my office. They had  always sworn the governor and lieutenant governor in separately, and  then they put all the other state officials together. But someone who was  in charge of the ceremony   I can   t remember who it was   but they  lectured us, pointedly, and they said,    You do not move until your name  is called. Whatever you do, you just don   t do that. You   re not running  this. We   re running this.    So when it came time for the secondary  elected officials, they named everybody but me. So I knew I was  supposed to be up there, but they pointedly told me to follow the  directions, and so I did. So I just sat there, and they swear everybody  else in, and they realized,    We forgot to call him.    So I got my own  private swearing-in, and I have a photograph of me with more and  darker hair, larger glasses, and less girth beginning to be the top cop or  the chief legal officer of the State of Oklahoma.  Well, when you first started out, did you ever disagree on things that  Bellmon wanted to do?  We had a remarkable confluence of thought. There were a couple of  minor things, but we had the relationship   I remember it started early  when I was very concerned about the pollution of the Illinois River, and  I had talked about it in the campaign. I had even used a word to describe  11  Finchum  Henry  it then that you cannot use now. I had referred to it   this was a long  time ago, this was in 1986   I had referred to it as a jihad, as a holy war.  It was a holy war to me to keep this pollution from the city of  Fayetteville, that they dug a ten-mile canal to direct into our most  beautiful wild and scenic river. I thought it was a holy war. I was just  prepared to do everything I could to battle it.  Well, the EPA was somewhat complacent in this. They weren   t much of  an organization, then. They have become better since, I think, although  there is some dispute about that. They tried to arrange a private meeting  with Governor Bellmon so that I wouldn   t be there to talk about the  Illinois River. I called him and came to see him, and I said,    Governor,  you   re the governor, and you don   t have to involve me in this from your  perspective. I am the attorney general of Oklahoma, and I do have my  own powers, and I do plan to contest this under my powers, my common  law powers as attorney general. I do plan to file some lawsuits. I do plan  to make the EPA follow its own rules, and I do plan to try to protect our  wild and scenic rivers, especially the Illinois, which is historically and  traditionally and emotionally to the Cherokee Indians and Cherokee  Nation an important place.    And he said,    I   m completely with you on  that.    He said,    I didn   t schedule this meeting, somebody else did.    He  said,    You come to the meeting, and we   ll just sort of make that clear.     So I came, and the EPA walked in, and there I was, and they were  surprised. Governor Bellmon said,    But before we have this meeting,  gentlemen, I   d like to introduce you to someone. That person there at the  end of the table, he   s the attorney general of Oklahoma. He was elected  attorney general, and he is also my lawyer on this matter. So if you want  to talk to me about the Illinois River, you need to include the attorney  general, too.    So in that, sort of, kind way, he set the relationship. And  we had a lot of mutual friends, Bill and Wanda Swisher, G.T. and Libby  Blankenship, General Don Ferrell and Sally Ferrell. We had a lot of  mutual friends, and we had some confidence in each other.  He had a tendency to cross party lines, too, when he thought it was good  for the state.  He did. Of course, he was a modern day farmer and a graduate of  Oklahoma State University, and so he was a Darwinist. He understood  Darwin was right. He understood Mendel was right. When you farm and  raise cattle, genetics is just practical day-to-day science. He knew that.  And all the time I knew him, he was very interested in scientific  research. I think he would definitely cross party lines in areas today,  these efforts to keep Darwin out of the classroom that some very  conservative Republicans have brought forward, opposition to any kind  of stem cell research and those kinds of things. I think he would just say,  12     Wait a minute. There   s a national consensus on this. Science is real.     I remember one night after I was a judge and he had retired, he came to  an event to honor the redoubtable Judge Lee West, this wonderful  frontier character who is hysterical. If you can imagine the concept of a  hysterical federal judge, he can be. He and the governor are great  friends. Governor Bellmon came to this event that was honoring Lee  West. I believe it might have been the National Conference of Christians  and Jews Humanitarian Award, and it was really late. This was, as I  recall, after Shirley had died and before he had remarried, and I said,     Now, Governor, you   re not driving back to Billings tonight, are you?     because it was eleven-thirty at night, which was   he was known to be a  very early riser. He said,    Well, yes I am.    I said,    Well, why don   t you  come stay at my house?    He said,    Well, I have to be up bright and  early. I need to be at OSU at seven o   clock.    He said,    We   re working  on smart bridges.    And I said,    Okay. I give up. What are smart  bridges?    And he said,    Well, we   ve got these bridges now that we   ve  designed, and we   ve figured out a way that they can store heat. So when  ice comes, the bridges can release this heat, and so the ice will melt, and  you don   t have sodium chloride pollution from salt or have to move  potassium chloride or all those other things in to fix it.     I just thought this was so interesting, but here   s this retired governor  who   s trying to work on smart bridges. I said,    Well, Governor, you can  get up whatever time you want, but just spend the night.    And he said,     Well, you know, I will.    So I set my alarm for five o   clock to get up to  show him out. My alarm rang, I jumped up and walked out to knock on  his door, and I heard his car start in the driveway. He was already out of  there and on the road to OSU. But I say that because he knew about  science, and he was curious about that. He liked to take his  grandchildren there and show them the stuff, to OSU. He was a big  patron of education. He supported the reforms of House Bill 1706. He  supported putting more money in education with these reforms, and that  was very controversial in his party, just as the Panama Canal vote was  controversial, just as bussing, even though his votes there were for a  short term fix. He was a pragmatist, and he could use this immense  credibility that he had to go to that well a lot and do the right thing and  still survive.  I remember one thing that was very irritating to me, I believe it was   he  had supported this controversial tax increase, even though it was hitched  to reforms for education. That was not popular in the Republican Party,  and so George H.W. Bush, the first President Bush, the father, George  Herbert Walker Bush, had just announced for the Republican  presidency. Governor Bellmon had been one of his first and early  supporters. There was a big event at the Cowboy Museum, a big  13  Finchum  Henry  Republican event at the Cowboy Museum, and here Henry Bellmon was  there as the sitting elected Republican governor of the State of  Oklahoma, and he was not invited to sit at the head table, which was  impolite and wrong. It bothered me much more than it bothered him. He  did leave the event early and mentioned it in his book, but I   m old  fashioned enough to know you just don   t do that.  Do you have some fond, fun memories?  I remember a great time when we flew in the state airplane to have a  meeting with then Governor Bill Clinton, on the Illinois River. I think it  was scheduled in Bartlesville, up in the part of Oklahoma known as     Green Country.    So as we were flying down, we were going over what  we were going to say, and I said,    Governor, if I were you, I   d welcome  them to Green Country, Oklahoma, but say you don   t mean the rivers.     Which he promptly did, later, pointing out we don   t want the algal  bloom, the algae that blooms when you put so much nitrogen in the  water and all that stuff.  We went into a private session and had what diplomats would call a     frank exchange of views.    We were not going to agree with each other,  although, frankly, I do think President Clinton felt our pain. I think he  thought we had a very good legal argument, and so we had a press  conference later, where we were trying to put the best spin on things in  hopes that we could resolve some of this. I remember Governor Bellmon  had been very straight and serious and almost a monotone, just no  histrionics or rhetoric, and they said,    Well, but Governor Bellmon,  what would you do if nothing happens and Arkansas ignores these  efforts and just continues to add this effluent to the Illinois River?    And  the governor just in a total deadpan said,    Well, we have a rather large  and at this time inactive National Guard in Oklahoma.    And the  cameraman just   you could feel the camera shake. (Laughs) I mean, he  had been so serious, and it sort of recounts the time when Governor  Murray called the National Guard out for a battle over a bridge with  Texas. That was fun.  I remember some press conferences we had. We had a big dispute  between domestic and out-of-state insurance companies, and there was a  lawsuit. These premiums, the premium tax was paid into a court fund  until the lawsuit could be decided. I met with some of the people who  represented the various insurance companies and I said,    Why don   t we  resolve this? Why don   t we settle this?    and they said,    We   re not going  to settle this because we can   t get a fair hearing in the legislature.    And I  said,    I can guarantee you a fair hearing.    I said,    Henry Bellmon and I  will come up with a study system that you will consider fair. I can  guarantee you that, and if we do that, will you play the game?    They  14  said,    All right. See if you can convince us.     So I called Governor Bellmon, told him what I thought, and he said,     Well, we need to find the perfect person to chair this study committee.     He called me back a couple days later and he said,    I   ve got the person.     And I said,    Who would that be?    And he said,    Father Michael  Roethler of St. Gregory   s.    I just started laughing, and I said,    Well,  nobody   s ever had a Catholic priest in Oklahoma lead a study  commission. I hope the Vatican doesn   t own any of these insurance  companies that are involved.    But I said,    He has a PhD from Fordham.  He is big and strong and tough and highly respected. I think it   s a great  idea.    So Bellmon shocks everybody by announcing,    I   ve got a  Catholic priest who   s going to lead this study commission.    Well, the  insurance companies go, they checked Father   he   s a monk, too. He   s a  Benedictine monk. That   s oath of poverty. He owns nothing. He has no  property. He has no wealth. This guy is impervious to any kind of  complaint of political duplicity or conflict of interest. It was an  absolutely brilliant appointment. I wish I had thought of it. I did  introduce Father Mike to Governor Bellmon, but it was his idea. So  Father Mike pulls this committee together. He comes to my office as  attorney general all the time,    I need some staff. I need some law  reviews. I need to study this.    And they work it out. They work out an  agreement between all the parties, and we sign it, and the lawsuit goes  away.  The governor and I decided to call a joint press conference and  announce this. So he has his weekly press conference and he says,    And,  now, my friend and colleague, the attorney general of the State of  Oklahoma   s here, and I   d like to share the podium with him today to  announce something that   s very important.    So I get up and say,     Governor Bellmon and I have worked together, and we have resolved  the insurance premium tax dispute. The matter   s resolved. It will  immediately free up X million dollars for appropriation. Both parties are  happy, and this has been a remarkable conclusion. I   ll be happy to take  any questions.     There   s just total silence, and one of the senior press correspondents  says,    Where   s the catch?    I said,    What do you mean, catch?    He said,     Well, where   s the deal. I mean, what   s under the table here?    I said,     There   s nothing under the table. I mean, I   ve shown   this is   you see,  the parties have signed this. It   s an agreement.    They said,    There   s got  to be more to it than that.    I said,    No, we had a study commission,  Father Mike chaired it.    The cynicism was just so apparent and palpable.  Finally, I said,    Hey, guys    (and guys is a sex-neutral term, although  they were mostly guys). I said,    Hey guys, the funny thing about life,  every now and then, despite your best efforts, something good happens,  15  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  and something good happened. And the governor and I worked together.  It   s kind of a novel thing for the attorney general and the governor to  work together, two different parties, we did, we solved this. Everybody I  know is happy, you should be happy.    And we left, and I was really kind  of disappointed in the press.  In retrospect, they were just doing their job. I mean, cynicism was  justified by the press in Oklahoma, I think, and the governor was  philosophic. He said,    Robert, let me tell you.    He said,    I have never  minded that the press gives us a hard time.    And he said,    I remember at  one time when I was the governor, there was a guy running named  Preston Moore, whose biggest claim to fame was he was big in the  American Legion. I just didn   t think he was qualified at all. He was  going to be the democratic standard bearer and run against Dewy  Bartlett. I knew he was going to get elected, and I was really worried  about it. And then I went through one really hostile press conference.     He said,    I took some comfort out of the thought that,    Well, at least  Preston Moore will have to face this heat, face this music, as I have, and  it   ll make things happen.       And that was just a great lesson for me. He  was just saying,    Hey, the press is the press. Maybe we wish they  wouldn   t be cynical, maybe we wish they could have done their  homework well enough to know this was a good deal, but not to worry.  It   s the way the system works.     Any idea where he developed that type of philosophy or how he came to  have it?  Well, he had a tough hide to be sure. I think, I guess, one of the many  great things about Henry Bellmon was his humility, and humility is,  perhaps, not always a virtue. Benjamin Franklin said,    Humility was the  virtue that once you determined you had acquired it, you immediately  have lost it.    But if you are a smart and hardworking person, the fact that  you are humble enough to think you don   t know all the answers, I think,  is a good thing. I think it   s sadly lacking in a lot of modern politics,  political officials, and it   s our fault as voters and citizens. Political  officials are not expected to say,    I don   t know the answer,    or,    I could  be wrong about this. I haven   t had time to think it through,    but that   s  still a really good way to do it sometimes. I think he had a natural  humility. I think part of it may have been the humility that farmers have.  What   s going to happen is, in a sense, going to happen. You work your  best to get a crop in, but at the last there   s some hail, there   s a flood,  there   s a fungus, world prices, and you can get mad and curse and  wheeze, or you can just say,    Well, stuff happens.    And I think, maybe,  that was part of it.  Well, do you have any idea how he even came to think of Father Mike  16  Henry  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  Henry  for that one committee?  He got to know Father Mike through the Benedictine Medal that we  gave at the Skirvin Hotel. When you got to know Father Mike, you just  got to know him. I mean, he was an amazing guy. He was a great golfer.  He was a chain smoker. He was capable of losing his temper when the  situation demanded it. He was just sort of a real man who had a passion  for justice and, particularly, for mentally challenged people. He was  witty, funny, talented, life of the party, and St. Augustine was famously  said to have said,    Love God, and do what you like.    The idea being if  you really love God, the stuff that you like will not be disappointing to  God. I think that was Father Mike. He was a person who loved God and  did what he wanted. And he loved to play golf, he loved to drink scotch,  he occasionally felt that an epithet was needed to deal with a situation.  He was honest to a T, charitable to a fault, and intelligent. He was a  great, great man.  So I   m imagining Governor Bellmon sitting in his office just running  through people in his head, processing.  And I think the light went on, the    Eureka     light went on, and he said     he loved irony, too, and I think he said,    Let   s see them find something  nefarious in this one.    And I can just see these major insurance  companies, someone called the CEO,    He   s appointed a Benedictine  monk.       What?  What?        Governor Bellmon has appointed a  Benedictine monk to chair this committee.       Well, who is he? Who   s his  family?       He   s nobody. His family came from South Dakota. They  came here because of St. Gregory   s. He doesn   t own anything. He   s got  an oath of poverty. Let   s see what happens.    And it happened. (Laughs)  Did he have that much success with any other similar cases?  Bellmon liked to go outside the box, and he liked to give people a  chance. So he received the American Civil Liberties Union, Angie Debo  Award. Now, can you imagine a sitting Republican governor nowadays  accepting the American Civil Liberties Union Award? Well, the truth of  the matter is, the American Civil Liberties Union is neither Democrat  nor Republican, neither liberal nor conservative. I mean, the ACLU  supported the right of Nazis to march because they   re big free speech  people, and they feel the marketplace of ideas will take care of it. Well,  the governor admired Angie Debo, greatly, as did I, and this award was  named after her. In fact, Angie Debo had resigned from the American  Civil Liberties Union because they used a lottery one time to fund  something, and she was opposed to raffles or lotteries. (Laughs) But the  governor was proud to accept that award and deserved it for his human  rights work.  17  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  Henry  He also appointed Hannah Atkins to office, and she was a Democrat.  Yes. He appointed a lot of Democrats. Hannah, who just passed away  not too long ago, was   whenever her name comes into my mind, the  word    dignity    just appears. She was just the most dignified   she was a  librarian, by the way, and her husband was Dr. Atkins. They were very  prominent in the civil rights movement in Oklahoma. President Carter  had drafted her to work in the United Nations, and so, at a certain point,  Governor Bellmon appointed her his financial officer. Lex Holmes was a  lifelong Democrat. He just went to people with talent. Some other  stalwarts, like General Don Ferrell, were lifelong Republicans. Drew  Mason, Andrew Tevington, those key officials were Republicans,  although the party moniker just never really adequately described any of  them. They were pragmatic and progressive people.  He could have run for a second term, couldn   t he have, at that point?  Were you surprised that he didn   t?  No. I don   t think he had really wanted, in essence, his second term. I  mean, he could have   if he   d ran again, it would have been his third  term as governor, but his second successive term. There   s that old World  War I song, I believe it is, How    Ya Gonna Keep    Em Down on the Farm  (After They   ve Seen Paree). He left the plow, saved the republic and  then wanted to come back to the plow. I think he felt like Oklahoma  really needed him during that second term as governor and that some  stability was called for. It would have been a difficult campaign. He  would have been challenged from the right in the Republican party,  David Walters and Mike Turpin. I think David Walters had pretty much  been determined to be the potential Democratic rival, and he was a very  gifted campaigner, and I think Governor Bellmon said,    I think I   ve  done more than what I needed to do.     He did go back to the farm, but, of course, he never just stayed there. He  was always involved in the Academy for State Goals, always involved in  his beloved Oklahoma State University and their research. A couple of  weeks before he died he came to visit me at my house to ask me to help  on another educational initiative he was working on to try to look at the  reforms of House Bill 1706 to try to do a cost benefit analysis on them,  see if they were really working, see what we needed to do. He was  interested in early childhood. Again, this is something that his current  political party has not been supportive of, these major initiatives in early  childhood, like those that George Kaiser and the Kaiser Foundation  came forward with and Brad Henry. Oklahoma has made some real  progress in early education, but currently, the majority in the legislature  has not been interested in expanding that, unfortunately. Governor  18  Finchum  Henry  Bellmon was very interested in those things.  I noticed you have several books regarding Mr. Henry. Do you want to  share a few of those?  Well, I love my library. I   ve got about 5,000 books in my library, and  about 4,000 of them are here, and the rest are across the hall in the  administration building here at OCU. I don   t have quite room for  everything. But one of my very favorite books is this, The Life and  Times of Henry Bellmon. I got a call some years ago from Jim Tolbert,  who has Full Circle Bookstore, our greatest bookstore here in  Oklahoma. He said,    We   re putting together a book on Henry Bellmon,  (he and Pat are) and we need someone to write the forward. I proposed  you, and Governor Bellmon said he   d love to do that. Would you read  the book and write the forward?     So they sent me the manuscript. They asked me to make a few  comments, which I did, and I wrote the forward. The book won Book of  the Year in Oklahoma, that year. It was an outstanding book, and I got  this letter from Governor Bellmon on May 6, 1993.    To Mr. Robert  Henry, Dean of Oklahoma City University School of Law. Dear Robert,  at last the long promised autographed copy. The limitations of space  made it difficult for me to express, fully, the debt of gratitude I feel to  you as a result of years of the wise counsel you gave me as my lawyer.  Also, the flattering preface you wrote is deeply appreciated. During my  time in military service, a wise man I met in San Diego told me that if, at  the end of a person   s life, he could count on the friendship of five people  he would have lived well. I am proud to count you as one of my five and  hope you will look to me in the same light. Sincerely, Henry.     I love and treasure this letter. The original is filed in a protected place,  and this is a photocopy that I keep. In that preface I said a number of  things, but I reread it from time to time, and I just haven   t changed my  opinion. He is just one of those people that ages well, that takes history  well. I pointed out,    Over his impressive career, this mountain of a man  has farmed, fought for his country on the islands of the Pacific, created a  modern political party. He has been a governor. Indeed, his place in  history is assured as he was the first Republican governor of a southern  state since the reconstruction, and a United States senator, and then a  governor again. He   s been a businessman, a manufacturer, director of  one of the finest, most socially responsible major corporations in  America. He   s been the confidante of presidents and imminent political  figures. He   s been a proud husband and father and, perhaps, above all,  he   s been a friend not only to those he knows, but to those he knows  about: the poor, the disadvantaged, the oppressed, and the uneducated.     19  Then I closed,    There probably will never be another Henry Bellmon,  but for the sake of our state and country, I hope I   m wrong. For Henry  Bellmon, echoing Burke, has followed the observation he makes in his  book that the politician who tries to follow public opinion rather than  lead gets left behind.    So I really think this book is good and is  something that I would encourage young aspiring political leaders to  read. I was very gratified that it was Book of the Year, and I treasure my  two inscribed copies I have from him. This one thanks me for my kind  words and wise counsel in many explosive situations.  One other thing I wanted to mention was when President Clinton was  impeached and going through that situation, I knew from my many  conversations with Governor Bellmon that he had experienced the same  thing during the Nixon era. So I was federal judge then. I invited him to  my office to meet with my law clerks. When you   re a federal judge, you  have these wonderful law clerks from all these great institutions, from  Yale and Harvard and Columbia and Stanford and Chicago, and I knew  they had never encountered anyone quite like Henry Bellmon. We had  lunch and talked about this situation, about the analogy. And Bellmon  had been an early supporter, as governor, of Richard Nixon. When  Nixon was elected, he called a few people together, including Barry  Goldwater and Henry Bellmon and said,    You   re my kitchen cabinet.  You   re the guys I   m going to call on. You   re the ones who are going to  come over and help me govern this country.    And that was the first time  he had the group together.  The second time he had the group together was the eve of his  announcement that he was resigning. He just completely lost touch  with   he didn   t dance with the ones that brung him. He completely lost  touch with these remarkable people. I mean, it doesn   t get any better  from a wisdom sense than Henry Bellmon and Barry Goldwater. These  are the Cincinnati, these are the people who   ve saved the republic.  Nixon, who was a brilliant but troubled soul and a paranoid, lost sight of  this group of advisors that he could have had. As Governor Bellmon told  the story, he told about Nixon weeping and saying,    I hope I haven   t let  you down.    Well, of course, he let them down  He let the whole country  down, but at the end, when it was too little and too late, he realized that  he could have turned to these people that could have helped him all this  time. He felt that he had to apologize to them. He did that, and then he  left that room and walked out in front of the television cameras and  resigned.  So I said,    Governor, compare this to President Clinton   s situation.    And  he said,    Well, all right,    he said,    Richard Nixon should have been  impeached.    If he hadn   t resigned, he thought Richard Nixon should  have been impeached, and Richard Nixon should have been convicted.  20  Finchum  Henry  Now, that   s quite a staement   Richard Nixon should have been  impeached, and Richard Nixon should have been convicted. He said,     Bill Clinton should have been impeached and Bill Clinton should be  acquitted.    And his point was   and he later expanded this     impeachment, itself, is a sanction, and it   s a pretty good one. Clinton did  sanctionable stuff, but not impeachable stuff. Personal sexual ethics, bad  as that is, and lying about it, bad as that is, in Governor Bellmon   s mind  was not a high crime or misdemeanor to the extent that it warranted  removal. But it was quite a lesson. It was quite a lesson. Just the times  that he had lived through from Iwo Jima to just a few months ago. He  experienced a lot of things.  He was a perpetual teacher, too, it sounds like, constantly teaching.  He would take the time to teach those of us who were younger and  curious. He   d teach us some things. I   ll tell you about my last visit.  Governor called me and, intriguingly, I could never call him    Henry.     That   s just been, I have just admired him too much, and he was a teacher  to me, and I try every now and then, but it just   I always tend to call  him,    Governor.    And he would never call me,    Robert.    He would call  me,    General,    which, believe it or not, is the title for attorney general,  or,    Judge.    And I was certain he deserved the title. I   m not certain that I  did, but the governor came over to visit me, and when I walked out I was  watching the window. Someone had driven him. He was not doing so  well. His Parkinson   s had gotten bad, and I thought,    Well,    I just  almost never thought I would see the day when Henry Bellmon would  need a driver. I just thought that not even age and disease and malady  could conquer this mountain of a man, as I referred to him. But he was a  realist. He knew he couldn   t do this.  He came in the house, he sat down. Penny Williams was there, former  state senator, state representative, longtime friend. We discussed this  task. He had this idea. He thought I needed to talk to Brad Henry and get  Brad Henry involved in it, and he thought we should work together on  this other program. When we finished, I said,    Governor, if you don   t  mind, I   d like to ask you to walk out to the back, and I want to prove to  you that I have some slight objective worth as a human being.    We  loved to sort of play these games with each other, and so he wondered  what I had in mind, but of course, he said yes. So I walked out, and I  took him to my organic garden, and this picture doesn   t reveal it quite  well, but those tomato plants behind us are about twelve feet tall.  (Gestures) We had devised a way to train and prune them to grow  vertically, and it was remarkable. He said,    I have never seen tomato  plants like that all my life.    He said,    My daughters need to come see  your garden.     21  Finchum  Henry  Finchum  A couple weeks later, I was to receive the Roger   s State University  Constitution Award. I was up there to receive it, and I was teaching a  class before the lunch where the award was offered, and my dear friend  Judge Stephanie Seymour was going to be there, my mother had driven  in from Shawnee. I finished teaching my class and one of my law clerks  came to me with a sad look, and I knew the news was not good. He told  me that he   d received a call that Governor Bellmon had passed away and  that he   d been hospitalized and Parkinson   s had, I believe, sort of gone  into the colon and caused some problems.  Shortly afterwards, both Pat and Gail called me to personally tell me  what happened. Both of them said,    Daddy said we need to see your  garden.    And I walked down, I saw my mother, I started crying because  she understood the relationship that I had with him. He came to my  father   s funeral. It was just a really emotional time. People don   t get to  live forever. It wasn   t a great death. It was kind of a painful death, but I  think the very end was okay. They asked me to speak at one of the  memorial services, which I was very happy to do, and it   s   and as you  can tell, it   s always hard to lose a political figure like that. (Cries) They  don   t come about that often.  I spoke at the service here and then went to the church at Billings, and  he was a person of the soil, and the best person of the soil I   ve known. I  think the services were dignified, and a lot of people   they needed two  services. One for people here and one for people in the community that  knew him so well. I think Methodists, United Methodists, talk about     servant leadership,    and I think that phrase is a very wise one because a  servant is a communitarian. A servant works for the community. A  leader is an individualist. A leader has to be alone. A leader has to be up  front. And the relationship of the one to the many, of the individualist  and the altruist, is a huge part of human nature, of philosophy. I think the  answer is   should we be altruists, should we be individualists? The  answer is we should be both, and I think Henry Bellmon   s life is as great  an example of that concept of servant leadership that I   ve ever seen.  That   s a good way to end, isn   t it?  Yes, I think that   s a good way to end.  Thank you very much for your time.  -------  -------
