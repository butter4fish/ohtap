Deborah Aschheim: This is Deborah Aschheim, and I’m in the Crystal Room at Alumnae Hall
on Pembroke Campus, interviewing Mrs. Katherine Hazard for the Pembroke Archives in the
John Hay Library. This is a project for Michelle Oppenheimer’s oral history class, and I’m
interviewing her about her life at Pembroke College starting in 1930. But first I’d like to ask you
just a preliminary question. Did you live on campus when you attended Brown?
Katherine M. Hazard: No, I didn’t. There was a very small number of people did live on campus.
We lived mainly (inaudible). We had (inaudible), and two people lived in (long inaudible).
[01:00] And [we lived in Angell Street?]. (inaudible)

DA: All right. Did you commute from Cranston?

KH: Yes. I commuted on the trolley car. Plus, you took trolleys, one from my home to
downtown, and another one up the hill. If you wanted to pay for two transfers (inaudible).

DA: Every morning?
KH: Every morning, because there was chapel at nine o’clock.

DA: Oh, so how early did you have to get up for this?

KH: Well, (inaudible).
1

DA: Oh, wow. (laughter)

KH: (long inaudible) walk up the hill. Ah, but you had to run up the hill, [twice around the lake?]
(inaudible). [02:00] (inaudible)

DA: So did they serve lunch on campus?
KH: Yeah, (long inaudible). They didn’t – you knew which days they had the best food. In those
days, (inaudible).
DA: So it wasn’t like the meal plan today. Did you pay in cash (inaudible)? So what’d you think
about getting to school at 9:00 every morning for chapel?
KH: I didn’t mind it. (inaudible) in high school.

DA: Yeah. What we read in the yearbooks and the Pembroke Record was a lot of protests
(inaudible) controversial [issue?].
KH: I didn’t think it was controversial.

DA: Well, maybe it [03:00] looks that way. Yeah.

KH: I mean, but to be controversial.

DA: Which were the years that you were at Pembroke?
KH: I was from 1929 to ’33. I graduated in ’33. We were really used to regimentation in those
days. But (inaudible).
DA: What other kind of rules were there, whether it be mandatory exercise, or –
2

KH: Well, and mandatory gym. We’ll use gym.

DA: What was the reaction to that?
KH: Well, again, we didn’t know enough at the time. (long inaudible) Not what you were going
to major in, but I mean, the fact that you (inaudible) distribution.

DA: Yeah. Were there a lot of the [pharmacy core courses?] that you had to take?

KH: Yeah. I can barely recall, but (inaudible). I think you had to have a certain number of
[04:00] foreign language credits, and some English, and some – I’m not really sure, but I don’t
think I (inaudible) science if I had it (inaudible).

DA: What do you think of the new curriculum today? (inaudible) [finish what we want?]?
KH: I don’t think that’s so good either. (inaudible) I think some students, at least, are likely to
(inaudible) all around it. I think the distribution does help to round out a person’s education. I
don’t think it needs to be as scripted as it once was, but there could be a happy medium.
DA: Would you like to see Brown trying something like Harvard’s core curriculum?
KH: Well, I don’t know too much about Harvard’s core curriculum (long inaudible). I
understand it could be – it could be a matter (inaudible).
DA: Yeah. [05:00] No, you definitely deserve (inaudible) avoiding the things that are – come
hard to him
KH: Yes, we did, and a little bit of the difficult things couldn’t hurt.

3

DA: What other really major differences did you see between campus of today and then – I
remember reading things about, like, uniforms and –

KH: gym uniforms?

DA: I think so. I think it was gym uniforms, but (inaudible) and we were shown one in the
archives.

KH: Well, the first year we were here we wore high brown socks to gym. And Brown set limits
(inaudible). But they would (long inaudible). [But not too strict?]. And then the shirt was also
tan. (inaudible). And we wore the bloomers over it. [06:00] It looked nice, but –

DA: Was it comfortable for athletics?

KH: Yeah, in fact, (inaudible).

DA: Oh yeah.

KH: But after a couple of years, they did (inaudible) that [came into class?] (inaudible).

DA: Oh no! (laughter)
KH: That’s a pleasant [year?]. (inaudible)

DA: Oh really? (laughter)

KH: They had (inaudible).
DA: (inaudible) we were talking about –

KH: (inaudible) all round. (long inaudible)
4

DA: Oh, so that must have made everyone much more happy. (laughter) [07:00]
KH: Much cooler (inaudible). I can’t remember (inaudible).

DA: Yeah. [Keep in mind?]. Another thing that we heard about the big issue was I guess the
right to smoke on campus. (inaudible) So some of these things I guess were blown out of
proportion (long inaudible). Another thing we heard about was the sophomore math (inaudible).
Were you involved in that at all?

KH: Everybody was involved in everything else because the campus was small, and you either
were in it or you (inaudible).

DA: So which did you do?

KH: (very long inaudible) May Day (inaudible) [08:00]

DA: Sort of. (laughter)

KH: And (inaudible).

DA: No, not as much. (laughter)

KH: (inaudible) And either of those, they were both fun.

DA: And so were there a lot of sort of traditions from back then?

KH: Yes, there were. Well, (inaudible).
DA: I think, yeah, something that. So did women’s colleges tend to have more traditions than
coed ones? Yeah.
5

KH: (inaudible) [09:00]

DA: How much contact was there between (inaudible)?

KH: Well, not a great deal.

DA: Did you ever have [problems?] (inaudible)?

KH: Well I did. It depended on your major. If you were in a major that a lot of girls chose, you
tended to see an all girls class. I majored in math (inaudible). So I have, after freshman year, I
had only classes on the hill. Most of them (inaudible). There would usually be two or three
women, and a dozen men.

DA: Oh. How did the male students react to the women?
KH: Well, they didn’t say no at the time.

DA: Did they respect you equally do you think?

KH: Yeah. There was no disrespect. I think just he was uncomfortable.
DA: Did they seem to be interested in –
KH: Not (inaudible), no. As math – as mathematicians, yes. We were equal in that way. [10:00]

DA: Oh, you never [have gone to?]. (laughter)

KH: Well, I guess by senior year, I was going out with a couple of the math men(inaudible) any
other [men?].

6

DA: Oh, there was (inaudible). Was it because of this (inaudible)? Some of the things that I
noticed in the archives was sort of an almost an antagonistic attitude on the part of the Brown
Daily Herald was (inaudible). So how [should that really work?]?
KH: Well, I don’t know either. We (inaudible). At least I (inaudible). [I’m on record with that?]
(inaudible). And as a matter of fact, (long inaudible) [and bringing all of those things to here?].
(inaudible) [11:00]

DA: How did the professors treat the (inaudible) students at Brown?

KH: If there had been [antagonizing?], that probably went out long before.

DA: Yeah. Do you think that you got equal time in the classroom though or were treated
equally?

KH: You mean in the mixed group?

DA: Yeah.
KH: Oh I’m certain, I’m sure we did.(long inaudible) I guess some at the science department
(inaudible). But English giving, French giving, they were (inaudible).

DA: Oh, really?

KH: (inaudible)
DA: Yeah. Well, there were a lot less students, I’m sure.

KH: Yes. But I mean, the variety of (inaudible) may have been (inaudible). [12:00]

DA: Yeah. What were the professors like over at Pembroke? Were they mostly male or female?
7

KH: Mostly male.

DA: And how did they see the students?
KH: (inaudible) I think the kind of a feeling that (inaudible). I don’t imagine they were crazy
about coming over there, because it was so hard to get there from (inaudible) [building away?]
and it took more time (inaudible). But (inaudible).
DA: Well, that’s good.

KH: But some of the faculty were (inaudible).
DA: Yeah. That’s where – I had two classes there.

KH: (inaudible)
DA: That’s where our oral history is. (laughter)

KH: [13:00] (inaudible)

DA: Did you get a sense of any particular life that Pembroke was preparing you for? Like, did
most of the women expect to go into careers, or be housewives, or –

KH: Well, I think most people thought they were going to careers, (inaudible) [meet the
careers?] – money was tight. But Ms. Morriss was against that. She would say, “You’re not
preparing for a specific career, you’re preparing for life.
DA: Yes, I’ve heard that. (laughter)

8

KH: She preached that at every chapel, maybe once a week we heard that. [Because people do?]
(inaudible) what’s happening in the outside world.

DA: Yeah. Can you feel that having as large effect on your life with what your political scene
and economic reality?
KH: Well, I mean personally, [14:00] in college. But there were classmates who couldn’t stay.
There were some that were here the first term, in 1929, and they couldn’t return (inaudible) for
second semester. And so (inaudible) at some point it did affect us. (inaudible) It did affect me
after I got out of college, because hardly anybody got a job. (inaudible) early days [of oral
history of WPA?]. Well, I worked for the WPA, and [it accepted the PWA?]. I can’t remember
which came first, but in any case, they employed many young people, teaching Americanization.
And that’s what I did [15:00].

DA: What did you do in teaching Americanization?

KH: You taught non-English-speaking people to speak English. And the reading, the writing.
Writing (inaudible). And there were quite a few Portuguese in our town. And in many cases, the
men spoke English, not well, but they were perfectly understandable. But they didn’t write it or
read it. We taught those after school. I mean, after work for them. But their wives, in many cases,
didn’t speak any English. So they stayed home, looked after the children. And so we went into
homes, sometimes wondering what that (inaudible). But what was that, a whole year and several
(inaudible).

DA: Did you enjoy it?

KH: Yes, I wouldn’t have liked to have find a [16:00] (inaudible). And then after years, I meet
those people, and they were all very glad to see me. In fact once, I was a teacher, and once, many
years after I was teaching (long inaudible) I got a tenth grader and he looked at me and said
“You had my grandfather in school,” and I wasn’t that old when (inaudible). And I said “Oh my,
I might have had your father, but never your grandfather”. And he said “Yes, you did.” And I
9

said you go and check with that. So he came back the next day, and he says “Yes, he says he had
you all right, but it wasn’t the regular course (inaudible) he didn’t speak English” And I said “Oh
that was why” (overlapping dialogue; inaudible).

DA: Oh, how did you feel teaching them?
KH: I didn’t mind. And they didn’t mind either. I mean, they were all glad to take the
opportunity. They were always very nice, and very, very respectful. [17:00] A lot more
respectful than the children (inaudible) to send somebody inexperienced.

DA: Yeah. So you went on to continue elementary school? (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) Or
junior high. Were you teaching math?

KH: Yes.

DA: Where did you teach?

KH: I taught in (inaudible)

DA: So what is the majority of the class (inaudible)? How did they use their education?

KH: (long inaudible) Some of them became librarians. Some of them were social workers (very
long inaudible). [18:00]
DA: Oh, Okay. That’s good. (laughter)

KH: You know, (inaudible).
DA: Yeah, but so do you think that there was, compared to today, maybe more of a– I don’t want
to ask a leading question or anything but it seems to me that perhaps they endorsed more of a

10

social, a desire to do social work and (inaudible) personally, [so you need professional?]
(inaudible).

KH: (inaudible)

DA: Okay. Seems that people tended to go into occupations that were more subject towards
others as opposed to just trying to get a good job that paid well. (inaudible)

KH: Oh, (inaudible).

DA: Yeah, that might just be my perception.

KH: I think that (long inaudible). [19:00] (inaudible) [down to Pawtucket?] on Sundays, and
listened to some women (inaudible) she may have been (inaudible). I’ve seen her name.
(inaudible) but I (inaudible). She was quite (inaudible). But we went, [a couple of people?]
(inaudible). They were trying to stir up our consciousness, (inaudible). Almost everybody (long
inaudible). So there’s not much money to be made anyway. I mean, you got a job, you were
lucky to be working. [You got paid to have a name?].

DA: Was there a lot of community programs, and sort of that sort of thing [20:00] going on a lot
with Pembroke women while you were at school? Were there a lot of social programs?

KH: You mean daycare and such things?

DA: Well, just (inaudible), sort of reaching for [community?]. Or did the women mostly stay up
on the hill, (inaudible)? Is it another leading question?
KH: Yeah, I don’t – they stayed up on the hill and studied but (inaudible).

DA: Yeah. So yeah, maybe you could give me a sense of what a day at Pembroke was like, to
actually arrive at chapel at nine…?
11

KH: Chapel was about a half an hour I think. Maybe it was longer. (inaudible)

DA: What did you wear to a day of classes?

KH: Skirt, blouse, sweater, jacket.

DA: (inaudible) wear your (inaudible) a different set of clothing that you wear [in your own
home?]? [21:00]

KH: Well, I suppose so, but (inaudible). Because there are no large [orders?]. But on the other
hand, you’d get [the girls now?] (inaudible). We weren’t dressed to that extent, but neither were
the (inaudible) people were. (long inaudible) Nobody looked casual.

DA:
KH: Well, it was the continuous (inaudible). You’d go directly to your first class from chapel.
And still a 10-minute break, but if you were going from here to there it took you really just 10
minutes to get out of one class and over to the next one. [22:00] And then it might be back here
for another one.
DA: How many classes did you…?

KH: Four or five.

DA: Oh, a day?
KH: Well, no, I don’t suppose so, because it was three times a week for most classes, if you
arranged them well you didn’t have all in one day. And of course, gym had to be added. And if
you had any extracurriculars they had to be stuck in somewhere too. So [you gave it?] (long

12

inaudible) take your lunch, (inaudible). And then (inaudible). You had lab courses, that would be
all.

DA: What extracurricular activities did you do?

KH: Well, I had (inaudible) in gym. [23:00] (inaudible) I had fistball, up and down the
(inaudible).
DA: What’s fistball?
KH: Well, it was something I thought of. You didn’t use your fist, you used your arm.
(inaudible) And I think (inaudible).
DA: Yeah, I hadn’t heard of it.

KH: Well, (long inaudible).

DA: Were you involved in any publications?

KH: No.

DA: or academic clubs and stuff?

KH: Oh, yes. The Math Club. Now, that was another thing. That was (inaudible). That [meant?]
(inaudible). Somebody [spoke to my roommate?]. (inaudible) It was a dissertation on – I guess
you’d proved the plan, or maybe the professors ran the thing. Now you see that, [24:00]
(inaudible) [jump around?] (inaudible). And they chose you to speak, and I think we’d probably
waited for (inaudible). And over the time (inaudible). And I debated.

DA: Oh, about math?

13

KH: Well it’d be an aspect of math. It was the 13-month year. And I had the (inaudible) we had
on the side here, (inaudible).
DA: Did you research it, and then –
KH: Oh yes. We got the assignment in the middle of summer. And I think I didn’t get mine till
March. But (inaudible). [25:00] And my advisor (inaudible), he was an old man then. I think it
(inaudible). Yeah. It’s a long time, (inaudible). We wore [two satchels?]. (inaudible) And then
they wore wide, wide cut. (inaudible) It’s the kind of palette, looking back, (inaudible) the kind
that we had packed for this year. You know, a shirt with no color, (inaudible). And they always
loved that. For me, at that point, that’s (inaudible). It’s been a long end (inaudible). And they
went to [file?] (inaudible). Not only wore (inaudible), but they were quite (long inaudible). There
were a lot of nice men in that department. It wasn’t (inaudible). [26:00]

DA: (inaudible) (laughter)

KH: No. But [related to?] (inaudible).

DA: Possibly towards art and English, if I stay (inaudible). Yeah. (laughter)

KH: (inaudible)

DA: So, do you find it easier [for math you learned?] at Pembroke [afterwards?]?

KH: Not (inaudible). Because (inaudible) very, very elementary level of math. It was algebra.
But it was beginner’s algebra. But without the advanced math, we wouldn’t have (long
inaudible). But [flew out from here?], we have the previous knowledge. It’s still math, but it
might have something or nothing to do with what we were doing at that moment. But you
couldn’t have gotten a job if you hadn’t had – [27:00] I mean, you couldn’t have gotten a job
teaching math.

14

DA: What sorts of careers did the men go off to in your department?
KH: Well, some (inaudible). So everyone had (inaudible). And one man (inaudible), and there’s
a lot of angry men in that (inaudible). But that’s why you do it. (inaudible) was in the math
department, (inaudible).

DA: Okay, yeah. (laughter)

KH: It was the same with the women. They majored in math, maybe they (inaudible), maybe
they didn’t.
DA: Yeah, that’s pretty much the way it is now.

KH: Yeah.
DA: So after classes were through, did you generally go home or did you stay –

KH: Well, yes, [28:00] well, I stayed around some. But I was also an active girl scout. (very long
inaudible) More or less, (inaudible).

DA: Did you come back to the activity center?

KH: Oh yes (inaudible) the play (long inaudible)

DA: What are those? Oh, I think so, yeah. Yeah.

KH: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)

DA: Were you ever involved in it?

KH: No.
15

DA: Okay. (inaudible). (laughter)

KH: No, not (inaudible). [29:00] [It was tough majoring in math?]. (inaudible)

DA: Oh. Yeah.
KH: [With my age, she hasn’t been at it?] (inaudible). You’d see an old movie sometimes.

DA: Oh, wow. (laughter) So what (inaudible)?
KH: Well, it’s about 100 now, and I think it was about 120 when we would do it.
DA: So did you all pretty much –

KH: Oh yes, we knew everybody. [Either some kind or another?] (inaudible) Unless that happens
to be in the class, (inaudible).

DA: Was there pretty much [a separation]?
KH: Somewhat. Now, another way (inaudible), it’s not alphabetically (inaudible). And they took
(inaudible).

DA: What happens if you went [there?]? (laughter)

KH: (inaudible) [30:00]

DA: Yeah. What happened if you cut class?
KH: Well, I think (long inaudible). I think that [was true?]. I wasn’t with much of a cutter
anyway.
16

DA: Yeah. (laughter) Probably for the best.
KH: Yes, [it’s true?]. Well, some of the people that [led to sat around in the faculty?] someplace.
(inaudible)
DA: So what sort of sense did you get of (inaudible) satisfied community? Or –

KH: I suppose if I did, to a certain extent. (inaudible) [Which is especially?] after the (inaudible).
And I [thought about it?], because I have (inaudible).

DA: Were they generally [welcome there?]? (inaudible)

KH: Well, I suppose [31:00] [the real level?], maybe not. Different priorities from us. Most of
them came (inaudible), but no City Girls lived in Brown. That [went and came?] in later. I mean,
nowadays, I know, people living in Providence have done but these days nobody did. But they
(inaudible), and a way might (inaudible). We’re very (inaudible) New Hampshire. (long
inaudible)

DA: What was the social life on campus, besides the extracurriculars and the clubs? What did
people primarily do for entertainment? (inaudible) [conference and lectures?]? Or –
KH: I think (inaudible) There were dances (inaudible) the Junior Prom… [32:00]

DA: Oh really? What were those like?

KH: They were both here. They were in here. No, they not in here (inaudible).

DA: Did you attend them? (laughter)

17

KH: Oh yes. I suppose, especially the sophomore dance too, I can’t really remember going to
dances in those days. And junior year, junior prom, (inaudible). Although the senior dance was at
the end of the year (inaudible) spring. And the same way (inaudible), although the (inaudible)
[were half a younger the year?], (inaudible). But they were very bad.

DA: Did the women go with men from Brown, or from (inaudible)?

KH: Well, it depended. Some (inaudible) Brown, and others of them went with [33:00] people
they’d known in high school, that maybe went somewhere else for college or maybe didn't go to
college at all. And then they had people come up [the front?].

DA: Oh. It was quite an event?

KH: Oh yes.

DA: What did you wear? So did you prepare for a [game?]?

KH: Long dresses, flowers, (very long inaudible). Men wore tuxedos. (inaudible)

DA: Oh, you tried to expand. (laughter)

KH: Yeah. (inaudible) [34:00] [men in print?] (inaudible). I think (inaudible) kind of those (long
inaudible). (inaudible)

DA: Oh yeah?

KH: Oh yeah.

DA: (inaudible) interview for?

18

KH: No, we found out afterwards. I think (inaudible). And so I [kind of went to midnight?]. I
don’t think it (inaudible). But then there were a few [pocket places?] around the city, but
afterwards, [he was gone?] (inaudible).

DA: Where in the city did Pembroke women usually go? Was there, like, Thayer Street today?]?
Or did you down the hill?
KH: (inaudible) [35:00] But the things I’m faced with, and there was nothing that took place
(inaudible). But they still (inaudible) things of that nature. (long inaudible) But there were a
couple places to eat (inaudible).
DA: Yeah. Did students go down the hill a lot in Providence? Or mostly stay –
KH: Well, I really don’t know about the [dormitory?] which is where they went at night,
ordinary nights. (inaudible) I don’t think there was [much of a chance?] (inaudible). But I’ve not
really had to think of that. (inaudible) He never kept in touch with me. [36:00]
DA: (inaudible) What kind of secondary school education did you have before you –

KH: I went to public high school in Cranston. (inaudible) that kind of was the only high school.

DA: Ah. Was it [grey?]?

KH: Cranston. Yes, Cranston High School. Very good (inaudible) high school (inaudible). I
don’t know how [lucky you were?] (inaudible). (inaudible) One of them, [37:00] my Latin
teacher, really, I won’t say she influenced me, but I admired her. Both my Latin and history
teacher (inaudible).

DA: Did anyone suggest that you (inaudible) the company starting school (inaudible)?

KH: (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) college. But I [was sure earlier?].
19

DA: Yeah. About what percentage of women from the high schools went off to college?
KH: I’d say at least a third (inaudible). It was a very well respected high school. They were put –
you went into, now they call it a track, but in those days, they called it a [core]. And there was a
classical core, and a college core. (long inaudible). And then (inaudible). [38:00] on that
industrial aggregate. But almost all of them were college bound, and they went, and they
graduated.
DA: Wow, that’s pretty impressive.

KH: Yes, (inaudible).
DA: So you didn’t feel any stigma about about where you were coming from? So it was basically
the norm? Okay.

KH: Yeah. (inaudible)

DA: What sort of backgrounds were girls in your class that you (inaudible) at Pembroke? Like,
where you said where they were from [39:00] but what sorts of families?
KH: I don’t know anything about the family that (inaudible). People from Providence
(inaudible), some of the smartest [returned to staff?], another was (inaudible).

DA: Oh yeah.

KH: (inaudible) And some were (inaudible).
DA: Were most of the students’ parents college graduates?
KH: I don’t believe they all were. I mean, mine weren’t (inaudible).
20

DA: Yeah. Did Pembroke provide any help financially? Or –
KH: Presumably there were some, but I didn’t get any funds and I don’t know who did.
DA: [40:00] And there were still women who couldn’t [continue?]?

KH: Well, I think there were really very few at the time. I know my parents thought maybe I was
simply (inaudible). But apparently, (inaudible) nothing (very long inaudible).
DA: Were the city girls generally from – what city is nearby Cranston?

KH: Providence, and Cranston.

DA: Did they mostly take public transportation?
KH: Yes, oh yes. They didn’t have cars. Meaning, the family has cars, but it wasn’t always
available to them (inaudible).

DA: Was there somewhere to stay overnight (inaudible) on campus? Or did people generally go
home? Was it very common (inaudible)?

KH: Well, (inaudible).

DA: So were there other colleges that you considered attending? Or did you always find
(inaudible)?

KH: Well, at one point, I courted the idea of being a librarian (inaudible) Rhode Island
College(inaudible). But (inaudible). That was (long inaudible). But (inaudible) when I was in
high school, and [Mama knew I was going to be?] a librarian [42:00] (inaudible). They
(inaudible).
21

DA: Oh no, you’re fine. No, (inaudible). See, it’s (inaudible).

Track 2

DA: This is a continuation of the interview between Deborah Aschheim and Katherine Hazard at
the Crystal Room in Alumnae Hall. Is there anything that you perceived about, I don’t know, just
changes in education for women today? Differences you’ve noticed: curriculum, and (inaudible)?
And will it seem to you that there are more or less options today at any – (inaudible) when you
went to college?

KH: Well, there are more options for students, for their [teachers?]. (long inaudible) [01:00] We
were (inaudible).

DA: Yeah. What do you think of, like, the feminist movement?
KH: Well, the feminist movement was [in times of ERA?]. I don’t care for any of it (inaudible).
And I don’t care (inaudible) words. Not [free to say?] (inaudible). I went to Pembroke reading
center yesterday, and I was reading aloud that book (inaudible) gender. (long inaudible) [02:00]
gone so far as to change your name (inaudible). And that was not a joke, he (inaudible). I think
of men [in a universal way?]. I think [private men], but I know (inaudible). I’m sorry that
Pembroke lost its identity.

DA: Yeah. How do you feel about the [merger wall?]?

KH: I feel very strongly against it. I think [the women fought it].

DA: How do you feel compared to, say, Harvard and Radcliffe?

KH: Well, (inaudible). I think it was a mistake. I think [03:00] we have traditions on campus,
and (inaudible). (inaudible) Brown men’s club, the Brown club. And a little house across the

22

street, which now is something along the lines of (inaudible). An old lady lived in it. She lived at
Pembroke. There were other things. The newspaper and such things.

DA: Yeah. What was the general Alumnae reaction at the time of the change?

KH: [My level?] and older, I think it was against. But the young women (inaudible), the height
of the feminist explosion… And I think some of them have lived to regret it, and I think some of
(inaudible). [04:00]
DA: Is there anything that you see we could do to, sort of, bring back the sense of Pembroke’s
identity?
KH: No. I don’t (inaudible). I can’t imagine co-ed dormitories. I think that’s a real (inaudible).
And I don’t mean from a moral standpoint, I mean, from a personal standpoint. We used to run
around (inaudible). And surely, they can’t [manage?]. (inaudible)

DA: To some extent, yeah.
KH: I think (inaudible). But I don’t think anybody my age or older thinks it was a good idea

DA: Do you feel that way mostly just because of Pembroke losing its sense of being its own
unique college, or because of the college (inaudible)?

KH: [05:00] (inaudible) We had the best of both worlds, really. We had the men professors, we
had men in classes, but if you chose the right path – and yet, right here on this campus –
DA: Yeah. Do you feel that women, that opportunities for them have suffered because they’re
not separate? Or –

23

KH: Well, there was great guidance from the [women’s counseling society?]. I have nothing
(inaudible) what I have read. But they said that the counseling on this end, it’s better [than that
end?] [06:00]
DA: When you walk across campus today, what’s your sort of emotional reaction? You know,
across the green? How does it feel?

KH: You mean this one? Or (inaudible)?
DA: Either one. I mean, having lived here for four years in the ’30s, to walk around today, what
is your general reaction?
KH: (inaudible) I think you’re expecting to grow (inaudible). I mean, there hasn’t been [on this
hand?], but there hasn’t been much destruction. There’s been continuity. I’m looking, trying to
(inaudible) bowling alley in the gym.

DA: Oh really? (laughter)
KH: I used to bowl. That was (inaudible) recreation. I mean, just for pleasure, not for sport . It’s
probably long gone. [07:00]

DA: I have (inaudible).

KH: Does anybody (inaudible)?
DA: Oh, well, they have a lot of intramural sports, (inaudible). There’s no requirements for that,
but a lot of people are fitness buffs.
KH: (inaudible) Yeah, (inaudible). And I said, oh yeah. [I don’t know how you did?]. (inaudible)
But we had a good team. Some of us liked to (long inaudible). We came [awful close?].

24

DA: Yeah. (laughter) [08:00] Did you find yourself well prepared academically? Was the work
challenging?

KH: Yes, the work was challenging. The worst thing is (inaudible). In high school, my French
was very (inaudible). We knew our grammar very well. We could read very well. But speaking
was terrible (long inaudible) probably [in the?] standard French [way?], but (inaudible). We had
[a long night?], taken very well, (inaudible). I had a good record in French, but not for speaking.
They didn’t have to emphasize speaking. Now they start the children with speaking rather than
reading or grammar. [09:00]

DA: But all in all, it was very swift (long inaudible).

KH: (inaudible)

DA: Oh, like what?
KH: Well, sometimes, like, they’d be [keep track of us?], and sometimes they wouldn’t. (long
inaudible) Plus, the writing. You know, we used to write, but, you know, one every week, and
sometimes the assignment [touches us?] when we [have other assignments we have to keep up
with?]. Other times, (inaudible). You know, it’s even [worse?]. (inaudible) having trouble
(inaudible).

DA: Did you feel a lot of pressure from parents and teachers to do really well? Or was it mostly
from yourself? [10:00] Was it very competitive? Were people conscious of other girls’ grades?
KH: I don’t think we were. For the most part, I think we were not as interested (very long
inaudible).

DA: You mentioned for reading project [part of the?] (inaudible), the class.

KH: Pembroke Reading.
25

DA: Yeah, but you just [happen to?] coordinate Alumnae, [11:00] to keep your classmates
(inaudible). How else were you involved (inaudible)?
KH: (inaudible) And it’s still linked (inaudible) understand, and the readings [are still
potential?].

DA: Yeah. What do those do?

KH: Well, Pembroke (long inaudible).
DA: So it’s (inaudible)?

KH: It was sometimes (inaudible).

DA: Yeah. (inaudible) difference.
KH: Yeah. That type of [a low?]. That public a range of age, I don’t think there was anybody
young in the readings. But anybody beyond middle age was more likely to be (inaudible) than
the Pembroke [club itself?] (inaudible). [12:00] And (inaudible).
DA: Oh, I didn’t know that. But what do you do with the class (inaudible)?
KH: Well, we coordinate it, we’re sending out notices. And (long inaudible) 56 million this year.
And it takes plenty (inaudible). Every class, every class (inaudible). But there are a very few
classes (inaudible), but then mostly (inaudible).

DA: Oh yeah. [13:00]
KH: Now I’m about to have my fiftieth reunion.

26

DA: Oh, that’s exciting (inaudible).
KH: [In June?]. And our [forty fifth?] for men (inaudible). And it’s a very great time, (inaudible).

DA: Really? (laughter)

KH: (inaudible) [some conversation?]. (inaudible)
DA: So what’ll happen at the reunion (inaudible)?

KH: At the reunion. Friday night, there was an all-house event (inaudible).

DA: Oh no. (laughter)

KH: Beautiful (inaudible). And Saturday, but so Friday night, [14:00] (inaudible) prime example.
And they didn’t have it, presumably rain or shine. Last (inaudible), terrible rain, rain, and cold
(inaudible). And Saturday, there’d be luncheons and Saturday night we’d go home..

DA: Does a lot of your class show up for reunions?

KH: Yeah, about half.

DA: Have you kept in touch with a lot of women?

KH: Yes.

DA: What are people generally like after Pembroke?

KH: Probably married. And now probably all of them are retired.

DA: Oh yes. Are a lot of them in fairly close contact with the school?
27

KH: No, I don’t think they’re in close contact (inaudible). They come back for reunions, and
they (inaudible). [15:00] If they were (inaudible) right away, they would (inaudible). But if there
was [paint in the way?] and our backs to the wall, they don’t keep close contact. But they do
give, (inaudible) 58 percent, (inaudible).

DA: What changes do they most talk about? (inaudible)

KH: Well, (inaudible). Changes to co-ed living.
DA: Are most people –
KH: I couldn’t say. I don’t know. But there’s a lot of talk (inaudible)

DA: Yeah. How do people generally react, alumni, to other issues that [16:00] seem like big
issues on campus now? The ones that, do you at all read the Brown Daily Herald?
KH: No, I don’t read the Brown Daily Herald. But Brown Alumni Magazine keeps us pretty well
informed.

DA: Yeah. Well, the main things that have been going around campus this semester have been a
lot of criticism of the fraternities and talk about racism and prejudice - I don’t know, the new
science building.
KH: Well I hadn’t heard anything for or against the science building. But the racism and the
fraternities. Both of those (inaudible).

DA: Are you generally concerned?

28

KH: Concerned, but some of the racism, I think (long inaudible). [17:00] And sometimes,
(inaudible) black people [who are in debt?]. And (inaudible). They’re not empathetic. The line
should be (inaudible). I mean, other than that, it is. And I’m saying, hey, (inaudible).
DA: Yeah, that’s the way a lot of people feel too.
KH: But I’m sure they have reasons for complaint (inaudible). I think everything is (inaudible).
But I think some of (inaudible). They can approve of some of them. I don’t know who they are,
but there are (inaudible).

DA: Were the fraternities and sororities a big factor on campus?

KH: There were no sororities.

DA: Oh, there weren’t?

KH: No. There had been, and the first year [18:00] that they (inaudible), but the fraternities were
in houses in those days.

DA: Oh, off campus.
KH: Yes, up and down College Hill (long inaudible) along Waterman Street. And I didn’t
remember ever hearing (inaudible). Oh, they kept it to themselves. But now they’re right on the
campus, (inaudible).

DA: So you feel that was a mistake, that they moved on campus?
KH: I don’t know if it was a mistake. I think they put (inaudible) in trouble, (inaudible) thought
they should be in those houses. And of course, they did so, they were (inaudible). So then
(inaudible), but (inaudible). I know it’s (inaudible).

29

DA: People aren’t upset at the incongruous architecture or anything?
KH: [19:00] Oh, well yes, they are. The thing they’re building now, I can’t (inaudible), what is
that building there? Is that it?
DA: I don’t really know what that is.
KH: (long inaudible) But I like – I don’t care too much for the newer Pembroke (inaudible).

DA: No. I live in the one [in Tyler?]. (laughter)

KH: (inaudible) They used [to make changes?] (inaudible). I think it [tends to look better?]
(inaudible). Again, (inaudible).
DA: I’m trying to see how long it’s been.

KH: I think about an hour.
DA: Okay. Let’s see, [20:00] gives us some good time for something. So generally, I take it that
you regard your Pembroke experience as a highly valuable one?
KH: Yes, I do. I made many friends that I’ve kept. I think that [my life was] (inaudible).

DA: Yeah. Did you possibly hypothesize how it would have been if you went to a state
university and such?
KH: No. I was thinking more in terms of if I had –

DA: No college at all? Yeah.

KH: Yeah. (inaudible)
30

DA: You don’t think there was a big difference between Pembroke and, say, Smith or Wellesley.

KH: No. (inaudible) study describe wherever you need to go. And the things that we did here
were similar to the ones they did there (inaudible). [21:00] I have Pembroke (inaudible). And
they are (inaudible) right now. Well, (inaudible).
DA: Yeah, yeah. What do you think your life would have been like if you hadn’t attended
college at all?
KH: I don’t know. Probably saleswoman, or [telephone worker?]. I wouldn’t have been a
teacher, that’s for sure. (inaudible)

DA: So can you, to any extent, determine how your attitudes and views have been changed by
Pembroke? Or it’s sort of between (inaudible)?
KH: Well, I think - broaden, [22:00] I think (inaudible). I didn’t know many people at my
(inaudible) before I came to college (inaudible). I’ve known (very long inaudible).
DA: Yeah, so (overlapping dialogue; inaudible) – oh, sure, okay, I feel like a much more real
sense (inaudible). Thank you very much.
KH: You’re welcome.
