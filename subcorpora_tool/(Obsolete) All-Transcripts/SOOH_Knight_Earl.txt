 L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the Oklahoma State  University Library. Today is December 20, 2010, and I am in Stillwater,  Oklahoma, at the home of Earl Knight. I will be interviewing Earl today  as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History series of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. His wife Sue is also sitting  in with us,  along with his son-in-law, Wyatt Wilson . Thank you for  having me here today.  Would you tell me a little bit about your family and what your childhood  was like?  Well, I was born  September 18,  1928 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Both  parents were still married at the time, which is kind of rare now. We  lived there about six months after I was born, moved to Oklahoma City,  so my first memories are of Oklahoma City. And somewhere in there in  the early thirties, when I was about five years old, I think, my dad (this  was the heart of the Depression) lost his job. He was a cook, and he had  a very hard time getting work. The times were very hard. I can vaguely  remember standing in a soup line at least twice trying to get food, I  think, because my folks were too proud (laughs) to get in the soup line.  They would give me a bucket, and I would get in the soup line and get a  bucket of soup. I can remember that. Most of the time, we did furnish  our own food, but just a couple times, I guess Dad was really down, and  at times he could get a job working for the WPA  Works Progress  Administration . The only problem was you couldn   t work a whole week  at a time. You could only work like one day a week or two days a week,  and when you did that, you got a dollar a day, so you can just imagine  how hard it was in those days. We were living in a very poor section of  Oklahoma City.  He could only work part time because they were trying to hire as many  people as possible.  5  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  Yes. To get as many people at least a buck or two a week, honestly. A  dollar or two a week, you know. Sounds terrible now, but he was a hard  working person, so he had to have a job. He couldn   t stand being on  relief or anything like that. So when I was about six years of age, my dad  and mother separated, mostly because of the hard times. It was decided  that she would stay in Oklahoma City, take my sister who was two years  older than me, half-sister, and I don   t know why or what she was going  to do, but she had something lined up. My dad and I would go back to  the country where he came from and sharecrop with his dad.  That   s Hughes County.  Down in Hughes County. So we went back there, and my job was to do  chores on the farm, and my dad   s job was to put in the crops and so on  and so forth. My grandmother and grandfather were very old even then.  I was a skip generation child, you know. My dad   s first family was,  what, twenty-five, thirty years older than me. He was about fifty when I  was born. And my earliest memories of working down there would be  doing chores, water, firewood, helping clean around the house or  something like that. Dad did the farming and the cooking since he was a  cook. As far as I know, my grandmother and grandfather had no  assigned duties. (Laughs) We just tried to do everything. I started to  school at Moss in Hughes County, which is a rural school, first grade,  and I think I was exactly six years old. I can   t remember exactly when  we started to school. I really liked Moss School. I got right in with all  the little kids, you know. We rode the bus together, we went to school  together, had a very good teacher. I remember my first year I went to the  county meet and was the champion speller of Hughes County, first  grade. What an honor. At least, I thought it was. And that fall, they made  me a cotton sack out of a tow sack with a canvas bottom, threw it to me  and I hit the cotton fields with my dad. We picked cotton that fall for     And you were six?  I was six, yeah. Just past six. First cotton sack. And I wasn   t proud of it.  (Laughs) I did not like picking cotton. But I earned enough money that  fall to    Dad bought me a leather jacket and some overalls and shoes.  Of course, I don   t think I earned all that much, but anyway, I had to  earn, it was not my money. It was money to buy clothing with, and I did  get probably a few goodies out of it, but mostly just clothes. That   s what  you did in those days. Got my first pair of high top shoes so I could go  through the winter. I was all set for the winter. And then, end of story for  the first year. After that, that was the routine as long as we stayed with  Grandpa and Grandma was work the farm. Fall time, we   d pick cotton  for not only him, but everybody else we could go through. Earn money.  6  L. Wilson  E. Knight  As a consequence, we had money most of the time.  I do remember one time asking my dad for money to go to town. I  wanted to go to town with Granddad, and he dug in his pocket and he  said,    I   ve got ten cents.    He showed me his dime. He said,    That   s all  we   ve got until cotton picking time.    I remember that. Put me in a state  of shock, so I didn   t go to town. That went on until I was almost nine  years old, and that fall we decided to join my uncle, Uncle Jim, and his  family, which was a fairly large family, and we would go to California.  So we put the mattress on top of one of the cars, we had a trailer pull  behind another. It wasn   t all our stuff, of course, it was theirs, most of it,  and they had two cars and a T-model. We headed down through  southwestern Oklahoma, south-central Oklahoma to Texas. I had an aunt  living in Texas and we went over and picked some cotton on her farm,  then we moved on down. Well, actually, we pulled bolls. It was the first  time I   d ever been in a cotton patch where you pulled bolls, because they  had better gins in Texas than they did in Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, they  would only process picked cotton at that time, at least where I was. But I  went down to Texas and I pulled two hundred pounds of bolls on my  ninth birthday, and I was so proud. Two hundred pounds.  The family then moved on down to the Rio Grande River. Picked cotton  all the way up to Texas and moved over into New Mexico where they  had irrigated cotton. Dad and I slept in our cotton sacks at night because  there wasn   t any room on the mattresses with the rest of the family.  (Laughs) And we rode the back end of that T-model all the way to  Arizona. Went over the last mountain range, I guess it   s the Continental  Divide. The river bottom over there, some famous river, I cannot  remember the name of the river. I can see it on a map. Every once in a  while, I look. And there   s huge, huge ranches over there that, no, they  have cattle, but they had cotton, irrigated cotton, a big thing. Huge  cotton fields. Rows would be a mile long, which is eternity for a nine-year-  old picking cotton. Irrigated cotton, and we picked cotton there. My  dad was a very hard worker, and he could pick a lot of cotton, but he  really got ill. There   s something over there he was very allergic to, I  guess, and he had asthma already, and he just got really deathly ill. So,  we bought a ticket and came home. We didn   t make it to California on  that go-round. Well, the rest of the family went on to California.  You came home on the train?  Bus. We did come back to that farm. And we did work the farm a little  while, but Dad was determined to get to California. So we did head back  out, but this time we rode a bus. Found out how easy that was, and with  whatever monies we had, he bought bus tickets. We headed for  California on the bus, and we made it to California. And I guess that   s  7  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  when Grandpa sold his farm and went to live with Aunt Lou.  Do you remember your dad talking about why he wanted to go to  California?  Well, he had a son out there that was my older brother, who was thirty-five  years old, I   m sure. He   d invited us to come on out and share his  apartment with him, and he lived in downtown Los Angeles on South  Flower Street, I remember that. So we moved out there. Dad   s just  determined. He still thought he could do well, you know, if he could just  get back in the cooking line. He   d been a cook for many a year. We got  out there and it was terrible times out there. I enrolled in school and  started to school there, and doggone it, if I remember right, Dad had a  hard time finding work. When he did, it was just eeking out, you know,  like working for our food and maybe a small wage or something like  that. Times were just really bad, and his health was not good. He really  shouldn   t have been working at all, and Los Angeles at that time was a  horrible place to live unless you were wealthy and could live on the  beach or something, because the air was so bad. You   d go in those  tunnels they had out there and sometimes you   d just almost die before  you could get out of them it was so bad. So his asthma just got worse  and worse, and I   d went to school out there and made friends and was  doing alright, I guess, but I was prowling the streets. Wasn   t anything  else for me to do after school was over. Dad didn   t like that, and I don   t  blame him. (Laughs) So, he had gone down to get a physical, because he  was in such bad health, and the doctor finding out of our circumstances,  I guess, turned us in to the Health Department or something down there.  They bought us a ticket and sent us home. They didn   t want to put up  with us, I imagine.  Do you remember being around many other Oklahomans in California?  Other than my brother? No, but this old apartment that we lived in was a  place where these extras, Hollywood extra types lived. Quite a few of  them lived in this old apartment  building . It was kind of a respectable  place, you know, and they   d earned money enough that they could live.  We were living in the basement of it, so I don   t think our quarters were  quite as nice. But I got to know several of these old Hollywood extras. I  saw them later in the movies, some of them. You know, they were the  thugs and the cowboys, that kind of stuff.  Do you remember which movies?  Westerns. That   s where I   d see them. That was the only movies I   d go  to, anyway. But they were just extras, and I   d recognize them. One in  particular was a great big fellow, just homely as a mud fence, you know.  8  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  He   d always play a villain, so I could spot him right away. And I don   t  have a clue what their names were.  Do you remember being discriminated against any, being Oklahoman?  Okies, you mean?  Yes.  Oh, I heard a little Okie talk once in a while, but I was young, and it  didn   t  have much effect on me . I thought I was better than they were,  to be honest with you. Kind of like Will Rogers says, all the Okies going  to California raised the IQ of both states. (Laughs) But I do remember  going to this nice school, and I was not used to going to an integrated  school, but they had black kids and Chinese kids and Japanese kids, as  well as the white kids. And I do remember, speaking of discrimination,  while we were in class one day, the authorities came and got all the  Japanese kids out, just pulled them out of school. Everybody was  bawling and squalling, the kids were squalling, the teachers were crying  and madder than hornets, but it was some new policy that they were  going to take those Japanese children (this is before the war started) and  put them in different schools, separate schools, as I understood. I get  crossed up in history, maybe, but that   s the way we kids understood it.  They were going to put them  somewhere else . Everybody was upset  about it, but as far as I know, they never pulled Okies out and did that to  them.  But I do remember, we had benches, four wide benches, and they were  just like regular little school desks as far as you   re concerned. There was  an ink well and you had your own little slot underneath it, but they were  four wide. On my bench there was me and a little Japanese girl and a  little black girl, and a boy, I don   t know, a white boy I think. I don   t  remember very well. We just didn   t look at it that way, you know. So  that   s something you never would have seen in Oklahoma. But anyway,  they bought us a train ticket and sent us home.  How old were you then?  We were there six months, I believe, right at six months. I came home  and started back to school at Moss, and I was the only human being  going into my classes that had even been out of Hughes County, (laughs)  much less been to California, so I was quite a hero. I really enjoyed the  next two years. We sharecropped with my aunt and uncle for one year,  then we sharecropped with my uncle   s father, you know, uncle-in-law.  It   s just us three bachelors at his place, and we loved it. We had a good  time. My dad did the cooking and the farming, and that old Mr.  9  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  Hawkins, he was an old man then, in his eighties, I think, seventies or  eighties. Very old man. Born probably about the Civil War era. A very  funny old boy. That was about a year and a half or so of my life I really  enjoyed.  Were you in touch with your mother any throughout that process?  I did not see her. I had seen her maybe twice before we went to  California. I had not seen her again after we   d gotten back. I had yet to  see her. I did get to see her later on, but you understand, that was a  hundred miles in gas and she just couldn   t get down there very often,  I   m sure. She would   ve come more often. Anyway, we were there, and  at the time I was in the fifth grade, we moved to Lamar to live with my  grandfather and grandmother again. Grandpa was kind of hard to live  with, and he was living with his oldest daughter, some of the nicest  people in the whole world. I always thought of my granddad as one of  the meanest men alive. And he wasn   t, but that   s the way I thought of  him. But anyway, he wanted us to come back.  I   m sure the fact that you were a brat has something to do with it.  (Laughter)  Yeah, I was probably the meanest brat alive. He couldn   t get a ride. He  had been a successful businessman in cotton during World War I, and  made quite a bit of money and had bought his farm outright, you know.  He   d paid for it, so he had lived well. He was an old tightwad,  skinflint   he had to be in those days. I know that, but anyway, long,  long, early on in our association he had earned my disfavor because he  wouldn   t give me any money. (Laughs) That   s the whole family strung  out across there. (Gesturing to a photo)  This is his dad.  That   s long before I was born.  So those were the younger brothers.  Twenty years before I was born. But anyway, he did want us to come  down because my grandmother couldn   t run a house anymore. She was  in her eighties, I guess, by then, and so we moved to Lamar, a nice little  bitty town over on the eastern end of Hughes County, and I started at  Lamar School in the fifth grade. Went through the sixth, and for two  years or so, we lived in Lamar, and I loved it. I was one happy kid. I had  good buddies. Had fought my way into my slot at public school. You  talk about bullies, (laughs) so that everybody knew their place, and I  wasn   t in the bottom echelon or anything, so I was happy. I was not a  10  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  guy looking for trouble. But once you got your place, in those days, in  school, life was good. Real intense bullying like you hear of today, they  didn   t have. You just had to wrestle and fight your way to wherever your  slot was, then you got along pretty good. That seemed to be  the case,   anyway. I really enjoyed school.  We had a good baseball team. I didn   t get on it. I wasn   t old enough to  get on it, but I had started on it when we moved. So I had a good time.  Dad, though, was wanting to move. He   s always ambitious, wanting to  do  more . Things were    The war started in Europe. Not in the United  States, and people started looking for jobs, finding jobs. The Depression  did not end. Roosevelt did not end that Depression. The war ended the  Depression. We had as many unemployed in 1939 when the war started  in Europe as we had in 1933 when the Depression started. I   m not  knocking the President. It   s just his programs didn   t work any better  than Mr. Obama   s does, you know. (Laughs) And Dad wanted to get  back in Oklahoma City, and, of course, I wanted to go because my  mother lived up there, and I   d only seen her, now, if I imagine, about  four times all the time that we were away. And I sure did want to see  her.  So, when Grandpa got so bad off that he knew he was going to have to  be taken care of, and he decided to go back and give my Aunt Lou   s   place  a try again, (laughs) and sell the house, we headed out again.  Went to Oklahoma City. Went to the bad, same slums we came from  before, but my dad was finding work, and, you know, it wasn   t too bad.  But I skipped the rest of the seventh grade. I   d started the seventh grade,  but I skipped it. Got to  Oklahoma City , and I started the eighth grade  the next year at this real tough junior high that the clientele call Franklin  Reform School. It was in the toughest part of Oklahoma City, down on  Reno. I had to either walk a mile or so to school, or I could ride a street  car if we had money, and by then Dad was making fairly good money.  Was he working in a kitchen?  No. To be honest with you, he was working in a beer joint. (Laughs)  Running that. He was actually managing a beer joint for this bootlegger,  a well-known bootlegger in Oklahoma City named George something or  other, who always carried a .45 pistol and (laughs) took care of himself  and everybody else who got in the way. He was a gangster, in other  words. But he owned this fairly nice beer joint for the times, and Dad  had to stay over there. I stayed in our little old house     Shack.  Shack is a better word. And even though I was only thirteen years old, I  11  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  L. Wilson  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  stayed by myself during the week, and he   d come home on weekends,  one day.  So you couldn   t visit him at the beer joint.  No, he wouldn   t let me in the beer joint. Pretty rough in there. (Laughs)  But he had a fairly nice  place . He did let me see his apartment over  there, and it was nice. They had electric lights and gas and everything.  Of course, being a good cook, you know, he had good food. And I was  over there batching, thirteen, fourteen, those two years. (Laughs) I   m not  eating quite as well as he was. We   d put canvas on the floor. Sue thinks  that was something. We didn   t have carpet. We had canvas over dirt. It  was a nice floor, though. Dad knew how to do things. If you can imagine  double layer canvas over dirt, hard packed dirt.  Shanty Town is what the area of Oklahoma City was called.  Shanty Town?  I still remember.  You don   t know that.  Well, yes I do.  Hey kid, I lived a lot of places you wouldn   t think about living. (Laughs)  I don   t remember very many very nice ones.  I can just remember my Uncle Bill years later, who was some kind of a  police officer with Phillips Petroleum, he was always talking about  things going on down there in Shanty Town.  Yeah.  And then later (laughs) we find out if I   d known     One thing we didn   t do when we lived in this area she   s talking about,  and I lived there until I joined the Marines. By then, by the way, I had  already decided I was going to be a Marine, as soon as I could get in. I  just knew the war would be over before I could get in. I had some pretty  rough compadres there in school, you know. We didn   t steal from each  other. People in our hovels down there did not steal from each other, and  I don   t remember much fighting or anything else down there. And yet,  one of my buddies from that era is doing life in McAlester, at least the  last I heard, for murder. Another one, who is fairly honest, has already  done his time last time I saw him, in McAlester, and was never going to  12  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  go back, he told me. And a third one was in McAlester for dope dealing.  This was what you could expect coming from that era, you know, and  that place. But we didn   t steal from each other. We didn   t fight each  other. So it was a calm and peaceful place, but I   d hate to have been  around us, you know. (Laughs) Anywhere outside of the environs that  we lived in, because it was a pretty rough bunch. But my job, if I was  going to earn money other than what Dad would give me, I was very  engrossed in selling whiskey bottles. See, this was the bootlegging day,  and there were whiskey bottles that were    I know this doesn   t sound  very nice, but the kids, not just in our area, but elsewhere, if you found  these whiskey bottles you could sell them for a nickel, three cents to a  nickel or a dime a piece, and that was money in those days.  To the bootleggers.  To the bootleggers, and the bootleggers were well known. Most of them  were very peaceful people, you know. They just sold whiskey. Made it  and sold whiskey, too. But they had to bottle it, and they would not  bottle bond bottles. In other words, if you go buy your Old Crow, it said,     Bottled in Bond.    That bottle could not be used again. If you did, the  Feds would get a hold of you. So we were told you never try to sell those  bottles. You sell the plain whiskey bottles that don   t have anything  written on them. And they were worth good money, at least to us. So a  lot of my spending money came from that kind of stuff. I did not smoke,  didn   t want to. I didn   t drink, didn   t want to. I made good grades in  school, in high school, junior high and high school, and I stayed out of  trouble. I really did. Never stole anything my whole life, I don   t think.  At least knowingly, you know. (Laughter) Well, I don   t think I did.  So, at what point did you join the Marines?  Seventeen, on my birthday. (Laughs) Well, I   d already   I   ll tell you  what. Let me get into this. I went to Franklin Junior High, and on my  graduation year from junior high (that would be the ninth grade in those  days) I got a job taking care of the school grounds during vacation,  which was a fairly good job. I don   t remember what I made. You   d  laugh at it now, but at the time it wasn   t bad wages for a kid my age.  And the next year, after I started to school, I went to work at Tinker Air  Field. I think I was fifteen, going on sixteen, and a regular employee,  civil service. They would take you at wartime. You couldn   t walk down  the streets in those days without people asking you if you wanted a job. I  mean, you know, grocery stores needed you to deliver, things like that. I  always had a job. Made good money, as far as I was concerned. Worked  at Tinker Field right alongside people of all ages, doing the same work.  And when I went to Central High School, I made very good grades with  the exception of electricity. I got into something there I didn   t like. I  13  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  enjoyed high school. I had to get there by myself. I   d come home by  myself. I ate a lot of canned soup and stuff like that. (Laughs) I   m sure  my diet wasn   t the best, but we had money. Dad would make really good  wages for the time over there running   he actually managed that beer  joint. I don   t know what they call those places anymore. And he tried to  keep law and order over there.  One time, and all these big old truck drivers and other thugs went there,  and it was kind of a hard job. I often times hoped that nothing happened  to him before he   d come home for the weekend. And he did have some  scary times over there, but Mr. Jones, who was a well-known gangster,  made sure that they left him alone. They got in a fight once and had my  dad down on the floor and were really stomping on him. Then old Jones  came in the door with his .45 drawn and blew a few holes in the ceiling  and sent them running. (Laughs) No more trouble. Forty-five automatic.  Sounds like a good friend to have.  He was a very good friend. He was good to me. He was nice to me, and I  don   t know what his other meannesses was, but I heard he   d killed  people and been in McAlester and all this and that. But that was a hard  racket he was in over there.  Did you say his name was George Jones?  I don   t know whether his last name was Jones, but it just came to mind.  George, for sure. He had one arm that he had gotten shot off practically,  you know, he was in just a brace he carried then. And so he was one-armed,  and I didn   t blame him for carrying a .45 around all the time, but  the police never questioned him about it. He never mistreated Dad, and  he certainly never mistreated me. I learned from people like him. Some  of the big old truck drivers got to like Dad and they   d come by once in a  while, give him a ride over to work or something just knowing he  needed it. He   d have to walk about two miles to get to work. And he was  getting up in years then. They always treated me right. And the  bootleggers treated us nice too, as long as we were honest with the  bottles. (Laughs) That was quite a growing up. Sounds worse than it  was, because Dad always made sure I had money to buy food with, you  know, stocked us up. But I had to live by myself. My mother lived right  over a ways, but I   m not going to get into my mother and her problems.  (Laughter)  On my seventeenth birthday, I went down and joined, signed up. They  told me that I would have to go back home and get my dad   s approval. I  went home. Dad knew I was going to do it anyway, so he signed, and on  the eighteenth  of September  I started processing. On the twentieth, I  14  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  was sworn in. And on the twenty-first  of September 1945 , I was well  on my way to San Diego.  Wow.  I was seventeen years, and three or four days old. I never looked back,  because number one, I had seen a Marine Corps movie when I was a kid,  about thirteen or fourteen, that I would consider incredibly corny now,  but oh, it just inspired me. I was going to be a Marine.  What was it?  I can   t remember, but it was a serial. They used to have serials, and this  Sergeant something-something of the Marines, you know, I can  remember him holding that arm up at forty-five and yelling,    Charge      And I was ready to go. (Laughs) I was about thirteen, I think. I cannot  remember. I saw that movie, though, later on in years. I made an effort  to find it. It was a serial, and this was one episode in this serial, which  was a three or four episode serial, and I thought it was incredibly corny.  But that just set me on the course. I was going to be a Marine. Kind of  like old Wyatt over there, I was determined. But I didn   t want to be an  officer, unlike Wyatt. I wanted to be what I had admired, you know,  which were Sergeants. I wanted to be a Sergeant. I wanted to have my  own squad.  I went to San Diego amongst a bunch of other kids going there. Most of  them were draftees. I was one of the few volunteers. They   d just started  taking volunteers again. You know, four year hitches. Before that, if you  volunteered that was alright, but it was for the duration and six months  minimum. And they were so glad to see regulars, I do remember. That   s  later on when we got out of boot camp. We   d go to a station, you know,  and the commanding officers greeted the new arrivals.    Oh     He was  just so proud that we were regulars. All those old-time Marines wanting  to be back on volunteer, all volunteer, so bad. San Diego, yellow shoes,  yelling and screaming, the whole thing, just like they do in the movies. I  had seen Marine movies, knew what I was going to get into basically,  and the base looked just like it did in the movies. I couldn   t get over it. I  got out and went into the arcade there along the berm there.  Speaking to  Wyatt:  You   ll learn one of these days, San Diego, very, very much  history there. That   s Hollywood Marina all the way through there. It was  so much like what I expected that I got through fairly good. Didn   t get  beat up. Maybe you   ll see the different half. (Laughs) But anyway, I had  a lot of experiences there, but on the whole, they were just fine.  How long were you in San Diego?  15  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  W. Wilson  E. Knight  Well, it took us in those days ten actual weeks to get through boot camp.  Twelve weeks including getting in, getting assigned to the next platoon  and stuff like that. So on the whole, I was there about twelve weeks.  Then they gave me leave to come home. I had, I think it was two weeks,  but I don   t remember. Then I took a train back to San Diego and  reported in at Miramar Marine Air Station. I don   t know whether it   s  still there or not. I didn   t want to go, but I had been assigned to air. I  wanted to go infantry, and I told them so, but they said,    Yeah, but it  shows right here that you worked at an air field.     Mowing lawns at the air field. (Laughs)     We can use your experience in the air field.    (Laughs) I said,    I mowed  lawns and built fence.    He said,    I don   t care.    Anyway, I had to go into  the Marine airway. And while there at Miramar, just on general duty,  one of them, a brand new baby carrier was assigned to the Marines, and  I was assigned to that carrier, USS Mindoro. And at that time, we were  the first to board. A Marine squadron was formed and put on that, and I  became a seagoing Marine whether I wanted to or not. I promptly got  sea sick the first day on board. (Laughs) I always got sea sick. I told  somebody,    I   ve been on fourteen different naval vessels and I was sea  sick on fourteen different naval vessels.    But I got over it. Each time I   d  get over it, then I   d be off a while and I   d have to go back and go  through the whole thing again. Our squadron was in training and we  were the first time, I think, that big old Corsair fighters, TBMs, and I   ve  forgotten what else was    It seemed like there   s yet another type of  plane on them, but the big old TBM torpedo bomber.  What was your job on the baby carrier?  I was assigned to plane handler. I wore a certain color. I think it was  green or red. I don   t remember. You know, you put on that vest and you  wore it all the time on deck. I liked my job. I think it was the best job on  the carrier. If you   ve got to be on a carrier, it was a good job. We were  out on the deck, you were working the deck. It was dangerous, but you  got to see all the excitement, you know. Like I say, that was the first  time, I think, that they   d ever assigned a Marine squadron aboard the  carrier. Most of the pilots were veterans, but they had a hard time  learning to land those Corsairs on that little carrier. They were a small  carrier, about five hundred foot deck on them. And we had some  crashes. It was kind of an exciting tour of duty.  Our cruise took us through the Panama Canal and up through the  Caribbean and so on. Finally landed over in Norfolk, Virginia, and I  went from there to Cherry Point, North Carolina. That   s where the  squadron went. Stayed there a little while, they put us back on the train,  16  W. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  and headed for the west coast again. Took us five days to get there on  the troop train made out of old box cars that they had built into, just  rebuilt them to make troop carriers out of them. Got to San Diego and  they assigned us back to Miramar, and then from Miramar, they shipped  us to Hawaii, and I joined the squadron in Hawaii. They tried me on  everything there. They tried to make a mechanic out of me. I didn   t want  to be a mechanic. They tried to make an office pinkie out of me. I didn   t  want to be an office pinkie. So I wound up on guard duty, which is what  I liked. I like guard duty, field duty, and of course, you also got mess  duty. You know, the mess duty then was thirty days at a whack. I mean,  you practically were the cook when you got through your mess duty. But  I took guard duty detachment and mess duty detachment and my bull  gang. I finally wound up with my own bull gang.  Speaking to Wyatt:   You know what a bull gang is, don   t you?  Will you define bull gang?  Well, my particular one was a truck, three hands, and we picked up all  the garbage and trash around the base. Great job if you liked being just a  jack-of-all-trades, which is what I was developing into. And later on, I  became a maintenance man, took care of the headquarters, buildings and  all that. Just anything to get out of being a mechanic, which I did not  wish to be. And they didn   t have any. They at first had told me when I  got into that that perhaps I could become a gunner. That sounded good,  but they quit manning those positions. They didn   t have     Was the war over by this time?  Yes, and the war was over, and so after six months or so in Hawaii, I  went to China. I volunteered for China duty with First Marine Air Wing  over there, which was attached to the First Marine division over there. I  was sent to Beijing, China. And I liked that duty real well. I was in the  guard detachment at the air base, and that   s where I wanted to be. We  were over there maybe six months, I don   t remember, and the Chinese  Chiang Kai-shek   s boys were fighting the Communists. Needless to say,  we were taking sides with Chiang Kai-shek. We weren   t supposed to be  officially, but we were. And there were some skirmishes fought over  there if you know your Marine Corps history. We had a few skirmishes,  and my position at the air base was guarding that air dump, which was  not only all of our ammo and bombs and so on for the planes, but we had  Japanese equipment and everything that was left over. We were  guarding that whole thing, and the Communists sure did want it. And  next door to us they had a Chinese boot camp, where they were training  Chinese army recruits, and we were having a hand in their training. Not  me personally, but the Marines were. So we met those guys later in  China, over in Korea. Complete with the Thompson .45 submachine  17  S. Knight  E. Knight  guns, we   d get in on everything else. Well trained people.  Your eighteenth birthday.  Was in China, and I can   t remember. What else should I say about  China? My other job as a guard detachment, gate, patrolling. I had post  number two, which was the ammo dump, and I enjoyed it. It was a lot of  excitement going on around there, you know. Had a few problems out at  the posts, and then we would ride shotgun into town. No truck or vehicle  left the base without armed guards, and I got quite a few runs into  Beijing. Peiping we called it. It was Peiping then. Then it went to  Peking, then it went to Beijing. It was a pretty exciting tour. They had  lots of executions going on all the time over there and things like that.  The Commies would, three times (and mind you now, I   m not talking  about me personally, because you had to be on that detachment) while I  was there one of our planes would go down somewhere out there and  boy, it was an armed expedition to go out and get them. It was exciting.  You never knew when you were going to be on one of those, and you  never knew when you went into town whether you were going to get  shot at or not. You never knew when you were on guard duty whether  you were going to get shot at or not, because those gooks, they just shoot  out there. I don   t know whether they   d be shooting at you or not, but I   d  be out there in that post,    Ping     you know. If it got too close, you were  supposed to call the guard. And you had a telephone to call the guard  detachment. But if you get to the telephone, you were standing there  under a bright light. That was the only bright light out there. Otherwise  the ammo dump was black. Just pitch black. But if you had to go to that  telephone and call in, you   d have to go stand under that stupid light.  Well, if you just heard a few rounds in your direction, you didn   t want to  go stand under that stupid light. (Laughs) I remember that as the most  harrowing thing I did out there on that duty. But one night, and it was  kind of funny, I was standing guard out there and low and behold there  was a little dirt road running up through the ammo dump where the  trucks come and get the ammo. They   d give you a carbine, and they   d  give you one clip ammunition. Now don   t tell me    I don   t understand.  This is the Marine Corps. One clip. Fifteen round clip, in those days.  And I   d say,    Well why not two or three clips? It   s kind of scary out  there.       Don   t give me that. You get one clip. It says right there in the  instructions.     Well, I was standing there and on this road. I heard this vehicle grinding  its way down this road, coming into my dump, which was not permitted.  Nothing is permitted after dark. So I braced myself, standing out in the  dark, got behind something, waited until it got real close and yelled,  18     Halt. Who   s there?    That stupid car kept coming. I   d yell,    Halt   Who   s there?    you know. About that time the Chinese must have  understood. They had a Chinaman driving, and he stopped and he said,     Army       They can   t pronounce an    L,    kind of like the Japanese.     Army colonel    or something like that. I couldn   t understand him. And I  guessed, I thought,    Well, he must   ve said colonel.    I said,    Colonels,     (I could tell there was more than one)    Dismount from your vehicle and  advance into the headlights to be recognized.    We had words for  everything, you know. Nothing happened. He said,    Army colonel.     And so I hit the bolt on my carbine, which is already cocked anyway,  but I hit it again just for effect and said,    The colonels will advance into  the headlights     Man, those doors flew open. (Laughs)  But these army colonels had gotten lost. They didn   t know it, but I saved  their lives, because there   s a boot camp up there just a ways. Those guys  had machine guns. They   d fire all night. And these colonels popped out  of that car like jackrabbits, and man, they hit those headlights. And I  said, I wanted to ask them,    What in the devil are you doing here?    But I  said something to the effect of,    The colonels will identify themselves.     I   m trying to be formal about it, and they were full bird colonels. They  gave their names, and I said,    Sir, what are you doing here? This is a  restricted area. Nobody is permitted in this area after dark. You   re in an  ammo dump.    And come to find out they were just lost. They   d been  down on the base, visiting with the base commander and somehow had  taken a wrong turn and come out through here. If they   d gone on up the  road, there was a guy up there with a machine gun, you know. I think  he   d have killed them.  So anyway, I called ahead and took care of everything. But it was fun. I  certainly remember that. I thought they handled themselves rather well  considering where they were and what they were doing. But I just  remember being inspired to hit that bolt handle, you know, and man they  just flew out of there. (Laughs) You could tell these old boys had heard a  bolt handle fire before. (Laughs) Oh well, that   s an aside.  By the way, just the next day, I think it was, my relief heard a noise in  one of the buildings and went in there to look. We were supposed to  walk to the post, but it was so miserably dark and so scary out there  most guys would just find a hole and hide where they could see the area,  you know. But he did go look, and somebody just clobbered him, just  laid him out. When he struggled awake and called in, the whole base  flew out. We just knew that we were going to get hit, because some of  the bases did get hit out there by Commies. We were fighting  Communists before the Korean War, in China. There were casualties.  But we got out there and we searched the buildings, and whoever it was  was probably just kind of doing a recon to find out how well protected  19  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  this ammo dump was. And those base guys over on the other side, those  boot camp fellows, they just fired all the time. They just heard sounds. I  don   t know whether there really was a war going on. No battle stars,  though, not for China. Anyway, in September through December, it   s  getting hot over there. We were really getting in trouble, and they  decided to pull us out. January we left on the train headed for a seaport. I  can   t remember the name of it.  What year is this?  We   re now into    47. It was probably one of the coldest winters China  had ever had. It was eighteen below zero when we left that stupid base.  The train had no windows in it. Otherwise, it was open box cars. We   d  like to have froze to death on that stupid train. Boy, it was so miserably  cold you couldn   t believe it. You know, traveling through the  countryside, way below zero. Next day, we got to the coast where our  ship was waiting and the ocean was frozen up for several miles out. We  broke ice with that big old   well, we had a little modified seagoing tug  that was supposed to break ice for us, but it wasn   t heavy enough, so a  lot of times the transport had to break the ice because the tug wasn   t  heavy enough. It was a pretty big seagoing tug. We headed for Guam.  At Guam, it was a hundred and thirty  degrees  in the shade. (Laughs)  But it felt good for a day or two there. Stayed there a while and I got to  run, protect Japanese prisoners for a while, you know, a few days. Keep  us busy. I enjoyed that. They were a pretty good bunch of guys. They   d  finally decided the war was over, and they were coming down out of the  hills surrendering. They   d existed there with the Guamanese for ever  since 1944, when we  the US  took Guam. Thousands of them never  surrendered, you know, and they lived up there in those hills in the  caves. And people just kind of tolerated them as long as they didn   t do  anything too out of line. Anyway, did that, then from there we went to     I think we went to Midway. I don   t remember. I   ve been to all those  islands and I don   t remember all of them. Been to Kwajalein, Midway,  Johnston, Guam, and I don   t remember what else over there. Back to  Hawaii. Technically, I   m a veteran of World War II.  Where were you when the war ended, exactly? Do you remember?  Oklahoma City. The war did not end until following years.  That   s what I   m saying. Do you remember     I mean, I   m telling you, the war was actually over but until Truman  declared the end of the emergency, you were still in World War II. See,  China was actually a war zone.  20  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  So the war ended before you left the United States?  The war ended before I got in the Marines. I mean, the shooting. That   s  what I   ve been telling you, ever since I was thirteen, I was crying that  the dad burned war would be over before I could get in the Marines.  (Laughter)  Do you remember the first time you heard World War II had ended?  Yeah, we were all waiting for it to end. I mean, the whole country was. I  was really, really upset, you know, because I really had wanted to be a  part of that war. After all, you know, it had been going on ever since I  was a teenager, fourteen years old, something like that. But the war  ended in August, I think it was, of    45. The shooting stopped. The  Japanese asked for an armistice, you know. They asked, they  surrendered and they set up the thing, and then our war with Japan was  officially ended when they signed up on the battleship Missouri,  however long it took that to be set up. I don   t remember the date the  shooting stopped. But technically the war continued until that whole  mess was settled and Truman declared the war ended. I don   t remember  what they   seemed to me like that was a year later or something like  that. I just don   t remember.  So we   ll pick back up in Hawaii.  Ship came into Pearl Harbor again, and back to Miramar, and I stayed  there until my tour of duty was over and I went home. Only, and then I  think I was   yeah, I came back to Camp Pendleton. Wasn   t Camp  Pendleton, El Torro Air Base, now closed, and then from there I went to  Cherry Point, North Carolina, again, and I stayed there until my tour of  duty ended in 1949, I believe it was. I   d been in four full years because I  joined in    45. Then I went back to Oklahoma City and couldn   t make up  my mind what to do. I wound up, my first full time job was in a candy  factory making Christmas candies. I made Christmas candies. Really  good Christmas candies, too. They were really good. Not because of me,  I was just working there, but     What kind of candy?  Regular Christmas candies, like the ones with the little trees in the  middle, the hard candies. Then we made chocolate candies and all kinds  of stuff. I don   t remember what all, but I was working under an old boy  that had been in the Navy for about four or five years, and he was really  good at it, and it was for William   s Candy Company. It was in  Oklahoma City. Really hard work. Everything was big, everything was  21  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  heavy. I put on two or three inches on my chest. And then I decided to  go back to school. So I went to Hills Business University. I didn   t think I  could. I had lots of education time coming, but I thought,    Well, I can go  to Hills Business University, learn to be an accountant and be out  earning money in two years.    That   s where I met Sue.  Not then, though.  But not then. I went there and had a part time job, did this and that and  was doing real well in school. The first part I liked, but after a while I  realized that really, I didn   t want to be an accountant. But, by then, I was  well on my way. Had a part time job in accounting and all that. And the  war started. Well, I had in the interim joined the Marine Corps Reserve,  and I do not remember just when I went down and joined. I think it was  around October after I   d gotten out. I got out in September, October or  November. But I joined the Reserve for four years, and the dad burned  war started the next June and I wound up back in uniform. On the  twenty-third of July, they called us up and we shipped out by train back  to Camp Pendleton     And this is what year?  1950. And I remember coming in with these guys I   m with. I was in the  Twentieth Infantry Battalion. I made sure I was in the infantry this time.  The Oklahoma City Detachment boarded the train down in Oklahoma  City. I do not remember whether the Tulsa-Broken Arrow guys were  already on it or not. I cannot remember that. I just remember the train  trip out there. We got to Los Angeles and everything stopped for the  longest period it took us to get into Camp Pendleton. They say that there  was many, many miles of train backup to get into Pendleton. They were  calling up the Marine Corps to make a division. The whole Marine  Corps. We got in, went to Tent Camp Two or something like that, and  started training that very day. They issued us some kind of gear, you  know, whatever they could, and we hit the hills, started training. A week  or so later, we were gone. We were put on   how in the heck did we ship  out of there? I don   t even remember. Things were so chaotic. But I think  we went all the way down to San Diego, boarded a transport there. Let  me think on that a minute. I had come in from Hawaii into San Francisco  and was discharged. I think I had to go down the coast to discharge at  San Diego, where I started from.  But that   s on your first tour.  Yeah, on my first tour. So the second time when we boarded, I can   t  remember whether we went to San Francisco to ship out or not.  22  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  From the time you were called up to the time you got on board ship, how  much time was that?  You know, it wasn   t very long.  Two weeks?  About two weeks. We didn   t get much training. I mean, we were out in  the hills every day. I remember the first day, we went out and threw  grenades and started a fire at Camp Pendleton that burned off many  acres. The whole battalion then fell out, you know, did fire duty. But we  were really pushed to try to get out, get assigned to units, get assigned to  equipment. I was assigned to a fire team in Able Company, the First  Battalion. They pull me out of it, they started looking at the records, and  guess what? I had been in an air field. I had been in an air wing. They  were going to send me there, and I said,    You are not going to send me  there.    I was really mad. I was ready to fight. But, he said,    Well, it says  here that you were an AT assault in Oklahoma City, so we   ll put you in  that.    And I didn   t want that, but I took it. By then, this gunny sergeant  and I were not on good terms. He said,    Not only that, you   ll be a flame  thrower man.    And I voiced my objections to that. He said,    I don   t  want to know what   s got into you kids today,    or something like that. He  said,    You act like being assigned to flame thrower is suicide.    And I  thought,    Yes, it is. Everybody knows that.    (Laughs) But I just didn   t  want to go back as a flame thrower. I didn   t want to cook people off.  Fortunately, on the way over, they decided they weren   t going to use  flame throwers. I don   t know why, but they never did. We had them  with us, but they never used them. Anyway, I was put in an AT Assault  platoon, which I was very unhappy about.  Which you should define AT Assault.  Anti-tank assault. Anti-tank weapons, 3.5 -inch  rockets, flame throwers  and explosives. And if, say, your unit was in the assault, you would be  with the assaulting units. You would form a separate detachment in that  unit, and if they came across tanks or they came across pill boxes, your  job was to take them out, which turned out to be not too bad a job, but in  a full-scale war it is a suicidal deal. Might as well have a flame thrower  on your back, because they   re going to get you one way or the other. But  as it was, there were some tanks at the start of the fight, but after we  knocked out their tanks, you know, except for the occasional pill box or  something, it wasn   t too bad. They usually wound up carrying rifles and  going with the infantry. Where was I? Oh, we shipped out about two  weeks later after we got there, and I   m going to say we went to San  Francisco and shipped out, but I sure can   t remember. Because I went  under that bridge so many times by then.  23  S. Knight  E. Knight  We were on the ship three weeks, at least. Landed at Kobe, Japan. Got  out, got off, turned around, unloaded the ship completely, all right down  to the keel, then combat loaded it, which means you put everything  upside down in your ship. What was on the bottom usually goes back on  top. So it   s a combat loaded situation. All your other gear, your  permanent gear stays on the ship and you go off with a pack. While we  were there, we did have our ship. I think we had combat loaded it when  this typhoon hit Kobe, and it was a mean typhoon. We were in dock  here, this dock here and this dock here. (Gesturing) On this dock was our  ship. On this dock, right beside us, was another troop ship. And then the  whole thing was surrounded by sea wall in Kobe. The water started  coming over the sea wall. That shows how violent it was really blowing,  and the ships started drifting. The buildings, the roofs were taking off on  the dock, and we were all standing back under the steel looking out. I  had a watch, if I remember right, but anyway, the ship started blowing. It  was blowing us away from the dock. And we had every cable we had in  the ship between the, you know, tying us to the dock. And they start  popping. Now, we   re talking about these things, you know. Steel cables,  and also the hemp cables which are springier and don   t pop as fast as  those steel ones do. And the ship started blowing out.  Well, across from us, we were sitting there watching, and these poor old  Marines on that ship, which was going to get scrunched, they figured,  started unloading right in the middle of that typhoon. (Laughs) The  ramps went down and here they came out. They had to get in these  buildings, and the roofs were blowing off. It was not the time to be out,  you know. I really felt sorry for them, but we did wonder what was  going to happen if our ship scrunched. They tried to get the Japanese  tugs to come in and hold the ship to the dock. You see, you have these  high-sided troop ships. They   re huge vessels, you can imagine, and they  catch a lot of wind. And that wind was coming broadside. So the ship  started blowing over. Well, the Japs wouldn   t come in.  Smart folks.  The tugs just pretended not to hear us, I guess. We were bellowing on  the fog horns and everything else. They wouldn   t come in. So being a  naval vessel and lots of Marines and all that, they just unloaded our  LCVPs  Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel  that we were going to use  for landing. They put crews on those and hit the water. Turned those  LCPVs around, butted them up against the ship, and held it. Our own  LCVPs, until the storm passed. I thought that was really clever of that  captain, by the way, but it was also really hairy for the people in the  LCPVs, too. Little boats. But they held us against the dock until it was  over. So then we finished up, went over, by that time we knew we were  24  S. Knight  E. Knight  going to make a landing somewhere. They didn   t tell us when. We  headed out to sea, headed for Korea. After we got so far out, they told  us,    Here comes another typhoon     Fortunately, it raced ahead of us, but  we got it. You know, we got a lot of it. And so we went over toward  Korea in a really bad situation. I mean, the ship was just done. You can  imagine what those troop ships are like, and our quarters are right in the  bow of it, so when it went up, then it would go up and it would pause.  You take a deep breath, grab the bunk, and it falls about twenty feet or  thirty feet. Just a free fall. Hits down there and your teeth rattle and then  you roll over and start the whole thing over. It was a very funny cruise.  And I had watch on of course. I always had watch in bad weather, which  was pretty good because it   s fresh air up there and it ain   t fresh below  (laughs) after those guys lose their stomach.  Then the typhoon blew aside, and we came into this huge harbor. They  told us where we were, and the destroyers were in ahead of us, and they  cut loose first, if I remember right. And the boys were landing on  Wolmi-do.  Incheon  At Incheon. And they really were working it over, just like World War II  all over again. Then the cruisers came in, and the Battleship Missouri  was firing, but we didn   t know that at the time. It was so much noise we  couldn   t tell, and it was further out, anyway. And they worked and  worked and worked, and the guys took Wolmi-do real fast considering  there   s so much opposition, and then we landed. Well, we went out and  they had smoked up the area. It was so smoky you couldn   t believe it.  And the young Coast Guard people running the LCPVs got lost. Ours  did. And we had scaling ladders, big old long ladders and they   d have  hooks on the end, because we were coming up against the sea wall. It  wasn   t going to hit the beach, we were going to hit a sea wall, and we  were going to hit at a tide where there   d be about twelve feet between  the surface and the sea wall top. So we were expected to hook our  ladders up and go over the top, and it was crazy. It would have been  crazy if it had been real well held. It would have been a slaughter.  But going in, we got quite a bit of fire. Mortar, I think it was. I don   t  know. The shells would land out there and the water would go up in the  air and they   d be yelling up from the front there,    Keep your heads  down, keep your heads       Of course, everybody wanted to stick their  head up and look to see what   s going on. (Laughs) And there was some  machinegun fire, I think, because you could see the water dancing  around, but I wasn   t scared. I was just busy trying to see what   s going  on. Just like I had imagined it ought to be when I was a kid, looking at  the movies and the television, monotone news and all that. This is what I  25  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  wanted to do, you know. And boy, was it a noise. The noise was terrible.  Those destroyers and everything, this was not going to be Tarawa or Iwo  Jima even. They were going to get those gooks before we got scored.  And the airplanes. Everything is going, just like the movies.  So we hit our wall, up went the ladders, up we went over the top, one  little pillbox, two poor little old gooks that died instantly and never knew  what hit them, and there we sat, because on the other side were these  great big salt basins where they make salt.  So you   re on the wrong beach.  We were on the wrong beach. (Laughs) There in all that smoke and  everything, they had lost track of where they were, so we just angled off  and hit the wrong beach. So there we sat and watched the rest of the  landing the best we could.  The tide goes out.  Well, we were afraid of that, but the tide didn   t go out. It was going, and  sure enough, a guide boat or something came in to show us the way, and  we loaded back on our boats and went around. You   ve seen where  McArthur landed, that big old warehouse there in this area there? That  was where we landed. We got out and you could tell there had been a  fight. There was a dead Marine laying out there and a few holes in the  ground, and we went in just so far and the word came in to halt. We sat  down there by the side of that warehouse, then after a while there came  this big bellow. Somebody had a horn or something and he was  bellowing,    Fire in the hole  Fire in the hole     over and over again. It  got real quiet, and then the world ended. They blew up that sea wall, and  we were only about a block from it. Those great big old boulders were  going in every direction. They landed right out in front of us,  everywhere. When that guy yelled,    fire in the hole,    he meant it. The  idiots didn   t know we were there. They blew up the sea wall. That was  so McArthur could walk ashore, we were told. You know, he did his  famous walk in like he did at Luzon. He was a very egotistical person,  incredibly brave, I mean. In his youth had been incredibly brilliant, too,  but I think he was already suffering a little bit from old age.  Did you have interaction with him personally?  No. I did see him a little later than that. So we went on in ashore, and it  started to rain. Of course, it always rains in a combat zone, and they  were busily destroying the town, trying   what was left of the North  Koreans were trying, doing their best, and the Marines were busy killing  them out through there, you know, and the mess. It sounds brutal, but  26  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  that   s war. I   m not trying to say we were brutalizing anybody. You just  shot them. It was brutal.  We set up a line and waited until daylight because we didn   t know  where we were supposed to be. We were the lost ones. The next  morning, we formed up with our units and moved inland and along the  road where the tanks were knocked out. You   ve seen pictures if you   ve  seen Life magazine. We walked right by all that stuff. And we got just a  little ways inland, still following the assaulting unit. We were follow up.  We were sitting there on the road watching, and there was a disturbance  out there in the rice, in an area of the rice paddy where the weeds were  growing up, and we could see it all. There was a North Korean. Now  when I say    gook,    that   s Marine technology for the enemy, you  understand? I   m not running people down. That is an old term from the  1930s when the Marines were in the Caribbean fighting down there in  those islands, and they fought the gooks. That was their name, this tribe.  And of course, the Marines picked that up. That   s part of Marine Corps  history, now. And so we always called the enemy the    gooks.    I don   t  think they do that anymore, but we did. Bad, bad, I   m sure. It was not  meant as a term of endearment, but it   s kind of how we felt about them, I  guess. But they were the enemy during that time.  South Koreans were not gooks.  No. The North Koreans were the gooks.  North Koreans were gooks.  That   s just Marine terminology. The Japs were gooks, by the way,  because we just brought that in through the thirties. Where was I?  Moving along. You   re on your way to the assault.  Yes. There   s a disturbance. These three Marines were down there. We  could see the guy hiding in the grass, and it didn   t look like he was  armed. He was a Korean soldier.  To Wyatt:  And you take note,  because this is what you   re getting into today. These three guys, one of  them I know had to be a veteran of the Second  World  War because he  was staff sergeant, and these two young men that spread out were  approaching the area of high grass. They figured he must be there, and  they came up on him where they could see him. They were real close,  like you and me. They had weapons on him and they were calling for  him to surrender. I couldn   t hear. I know that   s what they were yelling,  you know. And he had kind of come up like this and he pulled a grenade  out of his clothes, pulled the pin and threw it, and he took all three of  them down. But on their way down, falling backwards, they riddled him.  27  W. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  And the gunnies yelled at us after that was over.    You saw what  happened.    You know.    If he   s got a weapon, or if you think he   s got a  weapon, you kill him right now.    They   re still following that directive.  Well, that was a lesson to us.  Well, we go on up the road a ways and sure enough, on my left, there  was movement. Old Sergeant Holloway told me to take a section, go up  there and find out who was in the ditch up there. There   s somebody in  the ditch. And I have felt bad about this ever since. I got up there and  there was one man in there, military age, a very fit looking individual,  and he was moving back and forth in that ditch, you know, trying to  keep out of sight. And I remember hollering at him, and old Holloway  come up behind me and I said,    He   s unarmed.    I could see that he  didn   t have a weapon, but I could also see that he was military. I said,    I  think I can take him prisoner.    He says,    Kill him.    I said,    I think I can  take him prisoner.    And he said,    No, you saw what happened earlier.  You kill him.    Well, he couldn   t understand English, he was scared, he  was running back and forth and all this and that. Well, he came running  back again and as he went by, Holloway yelled again,    Shoot him     and  I opened fire. Well, and then this kid beside me had an automatic carbine  and he opened fire. And we killed him. Well, I didn   t want to kill that  guy.  To Wyatt:  Would you have killed him? Come on Lieutenant, tell  me. You   re going to be directing these kids. I just wanted to ask you that  question. And I know I   m putting you on the spot. What would you have  done?  As of right now, no.  It   s always bothered me that I was under direct orders. Anyway, when  we searched him, we found he had loot in his pockets and so on. So we  know he   d been in the fight.  But he didn   t have a grenade or anything to throw.  But there was a lot of blood, guts, and ammunition around. There had  been a lot of them there. He had been left behind for some reason or  another, maybe to do whatever he was doing.  What do you mean when you say he had loot in his pockets?  He had a beautiful gold watch, now, this is a coolie type, you know, and  he had a huge roll of Korean currency. Things like that. That   s just  almost always a sign that they   ve been looting, because those soldiers  didn   t have any money. That watch was very expensive. I bet old  Holloway   s got it to this day. Anyway, I went on from that. My  conscience bothered me some on that, even though I was under orders.  28  We went on up through numerous things. Some stayed the night, had a  pretty hard night. Some mortar fire, some action.  The next morning, I wasn   t directly involved, but we did have a really  hard fight. Moved on and was heading for Yong Dong Po. Now, you   ve  heard of Yong Dong Po? I think even in the Marine Corps today, we  have really hard fights there. Outside of Yong Dong Po, I was bringing  up   I wasn   t in the front ranks, but there was battle all around us. Dead  Marine here and there, so on and so forth. Some mortar fire. Somebody  yelled,    They   re coming up from behind us     or something like that. So  I turned around and here come these young men. There was about one,  two, three, four, five, five or six of them. Young men running toward us  yelling, and again, this time, the gunny yelled,    Knight, take a section.  Go out, stop them. See what they are. If they   re armed, kill them      Well, I went out, and something about it just wasn   t right, and so I halted  them. My men held their fire, which I was real proud of, and the first  guy I searched had a grenade in his pocket. So I yelled back,    This guy   s  got a grenade in his pocket     Again came the booming call from back  there, I don   t know whether it was the gunny or the lieutenant or both.     Kill them  Kill them     But I wasn   t going to do what they   d done  before. So I took his grenade. There   s something about his smile, you  know, the way he   s looking, he wasn   t suicidal. He thought he was  talking to a friend. The other guys were stopped behind him and looking  a little apprehensive, young men, and they didn   t have military haircuts  on. They had longer hair. The gooks had short hair, and I took his  grenade and I said,    I   ve got his grenade, he   s disarmed.     Still the word was,    Kill them,    because nobody was shooting. It   s just  the kind of pressure you can be put under, and I didn   t shoot him. I said,     They   re disarmed. I   ve got them. There are no arms. They have no  arms.    It got kind of quiet, and about this time, this interpreter came  running up from behind me. He was Korean. Very intelligent man. He  just took one look at them, and he says,    They   re not military.    Then he  asked them a question. They turned out to be college kids, about your  age, that had run up into the mountains to get away from the North  Koreans, keep from being forced into the army. They had armed  themselves and were trying to fight back. They saw us coming and they  were just pig happy. So I was really glad I didn   t pull trigger on them.  But everybody was yelling,    Kill them, kill them     Because we   d seen  this laid out just like a movie, you know, before. And so that was one  thing I was really grateful for, but I always regretted the first guy. I  should have told Holloway where to go and gone down there and got  that guy, but I   d have had to tackle him or something, he was so scared.  But that   s always been on my mind.  29  We went on to Yong Dong Po, came on the bridge. They   d already had a  hard fight there. There   s a bridge crossing the river. River was running  into the Han River, the big river there. I got there and I told the gunny,     You know, ever since you   ve given me that 3.5, I haven   t fired a shot  with it. I   d like to fire it.    So I got down and even though there was  mortar round coming down here and there, I wired it up and fired it just  to make sure I knew what I was doing when it got time. I hit my target  across the riverbank. Got back up on the riverbank, getting ready to go  across the bank, and then we would go down in an area, a low area and  go up towards Yong Dong Po, and I knew there was going to be a fight.  I could hear the shooting. And besides that, there   s dead people around,  all that.  Along the way there was some blood and stuff there. I picked up a Bolt  Action Springfield. Believe it or not, an    03  1903  complete with  bandoliers. Apparently, the South Koreans had been there, and some had  been killed. There was a lot of blood around, but I picked that rifle up. I  didn   t have a rifle at the time. I had a .45 and ammo for that dad burned  rocket launcher.  Then we were waiting and then the word came,    Move out. We   ve got to  cross the bridge.    And I was going to lead the way. Well, the bridge had  been blown out, and all the bedding from the middle forward, there   s no  bridge. And all you could walk on was this beam, you know. Bridges  have beams about that wide. Thirty, thirty-five feet down was the river,  deep river, looked like, and I was loaded to sixty pounds of gear, you  know, and I was scared of heights to start with. But anyway, I had to  watch that bridge, kneel down, and believe it or not, they picked up  mortar fire on either side of us, stirring up the water. And I thought,    Oh  man, I don   t want to go across that beam.    Because when you got so far,  you had to kneel down. It was completely out after that, and you had to  climb down the trellis, or whatever that   s sitting on, just like they do  over here. They   ve got these girders coming down.  So I   m climbing, have to kneel down, the war is going on all around me,  and kind of like over there except I could get up and down in those days,  and climb down that stupid thing. All the way to the ground on those  trellises. And that was harder on me than anything I   d been up to before,  because I really was scared of heights. Still am. Anyway, I look back  and everybody had made it but one guy, who I knew, who was more  scared of heights than me. (Laughs) And he had to go all the way back  and get down and cross the river someplace. I heard later he did get  across the river. Well, I led the way. I don   t know why I was leading, but  I was, and I got up, had to climb the riverbank. Got on the other side.  On the other side, Baker Company was lined up for moving out, you  30  know, and line of skirmishes. We were attached to Baker Company as of  that moment that we got there. So I fell in with them, and we moved on  down along the line there, and the gooks had put in spider traps in the  cornfields and rice paddies. A spider trap is a deep hole that they dig,  one man gets into it and he makes a lid of the vegetation around and  closes it. You go by him, then he shoots you in the back. And they were  in this cornfield. This is a hateful thing. As we go through, shooting is  going on and there   s people shooting down at you from the riverbank, all  this and that, which was a dyke alongside the river. And the reason why  there were no prisoners taken that day, they had put a family, a Korean  family, children, women, two women, I believe, and children, and a  male or two in that field, then they dug their traps behind them. And  then they would open fire on the Marines, advancing in skirmish. And  the Marines, of course, killed everything in front of them. It was a  horror. And the Corpsman, we just had one Corpsman and he was  examining all the little kids and others. We went on and we took out all  the spider traps. We went on to the edges of Yong Dong Po, lined up  along the bank, and the gooks had retreated to the other side of the little  valley there where the river was coming in. There was a dyke over there,  we were here, they were over here. (Gesturing) And town   s in between.  They were firing across the town.  They sent a platoon or two of Marines over there to take them off that  dyke, thinking that would be easy. And so we had a firefight starting up.  Guys over there are really having a hard time. We had enough problems  because we had burp snipers, you know, the burp guns. They use a lot of  them for sniping, close range sniping. And we were losing men. I came  up beside the captain and I could look over there and these North  Koreans were running into this warehouse over there. They were really  pouring fire on our people who were trying to take this other ridge over  there, this dyke. And I said,    Sir,    to this captain who knew me not. I   d  only been with him just a little while.    My 3.5 man is real good. He can  take those people out of that building. He can hit that building no  problem at all.    He said,    Bring him up.     So Mal Berger came up, and he was really good. Man, his first round,  just like a mortar shell. Just went right in and blew a great big hole in  that warehouse over there, and the gooks just went pouring out of it. I  don   t know how many he got or anything like that. And then he told me,  he said,    I want you to take a couple of men and I want you to go over  there and tell the lieutenant in charge to pull back. He   s got more than he  can handle. Tell him to come back.    So I went through, took these guys,  I   m not supposed to be doing this, but I wanted to get in that fight so  bad. I was so upset, you know. Besides that, even as I was lying there  talking to him, the machine gunner (Bill Woodward   s from Oklahoma  City, it was one of his machine gunners) was laying there beside me  31  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  using that .30 Air-Cooled  machine gun . He just rolled over against me  and he had been shot in the head.  That   s not Woodward.  That   s one of Bill Woodward   s machine gunners. He had a section. And  so I took the note, headed out, led the guys across town, just two of  them. We got over there and the gunny sergeant was back there still  directing men into the combat area, and every time that he   d send some  men in, they   d have to go across this open area. The machine gun  bullets, just like the movies, you know, the machine gun bullets always  hit the ground. And I was sitting there, and I had more experience than  him. I just felt sure. I had already had five years in the Marines, and I  said,    Gunny, I can take out that, go through that building over right  there that we   d put the hole into.    I said,    I   m pretty sure we run the  gooks out of that building. And we will have flanked that whole line  there. You know. What do you call that, enfilade or something? If I can  go through there       I   d already told him that the captain had said to pull  the men back. He says,    I can   t get to them right now.    He was trying to  feed more people into it because there were so many wounded over  there, they had to be taken out, too, and cover fire provided and  everything. And he said,    But you go ahead and do it.    So I ran around  and got across the open area and got into where the barbed wire was, and  I fell down on my back like I   d seen them do in the movies.  Good old John Wayne movies. (Laughs)  Yeah. And yelled,    I need cutters     And the gunny had already thought  about it, and he yelled,    Somebody throw him cutters     Remember, old  Bob Woodward was wondering where those cutters came from? And so  the guy threw cutters and I caught them, and I laid there flat on my back  and cut the barbed wire. The bullets were just a popping through the  wire, just like in the movies. That   s what I was thinking,    This is just  like in the movies.    When I got through cutting the wire, I crawled  inside and they came in following me. And I threw a grenade up in the  loft just to make sure, you know, and went on inside. There   s these  windows facing that dyke over there were they were. I mean, there they  were right out there, right out the window. All you had to do is look out  the window and there they were. And man, we started. I had a BAR with  me and I had my    03 Springfield Bolt Action. (Laughs) That was all I  had. So I started shooting that Bolt Action, and every time I would shoot  (laughs) I   d forget to run the bolt. You know, after all, I was used to an  M-1 then, and that guy would hit the hole and I would miss, of course,  because I   d,    Oh  The bolt     you know, I   ve got to work the bolt.  Anyway, this went on quite a while, and this BAR man was over here.  32  Man, he   d say,    I got one  I got one     and I   d say,    Well, I got one.    We  had competition. He   d dance out, you know, and kill somebody, and  he   d back in. Then I was supposed to take over. Well, this went on for  quite a while, and the kid right beside me would come in, and I never got  around to telling him,    You don   t stand in the doorway.    And he got  shot. Well, when he got shot, I had me an M-1. (Laughs) These things  go on, believe it or not. Just, movies can be pretty real.  So we continued firing and we was really helping the guys down front.  That   s all this was all about. They were pinned down absolutely, and  they were working to try to pin them out. You know, we   re not going to  leave anybody out there. And Bill Woodward came in. I didn   t know  him at the time, don   t get me wrong. He had a Light .30 and had an  assistant, and there was no way they could fire that .30 without being  killed. In other words, if you got up in the window, they   re going to get  you. If you got in the door, and I was firing from the side of the door,  they   re going to shoot you. So apparently they decided they   d just go  through the wall. And that was a double built brick. I found out later  when we were talking to him in Oklahoma City or someplace, I said,     Bill, how did you get that hole through that brick wall?    He says,    You  know, I don   t remember.    I said,    I thought maybe you   d taken your K  bar out and pried out those bricks. That   s what I   d do.    He said,    That   s  right.    He said,    That   s what we did.     So anyway, they pried out the bricks, first row of bricks, and then set up  his .30, pointed through the hole, and blew out the rest of the bricks  making a nice firing port. And he cut loose with that machine gun. And I  mean, Bill is a whale of a machine gunner. He   s not afraid of anything,  anyway. And we cut the fire down so apparently they could go ahead  and get those guys out, because we were firing away and firing away  and firing away, and it was getting dark, and the gunny had come in. He  quit directing people over that way. He came in and he said,    All right.  It   s getting dark, they   ll be coming through the windows. I want you  guys to take all these cement blocks and build them up here.    They   re  laying around inside, probably from my gunner blowing holes in the  roof. He said,    And I want us to build a rampart right here, because  they   re going to be coming through that window and we want them up  high enough we can get behind. We   ll shoot them when they come  through the windows.    And so we were building that and continuing to  fire out the window.  About that time, some guy stuck his head around the corner and yelled,     We   ve got everybody out  Captain says pull back     So we all gathered  up, started back out, went back out across the courtyard, and as we  headed across the town, the tracers were over our heads. Far enough that  we weren   t worried about them, but they followed us all the way back to  33  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  the dyke on our side. We got over there and we were almost out of  ammunition. Bill Woodward   s machine gun had already stopped firing.  He   d run out of ammo. We got back over there, got across the dyke, and  lined up shoulder to shoulder, and traded clips, you know, so that  everybody had a few rounds. And then they yelled,    Fix bayonets      They figured they   d be there any time. It was getting dark, because  that   s the way the gooks like to come, you know. And they   d quit firing.  So we were pretty sure they were on the move.  So there we were, ready to go, and there was a challenge on the right,  oh, not too far down, and somebody flashed a light down there. And  there was this fat major (these are reserves, you know). He hadn   t lost  his fat, yet. But he was the exec, the battalion exec. And he was loaded  down with .30-caliber machine gun belts, all over him, but I recognized  him. I don   t know, something, because that flash had hit him right in the  face, and behind him was a bunch more guys from the rear echelons, you  know. They were just loaded to the hilt with ammo. So it was over, as  far as nobody   s going to take that dyke. And so we were spared combat  by bayonet. But on the other end, it was breaking loose on our left, and  that was Able Company coming in, and they had an even worse fight.  They really had a fight, and the AT assault boys that were from my  outfit got three tanks over there. You know, they had tanks, they had the  works. Able Company had had a worse fight. And that was my old  company. I really felt bad about that.  Okay, now that   s the end of that, because we spent the rest of the night  there, and the next day they brought in some, what does he call those  track vehicles? We used to call them Alligators, but I don   t remember  what they call them. ATVs or whatever. And the amtracs, and they  brought them up and loaded them. They loaded us up and went across  the river into Seoul. I remember that big old river, how bad it smelled.  And there   s a lot of history there, because when the war had started, the  South Korean populous of Seoul all wanted to run away from the  advancing North Koreans, and that bridge was just loaded with people,  and the South Koreans blew it.  The North Koreans.  No, the South. They were trying     Their own people?  They weren   t blowing it to kill their people. They were blowing the  bridge, Mom, because the North Koreans were right behind them. And  yeah, I   m sure we would have found some other way to do it. They  dumped thousands of bodies into that river. And it still smelled, that  34  L. Wilson  E. Knight  water. But it looked pretty.  What river was it?  That   s the Han. Huge river that runs right by Seoul, between Seoul and  Yong Dong Po. Then we went into Seoul and we took the town. We  landed, went, climbed up. They   ve got pictures over there in the  magazines showing    They showed a couple pictures, that was actually  our outfit. But we went up, we went through the town and we got up on  top of the hill there and we were going down this street   remember  now, we   re now in combat mode again. We   re going into what might be  action, and on each side of this nice, broad street there were trees and  there were nice houses, comparatively. Really, kind of a nice place. And  the North Koreans had taken all of the occupants out and shot them.  Tied the men and women both, shot them. They were prosperous people.  So we marched through that before we got to the main downtown area.  Then we went down that main street you   ve seen at all if you   ve ever  seen any of the war shots. That   s where, we all went down that stupid  street. And it was road block after road block in that town until you got  to the railroad station, and our outfit took the railroad station. It was full  of the enemy, and boy, were they ready. There was another fight there. I  really don   t remember much more about it. We took that, went by that  embassy in pictures we   ve got and things like that, but I don   t remember  it all. Then we went on through town. Took us a couple days. Got on the  other side. Real pretty over there, but we   d fight. Before we got to that  area, some of the South Koreans or somebody had fought there. There  were bodies everywhere.  We had a real nice area over there, but I lost some friends there in town,  Seoul. I remember once, this guy, very good friend of mine from  Oklahoma City, and he had been shot. We loaded his body on board the  ambulance and sniper fire was really bad. They were just zinging  around. I was really upset, and I thought,    I know where that guy   s  shooting from.    And I had a good M-1 then, so I rolled up my sights, put  on about thirteen clicks, and there was a big tall church, it   s still there,  whatever the Koreans call their temples, and had a window looking right  out on this area where we were. I figured that   s where he was. And  that   s the only shooting I did the rest of that day, but I laid there and  emptied a clip or two into that window, and you know what? The  sniping quit. So I either scared him away or I got him, and that made me  feel real good. You can get that feeling sometimes when you lose a  buddy or something, you know. I mean, the guy   s just a soldier doing his  job, but I wanted him real bad.  And then the next day, I think, we marched out of town, on the other  35  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  side of Seoul. We dug in over there for a while, and then from there we  went back to Incheon. And remember, days may be flying by here. I  don   t remember. We got ready to load aboard the ship. Well, the ship  we   d come on, we   d left our packs and everything on them, so they had  distributed packs, you know. We had our names on them, from the ship,  and our packs were coming back empty. The sailors or somebody had  stolen everything in those packs. So there was a lot of grumbling and  mad talk and all this and that. The weather was starting to get cool, and I  guess that we had a change. Anyway, instead of loading back aboard our  transport, we went back aboard LSTs  Landing Ship Tanks . And so we  set sail to go around to the other side of the island to land. It was  supposed to be an assault against Hungnam. Was it Hungnam where we  were going? Wonsan or Hungnam, I can   t remember.  Around the peninsula.  It   s on the other side of the peninsula.  Yes. You said island.  And we were first. We were going to be first wave. So we were the first  wave and we assaulted Bob Hope   s show (laughs) on the other, you  know, they   d already taken that side by the time we got around and  landed on it. Turned out the harbor was heavily mined with really good  mines. Hard to sweep. It took them two or three weeks to sweep. Well,  we went back and forth, yo-yoed up there, up and down, up and down  that flat-bottomed LST. I was really seaworthy by the time we landed,  because I didn   t have any sea sickness left in me. But we did, went in  Amtracs. That   s the first time I had made it to Seoul in an Amtrac.  And made it right in to    Bob Hope went in to Seoul.  Just rode right in. Yeah, they had to, Bob Hope   s show was scheduled  that evening. But not for us. We went in, aboard the train, and headed  south to a town called Wojo, or something like that, where there was a  big ammunition dump again. Got down there, and it took us a long time  to get there, but when we got down there we unloaded and went through  town. We headed for the hills, and found out that there was about 2,000  or 3,000 North Koreans coming up from below. They had been all the  way down to the end of the peninsula. And we were supposed to stop  them. Well, they spread us out about one man per hole per fifteen or  twenty feet. Well that night, they went through us like a hot knife  through butter, and got quite a few of us, too. Of course, we got some of  them, I guess. And then we pulled back off that ridge and realized we  were outnumbered down there.  36  S. Knight  E. Knight  W. Wilson  E. Knight  Well, in the meantime they started another battalion down to support us.  We got in and we dug in along the railroad tracks, which run along the  coast. Behind that we had our artillery, and behind that we had  destroyers. And of course, they weren   t about to attack us. Boy, we had  a beautiful set up. The guys from up north came in and reinforced us.  We could have taken on the whole North Korean army where we were,  and we wanted to take on the whole North Korean army. We were really  upset.  Because you   d been spread so thin the night before.  Oh yeah. I lost two men, and I was sitting there in this stupid hole. I was  back down to a .45 again. I   d given my rifle to somebody, and I had my  men behind me because I honestly wasn   t trying to be brave, but I read  somewhere you were supposed to lead, you know, so I   d sit down in this  hole up front of them, and they were all dug in and it was timbered,  rocks, everything. And we could hear all this noise right beside us  almost. All of a sudden some dead gook yelled,    Monzai     right into my  ear. I was sitting there in the dark, you know, facing a rock. I   d long ago  learned that you don   t want to face anything that somebody can hide in.  And this gook come up beside me and yelled,    Monzai     right in my ear,  and I just, I bet I cleared that hole just    (Laughs) I didn   t get him, but  somebody got him. Everybody got somebody. But I had two men, one of  them was wounded pretty badly. And they went through us like     So we lost several guys that night. They weren   t interested in wiping us  out, they were interested in going north. They were headed north. Two  thousand of them, they said, figuratively speaking. Except for the ones  they left out there. And this machine gunner beside me got a medal that  night. Had this .30 Light. He pulled the pin on it when they went all  around him. They were just flowing all around him. They   d taken out his  buddies, and he was an old Okinawa vet, and he just pulled the pin down  there. You know, there   s a pin down there that keeps your weapon from  rotating too far. He pulled it out, threw it away. He had to look for it the  next day. And just went around 360 degrees, because all his  people   lying on each side of him were either dead or wounded. They were all  down on the ground. He killed guys behind him, he killed guys in front  of him, beside him. But they didn   t overrun him, and I think that may be  where  Raymond  Kaminski got his medal of honor. I don   t know. That  was really a bad situation.  Earl, what town is this where you had your line? Is this the Hungnam?  No, we had gone south, see. In Wojo. Well, the next day, reinforcements  were in. Nobody was ever going to attack us, so after a while we moved  on out. My men had been pushed out of their holes that night and kind of  37  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  swung back, you know, but they were all recovered, so I was in good  shape. But I was really kind of sick of the whole thing. And Colonel  Puller was really sick of it. He was bad. He in effect relieved that  captain. I don   t even know if it   s his fault.  They had you spread out so thin.  Yeah, I don   t know what he could have done about it. They were  assigned this territory. They tried to defend it. But anyway, Puller was  not proud of that situation. We heard word of mouth. We went on up  north, got into trucks, got up around Wonsan area and somewhere up  there, and we did a lot of patrolling in those mountains in trucks,  including the incident where the trucks went off the road and rolled way  down, 500,000 feet down. I was on that patrol. It was scary. You know,  you were on dirt roads, you   re sitting on those old six by   s. You look  around and you can see forever down there. You know, you realize your  rump   s sticking out over the edge, nowhere. I was glad to get out of that  area. Then we went on north, up the road to Chinhung-ni, and it was  getting cold. Before we got up to Chinhung-ni, it was getting very cold,  and finally we did get some sleeping bags and parkas. And those old  boots, whatever they called them. Which just in time, too, because it was  really starting to get cold up there in the mountains. And we stayed at  Chinhung-ni while the rest of the first battalion went on up north to     Somebody help me here.  Hagaru-ri?  No. Our battalion only got as far as, wasn   t Koterie. Up there on top.  She   s got the map. Let me see it, sweetheart. I should know, I just forget.  Oh Mom, they don   t even have it there. It   s wherever that guy was.  (Laughs) It is Koterie, and I stayed at Chinhung-ni, we patrolled out of  Chinhung-ni. The Chinese had already come down there and were  around Chinhung-ni. We waited there until we were relieved, and the  division had already run into the Chinese trouble up there and was  pulling back. They   d run into about six divisions up there, and were  somewhat outnumbered to say the least. We started pulling back and we  went up to take Hill 1081, which was the gateway to that plateau up  there. By then it was really cold, and it was snowy, and we went up the  road in a snowstorm. It started snowing before we got started. It already  had snowed some, but to show you how cold it was, the cataract that  falls on the river at Chinhung-ni had frozen solid that night. Just quit  running. Well, the water was running underneath, but it was just flowing  under solid ice. It was that cold.  We got up to start, real early, I think about two o   clock, and started up  that hill, the road. It was about, I don   t know, three to five miles hiking.  38  It wasn   t a long ways. It was all uphill, and it was all icy cold and dark  most of the time. Then we got to where we had to pull off and go off the  road, you know, where the bridge had been blown out that they had to  replace the bridge. Some of my men had already been up and over that  bridge up at the top several times. I hadn   t, because I stayed down there  to patrol, duty patrol. They got up to this area where we had to go up,  and I started up. My guys were trailing down behind me. We just started  up this ridge.  Well, where I started up was steep. Really steep and long, and I was  struggling up in that snow with all my gear and everything. I was going  from bush to bush trying to hold on, pull myself up, and the gloves were  so slippery and it   s so cold. I took off my glove in order just to hold on  and keep going up. And when I got up to the top of the ridge, my hands  had frozen. Not solid, but they   d frozen. They had frostbite. So I had to  put up with that, and my feet were getting frostbitten, too. Got up on the  ridge. My guys had come up, you know, down below me just up the  ridge. We turned and went up the ridge toward Able Company up at the  top and dug in from Able Company down alongside that ridge. Only you  didn   t dig, you just made a spot in the snow. It was real deep up there.  So we tossed our bags out in the snow, and since it was daylight by then,  we built fires. Which wasn   t too bad, except the wind was just howling  and thirty-five, forty  degrees  below, that wind is just awful. I situated  my boys so that we were fifty percent watch all the time, that way some  of us could get in the sleeping bag. Trouble is, we had to get in our  sleeping bag with our boots on. You couldn   t take your boots off up  there, and you never knew when there was going to be trouble, and so  dragging ourselves, weary bods into the sleeping bag, we drug in snow  and ice. Well, our sleeping bags froze up. They were stiff as boards.  And, you know, every time you   d open up your bag, you   d hear that ice  breaking as you   re trying, and you get back in there. You   d kind of get it  warmed up, you know. If you   d roll off enough, you   d do pretty good.  So I had him, we   d switch out parkas so we   d have hot parkas. We   d get  out of the sleeping bag and put on the guard   s parka. He   d get in the  sleeping bag covered up under your parka because you tossed that on  under there and everything else you could toss on it, too. And this went  on for a couple three nights up there on that ridge, you know, and  actually was no problem for us except just staying alive. Except, well, I  did have to go up to Able Company and take ammunition up to them. I  gave them my 3.5s. They ran out of 3.5s knocking those bunkers up out  there and they were out of them, and they needed it real bad. So another  guy and I loaded up with our 3.5, which we were glad to get rid of  anyway. Tired of carrying that stuff around. And got to the top, oh man.  Getting to the top, because the snow was so deep, and got up there on  39  the line and distributing ammunition, and they were pretty hard firing  even then.  There was still some Chinese that hadn   t frozen to death or whatnot up  there. And distributing ammunition, the first guy I met when I got to the  very top was a young man. I had never seen him before. At least, I didn   t  recognize him, but one side of his face was solid ice, frozen. His eye was  frozen. And I asked him, I don   t remember. I should have just said, in  my position of authority, you know,    Get your butt off this mountain.  You   ve got to save that eye.    I don   t know whether he could save that  eye that   s frozen or not. That   s one thing I remember. But on the line,  everybody up there was just like something out of one of these zombie  movies, you know. Moving slowly. They   d been a firing all night long.  We were distributing ammunition to the guys. I knew them, most of  them from Oklahoma City, they were Able Company, my old company.  And nothing much was going on at the time after I distributed, so I  asked,    Well, you want me to stay up here or go back?    And this guy  said,    No, go on back down there. Get on the ridge line, hold the ridge  line is what you   ve got to do.    It wasn   t long after I did that, I don   t  know, sometime that day, they, Billy Webb from Oklahoma City, he and  several guys, I guess they   d had enough of it. They fired those 3.5s and  took out those bunkers and bayonet charged up there and cleaned that  whole place out. Captured some Chinese frozen, frozen to their  weapons. They couldn   t even pull the trigger. They were frozen. And I  saw a lot of those up there before I left. Chinese, they   d been in those  bunkers, but they couldn   t do anything. They were frozen, literally.  Couldn   t move their fingers. They couldn   t drop their rifles. We had to  take them away from them. Can you imagine, they   d sit there in those  stupid cotton uniforms, padded uniforms. Their uniforms froze up, and  they froze up inside the uniforms. And their hands were frozen to their  weapons, and, you know, you   re just like this. Try to pry and get the  weapons. You had to take the weapons away from the poor people. We  weren   t mistreating them. Felt real sorry for them.  As a matter of fact, we brought them out and while up there, though, my  pride was really restored. I looked down there and that division   s  coming through. First Division. The point of the First Division started  across that bridge they   d fixed. So I was up there, I looked down and  watched it, and the division started flowing through, and they flowed  through that day. The next day, we took out his rear guard, brought him  down. And the Tommies came through showing,    Hey, we   re  Tommies,    you know, the Marines swaggering, if you can swagger.  Well, you knew they were just as glad to get out of there as anybody  else, but they were swaggering, and I watched them a long time. I  thought,    I   m watching history here. Here goes the First Marine  40  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  Division right down that cotton picking bridge, and they   re doing it  because we took this mountain and held it open for them.    Not that  holding was very bad, because the Chinese were frozen. They were beat.  We should never have left Hungnam. We should have stayed. That   s  really all I know. I could talk about patrolling up in the mountains, and  what little skirmishing  we did , but it   s just blank to me. It was just too  cold and miserable. That just didn   t record, I guess. I don   t remember.  So were you part of the First Marine Division?  Yes.  Where did they get the nickname    The Old Breed?        The Old Breed    is World War II and before.    New Breed    is Korean  War, or after World War II. I was both, so, you know, old and new, but I  guess it   s serious in the    I don   t know why. There   s not that much  difference between the old breed and the new anyway, as far as I can  tell. But most of the reserve units that made up the First Marine  Division, made up about half of it, were reservists. They were all World  War II reservists, most of them, because if you were too green, you had  to go to boot camp. They took you right, instead of going, say, from  Oklahoma City to Camp Pendleton and then on into the First Marine  Division, you had to go to boot camp. Those kids, a lot of them had  never gone to boot camp. But sixty percent of the reservists were  veterans from World War II. Shouldn   t have had to go back over, but  they did. Volunteered again.  Well where were you when you were called back by the Red Cross to  see your dad?  Okay, well, we had went on down. I   ll never get out of this Korea. We  got down to Hungnam, and by the way, it wasn   t easy, because there  were a couple points where the Chinese had broken through down there  below. The army was supposed to keep them off of us, but as armies  frequently don   t do their job well    Anyway, they broke through and we  lost a few Marines on the road going down. But we did get to Hungnam  and stayed there that night. But I think it was early the next morning,  they had the line, we   d lined up and we   re getting on these, not the  LCPV, but the bigger ones, the next one up. Great big ones, you know,  and loading up on those to go to the transports and load up and go out,  and we got on board these stupid things, and we had to stand. We were  so densely packed in we couldn   t sit down or anything. We stood on  those stupid things for hours in the cold and the wet.  We finally take our place getting out to the troop ships. Nobody   s fault,  41  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  they were just, you know, in train. And we got out to the troop ships and  went up, didn   t have to climb the dad burned netting, anyway, but we  did go up a gangway that they   d lowered, and then we weren   t even  assigned bunks, I don   t think. I don   t remember being assigned a bunk.  You just slept where you could find a place.  Well, we were standing there and they were loading up, and believe it or  not, Chesty and his breed came up, you know, Chesty Puller. One thing  about him, if he saw a knot of Marines, he headed for them like a streak,  you know. I know he was tired, worn out, like the rest of us. He   s a lot  older than we were, but he came into our little group, there was about  eight or ten of us, I guess, and we all squatted around and he started  talking about what we ought to be doing, what the danged army was  doing. He cussed, you know, and he told us what was wrong with the  army. He told us what was wrong with our equipment. He said,    We  ought to burn up those, throw away those carbines. Destroy them, smash  them, burn them up and give everybody an M-1 or a BAR.    On and on,  he talked for thirty minutes, I believe, to just our little group. Then he  went on and probably found another group. Cussed the army out in that,  too. He really was mad at the army and had good reason, I thought. And  I think the army felt they did too, because, you know, they started  training using Marine Corps methods after that debacle. You may not  know it, but they did. They came to San Diego and Paris Island and  followed the training regiments for a while, and learned what we were  doing and how we were doing it, and went back and improved their own  situation.  When you all got back on the ships, were the hundred thousand refugees  were on the same ship?  No. Refugees were loaded separately, as far as I know. We never had  any refugees. We brought them back, but they didn   t get on our ship.  They had to wait until we loaded out. Those poor refugees had a  miserable situation.  What happened to them?  Well, they had followed us down. See, my outfit, my unit was rear guard  in the division. We were between the refugees and the end of the  division coming down below 1081, and they had endured. It was their  home country and everything, they knew the weather and all that, but  they had their wives, their children, you know. It was bad.  They were running from the North Korean army.  Yeah, and we couldn   t let them mix with us or get in too close, because  42  S. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  those North Koreans or Chinese or both would sneak in amongst them,  you see, and cause casualties among us. So we had to make them keep a  gap between us and them all the way down. I think they understood. I  don   t, but they had a terrible situation. Here they   re on the road, you  know, thirty-five, forty  degrees  below  zero . They had food on their  backs, but we couldn   t afford to give them food. As a matter of fact, we  were kind of short of food ourselves. But they made it down, and I think  it was one of the largest evacuations of civilians in history. Ninety-eight  thousand, or something like that.  They said over a hundred thousand.  Wow. And then where were they taken?  South Korea.  See, they were North Koreans.  But they   re cousins to those folks below. I mean, Koreans are the most  inter-bred people in the world, I   m sure, because they   ve been on that  little old rock for forever. Ten thousand years, probably.  Well, and didn   t you see tales of where they had just gone in villages  and killed everyone?  In South I did. North, we destroyed their villages a lot because if we left  their homes standing, the Chinese and the Koreans would use them, the  North Koreans, and they   d be in the warmth and we   d be in the cold,  you know. So what we would do is set up at night, and if you had a few  houses in front of you, they   re made out of straw, most up there. And  they   re nice, snug places, but they   re made out of straw. We   d cut loose  on them with .30s or .50s. Now mind you, the civilians wouldn   t be in  the houses. We   d been warned. We had interpreters with us all the time,  but their houses were expendable. If we were attacked, we would rake  them with machinegun fire, and that would set the buildings on fire. So  those, they knew they could not sleep in their houses. They were warned  about that, and they didn   t. They   re smart people. This is war. I don   t  know where they stayed. You know, I honestly couldn   t tell you. The  thing to do as a civilian is just stay out of the way, and you just had to  know where to go. Maybe, you know, a depression somewhere. I don   t  know where, but first thing, you   ve got to take care of your own people.  You   ve got to, or you don   t come back, you know.  But we didn   t make a habit of killing people. We didn   t like it, we didn   t  want to do it, and we got mad if we were made to do it. You   ve got  somebody like the North Koreans. And the South and North Koreans  43  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  both preferred us to the North Koreans.  Soldiers.  Along with nearly a hundred thousand. I said ninety-eight. A hundred  thousand North Korean civilians, refugees.  I read, in one of those movie things they said it was a hundred and fifty  thousand.  Somebody   s exaggerating, I think. I don   t know, but when I was over  there, they said a hundred thousand. I don   t know who counted them.  They sure looked like a lot of people, you know. Enough.  And I guess they just came.  But we put them on the same ships, like our ship went back, I   m real  sure, and picked up refugees. The same ships we were on. Took them  down to Pusan, I think, and they provided camps there for them, and it  was a lot warmer down in Pusan. A lot warmer. We went on around to  Maisan, got off at Pusan, then went to Maisan. That   s where there   s a  bunch of old rice fields out there that we had been in before, and we  camped out there. And that   s when the Red Cross guy came up.  I   d been there about three or four days, and the Red Cross guy came up  and said my dad had had a heart attack and wasn   t expected to live, and  did I want to go home? And I said,    Well, yeah.    And so I went home,  but I was an only son, and the policy had come out already that if you  were the only son and the circumstances were such that you needed to  stay in the States, you could do so.  So you were finished at that point?  No. I went back. I wanted to go back. I didn   t want to, but my people  were over there, you know, and my friends. The job wasn   t finished, so I  went back, and I hitchhiked home. They gave me orders. I carried orders  with high priority, but this is the way I got home all the way to the States  anyway. Get on the mail truck. Once you get on the mail truck and go to  Pusan, that   s where shipping out points are. I hitchhiked to Pusan. I  thought I would catch a boat to Japan, but the guy down there says,    No,  go out to the airfield and get on one of the mail planes, and go to over  there.    So I did, and landed someplace in, I can   t remember the names of  the towns. When I hear them, I know them, but one of them was that  temple city. And then from there I hitchhiked a ride to Yokohama,  stayed at Yokohama until I could get a ride onboard. Well, I actually  went home on a Northeast Airlines plane from Japan because I had high  44  S. Knight  E. Knight  priority. Not the highest, but it was a high priority, and so got to the  States, and I don   t remember how I got home. Oh, I flew to Denver and  then took a bus, believe it or not. Then when I got ready to go back     Dad was doing better when you got home.  Yeah, Dad just perked right up. Kind of felt like I   d been double  crossed. (Laughs)    Dad, you   re supposed to be dying.    But anyway, I  got back, he did recover from that heart attack. I don   t know how he did  it. Pretty much. I had orders, of course, to go back. I had no problem  with that, but if I got to Treasure Island, I   d like to have never got out of  that place. They just rub your hands every time a contingent of Marines  come in, you know. It   s a Naval base, and they had a Marine prison  there. Treasure Island   s a big prison. So I chased prisoners out of that  prison for a while. I did, I stayed gate, I had the salute, I had the whole  works down. I did just everything. I don   t see how that base got along  after I left.  I did everything until finally, I got a ride on the troop transport. Back to  Korea with three thousand doggies. Yeah. Wasn   t even a Marine troop  transport. But the captain saw the Marine coming aboard, and I stood  watch every day going back. He wouldn   t trust (laughs) those ships to  those soldiers, you know, and I didn   t blame him. That was the rawest  bunch of people I   d ever met. They hadn   t been well-trained. I don   t  know what the heck. They were nice kids, but    I remember some of the  questions they asked me, because they knew we were veterans, you  know, and boy, those kids wanted to know what they were getting into.  But when I got to Japan, Yokohama, stayed there a while, finally got a  ride. I didn   t have high priority anymore, see? I wasn   t going home.  Finally got a ride out of Japan and flew into Pusan again. Walked up the  receiving there. It wasn   t Marines, it was soldiers or somebody, and I  said,    I   ve been on emergency leave. I   m going back to First Marine  Division. Where is it at?    He says,    It   s up north central, I believe.     Says,    You go to the mail people. Mail trucks go out that way. It   ll take  you a while, but they   re out there somewhere in the north central.     So I hitched a ride on mail trucks. Well, every time we   d stop at an army  base, we   d get in line at the chow line and get chow. And boy, we just  lived like kings. We were really getting good food, because those  soldiers, they didn   t get to see Marines very often anyway, and they just  fed us like we were princes. It took three days to get to my division, and  that   s pushing it, too. We slept on those trucks sometimes and whatever  we could do. Got up there and thought,    Yeah, going to see my old  buddies.    They were all tented up there in the pup tents and so. First  thing old Ravasari says,    What the ruh ruh ruh you doing here?     (Laughs) They all wondered why I had come back. I was an only son. I  45  didn   t have to go back, but I thought I was supposed to.  Anyway, three o   clock in the morning, I got in late. Got in the bunk  down in the tent. Three o   clock in the morning, yelling and everybody  was getting up.    Falling out  Falling out     And that   s when we had to go  up and plug that gap. I just got back, I hadn   t slept in days, and we got  on trucks and headed around to where these Chinese had hit this South  Korean division, and they had just melted. And so we went up, the South  Koreans just flowing past us all the way up, and our Marines were mad  and calling them names and all that, taking up weapons and doing  everything, you know. Got up there and there was an army artillery  outfit, had their guns pointed north, and they were in desperate straits.  They had lost some of the weapons because the South Koreans had  abandoned them, and they sure wanted us to get those weapons. They  sure wanted us to stop those Chinese, and they promised us,    If you plug  that hole       It was kind of a horse shoe, like that, and the road went  right through it, and they were on the road down here. He said,    We   ll  fire on them.    And boy, they fired, too.  They fired everything they had that night. And we fired everything we  had that night once we got up there in that horse shoe, because those  Chinese were just, there was a whole division of them right there in front  of us. This is my introduction back to Korea. Didn   t sleep that night  either, and our tanks, you   ll probably never see this. Our tanks had their  barrels horizontal to the ground and were firing ninety millimeters just  as fast as they could fire. Those Chinese were thicker than fleas on a dog  back up there. I dug me a hole and I was lying back flat, because those  tracers were just going right by. The call came,    They need ammunition  up front.    And of course, I was the newest sergeant there, so you know  whose name that gunny called right away. And so I had to crawl out,  crawl over, get some ammunition.  In the meantime, they had been trying to evacuate wounded from our     We were catching casualties. And a helicopter came right in to show you  what kind of guys those are, your helicopter men. And he brought it  right down in that horseshoe. We just look at the Chinese tracers. They  use tracers all the time, I think because they   re not that good of gunners.  I don   t know, but those tracers were just converging on that helicopter.  But he   s coming anyway and it crashed right there, like out there in the  back yard. Just went wham, right into the ground. He got out alive, and  so he had to be evacuated, too. We had a lot of casualties there.  But anyway, I tried to crawl that hill, up that hill, it was so steep. I got  about halfway up it, and I was loaded with ammunition, everything I  could. I had more than I should have been carrying. Dead tired. I  couldn   t wiggle. I couldn   t climb anymore. I got about halfway up, and I  46  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  had my men behind me, and besides that, this was hell. It really was.  Machine gun fire and all that, and this second lieutenant up on top, I  think, he was a lieutenant somebody or other, probably a second,  surviving lieutenant, started yelling for that ammo. He said,    You guys  got the ammo?       Yeah, I got the ammo        Bring it on up.       Lieutenant,  (laughs) I can   t wiggle.    I had about fifty pounds or more of ammo on  me, you know, and I was so beat I couldn   t move. I   ve never before been  where I literally couldn   t move. I think he finally got the word that I  really would love to be on top with you guys and give you that  ammunition. I felt really guilty. But I was so tired. And besides, it was  almost un-climbable. You know, it was about like that. (Gestures) I had  nightmares for, what, years, wasn   t it, Sue? About that stupid incident  that I couldn   t do my duty, I thought, to carry that ammo up that hill.  Finally, he said,    You know, we can reach it from there. Just leave it  there and go on back down.    And so I just let loose and rolled back  down the hill. (Laughs) I   d never been that tired in my life. I felt so  guilty. For years I   d dream I   d be in some stress trying to help somebody  or something, my legs wouldn   t move. Just wouldn   t move. I   d wake up  saying,    Wonder why I   m dreaming like that?     To Sue:  Do you  remember that? A lot of times it   d be something, I had to get up, I had to  get up there somewhere. Anyway, it was a bad dream. I guess I had that,  whatever that is they have  PTSD, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder . I  don   t know. But that was the only thing I got from it that really bugged  me for a long time.  What month and year did you return?  Let me think a minute, if you will. I   m not through yet, believe it or not.  I had one more horrible experience, but July. I think it was July when I  came home. One month later than I should have because of that  emergency leave. They lost my records on that emergency leave, so  when they called up the Reserves to go home, I wasn   t included. I  could   ve stayed, just been another month or so and they   d all joined me  back home, but I didn   t know that.  And that   s in 1953?     52.  Now, wasn   t that, too, when some of them thought you were dead?  Well, that was somewhere in there. I don   t remember. Some kid named  Knight got killed. Well, Jean Krauss, big friend of his, he brought me  that thing. I   ve got it here somewhere, this kid named Knight.  47  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight     We thought you were dead.     Yeah, thought I was dead, and it didn   t make much of a stir, either. Let  me tell you. (Laughs) To come back in, and they say,    What are you  doing here? Thought you were dead.    Some kid named Knight got killed  by short round. I heard about it. Anyway, after that fight, and it went on.  I   m not even going to tell you about the next fight there, but we rear  guarded off of that one, too, and had a really fierce firefight up there  before I left. Then we had to run the gauntlet for a while, kept pulling  back, taking our wounded and so on, and the gooks had the high ground,  firing down there. But we got everybody out. We didn   t leave anybody  dead or alive up there. Not on our side, anyway. And then we went back  and set up later, further down the road, and I think I carried that stupid  machine gun fourteen miles that day. I was so tired I couldn   t walk a  straight line. We didn   t get any sleep. Nobody slept up in the town. But I  did have one big fire fight, then I got back down where the rifle was shot  full of dirt and all that stuff.  Oh, that story.  Oh, yeah. That was my proudest moment. I really don   t brag too much  about that. Got down and set up a line. Dared the Chinese to attack us  and they wouldn   t do it. I mean, that   s the way we felt about it, because  we were really dug in nicely again. Every time we really were ready,  they wouldn   t, seemed like. We had tanks, we had artillery, we had the  whole works. We were all dug in. We put up barbed wire and mines and  everything in front of us, and we were thoroughly ready for them. They  didn   t come. They went around us. They always went around us, seemed  like. Then we went back and it started back up again. Remember, I   m on  borrowed time here because I should have been going back to the States.  We were headed north along the Chorwon Reservoir country,  somewhere up there. Wound up at the, I believe they call that the    Punch  Bowl.    It   s in the Marine Corps books. There   s a big bowl, and before  we got there we came under really intense mortar fire. Just almost too  much. Lost quite a few people. I had a brand new squad, and I lost four  or five of them that day. Five, I guess. No, six. Some dead, some  wounded. And so I was down to me and a kid that just came in. This  made the gunny mad, as if it were my fault, and he was the one that put  us there. And so he assigned me a .50 caliber machine gun. I had never  fired a fifty. Didn   t know anything about it. Didn   t want to know  anything about it, because they weigh a ton. And a couple of guys, four  guys, and we went up the edge of the Punch Bowl, took us about two  days to get up there, and set up on the Punch Bowl, rim of the Punch  Bowl, where you could watch. Man, you could see for a mile down  there. And the Koreans were trying   we   re against North Koreans  48  L. Wilson  E. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  again. The Chinese really didn   t like to attack us. They really didn   t. But  they were attacking up at the east of us, and they were running in front  of us. We set up that old .50 up there one day and just had a field day.  We came back to our own area there where we   d all dug in and all that,  and a guy came, and I got me a haircut. My hair was getting down. In  the Marines, that   s just a no-no, but my hair was terrible, and one of  those gunnies decided he would cut my hair for me. He gave me the  worst haircut you can imagine. He just took a pair of shears, I think, and  cut it. And he hadn   t even got through when a guy come up to the rear  and was calling a name for a    Sergeant Earl Knight.    I yelled, and he  said,    You   re going home. You   re supposed to be home now.    (Laughs)  We went back down and got in the jeep and headed back out. And back  to hitchhiking, if I remember right. (Laughs) I got to an air base  somewhere down around Pusan. Might have been Seoul. I don   t  remember. There   s a big air base down there, and I flew back in one of  those dad burned army transport planes, and we went and landed at  Midway Island, and Hawaii, and a whole bunch of places like that. But I  was home, head bound. I kind of felt bad, but this time I didn   t feel as  bad, because all my buddies were either wounded, dead, or home, going  home. So I really didn   t leave anything in Korea like I had the first time.  I wasn   t being heroic, I just, these were my friends, you know. You just  go back to your unit.  So what did you do when you returned to the United States?  Well, we landed at San Diego at the boot camp there, and laid our bags  out for immigration inspection. They didn   t look at them. Didn   t look at  them. I could have snuck in a whole bunch of stuff, and I was really  feeling bad about that, because there was a lot of things I would have  brought back with me, including a Springfield rifle and a .45 and a  whole bunch of stuff. (Laughs) But I had a lot of things wrong with me,  you know, that I   d picked up over there. I had intestinal parasites of  different types, and things like that, and so I stayed for an extra several  weeks of medical treatment, and then they put me on a bus and sent me  home.  To Oklahoma City?  Yes. They would have sent me anywhere. They tried to reenlist me, you  know, switch me over because I now had experience, but I had a  designation, MOS  Military Occupational Specialty , they called it, that  was in short supply in the Marines. And they offered me all kinds of nice  duties if I stayed in, but I knew my dad was ill and I was waiting to go  home and get married, apparently.  49  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  Hadn   t met me yet.  Hadn   t met her yet. But I went back to Hills Business University where  you had joined up. So that   s where we met after I got back. I just went  back and then reported in at that reserve unit and they said,    Well, do  you want to stay on active or reserve, or do you want to go onto  inactive?    So I said,    Inactive.    That   s too bad, too. Was that right  away? Do you remember?  I don   t remember.  I don   t remember.  I think you were still in some kind of reserve when we met.  Well, I was on inactive later, but I don   t remember if I was still on the  active or not.  I don   t think so.  I did do some active reserving before I went inactive, because I  remember trying to train those guys how to fire 3.5s and this and that. I  wasn   t a very good instructor. My instructions were,    Look, you wire  that sucker and you shoot it,    you know, something like that. That   s the  way we learned over there. (Laughs)  I   m the teacher in the family.  What are some medals and honors that you received?  I didn   t receive any medals or honors. We had Presidential Unit  Citations. Two of them, I think. One Presidential and one Naval, but  individual honors, I never got any. Never deserved any, as far as I know.  He   s got service ribbons for having been there.  Oh, I   ve got several of those, but    I   ve got a whole chest full of that  stuff, but I didn   t get wounded. Could have. I   ve had some really close  calls, I   ve just never got wounded.  And you have to bleed in order to get a purple heart.  I got hit in the ankle once, but it didn   t break the skin. I limped for six  weeks, but it didn   t break the skin. So I didn   t get a purple heart on that  one.  50  L. Wilson  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  S. Knight  E. Knight  W. Wilson  E.

In your Tulsa group, you   ve got one from the Army.  There   s just one left now? There used to be two or three. I guess they  died.  I don   t know. And a Corpsman  And just one Corpsman, or two? We always considered Corpsman as  Marines. They deserved every honor they could get as far as we were  conce
