Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Nineteen something, I'll say.
Speaker 1: Okay, that puts us in the ballpark (laughter)--big ballpark (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace the Hugheses?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting in our family; we talked about this briefly earlier.  My name is Singleton Beryl, and my grandfather is Singleton Bernard Hughes, and this is on my mom's side of the family; and he was the--he went to Howard Medical School [Washington, D.C.], and he was the first African American physician to ever practice at John[s] Hopkins Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland].  My grandfather is a sibling--I mean--has--all together there--he has three brothers and two sisters; it's a very amazing family.  His father was Singleton Russell Hughes, and out of those six siblings, my grandfather, as I mentioned earlier, was a physician--his brother was Bishop W.A.C. Hughes; he was the first African American Bishop in a A.M.E. church [sic, Methodist Episcopal Church, later, United Methodist Church], and he had another brother, Hugh [ph.] Price Hughes, who was also a physician.  And he also had two sisters, May and Sarah, who--Aunt Sarah moved to New York and, unfortunately, back in those times, she passed for white; she's very fair-complected, and her, her sister--Sarah married and had several children as well.  That--so that was Singleton Russell Hughes.   Prior to that, what we know is Singleton Russell Hughes' father was Singleton Hughes, and he was a freed slave, and he became a minister, and he has been--information has been published and donated to the archives of the, of the AME church where you can read about a prolific African American who would preach for mile--and people from miles and miles would come and listen to his sermons, and he had a church called Mount Joy [AME Church, Monkton, Maryland], and it was in eastern Maryland.  And that's as far back as I can go with the Hugheses.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, with Reverend Singleton Hughes, what are his dates?  What is the--he practiced circa when?  The 1870s, eighteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah--approximately--that's a book that my mother's put together and has all, all of--has that information.
Speaker 1: Was he--I suppose he was born prior to the Civil War, right?--if he was a slave, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no--oh, yeah; oh, you're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that Reverend Singleton Hughes was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, exactly--um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Was he born--you know, was he--did he live through the Civil War era, or was he free prior to the Civil War or--
Speaker 2: My understanding, he lived through the Civil War era, and he was freed soon after.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Okay, all right.  And--okay, now, are there any stories that have passed down from that side of the family about, you know, life in those days?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I don't--you know, I don't have that information readily available, other than the fact that I'd heard that--about his preaching abilities and how black people and white people would come hear his sermons, and that he was very articulate and very profound, and the church--as a matter of fact, there's still a monument in Eastern Maryland.  Unfortunately, I don't have any more stories, other than that, that have been passed down to us.  Stories I can share with you with regard to my grandfather and that crew, they were very active in Baltimore, Maryland.  As a matter of fact, Morgan's University [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], the name of their stadium, is called Hughes Stadium--the stories I can share with you there are that my great-uncle, W.A.C. Hughes, was very active in getting funding to start the university, and also specifically the stadium because he was a big football fan.  My grandfather was the medical doctor for the football team, and gave them free services, and he and my grandmother, who had a house in Baltimore on Druid Hill Avenue where he also had his office, would even house many of the students who were on the football team who didn't have housing at the university, and as a result, in honor of all the contributions that my grandfather and his brother made to Morgan, the stadium is named Hughes Stadium.  As a matter of fact, we had a reunion two years ago when they re-dedicated the univers--the stadium because the, you know, Maryland Legislature gave them more money to fix it up and renovate it.  So, at that time, we had several Hughes members that were there in appreciation and recognition of the Hughes family.  My grandmother would always cook for them; she was quite a cook.  It was Blanche Hughes who was married to Singleton Bernard Hughes, and was very active in nurturing in those, you know, in those times, to help the, the students of the team out, as well.

Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name, and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S, Winford, W-I-N-F-O-R-D, Alphonso, A-L-P-H-O-S-O [ph.], McAllister, M-C-A-L-L-I-S-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 26, 19--what would dad be?--twenty--oooh--I'll have to get back to you on that one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's passed away now, but he would be in his late seventies now, about seventy-eight.  So we can subtract seventy-eight from 2003 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--So, '26 [1926], I guess.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I think we can say '26 [1926]. It slipped my mind.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes, 1926, okay.  Well, what do you know about his side of the family?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay--born in Mobile.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's interesting because, out of my father's family, there were two boys and two girls from my grandfather's second marriage, and the last of the siblings passed away a few years ago, and I was just chatting with my mother because--Harviette [ph.] McAllister Taylor, who stayed in Mobile, Alabama, was the oldest of the siblings, and she had the family bible and the family history.  And just recently, we found out that my great-grandfather was from Mexico--we never knew that; and we saw the pictures, and we always looked--we noticed, you know, looked a little--maybe Hispanic but in our community and the way genes blend and not knowing how far back certain mixtures come together was a interesting insight for us.  My grandfather--as a matter of fact, I have pictures to share with you of both he and my grandmother--used to work on the railroad back in the day and that was many, many years ago, and that's how he was able to support his family in Mobile, Alabama.  He was married--Emma McAllister, who was his wife, who was my grandmother, Harvie McAllister, was married once before, and I happen just--maybe fifteen years ago, to meet one of the siblings from my grandfather's first marriage, and he had two girls and two boys out of that marriage, so a lot of us--that part of the family lived in Mobile, Alabama.  Unfortunately, I can't go any further back than my grandfather and the information that my mother has with regard to his history and Mexico will be very important to us, but that's as much as I know to date.
Story_ID: 186653
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother [Ann Hughes].  What's she like, and how did she grow up?
Speaker 2: How did she what?
Speaker 1: Grow up, basically.
Speaker 2: Well, as I mentioned earlier, my grandfather [Singleton Bernard Hughes] was a physician, a very prominent physician in Baltimore, Maryland, and she and her brother, Dr. Donald W.O. Hughes, grew up very well--very privileged for, you know, you know, within the African American community.  They both, you know, went to college; my grand - my mom went to Howard University, she pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], she was the queen of everything--the queen of the Q's [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], the queen of the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], she was very active on, on-campus; her brother, Dr. Donald Hughes, went to Morgan [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and went to Howard Medical Schools [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.]; he was a practicing physician for some time.  Uncle Donald, as a matter of fact, is well-known in his own right; he's one of the first African Americans who got involved in horse racing and he's in the process, and has been for many, many years.  He's left his medical practice and now he's into raising and breeding horses, so he's done very well in that area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, where did your mother go to school?
Speaker 2: She went to school in Baltimore [Maryland]; she went to Booker T. Washington [Booker T. Washington Middle School of Arts, Baltimore, Maryland] and she went--for what we call junior high school and Douglass Senior High School, at that time, in Baltimore City; that's where, you know, a lot of African Americans, you know, went, went to school.  And when she went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], she majored in art, and when she majored in art, she was an undergrad and my father [James McAllister] was a law school student at Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.], and they met, and after graduation, the two of them got married.  My mom is a very--anybody who knows her--is no shrinking violet; she's a very strong, dynamic woman who has her own ways about herself.  She went into teaching, as a matter of fact, and when you go back to Baltimore and talk to people, you always say, "What school did you go to, and if you took art."  And if you took Miss--you know, took my mom, Miss McAllister, "Oh, you know, we had her," you know.  It was sorta like, you know, back in those days, there were strong disciplinarian activities going on in schools where, I hate to admit it, but oftentimes, you know, they would rap [ph.] your, you know, knuckles with a ruler, and she was one of those where people would say, "Yeah, she was very strong and disciplined but she was a very good teacher."  And to this day, there are people who are good friends of ours 'cause a lot of the students used to, you know, baby-sit for my sisters and I, and they've become very close to the family, and my mom's become a second mother to a lot of them.  She's still very active in Baltimore, Maryland; she's in her bridge clubs and social organizations like (unclear), and so she's still very active and very vital in her community.  As a matter of fact, the church in--at Sharp Street Church [Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church, Baltimore, Maryland] which was our family church--was the AME church [American Methodist Episcopal Church] that I talked to you about Bishop Hughes, she's very active in, you know, trying to get the cemetery funded because there are a lot of us, meaning, you know, African Americans, who are in the cemetery, and it hasn't been kept up over the years 'cause oftentimes some families have moved to the, the other areas outside of the inner city, so she's very active in trying to make sure that that cemetery is kept up in a way it should be for our ancestors.
Story_ID: 186654
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [James McAllister], you know.  What is he like, or is he still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Dad was--he was a criminal lawyer in Baltimore [Maryland].  I don't know if you ever saw that movie--it wasn't 'Tin Man' but there's a movie--I wish I could remember the name of it because there's a, a writer, originally from Baltimore, who wrote 'Tin Man' and--oh, 'Liberty Heights.'  I don't know if you saw the movie 'Liberty Heights.'  Anyway, it was interesting because in that movie it, it signifies what Baltimore was like back in the '50s and '60s and early '70s --the separation between African Americans and the Jewish community and the Gentile community, and there were--there was a gentleman, an African American gentleman, who was very active, Little Willie [ph.]--not Little Willie--I won't even mention the guy's name.  Anyway, it was a gentleman who was very active in--one needs to be careful about what they say on tape.  My father was a big criminal lawyer; many of his clients came to him for representation, and he was very good at what he did because he would get them out of jail oftentimes; and they may not have had the money to pay for their--his services, and oftentimes there would be fur coats for delivery or there'd be a pink Cadillac outside the house, and my mother [Ann Hughes] would always say, "Get the money, get the money" (laughter).  So it was interesting because the, the folks that represented were people who had access to that kind of work.  But I guess the point I'm making, he was very good in his means of representation in the--at the criminal level.  As a matter of fact, he was in the State's Attorney's Office and he was the first African American Assistant State's Attorney out of the state of Maryland, and he--as a matter of fact, Larry Gibson just did a piece, I don't know if you heard about this, on African American lawyers in the state of Maryland from eighteen--the last 100 years, but he started from 1850 to 1950, and they had a big showing at the library in Baltimore about three weeks ago.  My father was honored and represented there because of his work he did in the community.  He ran for politics--he ran for City Council several times; unfortunately, he didn't win but he was well-known as a excellent criminal lawyer in the State of Maryland, and particularly in Baltimore City--very big in what they call the Monumental Bar Association [Monumental City Bar Association], which is still very vibrant and active in, in Baltimore City; that's the offset of the National Bar Association.  As you know, every city where there's a large African American community has its own, you know, city or state associations, and Monumental Bar Association was the offset of the National Bar Association.
Speaker 1: So that, that was for the lawyers in the Maryland area?
Speaker 2: In Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Just in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in Baltimore; and there were other ones throughout the state, as well.  Oftentimes, the meetings were held in our living room at our home, when I was growing up, and dad was very active and, and vibrant in, in that part of the community.
Story_ID: 186655
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: It's interesting.  In Baltimore City [Maryland] growing up in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], there was a woman by the name of Rosina Ridgely [ph.] who was very fair-complected, and she was good friends of my mom and my dad, and also good friends of ours, the Randolphs; and she would take my sister and myself and Lisa, who's the daughter of the Randolphs, on outings.  And in Baltimore, I remember when we were about maybe five or six, Rosina took us to an amusement park; well, we didn't know at five or six what racism was all about.  And when she took us there, it was for whites only, and what happened was when, when I first had my first experience of racism, we got on one of those little rides with the little boats that take you around, around and around, and Lisa's very fair-complected and at that time it was about--you know, you probably couldn't tell what I was and they thought I was white, but Donna was a little dark--a little more olive and melon in her skin, and as soon as we got in those boats, there were--I'll always remember the vision of this big Caucasian gentleman who said, "The boats don't work."  And as a little kid, you're tryin' to figure out what's goin' on.  And then when we got outta the boats, then he had the other white kids, you know, riding in the boats.  In Baltimore City that was my first experience of what racism was, and not really recognizing, you know, how that all came to be or what that meant, you know, that--to be a kid at four or five.  But growing up in Baltimore, we went basically to interra--you know--interracial schools.  We were in a school--in elementary school--it was a combination of, of black and white, but it was interesting.  When you first went to the school, this is in Baltimore, and you're in first or second grade; it was a major--it was maybe majority white and--two-thirds white, one-third black; but as you got closer to sixth grade, you noticed how it became more of color, and the white folks were taking their, their kids out of those schools.  It was a time where the African American community was taking--was, you know, going more into Baltimore City, and in Baltimore, recognizing how that city's set up.  You know, first you had the Gentiles that were in this inner-city, and after that, then the Jews, and then it, it was the African Americans.  I mean it's probably not unlike many urban areas and what's happened over the years and, and as a child growing up, I mean one could see that dynamic.  By the time I got to junior high school, that was Lamell Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland]--that's where my mother was a teacher, and that's where--and that was mostly an African American school and, and it was a great experience; I was a salutatorian, I graduated second in my class, and I had to give a little speech, and my father [James McAllister] used to--he wrote my speech, and I'd keep practicing with him; I will never forget it--"With heavy heart I welcome friends, parents"--I mean, you know, I'm like thirteen (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Heavy heart (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, with heavy heart I--you know, "Dad, I'm not in a court room with heavy heart" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Sound like the LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] speech, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, got this--one of his political speeches, he's writing my speech (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanna take--
Story_ID: 186656
Speaker 1: --Take you back to when you were a little kid and to ask you what kind of a little girl were you?  What did you like to do and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, as a child, you know, we always had music in our home; I played the violin, my sister Donna played piano, my mom [Ann Hughes] played the cello, so it was always lots of music in our home.  You know, we--you know, we had my uncle Donald, who I mentioned earlier, my mom's brother, his wife Arnistell, she was a dancer, and we used to take dance classes with her.  It was always lots of activity at the house; I guess as a kid--I'm the oldest of two girls and a, and a brother, and Donna, who's my sister, well we're only eighteen months apart, and then there's Leslie who is thirteen years younger 'cause she was the child my mother would--said, "Oops!  Didn't know," but we love--you know, so Leslie popped up.  And then I had a, a brother, James W. McAllister, Jr.; unfortunately, Jay [ph.] had cerebral palsy and Jay was a few years younger than, than Donna.  So it was a situation where, you know, Jay was in the home but you're always hoping that, you know, one day--it was always my wish; every, every birthday, it was, "Please God, please, you know, help Jay get better."  Unfortunately, because of, you know, kids that have that kind of, of problem, he died of respiratory illness when he was eighteen years old; but that has always been a loss to us in our family.  But the home was always very warm, and as a kid, I guess--I wouldn't say I was a quiet kid.  I guess we were always rather precocious; I mean we'd always ride our bicycles, you know, out and about in the community--very neighborhood--everybody knew everybody on the block, you know.  If you did somethin' wrong, you know, the--Miss, Miss Sadie down the street will tell your parents--of a situation where we'd have, you know, cook-offs or bake-offs in, in, in, in the, in the neighborhood.  We always had animals--dogs and cats; I remember one year, I found this white shepherd where we used to always go to this area called Hindler House, which we always called--oh, it was a spooky house, and it was a, it was a puppy--maybe--boy, couldn't have been more than a few days old, but it was caught in the, caught in the bushes, and his--all four of his legs were pronged out, and I brought it home and we, you know, we found out his legs were all--were broken, and we had to feed him from a bottle.  But I always called him Misere [ph.] Puppiet [ph.] 'cause that's the day I--those are the days I was taking my French, so Mr. White Paper (laughter).  But anyway, when you're a kid, I guess that makes sense to you.  And anyway, the dog grew up to be a beautiful, beautiful white shepherd--Dolce shepherd, for that matter; but somebody stole him outta our backyard.  So, it was situation growin' up, we always, you know, took care of animals, had 'em in the house, and our parents were, you know, kind enough to let us do this kinda stuff.  So I guess, you know, I was always very studious--studied a lot, always, you know, always wanted to get A's all the time, my parents always, you know, instilling that upon us to do well in school.  So, I guess that gives you some sense or flavor as to our upbringing.
Story_ID: 186657
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: We called it School Number 18 [Mordecai Gist Public School, Baltimore, Maryland]; they were numbers back in those days.  I'm sure it had a, had a name--I wanna say Mordecai Gist.  In fact, it's still in Baltimore [Maryland], but it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)-- Mordecai Gist?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was Lamell Junior High school [Baltimore, Maryland].  And then for high school, they built--when I was growin' up they'd built a new school called Northwestern Senior High School [Baltimore, Maryland], and that was out in Park Heights in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went to Northwestern?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 186658
Speaker 1: When you were in grade school, are there any teachers that really stand out as important to your--in your development?
Speaker 2: Yeah, this woman named Mrs. Gayle [ph.], who I had for third grade, who was--always stuck out more than any other, you know, teacher back in grade school.  She'd always take the time; if you didn't understand anything, or you needed any help, to give you that kind of assistance.  Always nice, always very friendly, always warm, and always give you that special attention, and that always meant a lot because when you're in, when you're in school, and when you're in a classroom, there're so many students and probably many are competing for interest or, or some don't even wanna be bothered, but she was one in which always reached out, and that always meant a lot to me, and she was very special and stood out in my mind.
Story_ID: 186659
Speaker 1: What were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Social studies and history; those were my favorite subjects.  I remember one year being put in honors math; and I never understood how I got in honors math 'cause that was never one of my big subjects.  As a matter of fact, I remember sitting--she was a very good friend of mine, Joan Pratt, who's now--she went--she was a CPA [certified public accountant]; she was always great in math.  I mean if--some of us who understand the A and the Bs, or the left or right side of your--our brains, and Joan is now the, the Controller [sic, comptroller] for Baltimore City [Maryland], and I can imagine--I mean it's elected position but, you know, Joan's good at that.  But social studies and history, I mean, those were always my, my favorite subjects; I was always interested in that area.
Story_ID: 186660
Speaker 1: Did you follow the Civil Rights Movement on--in the news and on television, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; I mean everybody--you know, as we talk on November 22, 2003, and if you turn on the television, you're seeing that forty years later after, you know, John F. Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] death, and I remember, you know, it's, it's one of those moments and everybody can always remember where they were, you know, when they heard, and I remember being on the steps of one of our neighbors and, you know, the kids were playing and then everyone--it's like everybody stopped, and you ran to your televisions to find out what was goin' on.  With regard to the--so I was young, I was--you know, that was in the '60s [1960s] so, you know, I was only in my earlier years, so I followed what was going on, and you heard the speeches of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], and you saw what was goin' on, and then [President] Lyndon [Baines] Johnson and the signing the Civil Rights Act.  As a matter of fact, my father [James McAllister], when he was practicing law, also--practiced law with--I mentioned W.A.C.  Hughes, my grandfather's brother?  His son, Alfred Hughes [William Alfred Carroll Hughes, Jr.], was very active with Thurgood Marshall in Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], back in those days, with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And, I mean that was somethin' that we'd always hear about in our house--our home, or we'd go over Uncle Al's house and, you know, and hear those stories, so it was somethin' that--we were familiar with what was goin' on 'cause our parents were involved in a very big way.
Story_ID: 188294
Speaker 1: Junior high school--Lamell Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland]; any, any reflections about junior high?
Speaker 2: Junior high school--yeah; as a matter of fact, Lisa Randolph [ph.], I mentioned earlier, that we were growing up--four or five years old--and Donna and I--it's so funny because we used to always do the--when they always had the school plays, we'd always do the dances for the school play (laughter), and we'd always go to Lisa's basement and make up the dances, and you would think we were real choreographers.  But anyway (laughter), it was good enough for the junior high school play, and we--actually, we were pretty creative, so that's one of the things that sticks in my mind.  And Robbie Pinkett [Robsol Pinkett, Jr.], as a matter of fact--Jada Pinkett's father, he was in high school--I mean junior high school with us, and Robbie was always the star; that's where Jada probably gets a lot of her talent from, of our, of our junior high school plays because he was always Scrooge in the Christmas play, or whatever, you know, was the lead role, Robbie was always, you know, the, the number one actor.  So that was always--that always stuck in my mind.  We, we had a pretty enriching junior high school when I think about it; that was the time when I, when I was first chair of the violin; I, I mentioned music.  And I always remembered one of my music instructors used to always say to me, "You know, the first day you don't practice, you know it; the second day you don't practice, your mother knows it; the third day you don't practice your violin, the world knows it.  Well, at this point in life, the universe knows it," but (laughter) it was something, you know that always was near and dear to my heart 'cause I, I love music and, you know, we used to--we had a great, a great orchestra at Lamell, and we were very active and vital in those activities--and in school; I mean I mentioned, you know, in junior high school I was salutatorian, so I musta liked it because, you know, that was the--with heavy hearts--no, that--yeah, that was the with heavy hearts speech that my dad [James McAllister] helped me put together; but--had a lotta good friends, a lotta good teachers.  This is the school where I mentioned that my mom [Anna Hughes] was also teaching at, so everybody knew everybody's business; if you did anything wrong, my mother would leave her classroom and come down and--to your classroom, you know and, and you never wanted to have that happen.  As a matter of fact, you wanted to change your last name so people didn't know that was your mother (laughter).  "Are you Ms. McAllister's daughter?"  "Oh, no; no, it's not us."  My sisters and I would--my sister and I would never want anybody to know.  But it was a great experience; it was enriching, I had a lotta good friends, it was a time, you know, where it, it was all good--yeah, in junior high school.

Speaker 1: High school--you went to Northwestern [Senior High School, Baltimore, Maryland]; now, are all--have all these high schools so far been integrated up to this point?
Speaker 2: At this point, Northwestern was integrated; junior high school was at Lamell [Junior High School Baltimore, Maryland]; that was an inner city, and then you started movin' outside of Baltimore [Maryland] on Park Heights Avenue, the way Baltimore is set up, and Northwestern was a new school, and that was combina--that was integrated but that was mostly your Jewish and African American community--yeah, at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, grade school was all-black, basically?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the one I was telling you; grade school was--you started off with two-thirds--one-third; by the time you finished grade school, it was mostly African Americans.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So its people were spreading out into neighborhoods and neighborhoods changing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, but they were--yeah, the, the white community was, was, was exiting the city and moving out into the county--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and Northwestern was one of the schools when they opened, it was getting closer out to the county; that's why it was still integrated by the time I had to go to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so Northwestern High School--what was it like?
Speaker 2: Northwestern was--actually, Northwestern was fun.  It was a situation where the Jewish and African American community, we worked very well together.  As a matter of fact, I remember several--the, the girls that I met there were, you know, you go over there houses for dinner and you have them at your house for dinner, and that wasn't--you know, we didn't have that in junior high school 'cause it was mostly an all-African American experience.  A situation where I was still in the orchestra, still in--doing the plays, still doing well in school, a situation where, when I was in the eleventh grade, I was a real hit because I was the second person in my class who got their own car (laughter); you know how you get your driver's license, and I worked during the summers and I saved enough money--not enough--saved up some money to get a car--all of $800 (laughter).  Back in those days you couldn't really get a car with $800, so my mother [Ann Hughes] and father [James McAllister]--back in the day of the Maverick, and I remember about that back then--1990--nineteen hundred and ninety-five dollars, you can get a Ford Maverick, and I got one of those orange Mavericks with the black and white, you know, tweed seats, and there was another girl in the school who got a Maverick; it was that lime green Maverick, so she and I were the first two in our class to get our cars, so then you became very popular because all your friends wanted to ride around.  So, you know, it was--high school was fun; I mean we, we had the pep rallies, you had the football; it was a new school, so you had all the new facilities with the tennis and all the sports and, you know, all of that extra academic, you know, curriculum stuff that you like.  I have nothin' negative to say about that; don't know what else to tell you about high school.  It was just an enriching experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And I went to junior school--and, and I went to the junior prom and two senior proms (laughter).
Speaker 1: And two senior proms!
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, I know, I know; back in those days it was a big deal.
Story_ID: 188296
Speaker 1: Any teachers stand out in high school [Northwestern Senior High School, Baltimore, Maryland] that you remember?  Any--
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  God, you're makin', makin' me think; I'm sure there were, but I--and I'm lookin' at a couple of 'em but I can't remember their names.  I remember a--my--one of my history professors, Mr. Schwartz [ph.], 'cause I--as I mentioned, a combination of, you know, it was an integrated school at that level--was, was always good.  He stood--I think he was one of the reasons I liked history so much; he made history come alive.  He brought true, you know, relevance to, to what it would--you know, what--you know, looking at history and you have to understand your past to understand your future and where we are and, you know, that was very profound to me, and I remember reading a lot about history and became a--somewhat of a history buff at that point.  So I guess he probably made a real profound impact on me than anybody else.
Story_ID: 188297
Speaker 1: Well [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated, I think, when you were in high school [Northwestern Senior High School, Baltimore, Maryland], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.  That was another one of those moments when one recognized where you were, at that time, when you heard about, you know, Martin Luther King, and people were, you know, very, you know, upset.  I mean, you know, here in Washington [Washington, D.C.], you had demonstrations on fourteenth street.  In Baltimore [Maryland], we did the--I remember the police, you know, were out in all force 'cause they were concerned about what's gonna happen in Baltimore 'cause at this point, we're becoming, you know, very prominent in, in the city, meaning the African American community, but--and there were--I remember being--living on Linden Avenue [Baltimore, Maryland], and around the corner, after King's assassination; there's a shopping area called White Lot, and my mom made sure that my sisters and I stayed in the house because people were out there, you know, demonstrating and throwing bottles and bricks and destroying the White Lot community, which was basically still like a business community.  We had the grocery stores and all--and the cleaners and restaurants; and that stood out in my mind that that was happening just up around the--up the street and around the corner from us.  Lots of people got arrested, lots of crack-down, but that brought home the real impact of such a national figure on what was happening right in your own backyard and the reaction it had to people in your community--and even yourself.
Speaker 1: Was anything special done at school--at Northwestern?
Speaker 2: I don't recall because Northwestern was further out; I mean that's one reason why the car was really important to me because you had--you know, it was so far out to get to the school; it was almost out in the county, that's why you had the, the combination of the interracial school, because it was outside the city; so I didn't see anything special happening in Northwestern, or remember anything special at Northwestern.
Speaker 1: The reason why I'm asking is 'cause the reactions of, you know, of--there are some interesting reactions around this--police departments, they were--reacted a certain way, on college campuses there were certain reactions, I mean--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sometimes you get a real sympathetic reaction from an all-white body, and sometimes you wouldn't; you'd get an ugly reaction about Dr. King, so I don't know if they--out at Northwestern and they, they didn't have any special commemoration or any services or anything out there, or did they talk about it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah, I do remember some, some commemor--yeah, some special services; it wasn't, it wasn't a negative reaction at all.  I mean it, it, it was a situation where--I guess if you had to say liberal; I mean Northwestern would be, would be of that, of that nature, and the folks that, that went to that school, and we did have services, but it wasn't the kinda--a neg--it wasn't anything negative at all, it was all rather positive and actually sad that this situation happened in our country and this particular time, and such a pivotal leader was, you know, assassinated in such, in such a way.  But it was a--you know, it was more a mourning than anything else; it wasn't, you know--everybody recognized that.  It wasn't--we didn't get any backlash to it at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 188298
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, when you were a senior in high school [Northwestern Senior High School, Baltimore, Maryland], did you, did you know what you wanted to pursue in college?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was eight years old, my father [James McAllister] used to always take me to court with him--I mentioned he was a litigator; and he would always take me to court with him to watch him try cases, and I would--and I thought I wanted to be a--so he kinda drilled into me about the idea of being a lawyer, so the situation--do I wanna be a lawyer 'cause I wanna be a lawyer, or do I wanna be an attorney because my father kind of instilled this in me?  I mean he was the kind of lawyer that--I'll show you pictures of him; he's like a, a, a, Clark Gable look-alike; I mean very handsome, very dashing, and he--he'd always win his cases, and he would always say to me, "I'm gonna show you my techniques."  And one technique, and one of his secrets was, is he would put an onion in a handkerchief, and then, then when he'd have to go to the jury, you know, and there were--he always made sure lots of women were on the jury, and he'd go up and he'd, you know, plead his case on behalf of his client, and he'd act like he was blowin' his nose and, you know, then the onions would make his eye tear, and then he would have tears coming down his eyes and pleading, you know, the case for his--on behalf of his client; I mean it was very dramatic, I mean, yeah--Oscar material here (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--He honored the heavy heart speech, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that was the heavy heart, you know?  What do I say?  So (laughter)--so he was very theatrical in his day.  So it was, it was a situation where, you know, I wasn't sure did I wanna do this, or is it something that my dad wanted me to do.  And then I thought--well, you know, actually, I thought I might be interested in, in science and being a, a physician like my, my grandfather.  So when I went into--I went to the University of Maryland [College Park, College Park, Maryland]--
Speaker 1: When did you graduate?  In (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971], okay.
Speaker 2: Northwestern.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay; back on the career path thing.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, when I went to University of Maryland, College Park the first year I basically took the--you know, the prerequisites that you're supposed to take the first year, and one of the classes I took was botany--yeah, and when I took botany, I said, "Wait a minute; if I can't get these plants straight--I mean I'm not wired to know the veins of this and the veins of that, etcetera."  I said, "I'm not even gonna try to go with people because if that's the case, this is definitely not my forte."  So I decided to switch my major to political science and African American studies, and I graduated with a double major in African American studies and poli sci [political science], thinking that the--either international or law; so, I wasn't quite clear about what area I wanted to move in, but it was more into that legal realm, so we were moving in that direction in undergrad.
Story_ID: 188299
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, who were some of your teachers at University of Maryland [College Park, College Park, Maryland] in political science and African American studies?
Speaker 2: Dr.--oh, the guy who was head of the department--[Mariyawanda] Nzuwah --Dr. Nzuwah, who was from Zimbabwe, who was head of the African American studies department at the University of Maryland.  It was--I think I was the second--I was with the second group of students who graduated with a major in African American studies at Maryland at that time because that's (unclear) from '71 [1971] to '75 [1975], and it was a newly-created department; that's why--as, as I told you, I double-majored in that and poli sci [political science], so I wasn't really sure it was--where the African American studies would take me, so I had the poli sci [political science] backup.  But Nzuwah was truly--made a profound impact on me because, you know, to really learn about Africa--I mean we always say as African Americans, you know, what does that really mean?  In the African American studies department you learned about Africa, the cultures of Africa--I mean it's a, it's, it's, it's a continent with several states, and when people say Africa, they think it's just one country--no, it's a continent.  And then, you know, he opened our eyes to figure out, you know, really what is going on over there.  And then it was a time where they also had classes in, you know, the early '70s, on civil rights movements when you learned more about Malcolm X, and now [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  I was very active in the Civil Rights Movement at University of Maryland; we had a newspaper called the Black Explosion. I was its advertising director and helped them get the money to keep the thing goin' with the ads.  This woman named Pat Wheeler [ph.], who's still around, she used to be our editor; and another woman, Sandra Dawson [HistoryMaker Sandra Long Weaver], who's now chief editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer, we were all at Maryland together, and I remember we were very active with the Black Student Union; I mean when I went to the University of Maryland, we were the largest African American class to enter the school.  There was a time when they were trying to promote affirmative action at--soon--I'm sure soon after the Civil Rights Act, and during that time frame where--because Maryland was, you know, pretty much a racist state, and University of Maryland there weren't that many of us there, so we had a considerable amount of us in that entering class.  Unfortunately, it was a situation that, in '71 [1971], there were all of us--there were a lot of us, and I can't remember the exact number; it was maybe 800 or so, but as time of graduation, you noticed how we went down to, maybe to 25 percent of our entering class, for a variety of reasons, you know--either economics or, you know, couldn't, you know, deal with that kind of environment.  It was a big transition for a lot of us going--putting in that kind of environment at Maryland.  But I remember sitting--I was very active with the Black Student Union.  I remember sitting with--oh, why am I forgetting his name?  The Muslim leader--Dr.--it begins with an F.
Speaker 1: Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan]?
Speaker 2: Minister Farrakhan--thank you.  Wanna get back in--many younger days, we were at the Black Student Union, we would have speakers come talk to us, and having a one-on-one dialogue with him, and that was very profound.  I remember back in the day when people were wearin' afros and my hair wouldn't quite do that, so I'd go out and get an afro wig (laughter); I mean the stuff we would try to do, you know, to try to blend in.  And, at Maryland, it was a time also where my mom--I mentioned at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], she pledged AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], and Maryland's campus there was a move to try to get some black sororities and fraternities on campus because there was an area called Fraternity Row at University of Maryland which there were all white fraternities and sororities.  So, I was the--being the advertising director of the Black Explosion Newspaper, I hooked up with a woman named Jatrice Gator [ph.], and she wanted to start a chapter of AKA, too, so the two of said, "Well, why don't we try to pull it off?"  And so then I was able to put the free ads in the newspaper (laughter).  In the Black Explosion, those interested in Tiaka [ph.], those interested in Alpha Kappa Alpha--we would call meetings together of the girls that were interested in maybe pledging AKA; and to do AKA, you have to at least have twelve women with a particular grade point average and to start--that's to start the chapter; and I mean that--we had twelve women and, and that group changed every, every now and then 'cause it took us about two years to get the sorority on campus, and we were working very aggressively 'cause the Delta's were trying to do it around the same time we were tryin' to do it, and we had the National Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, and our regional director worked very aggressively, and we're the founding chapter of AKA.  And people now have to go back and read about us because that was back in 1973, '74 [1974] when we, you know, founded that chapter.  So, Maryland was--Maryland was--you know, one of the things I used to always say in my life is that if I could, you know, graduate from University of Maryland, I always thought that that was accomplishment--during those times, and all of the different things that were goin' on, and I'm glad to have been able to do that.  Made a lotta good friends, and a lot of folks who I made friends with are, are doin' some really important stuff right now, so that's good to see.
Story_ID: 188300
Speaker 1: Now, what was the director of Afro American studies' name again, and how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: Mario [Mariyawanda] Nzuwah, M-A-R-I-O, Nzuwah, E---no, Nzuwah, it was--it's with a N, N-Z-U-W-A-H, Nzuwah.  As a matter of fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And he was from--
Speaker 2: Zimbabwe.
Speaker 1: Zimbabwe, okay.
Speaker 2: Matter of--well, at that time, it was Rhodesia; later it--you know, after independence became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right, 'cause they were still strugglin' for independence at that time, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, as a matter of fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--and they were in the news a lot; all their leaders--[Ndabaningi] Sithole and [Robert] Mugabe, and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all of 'em were in the news.
Speaker 2: (Unclear), yeah, with their liberation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Joshua Nkomo, and--yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Um-hm.  As a matter of fact, Nzuwah--I was trying to get in contact with him a few years ago when I was in Zimbabwe, maybe four or five years ago, because I understood that he, he went back to Zimbabwe after independence, and he was either--I think administer of transportation, I was told; so he stayed active.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Zimbabwe was hot then.  Rhodesia or--that struggle was really hot in those days, in the early '70s.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because what happened was, after I graduated from Maryland, I worked for [HistoryMaker the Honorable] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], and we were very active when Rhodesia--it's the Rhodesia (unclear) Sanction issue-- when the United States was tryin' to put sanctions on Rhodesia until they got independence, and--
Speaker 1: Does that have anything to do with why we, we saw the decline in the use of chrome on automobiles?  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: Oh, probably so; I'm, I'm sure; those sanctions lasted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--All the (unclear) are plastic now, and it was--chrome was the, was the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah, back in the day, back in the day.  Oh, yeah, back in the day that was really an issue--yeah.  So, that was Rhodesia.  And Nzuwah, that's where he is--Zimbabwe now.
Speaker 1: I know people would lecture about the chrome on the cars, and they would say that most of the--a lot of the components that go into a car come from Africa, everything from the oil to the rubber to the chrome (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's true--
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  They don't recognize that.
Story_ID: 188301
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was Mary Frances Barry at the University of Maryland [College Park, College Park, Maryland] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Barry, yeah, yeah.  DeWayne Wickham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, DeWayne Wickham.  As a matter of fact, DeWayne Wickham was a person who had a real impact on my--in my direction of going into the political arena.  When I was at the University of Maryland, I had to do an intern--I did an internship, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Internship Program when they had that; and [HistoryMaker the Honorable] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], who was the member of [U.S.] Congress who represented Baltimore--Seventh Congressional District who, as a matter of fact, lived around the corner from us when we were growing up; my dad knew him very well--was a member from Baltimore, and DeWayne Wickham said, "Well, why don't you do an internship of Parren Mitchell?"  'Cause I needed to have a internship to earn my political science--for my degree, and DeWayne did talk to Parren, and I knew Parren, and he was very instrumental in my getting my internship that summer, working for Parren my third year at University of Maryland; and soon thereafter, after I finished my internship with Parren, he offered me a job as a legislative assistant because my plan was to go to law school right outta undergrad.  So Wickham was very active; he's a--played a pivotal part; he's an editori--in fact--read--you know the name DeWayne Wickham?  He does a lotta cop--he does--he writes for--he's a writer; he's written a few books, and he also is--does an editorial for USA Today; very, very accomplished gentleman.  And DeWayne--did I ever thank DeWayne for that?  But I'll have to let him--I think I have--for that--opening up that door for me.
Story_ID: 188302
Speaker 1: Now, anything else about the University of Maryland [College Park, College Park, Maryland] when you were there?
Speaker 2: Gosh, so much was goin' on in Maryland.  No, I mean the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] and, you know, doing well and graduating on the dean's list and just getting through that experience.  I do remember, though, you were asking about civil rights earlier; that was a time also around the Vietnam [War] era, as well.  And I recall being in my dorm room one day and, you know, Maryland was one of those places where there was always lots of protests, and the student body there--there were always protests on campuses about Vietnam; very--very vibrant community.  I mean, you know, the students were active.  I'm, I'm starting to see the, the student (unclear) ship doing a little better now, because back in those days, I mean we were active in everything; I mean we were protesting, I mean, you know, we were, you know, wearin' our afros, we were talkin' to [HistoryMaker the Honorable Minister] Louis Farrakhan, we were creating sororities, we were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah, yeah; in those days, Farrakhan wasn't a national figure the way he is today.  Only in the black community was he a national figure 'cause he was the radio voice of Elijah Muhammad--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the early days just, 'cause now, there's a--I think when you speak of him in a national way now, most people know him from the media and some remarks he made about Jews or something, you know; but in those days, that was pre-those remarks, and he was the radio voice of Elijah Muhammad, basically.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Um-hm.  But those were the days where--I mean we were active and we were doin' something.  I mean, you know, we felt that we were making a difference and being very active in the community and, you know, we had programs of, you know, on the outskirts of the university.  We would tutor kids, you know in, in elementary or junior high school on their reading or, you know, on their home studies, and we would go out and do that kinda stuff.  So, I mean we were very--we were a close-knit group but we were a group in which we really thought, you know, we were the new coming, you know, and all that vitality about making a real difference in the world and, you know, being trailblazers.  So that's what I got more out of the University of Maryland; it was a great experience but it was--but, you know, it was a--not but--and it was an experience where, you know, you thought you were ready to go out and, and conquer the world.  And I'll always remember one of the things that one of my father's [James McAllister] friends used to tell us.  He said, "The first year when you"--I remember he told this when I was--told me when I was just going to University of Maryland.  He says, "The first year you realize you don't know anything"--no, he says, "The first year when you're an undergrad, you think that you know everything; the second year you start realizing you, you don't know much at all; between the third and fourth year--no, third year, you think you may know a little bit more than you knew the second year, and the fourth year when you get ready to go out into the world, you may think you know, but you don't know nothin'" (laughter)--Lorenzo Handy.  And he told us--told me that when I was goin' to college; and he's actually--absolutely right, but you thought you knew it when you jumped out there.
Story_ID: 188303
Speaker 1: What did you do after graduation [from University of Maryland, College Park, College Park, Maryland], or did you have any official role in the graduation ceremonies or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, not really.  I mean the university had thousands of folks so, no; just stand up, sit down (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, did you go right to Howard [University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] afterwards--to a law school?
Speaker 2: No.  What happened to me at--that was the point I was making earlier, is that I thought I was gonna go to law school right after undergrad, but [HistoryMaker the Honorable] Parren [J.] Mitchell [III], after my internship, offered me a position as a legislative assistant and, you know, at twenty-one years old, I mean I said, "Of course;" it's a great opportunity, you know, at that time, to work on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  So I delayed my graduate studies and worked as a legislative assistant for Parren Mitchell, and that was probably one of the best things I did because working on Capitol Hill is a great experience.  When you're working up there, and when you go up there even today, you'll see there are a lotta young folks up there that have very powerful or significant positions, and you always probably wonder why.  I think probably one of the reasons is because members of Congress are only allowed a certain amount of clerk hire in their budget, and they have district offices that they have to fund, and congressional offices that have the funds; therefore, you're not talking about a lotta money.  So you may have maybe your top tier--maybe your administrative assistant, you know, your new chief of staff, or your legislative director, that get the--you know--reasonable lotta money, but your legislative assistants, legislative correspondents--onward, maybe not as high.  But with Parren, he--at that time, he was on the House Banking Committee and the House Small Business Committee, and on the Hill, you realize that you jump in with all fours because there is a limitation on how much, you know, staff there is and, you know, you are the point person for that member of Congress who has to get things done.  So Parren, at that time, wanted to move forward on creating the African Development Bank, you know, because of my African experience and, you know, all of--my degree in African studies--we wanted to move forward in that direction.  So I, you know, worked and drafted the legislation to get the initial 50 million dollars of US contribution to the African Development Bank, and Parren asked for fifty million.  No, I take it--that was 150 million; that's what it was initially 'cause Parren always thought that--'cause he says, "Ask for 150 and we know they're gonna whittle it down and we can perhaps get more."  So, we drafted the legislation, we asked for 150 million, and drafted the testimony, and Parren went over to both the House and Senate and testified before the Senate Banking Committees, and I can say that we were successful in getting the initial 25 million dollars (laughter), so Parren was right--ask for 150 and we ended up with twenty five.  But that was the beginning of the United States involvement in the African Development Bank.  Back in those days, that was one of my first assignments, having with worked with Parren Mitchell on some of his issues.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Anything else with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, Parren--those of you who--and I hope you do get an opportunity to include him in your HistoryMakers series 'cause he truly is a, is a legend and a real history-maker.  At that time, Parren created what he called the Minority Business Brain Trust, and what he was trying to do, and he was the first in pulling that kind of effort together on a national level, is put together African American business persons, and to be his think tank as we moved forward to create legislation that affected the African American business community.  He was the first back in the day that created the 10 Percent Set-Aside and Service Transportation Act for Minority Business.  There's been lots of talk since then, as you probably know, with Supreme Court, with something called the Aderand case [Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena], and with the Clinton Administration about, you know, "Mend it, don't end it," because Parren, during his leadership in minority business, was the first to create the ten percent as I mentioned in the transportation--Department of Transportation--but since then, the Department of Energy has the Set-Aside Program, USAID, United States Agency for International Development, had the Gray [ph.] Amendment, which is the ten percent set-aside, DOD [Department of Defense] had a five percent set-aside, and we can go on and on and on, but Parren was, Parren was the true leader in starting that movement, and I was happy when I worked with him to be--have had--you know, been a part of that experience as well.  And it wasn't just the ten percent set-aside program; Parren worked very aggressively with the Small Business Administration in what they call the Section 8A Program, to create, you know, eligibility to participate in sole--at that time--sole source contracts--with minority businesses as well.  So, having, you know--being able to have been a part of that movement in the minority business community in the work that Parren was doing, and also with members of the Congressional Black Caucus--keep in mind that this was a time back in the--this was in '75 [1975] we're talking about now when I graduated from the University of Maryland--from '75 [1975] to '78 [1978], that the Congressional Black Caucus was truly a very viable--viable organization and entity in its own right.
Story_ID: 186671
Speaker 1: Where did you go when you left Parren Mitchell's [HM Parren J. Mitchell, III]?  Is there anything else about Parren Mitchell's office?
Speaker 2: Oh, no; the only comment I was gonna make about the Black Caucus [Congressional Black Caucus] and during the time when Parren was chair of the Minority Business Brain Trust, it was a time the Congressional Black Caucus really worked very effectively; not that they're not working effectively now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Well, the Caucus was new, right?  So let's say, let's say that (Simultaneous)--Yeah, the Caucus was new, and it was a time where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And--'cause you graduated from University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] in what year?  What was it?
Speaker 1: Seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: Seventy-five [1975], and the Caucus was started '73 [1973] or so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the early '70s [1970s]; it was the early '70s [1970s], and during my tenure with Parren, he became chairman of the Black Caucus.  And the point I was gonna make, although it was new, it was very cohesive; it was a time where Parren was chair of the Minority Business Brain Trust, but you had Andy Young [HM the Honorable Andrew Young]; he was chair of his particular brain trust.  You had Gus Hawkins [HM the Honorable August F. Hawkins] who was chair of the Education Brain Trust; you had Bill Clay [HM the Honorable William Lacy Clay, Sr.], you had [HM] John Conyers who was chair of the Judicial Criminal Justice Brain Trust, and these members basically reached out on a national level and put together their own in-house council, or kitchen cabinets, Parren would call it, on these particular areas, and the purpose was to pull these meetings together so you got the black intellectual capital and capabilities to evolve, to create some legislation; so it wasn't just pulling people together for the sake of pulling them together, but pulling them together for the sake of coming up with an agenda and having that agenda be turned into legislation, and have that legislation to be turned into--as black--Congressional Black Caucus legislative initiatives.  And then what would happen in staff, you'd have [HM] Barbara Williams [-Skinner] who, at that time, was executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Ken Goldberg, who worked very effectively with us where we were a true family, where John Conyers is gonna do a "Dear Colleague" on this particular piece of legislation, then it was no if, and's about it; I mean Black Caucus--I mean your member would read it, but all members were on it.  I mean it was--I mean they were cohesive; if they said Black Caucus, you know, it went as a Black Caucus initiative.  I mean they worked hand-in-glove; I mean they true were a force--truly were a force to be reckoned with at a time in which maybe they only were maybe fifteen, sixteen of 'em; and then, obviously, they've now grown to almost forty.  And, in today's times, I mean there other reasons why it can't be the same because of other political dynamics and situations and viewpoints, but at that time in the mid-'70s [1970s], the Congressional Black Caucus was truly a force to be reckoned with and did quite a lot of effective stuff, and we were able to get legislation through.
Story_ID: 186672
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanna backtrack a little bit to--'cause I know during this period of time and on the political scene--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the National Black Political Assembly [sic, the National Black Political Convention] had taken place in Gary, Indiana in '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you go to that?  Did you have a chance to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--that was Gary, Indiana- [HM the Honorable] Richard Hatcher.
Speaker 1: You're right, right.
Speaker 2: Richard Hat--yes, as a matter of fact, that's gonna be a nice transition to what you're gettin' ready to say about my, my, my next position.  Yes, I did, and Richard Hatcher was very close (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--I know; 'cause I know students from all over the country (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah; we were there.
Speaker 1: It's a big deal.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal, and that was a time when the whole black, you know, movement was, was, was becoming consolidated and going in, in some direction.
Speaker 1: Yes, that's where the poli--the political people and the legal people were meeting with their activists for the first time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Exactly, exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--on a project.
Speaker 2: 'Cause Richard Hatcher was always in our office, and that's when--time when [HM the Honorable] Parren [J. Mitchell, III] was chairman of Congressional Black Caucus, so that went hand-in-glove.  Yeah, I'm glad--I forgot about that; I'm glad you brought that up because what happened was I'd met Richard Hatcher, and Richard Hatcher became the first chairman of the board of an organization called TransAfrica, and that's where I met him--in Parren Mitchell's office.  And at that time, there was a guy named Randall Robinson who worked for Congressman Charlie Diggs [Charles Coles Diggs, Jr.], who was from Detroit [Michigan], and he was the Chairman of the House of Africa Subcommittee [Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations], and Randall worked very aggressively with Herschell [ph.] (unclear) and others to help create this organization called TransAfrica.  Well, I was working for Parren and I was also doing Parren's international work, as--also witnessed by the African Development Bank legislation, and they asked me to become the first assistant director for TransAfrica, and Richard Hatcher was, as I mentioned earlier, its first head.  So that was a interesting transition because I'd said to Parren, after working for Parren for three years, about this--you know, about making this move from his office, and he thought it was a great thing to do because it was a new movement, you know, it was supposed to be an African American lobby for African Americans talkin' about our viewpoints for Africa in the Caribbean, and that was in 1978 that I started with Randall with TransAfrica.  Yeah, with TransAfrica, we'd opened the doors--there were only three of us--a woman by the name of Dolores Clemons who was our administrative assistant, myself, as assistant director, and Randall.  It was a new organization, novel in nature.  We got people, like Hatcher and others, on the board of direc--and Bert[ram] Lee--on the board of directors, and we had to come up with, you know, legislative agendas how we wanted to move forward with.  Well, this is a time--this is--no, this was the Rhodesia chrome sanction issue, as a matter of fact.  This was in '78 [1978], and the Rhodesia chrome sanction issue was going to come up on the floor of the House of Representatives, and we had only opened our doors for maybe just a few weeks.  And Randall, who was our executive director, he and his wife took a vacation because, you know, everybody worked hard to kinda get the doors open, but who knew that this legislation would come up so quickly?  So, members of the board were calling and said, "Wow, we gotta--you know, we need to actively be involved in this Rhodesia chrome sanction issue.  So Randall's now on vacation, he left no forwarding number.  I'm like, "Oh, my God, it's only me and Dolores; we gotta get this thing, you know, get in, in gear."  So, I went up and talked to Congressman Charlie Diggs [Charles Coles Diggs, Jr.] and talked to Parren so we could get TransAfrica actively involved.  We had been very active with African develop--ambassadorial community, so I called six African ambassadors and asked them to come up on the Hill while they were debating this issue on the floor of the House of Representatives.  So I worked with Congressman Charlie Diggs and had the ambassadors sit up in the gallery and had--Congressman Diggs, in his glory, said, "All of Africa is looking at you," and he mentioned the names of the six African amba--it might have been eight--African ambassadors, and how important, you know, this issue is for us to pass legislation, you know to, to put the sanctions of Rhodesia chrome and what was currently going on in that country.  And it really made a profound impact, and as a matter of fact, the next day, that's how we were able to get the name of TransAfrica on the map, because it was through the workings, you know, of myself through TransAfrica, we were able to position and stage the African diplomatic community's involvement in this activity, and members of the Congressional Black Caucus, you know, making reference to that; not only Congressman Diggs, but other members made reference to it as well; and also getting the members of the African diplomatic community meeting with other members of Congress on this issue.  So, that was TransAfrica's first recognition after opening the doors only a few weeks, which put us on the map, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 186673
Speaker 1: Also, I guess I'd be remiss if I didn't go back again to the earlier '70s [1970s] and talk about the African Liberation Support Committee and the big African liberation days in Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where thousands of black people, mostly students, would show up in the nation's capital, and march on behalf of African independence.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you attend?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you had to be (laughter)--okay.
Speaker 2: We were out there, yeah.
Speaker 1: But those were, those were--well, describe, you know, what those were for us; I could do it, but you (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, I--you know, it was a time--you know, it was like the days at University of Maryland [College Park, College Park, Maryland]; I mean you had people who were enlightened, I mean they recognized what was going--they knew where Africa was, they recognized that it wasn't a continent but, you know, the continent of many states, and that there were people over there that were being deprived; not only in Zimbabwe, but in South Africa and other parts, you know, as well--and what we were.  I mean there was a movement; I mean, you know, for us to get out there and feel like we were being part of it to affect U.S. foreign policy where this country stood on those issues that affected those across the waters; and we wanted our voice--our voices heard and to show that we had an impact and a role in all of this.  And, you know, there were the speakers there and the, you know, and the pronouncements that were all, you know, right on point, that got us all enthralled and, you know, invigorated about what we were doin'.
Speaker 1: Do you remember Owusu Sadauki and Kwame Ture --he used to be Stokely Carmichael--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, Congressman Diggs [Charles Coles Diggs, Jr.] spoke in '74 [1974] in a dashiki, you know; it's something that--I've never seen a black congressman in a dashiki, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, this is the same Diggs I'm talkin' about, yeah; the same Congressman Diggs, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know, we, you know, do what we had to do on Capitol Hill and we would do what we do out in the streets, you know.  And that--and the beauty of it is that you needed to have that political leverage on the outside to help--hopefully effect what we were tryin' to do on Capitol Hill to show that you did have an advocacy group out there and people were concerned about this.  And that helped the Congressional Black Caucus do what we had to do because but for that, I mean, you know, the rest of the Congress would say, "People aren't interested in this."  I mean, you know, "Yeah, Black Caucus, you're doin' this," but we needed that political leverage from the outside, so it had to work hand-in-glove to kinda get that momentum goin' so definitely, yeah, we were part of that, and it helped us make our job a lot more effective on Capitol Hill to try to get the legislation passed and become public law.
Speaker 1: The thing with those days, too, that the issues were a lot clearer than they are now, in terms of Africa--who was responsible for the trouble and, you know, what needed to be done, who he enemy was, and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was a lot clearer.  I remember we had dinner here at the house, in that dining room, with former Ambassador Sheila Sisulu from South Africa; I guess that was two and a-half years ago, in our dining room, and at that dinner, I had Congresswoman Kilpatrick [Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick], I had former Congressman Ron Dellums [HM the Honorable Ronald Dellums], and we were do--and we were make--you know, we were making that, that, that comment about, you know, back in those days when we were dealing with South Africa sanctions.  It, it was a lot clearer; I mean the, the issues were, were simpler or, or appeared to be simpler but yeah, right now, it's a--it's a, it's--it was like a black or white--not to put a pun on it--issue, but now it's a lot grayer in certain areas, even as you see what's going on in Zimbabwe today.
Story_ID: 186674
Speaker 1: Let's go on from--now, you're at TransAfrica; we've got you at TransAfrica, and you were there from '78 [1978] until--what time?
Speaker 2: Let me see, TransAfrica--maybe a year, year and a-half, because at that time, Bill Gray [HM the Honorable William H. Gray, III] became--was elected to [U.S.] Congress from the Second Congressional District of Pennsylvania, and Bill Gray became a member of the House Budget Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and he needed a legislative director, and several people recommended me to Bill to be his legislative director, but I was, you know, pleased; you know, I felt good about what we were doing at TransAfrica, but Bill being a new member of Congress, you know, needed someone who had been on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.] before and had some instinct about foreign policy.  I met Bill, and interviewed him and he interviewed me--well, I guess I interviewed him too, to see (laughter) if I wanted to go back up on the Hill at that time, and I was very impressed.  You know, Bill Gray has background; he is a third-generation minister, he's very articulate, very dynamic.  As a matter of fact, when he was elected to Congress, he was also elected to president of his freshman class; I mean this guy was a real comer, I mean he had real leadership skills, and I did take that job as his legislative director, so I thought I could even have more of an impact on foreign policy with somebody directly on the committee that has that impact on foreign policy because his committee assignments were House Subcommittee on Africa and International Organizations [Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--well, what are some of the highlights of that--
Speaker 2: Well, with Bill, and he'll tell you this today, he became the first member of Congress in this century to pass the creation of a new entity in Congress.  What we did is we drafted legislation to create the African Development Foundation, and Bill--Oh, I know what it was--he was the first member of Congress during his first term to--that's what it was--during his first term, to pass a major piece of legislation to create a new entity, and it was the African Development Foundation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the African Development Foundation?
Speaker 2: African Development Foundation is an organization that funds small-scale community development projects in Africa.  A example would be if you need a well in a, in a township in Uganda, I mean it may not cost a lotta money; each project had--at that time, had to be 250,000 dollars or less, so those small-scale community development projects meant a lot to that village or that community in the area of health, education.  As I mentioned, wells, irrigation--just a variety development related areas; and it wasn't in competition with United States Agency for International Development [USAID] 'cause at that time, they were doing larger scale projects; so these smaller scale funding projects weren't being addressed because they were looking at larger projects.  Today, the organization--oh, I was talking to na--friends now who is--Fields, who is the current president; they've gotten a plus-up.  I don't know what their budget is right now, but they're several millions of dollars right now, so I feel very good about, about that have happened.  I served on his advisory board for ten years, and the organization has really done a phenomenal job over in Africa, helping a lotta small-scale projects and makin' a real difference in a lotta people's lives over there--
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I felt good about that.  And also, as fate should have it, who knew I would end up with USAID [United States Agency for International Development], but when I worked for Bill, we worked aggressively with others on a staff to create a 10 percent set-aside for minorities and women within the agency for USAID, United States Agency for International Development.  And also (unclear) was obviously my thing, we worked very aggressively on the South Africa sanction issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I felt good about--oh!  And the fourth thing I really feel good about when I worked with Bill Gray--the Foreign Service Personnel Reform Act of 1946 hadn't been looked at for many, many years--over thirty years--and we went and, with Bill's committee assignment on the House International Operations Subcommittee, we were able to go in and put language in there to call for the recruitment, promotion and retention of minorities within the foreign service, so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well seem like you were very busy and a lot was bein' done.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we, we felt good about that.  Bill was chair of the African--African American Summit when we went to Sierra Leone and, you know, he was very active in, in foreign policy, and was a real force at that time with Congressman Diggs [Charles Coles Diggs, Jr.]--the late Congressman Diggs now.
Speaker 1: Now, Congressman Diggs [Charles Coles Diggs, Jr.], he was the chair of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--House Committee-yeah.  But he--I'm not sure what the year was, but he--when he got in trouble, it sort of messed everything up, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because when Bill--when Bill was on the committee, Mr. Diggs wasn't there; he was--it was a guy by the name of Steve Solarz [Stephen J. Solarz] who was chair of the committee when--and that had to be around--well, that was '78 [1978], '79 [1979], '80 [1980], so Solarz was there then, so it was probably right after--right before then that Mr. Diggs had some mishaps.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 186675
Speaker 1: What did you do next, after [African Development Foundation]--
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting.  At that--and I guess I neglected to say, when I was working for [HM] Parren [Mitchell] and Bill [HM the Honorable William Gray, III], I was going to Howard University [Washington, D.C.], working on my master's degree in international relations and public administration, doin' my graduate work, and I got--the only thing I had left to do was my dissertation, but meanwhile, I was still applying to law school 'cause I still had that in the back of my mind.  And Wally Branton was the dean at that time at Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington D.C.], and when I was working for Bill Gray, Wally Branton I saw at one of these receptions, and he walked over to me and said, "Miss McAllister."  I said, "Yes, Dean Branton."  He says, "You have more paper space in my office than anybody else who hasn't even attended the law school."  'Cause I--they would keep accepting me, but I just--I always--great opportunities were poppin' up, you know--TransAfrica, then, you know, back--you know, back in there with Bill, so I would always delay it.  And he said, "You have another application in our office."  He said, he said, "You're gonna get accepted this year, but if you don't come, I'm going to be concerned about your seriousness of purpose of going to law school, so I cannot guarantee if you will get accepted again."  Well, that got my attention (laughter).  And the thing is, at Howard, all they had was a day program, and if they had a night program it would have been great 'cause I could have worked and gone to school.  But as fate had it, I said, "Boy, I better get with this if I'm gonna seriously think about goin' to law school."  So I talked to Bill about it--Bill Gray that is--and Bill said, "Oh, Sing, you can come work for me, not a problem"--blah, blah, blah.  But the truth of the matter is is that when you're working 24/7, you know--as you were saying earlier, I was very busy--it's kinda hard to cut that back or have a person think you can cut that back, and think you're gonna get outta law school, too.  So, I said, "I don't know if I could pull that one off."  So, I was walkin' down the hall, and I--after I had my conversation with Bill, and I walked into the elevator, and there was Mickey Leland [Congressman George Thomas "Mickey" Leland].  And Mickey said, "Hey, Sing, how you doin'?  And, you know, this is totally something I would not normally do.  I said, "Oh, Mickey, I'm doin' fine but I'm not really sure 'cause I'm thinkin' about goin'"--and I'm like blabbin' about what I'm gonna do.  And he said, "So I'm thinkin' about goin' to law school bla, bla, bla, I don't know if I can pull that off, you know."  And he's--and I'm like--why--and it was like one of these things--you're just doing this unconsciously.  And then Mickey says, "Well, follow me, follow me."  I'm going, "What did I just say?"  So he takes me to his office and he introduces me to a young man at that time called--named Rodney Ellis, and Rodney Ellis is Mickey's new chief of staff who he just brought in from Houston, Texas; but Rodney had--did not know the Hill, had never worked on the Hill, so this was new to him.  So he said--so Mickey said, "Well, listen, I'm gonna offer you said amount of money."  He says, "You know, I'll give you special assist--why don't you come there as my special assistant, and we'll work your hours."  Oh, wow, you know, this sounds like a good deal.  And then, thank God 'cause you don't wanna burn bridges--that, you know, Bill understood.  And this is something that I would never recommend to anybody in life.  Anyway, I went to the law school, and I was able to get my classes set up from 7 o'clock in the morning to about 11:30, quarter of twelve; grab a quick bite to eat, get on the Hill, work from one to about eight, and then go to the law library.  This is my first year in law school; no one should ever do that.  I don't--you know, this is total, total insanity; but that's how I got through my first year of law school, and I did o--I didn't do all A's but I got through.  And then I said, "You know, this doesn't make any sense."  So then, what happened was, the second year, I was able to get a teaching assistant position just to get me through, and I was able to pull that off my second and third year, but that's how I took my first year of law school.  But when I worked for Mickey, though--I mean that was a--that--it was a year and a-half; and then when I worked for Mickey, it was a great experience because I assisted Mickey in drafting the legislation to create the Select Committee of World Hunger, of which, you know, Mickey was well-known in that area.  And Mickey was a kinda character where everybody liked him; he was a little outrageous, a little on the edge, but truly brilliant in, in his own way.  He was a pharmacist by, by training, and just--he could, he could just bring any kinda folks together.  I mean Mickey would go to Cuba and talk to Castro and come back.  I mean Bianca, you know, Jagger was always in our office; I mean he was on the cutting edge of a ton of different kinds of issues.  It was a lot, lot of excitement in that office and a lotta dynamic folks around Mickey all the time, so that--you know, so it was fun.  Although it was rather tiring getting through that first year, we did make a difference in, in some ways, and as you well know, history shows that Mickey lost his life flying over Ethiopia because world health and hunger issues were near and dear to his heart, and tragically, his plane went down with several people and friends that I knew on that flight.  So that was my Mickey Leland experience.
Story_ID: 186676
Speaker 1: Where does that put us?
Speaker 2: That puts us--graduating from--
Speaker 1: Law school?
Speaker 2: --law school, and decide--that was in 1984.
Speaker 1: Okay--so, Howard University law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] was 1984, okay.  Now, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Then, I wanted to decide what I wanted to do; I had three options--one, I could go back on the Hill [Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.]; I had that option.  Two, I had done a summer associate position with a law firm my second year of law school, and I got an offer to join them; and three, fortunately enough, I was blessed to get a, get a federal clerkship in Tacoma, Washington, with probably the most controversial judge in the Pacific Northwest--Judge Jack E. Tanner, who was a big civil rights lawyer in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington; Jack and [HM] Dick Gregory are very, very good friends.  He was the lawyer that represented Puyallup Indians back in the day when they were trying to get their land and civil rights.  Marlon Brand--Judge Jack would always tell me stories about Marlon Brando, and Dick Gregory would be, you know, arrest--you know, they'd have the demonstrations and they would have hunger--hunger strikes in, in jail, and Jack was the only one who could bring 'em food.  Jack was--and still is, as a matter of fact; he's on senior status right now in, in Tacoma, Washington.  As a matter of fact, we--the former law clerks had a big party for him about four years ago, so I was fortunate enough to be chosen to get a federal clerkship.  Like that, I was walking in the hall one day and the late Herb Reid [Herbert O. Reid] from Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law], who was my constitutional law/administrative law professor, said, "[HM] Singleton [B. McAllister], when you gonna get outta law school?"  I said, "I'm not sure, Professor Reid."  And he says, "I want you to meet this guy Jack Tanner."  And that's how I ended up in Tacoma, Washington 'cause that's not a place I would have thought I would have--you know, from Baltimore, Maryland to Washington, D.C.--end up in Washington State, so I went up to Tacoma, Washington and did my clerkship for Jack.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Now, what Indian group was he working with?
Speaker 2: Puyallup--Puyallup Indians [The Puyallup Tribe of Indians] in Northwest Washington State.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us, 'cause--
Speaker 2: Puyallup--ooh, good, I know I--you need to double-check this[LN1]--P-U-L-L-A--P-U--double-check it 'cause I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay. I had to ask because we're gonna transcribe this at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Double-check the Puyallup Indian tribe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Jack Tanner, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Jack E. Tanner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how long were you there 'til?
Speaker 2: Was--as fate should have that, I was supposed to--a two-year clerkship with Jack, and it's funny how things just happen in your life, and by that time Bill Gray [William Gray] became Chairman of the House Budget Committee, and Bill Gray called and asked if I could come and serve as senior counsel at the House Budget Committee, but at this time, I was, I was only a year and a-half into my clerkship with Jack and you're supposed to do full two years, but I didn't wanna leave Jack in a lurch, but fortunately enough, the young lady that was going to come up behind me--because he always had two law clerks--one senior, one junior, and at that point, I was a senior, so we needed to have another one behind me.  She had already finished law school and she was able to come five months early.  And so then, I went back to Washington, D.C. 'cause I was this close (demonstrating) to thinking about staying in Washington State because I really like Washington State; it's a beautiful part of the country--great community.  It's interesting, they say--Washington, D.C.--after work you go to receptions, or fundraisers, or some, you know, political activity; in Washington State you, you know, climb mountains, go canoeing, just a different lifestyle, and it was a lifestyle I'm glad I was able to enjoy for at least a--almost a coupla years.  So then I came back here 'cause I thought, you know, this was a great opportunity on the House Budget Committee, and--but when I was with Jack, I would be remiss not to say that that was a very exciting and challenging time, and one of the reasons I say controversial judge in the Pacific Northwest because at that point and time, Jack was the only federal district judge sitting in that area of Tacoma where they had lots and lots of federal installations, particularly, army medical hospitals and installations.  So all of those cases would come in our courtroom, and Jack was--I just learned so much from him as a judge and as a former trial lawyer--how he would conduct himself in the courtroom.  People said he was controversial because he was always vocal.  I mean he would have a--I'd always crack up; you'd have these, you know, these blue-chip law firm lawyers out there, out there and Jack would go, "One end and down the other" (demonstrating) (laughter).  I mean he was like--took, took, took no prisoners; but I mean, but he wanted those lawyers to basically know their law and come prepared in his courtroom.  And I remember one case that--as law clerks, what we had to do--we both were assigned to, to case--our individual cases, and one particular case was a medical malpractice case with one of the, the army hospitals, and Jack said to me, he says, "Well, figure out how we should calculate damages in this case."  I said, "Yes, your Honor."  I said, "Well, I can do that."  And he says, "Yeah, get your calculator.  How much would that person have earned if he were a productive citizen?"--Blah, blah, blah.  So I'm sittin' here with this calculator doin'--you know, from the time this kid was nine years old to, you know, life expectancy.  So I'm sittin' here with all this ticker tape, and it came up to millions and millions of dollars.  I said, "Your Honor," I said, "You know, this is kinda high."  He says, "Can you prove it?"  I said, "Yeah."  He says, "You have a way in which you"--I told him, "Yeah."  "Okay, that's it."  So it was a case that even the--Washington State wanted to take up the Supreme Court (laughter).  It was--because it was just so much.  But nonetheless, they settled the case and it, and it, you know, it moved on.  And Jack was the kinda--yeah, and still is the kinda person who would take on those controversial matters.  I mean there--one of the other cases we handled was a situation where women, secretaries or clerical workers should have gotten same pay as men who were delivering trash, you know, under the laws of Washington State--the equal, you know, pay situation.  And that was another one that--comparable work was the issue; and Jack took on that case and, and basically, his decision was, you know, that they should be given comparable work for the kinda work that they're doing as opposed to the kinda work that they're doing.  I mean how do you judge that kinda stuff?  So that was another one that was gonna go up to the Supreme--I mean everybody was always, you know, tryin' to appeal our cases, and that was another one that was gonna go up to Supreme Court.  But, but the--but in that particular case for Jack it, it settled and that didn't get to the Supreme Court.  So, he was quite a pistol in his day, and Jack's in his eighties right now, but I talked to a friend the other day in Washington State, and he's still out there kickin' butt (laughter).
Story_ID: 186677
Speaker 1: Well, I was telling you about Jack Tanner [Judge Jack E. Tanner]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and Jack Tanner used to be president of the National Bar Association's Judicial Counsel, and as an African American judge he was--or as any judge for that matter, quite a legend in his own time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So then, as I mentioned, Congressman Gray [HM the Honorable William H. Gray, III] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--(Unclear) was he related to the Tanners out of Pittsburgh?--Benjamin Tanner of the AME Church [American Methodist Episcopal Church], or those Tanners?
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know--yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You never know 'cause with us--by way of.  But Bill Gray, as I mentioned, became chairman of the House Budget Committee, and that was a great opportunity, so I served as counsel with the House Budget Committee for, for two years with, with Bill, working on--it, it was a different experience for me because my previous experiences were working with members in their personal offices, probably because the members I worked with-- Parren Mitchell, [George Thomas] "Mickey" Leland, and Bill Gray--other than Parren with the House Small Business Committee--really, at that point, we weren't chairmen of committees, and this gave me an opportunity to be on a committee staff, to see the Hill from a different stand--Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] from a different standpoint.  So it really did get me into the inner-workings of how that, you know, how laws are really made.  (Unclear) always say, "There two things you never wanna see made is sausage and legislation."  And working on the House Budget Committee is no distinction (laugher).  So that was a great opportunity for a coupla years.
Story_ID: 186678
Speaker 1: Okay, now where does that put us then in your--?
Speaker 2: Well, then what happened was--
Speaker 1: Well, you were with Bill Clay [sic. HM the Honorable William H. Gray, III] what years are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Gray?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Graduated from law school [Howard University College of Law, Washington, D.C.] '84 [1984], with Jack Tanner from '84 [1984] to '86 [1986], with House Budget Committee from '86 [1986] to '88 [1988]--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I was recruited by a gentleman by the name of Weldon Latham to join the law firm as an associate of Reed Smith, which is a large Pennsylvania firm that also has a Washington [D.C.] office.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, why did you leave the congressman's office for this offer?  Was this a, you know--
Speaker 2: It was a very--it was a good offer; it was working in a law firm on issues that I was really interested in.  This was a gentleman who was interested in--you can probably see a trend here--interested in minority business-related issues.  As a matter of fact, we created association called the National Association of Minority Business [The National Minority Business Council, Inc.] that lobbied on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.] on issues affecting minority businesses, and we probably represented more of the Black Enterprise 100 Companies than any law firm in the country; we developed that practice over--what--an eight-year period.  So, that got us very actively involved in, in those related issues.  And I also was able to, as a lawyer now on my own, and I became partner while I was at Reed Smith, as well.  My first major client was the National Medical Association, representing the black docs, and I was its first legislative counsel to work with them in its history.  And what we did at the National Medical Association--this was a time during--you may have heard--remember when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was moving forward during his first administration on medical, you know, insurance coverage for all?  Because basically the saying was, "The only two industrialized countries in the world that don't have health care, you know, coverage for their citizenry is the United States and South Africa."  We worked very aggressively to, you know, move forward on that legislation, and I remember a reporter once asking what's one of the hardest things I've ever done in the area of public policy.  It was--we created a--under the direction of the National Medical Association, association called the, the, the Black Summit--the Health Summit Coalition.  And that was the organization--a coalition of a hundred organizations; we got the NAACP [The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the Urban League, the sororities--I mean you name it--we tried to get all the folks involved to kind of--to come together and--in agreement on eight to ten initiatives within the Health Care Reform Proposal that we could all agree on, 'cause you can probably well imagine that, you know, medical malpractice insurance, you know, with the NAACP, may take a different position with the National Medical Association.  So it was like sitting around the table and hammering out--we got down to eight issues that we can all agree on for the African American community, and lobby collectively on those issues for the Health Summit Coalition.  So we did that, and we were quite successful in what we did; we pulled together summits all over the country, and we pulled together days on Capitol Hill and we have hundreds of people where we briefed them, they'd go out and meet their members of Congress; we'd prepare letters for them to write for their members of Congress, and what happened--I don't know if you followed the Health Reform Legislation; it was so, it was so large and encompassed three major committees in the House of Representatives under their jurisdiction, and two committees on the Senate side.  And we were able to get most, if not all, our amendments that we were interested in--all of those health care proposals in those five committees.  But, as you know, unfortunately, they weren't able to get the conference, they weren't able to agree, and unfortunately, you know the history about the way of the health care reform initiative [Health Security Act].  But, as far as this coalition was concerned, I think that was us at our best, being effective in lobbying on the issue that affected our, our constituency of underserved and underrepresented populations.
Story_ID: 186679
Speaker 1: Why didn't it [Health Security Act, 1993] pass?  What's your opinion of that, you know--like you said earlier, this is--there are only two countries in the world, so-called civilized countries, that didn't have a national health plan.
Speaker 2: Politics, basically, you had constituencies--I mean, as effective as we were, the other group was even more effective in, in, in lobbying their respective members of Congress; and then the politics was a little funky, too.  I mean there were those who didn't--who weren't happy to see Mrs. [Hillary] Clinton play such a pivotal role, you know, as the First Lady, moving forward in, you know, a major legislative initiative.  There, there were other organizations that were out there that were against national health care insurance that had a lot more money, had a larger PAC, a Political Action [Committee], you know, group that could, you know, give more money than we could.  There--they were a lot vocal and visible, and financially able than we were to kinda finally get this thing, you know, passed--unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think it ever will pass?
Speaker 2: Well, you got--many--you got--you know, right now, there's talk about, you know, the, the Medicare bill.  I mean there's talk about finally gettin' that done; you're seeing the advertisements on TV right now.  There's talk that that may happen.  I'm hoping in, in, in my lifetime it will happen because it's definitely needed.  I mean we see what's happening now with health care; hopefully, the American people will be a lot more vigilant and vocal and active, and can pursue, and that their members of [U.S.] Congress know this is really important to us.  I think it needs to happen, and I hope it will.
Story_ID: 186680
Speaker 1: Tell us more about your law practice.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, then I was practicing--yeah, so those are--so, I was, I was basically fashioned as a public policy slash government contracts lawyer when I was with Reed Smith and, and Shaw Pittman, working with Weldon Latham those eight, eight years of practicing law.  And then what happened was, I got a call from the White House--personnel director's office, and this was the last year of the first term of the Clinton Administration.  And they asked that--went over and met with them, and then I got another call back and they asked if I'd like to come join and become the general counsel of the United States Agency for International Development [USAID]; that's--and that's kinda interesting how things go full circle because, as you know, I'd--as I mentioned earlier, I was working on legislation that affected USAID.  Well, I talked to many of my mentors, and I said, "Wait a minute, this is, you know, the last term of his--last year of his first term," although Clinton was running again for another four years.  I said, "Does this make political sense to do this because if he loses, you only have done this for a year."  And all of my mentors said, "Yeah, but, you know, one year as a general counsel at USAID is good experience to have, and if he does win, then you got the option of four additional years."  I said, "Yeah, what are you gonna lose?"  So I went on and gave it a shot, and as fate have it, you know, we got a second Clinton term and I was general counsel at USAID for, for five years, and it was a great experience.  As a matter of fact, not only was I general counsel, the administrator of USAID at that time was a gentleman by the name of Brian J. Atwood [sic, J. Brian Atwood], and he--and what was created was a minority serving institutions committee, and there was a guy name Aaron Williams [Aaron S. Williams], who was his first chair, who was--who later became our South Africa Mission Director, who recommended that I become chair when he went out post--he was a foreign service officer.  So, during my tenure at USAID, we increased the amount of--a minority-serving institution committee is basically the (unclear) structure.  What we had at that--once upon a time, we had something called the ten--as I mentioned earlier, the 10 percent amendment for the Gray set-aside--as fate should have it--and when I got in there in January of '96 [1996], and to this day, I'm not really sure what happened--that the Gray Amendment was attached to what we call the Foreign Appropriations Legislation, and somehow the Gray Amendment got dropped out of Foreign Aid bill, so the agency no longer had that mandate to do the 10 percent set-aside.  So what we saw happening in the agency, and out in the seventy-two missions across the world, is there was not that much minority and small--as much small business participation in a lot of their grants and contracts.  And this minority-serving institution committee that Brian Atwood put together was a combination of representatives from the regional bureaus and the functional bureaus, the regional bureaus being the Africa Bureau, Asia Near-East, Latin-America, and at that time it was Europe and Eurasia.  And the functional bureaus are your Office of Procurement, your EOP Office [Educational Opportunity Program Office], and you had your global bureau, and maybe one or two others.  And you had representatives from each office and I was the chair of this committee, and we were try--and our role was to find out--and our mandate was to come up with initiatives and policies to get that--to increase that level of participation.  So I'm happy to say that when I left USAID, the amount of HBCU participation in grants and contracts rose by 67.4 percent, which was a good thing, and we created an advisory board of HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities], a minority--of Hispanic serving institutions in American tribal colleges, because those were the three entities where we were tryin' to do more work in that arena.  'Cause AID is a--people don't realize this--it's an agency which is our development assistance arm, and they have several billions of dollars in backlog work internationally, and they have seventy-two missions all over the world.  And if nothing else, our contracts and our grants that are being given should represent the kind of constituencies we have in our country to those internationally, as well.  So, we were very pleased about that in--that plus-up in, in those numbers.  I'm also happy to say that, during my tenure as general counsel, there probably more minorities now working in that general counsel's office than it has ever been in history.  I made sure that when I put my recruiting committee together that was a real issue for them to consider, so I felt very good about that legacy.  And as far as the Minority Serving Institution Committee--just to go back a bit, I created an office now that has a set staff, and a budget that is now free-standing work on its own, so that once I've gone--I--now--I've been gone now three years--that I keep in touch with them and they're, you know, still doin' that, their job.
Story_ID: 186681
Speaker 1: What have you done for the last three years?
Speaker 2: I've been--well, truth be told, my candidate won but he's not in the White House (laughter).  And so I--I hung with AID [USAID, United States Agency for International Development] at that time because I was told I was being considered for an ambassadorial appointment in the next adminis--Democratic administration; but what happened was it didn't happen, as far as Democrats getting control of the White House.  And the Type A personality that I am, and as you heard about my history, things kind of always landed, and I wasn't prepared for that move; and then my husband, the way he is, he said, "Listen, you don't have to work."  He says, "Why don't you (unclear) take off for a few months?"  And I'm like, "Gee, novel idea," you know.  He thought it--you know, it be one month and I'd be ready to go back to work.  I was like havin' a ball (laughter) for months, you know--working out, you know, takin' care of the house, you know, doin' all that stuff that you never get a chance to do.  And then, one day I got a call from a headhunter that wanted me to consider a corporate board position for Alliant Energy, which is the major utility for Madison, Wiscon--well, Wisconsin and Iowa, and their--well, it was another great opportunity to be on a board of directors of a major utility.  But one of the things in their bylaws specified is that you must be employed and--obviously, so you can bring value add-up from whatever outside job you're doing to the, to the corporate board.  So I said, "Gee, I'd better find a job," you see now, these aren't opportunities you get every day.  And as fate should have it, I was just lucky; I got three different job offers--one was to head up a major trade association here in Washington [D.C.], one was to head up the Women's Bureau over at the DNC [Democratic National Convention], and another was with the law firm.  And with all the kinds of things that I've been involved with, I just felt the law firm provided me the exposure and experience to kinda do a lotta different kinda stuff and not just be pigeonholed in one or two different areas.  So I decided to take a partnership at Patton Boggs [Squire Patton Boggs]; and just recently, I took a partnership and was heavily recruited with Sonnenschein, Nath and Rosenthal [Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP] where I'm--I've been a partner there for the last couple of months.  Also, I'm in the Public Policy Group at Sonnenschein, and I now develop--have developed and a practice head of a new group called Corporate Diversity Practice Group--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and what that basically means, 'cause I gotta talk to The New York Times about this later today, is the Corporate Diversity Practice Group is a way of recognizing what the 2000 Census has shown us, that corporate America has to change the way it does business.  In corporate America--some of corporate America has gotten it, recognizing, you know, the integration of minorities in senior positions.  Right now, for instance, you have--the general counsel of Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Company] is an African American woman; the general counsel of Starbucks [Starbucks Corporation], Paula Boggs, is an African American woman; the general counsel of Sara Lee [Sara Lee Foods, LLC] is a male African American; general counsel of Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], Deval Patrick.  And, what's happening now in our community at this particular time, is diversity is, is becoming recognized, and the importance of diversity.  And law firms on a whole, unfortunately, haven't gotten it.  I mean I'm the only, right now, African American partner in my law firm; this is a firm that started in 1906, has nine major offices, but this firm gets it--where we realize that internally, we have to change diversity if we're going to go out and preach diversity at a corporate diversity level and assist corporations in that arena, and this corporate diversity area is a way in which they're--they're hoping in that--helping us to move forward there.  And internally, this firm has, has been the fastest growing firm in Washington, D.C., and we're even doing more in diversity in the next coming months, so I feel very good about that.
Story_ID: 186682
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns.  Hopes are that we get our fair share--that as a people, we need to recognize the demographics are changing; we used to be the number one minority, now we're number two--Hispanics are a faster-growing minority than we are, and as such, I, I do hope that we don't become marginalized, and as a group, for us to make sure that as we move forward on a lotta these government-related programs that I've worked on, as you can tell, for the last twenty years, that we, we still get our fair share.  Because, even with the hard work that [HM] Parren Mitchell did with the 10 Percent Set-Aside with the Service Transportation Act in transportation, the definition 'minority' is growing under the Code of Federal Regulation Part 24.  If you look at definition, 'minority,' it's, it's, it's gotten pretty substantial.  So, as the black community is concerned, I just hope we keep our edge.  And that also can be one of the concerns.  I think that one of the con--many concerns I have is that we make sure that we keep our coalitions alive and vibrant and, and growing.  Sometimes, when I go to some of--you know, we talk about what we did in the '70s [1970s] in the marches; I don't see much of that goin' on right now.  I'm not sure the next generation has quite gotten it 'cause they haven't lived through what we lived through, having been a part of the civil rights, you know, struggles, and seen, you know, racism, you know, straight up and, and, and, and, and in our face; and that they may think that, you know, that, you know everything's fine and, you know, we were there; that's not the case.  I have friends of mine in California now whose kids are goin' to college and they wanna send them back over here at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] so those kids can get a black experience or an HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] because some of these kids--I mean it's good to have integration, and that's the way the world is, but I think you need to also recognize your past to recognize your future, and that's one of my concerns that I have.
Story_ID: 186683
Speaker 1: When you look back on what you've done so far, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Legacy--I had to speak at the--I was the fourth commencement speaker at Howard Law School [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] about two years ago.  They now have something called a pinning ceremony, which I think is--I think [HM H.] Patrick Swygert is doin' a great job there at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] because they're building a--that sense of family and community, and the Pinning Day Ceremony--as a matter of fact, they had their largest graduation class then--is that you have a former alumni come and speak at this ceremony.  I think [HM] Vernon Jordan was a speaker one year; I think Doug Wilder [HM the Honorable L. Douglas Wilder] might have been a speaker, and I can't--oh!  Former Mayor Kelly--District of Columbia--[HM the Honorable] Sharon Pratt Kelly was the, was a speaker; and then I was honored to be the, the, the fourth speaker, and then what you do at this, this--after the speech, each alumni puts a pin on that entering class.  So, as you ask about legacy, legacy would be one in which I hope that I've made some difference.  I, I, I, you know, I come from a family who has been diggin' the community, referenced by what my grandfather and others have done, that I could--from a ancestral point of view, make them proud of what I, you know, what I've tried to accomplish throughout these, these many years--a legacy of helping, I guess, the African American community eventually get their, their due--their due.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything that you would do differently, when you look back?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I think--to some extent, when you live your life, you have to believe in fate, that things happen for a reason, and that--you know, I--one could think, 'Well, what if you started law school right after University of Maryland?'  or 'What if you did this, what if you did that?'  But then, there are those other opportunities and experiences you wouldn't have had the opportunity that makes you you, and where you want to go and, you know, eventually that legacy, you know, isn't a force.  So, no, I don't think I would have done anything differently.  I mean, the way circumstances kind of happened to me, I--you know, it was always one of these situations where I'd stop and think, 'Well, you know, you're kinda like livi--you have choices, but there are certain paths that are in front of you, and you're just hoping you're making the right ones, and I, I, I don't feel--I feel very blessed that I think I've had some opportunities in life that maybe not many have, and I had an opportunity where I can say, you know, I've drafted legislation; I can, you know, put an earmark on it and, and, and have had a, a real impact.  No, I don't think so.  I think things happen the way they're supposed to happen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think you'll become an ambassador at some point in the future?
Speaker 2: You never know, you never know.  We'll see what happens in this next election, and see if I have--where I am at that particular point in my life, and see what makes sense.
Story_ID: 186684
Speaker 1: This last question we have is similar to legacy but it's a little bit--it's a little different, and you're still so young, it feels strange to ask it, but--
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you, thank you; I need to hug you already (laughter).
Speaker 1: --how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I hadn't thought of that one.  How would I like to be remembered?  As a person who worked hard, lived the way--lived their life that would make others proud.  That's about all I can say right now; wait another twenty years, maybe I can come up with somethin' a little more creative (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 186685
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a picture where the former law clerks of Jack--the Honorable Jack E. Tanner, Judge of the Ninth Circuit of the Federal District Court in Tacoma, Washington, came together three years ago, in the year 2000, to show our appreciation for him as our judge.  And those of you that could see the picture--and I don't think I'm talking outta school, Jack was always known for hiring black women law clerks and white male law clerks (laughter), as you could see from the picture. Jack said that people would always criticize him, but he said that's the way he was gonna do it.  So, you have--this--there, there several law clerks that have--had been with Jack, and I think you can identify--Jack is the gentleman who's quite squarely in the center of honor.
