 Neurohr  Mathews  Today is September 9, 2009. My name is Karen Neurohr and I   m a  librarian at the Oklahoma State University Library. I   m in Pawhuska,  Oklahoma today at the Osage Mineral Council building. I   m here to  interview Ms. Virginia Hopper Mathews and this is for an oral history  project of the OSU Library, which is titled Spotlighting Oklahoma.  Thank you, Ms. Mathews, for allowing me to interview you today.  I   m delighted.  This interview today is going to focus on your family and particularly  your father because we   re planning for an Oklahoma Literary Landmark  event in November.  Yes.  So in conjunction with that, we   re putting together a booklet of  information about your father. I wanted to interview you today so that I  could understand your father better and that you could share some of  your many wonderful memories about him with us for the recording. So  if you would tell me a little bit about your family.  Well, my mother and father and my brother   I have a brother who   s two  years younger than I am. He   s a physicist. He was a physicist; he   s sort  of retired now. (Laughs) Very brilliant man. He graduated from  Annapolis and he was just dying to be on the ocean. He loved boats and  he was going to be an officer with a white uniform and everything. Well,  he was going to get married too because he had a girlfriend from  Baltimore and they were going to get married with the crossed swords  from Annapolis and all this business. Well, unfortunately   well not  really, but sad for the moment, he was asked to come to Washington and  5  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  talk to an admiral who said,    John, we have been,      my brother   s name  was John, John Hopper Mathews. They said,    John, we   ve been  studying you and hope you don   t mind that. We find that you are a very,  very brilliant man, and a possible scientist, and we want you for the  Navy. We think you   ll be a great help, more than you would be if you  were on a ship. And to do that, you have to have really hard science for  another four years or so. We want to send you to go to some college  somewhere.    And my brother said,    Well, Einstein has always been my  hero and I would love to go wherever he went to get his studies.    And  the admiral said,    Well, where was that?    And he said,    It was  Eidgen  ssische Technische Hochschule in German and that   s in  Switzerland, Zurich. It   s a very, very well known scientific college.        We want you to go there. The Navy will pay everything that you need,  but we expect you to work for the Navy all your life, really.    And John  said,    Alright, that   s fine. I   ll do that.    And so he did, he went off to  Zurich. He had already had a lot of German in his prep school.  Did you have foreign languages in your prep school, too?  Well, French, yes. I did a lot of French. I knew a lot of French because  my mother and my auntie were brought up in France, in Europe     actually, Geneva. They were at a boarding school in Geneva. And they  always spoke French together because they   d been at a French boarding  school. So my brother and I quickly learned they were talking another  language and we got to it, so we learned it very early.  Your father was John Joseph Mathews     Yes.  And your mother   s name?  Was Virginia Winslow Hopper. That was her maiden name.  Okay. And your father was born?  He was born in1894.  And where was he born?  He was born right here in Pawhuska. And his mother was French. You  saw the picture of her. And his father, of course, was Osage and Welsh  basically because yes, his father had been Welsh.  So he grew up here in this area.  6  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  He grew up   absolutely, yes.  Did he grow up in town or did he grow up out in the country?  No, he grew up in town. Because the country place is what he made for  himself after he became an author (Laughs) and wanted to live there. But  he lived in the family house, you know.  What did your grandfather do?  My grandfather was  a self-made lawyer and later a judge . I think he  was the Osage chief at that time for the Council   he was on the Council.  He was Welsh and his name was William Shirley Mathews. His father  was the one that did the trading post with Oswego. So he brought the  Osages right back down to Oklahoma, really. I think his mother came  with him, she was Sarah.  Did you ever meet your grandparents?  I met my grandmother, yes. Daddy   s mother, French. The father died,  unfortunately.  What was your grandmother   s name?   Eugenia  Gerardo. She was French.  What do you remember about your grandmother?  Well, she was just a dear. She was awfully nice. We had lots of fun  together, she had a good sense of humor and she liked to talk French  with me.  My mother  talked French with me, too. She was a very nice  person, I liked her. We went down to the ocean sometimes and had a  little summer thing. I remember going with her and it was very nice.  So this was your father   s mother that you were at the ocean with.  That   s right, yeah.  I have a lot of questions I   m going to work through. We   ll just see how it  goes. I would like to know more about your father   s education. Did he  go to school here in Pawhuska?  Yes, he went to the high school. There are pictures of him with a ball.  So he was an athlete?  7  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Always had a basketball or football. Oh yes, quite an athlete. So much  so that when he got to college, he found that most of them were not  Indian. Very few Indians at that point and that most of them were white.  So some of the white guys said,    We don   t really want you, thank you  very much, you   re Indian.    Because that was the time when Indians  were not very popular. So Daddy figured out that he was awfully good at  sports and if he got real good at football, and everything else, that would  bring him in. And he also joined a fraternity, which was amazing  because most of the Indians were not wanted in the fraternities. But he  was smart. He knew what would do it good. I think he was the captain of  the football team, as a matter of fact. He was very good at sports, very.  And he went to the University of Oklahoma, didn   t he?  Yes, that was University of Oklahoma, OU.  Now what do you think influenced him to go to the University of  Oklahoma? There were other colleges in the state.  Yeah, I guess he thought it was a very good school, I don   t know.  Maybe he knew people who went there, I don   t know. Probably, older  people that had gone. But he really liked it very much. He dove right in  and he had a degree in geology, a diploma. And he also had a Phi Beta  Kappa key and I have it.  You have his?  Yeah, I should   ve brought it and shown it to you. (Laughs) I   m sorry, I  didn   t think of it.  That   s okay.  He gave it to me a long time ago.  I   ve read that your father left school and entered the military.  Yes, he became a pilot. And he left there, I think, just as we were getting  into the war in 1914.  World War I?  Yeah, World War I. He was going to be in the cavalry because, of  course, he loved to be on horses and everything. When he got there, they  said,    No, we   re going to have you be a pilot because you have night  vision, which is amazing.    There was no techie stuff then, you just had  to look outside and see what was outside. (Laughs) So he had very good  8  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  night vision and he was a very good pilot. So very soon he was teaching  the other guys to pilot. And they were in those crazy little airplanes with  no tops, you know. They must   ve had good seatbelts because you had  pictures of them going around like this in the air. I don   t know how they  did that. (Laughs) And he was so good that eventually they had him go  to France to give re-training to some of the pilots who weren   t doing as  well with the Germans as they wanted to and so he helped them, too. So  he was very good at it.  So he fought in the war and then did he come back to Oklahoma?  Oh yes, sure. He came back and then he came back to college and he got  his geology diploma for the last two years and Phi Beta Kappa. And then  he was offered to go to Merton College, Oxford. He was offered free   schooling . And he very politely refused and said no. He felt that  somebody else who needed the money   you know, he had enough  money to do that if he wanted to do it himself and he did. Because he  just didn   t want to feel that he  should be  given something when he  could do it for himself.  So he went to Oxford and studied there.  So he went to Merton College, Oxford, that   s right.  He was the first  native Indian to do so.  He was there three and a half years and he loved  it. He absolutely loved it. He loved England. He found that unlike the  white people here, the English thought he was fascinating. You know, he  was an Indian and they thought he was   and he was a very good sport,  he was very, very bright, he was very handsome. They thought he was  just great. And he was invited up to Scottish homes. Very lovely places  when they weren   t in school. He was a good writer, he was a good  hunter and they all love that. The British just love that kind of stuff, you  know. And he even found out about chasing foxes, all this.  He had a wonderful time. He loved it. In fact, he said to me once,    You  know, I really loved England. They really liked me and I liked them and  it was very nice.    And I said,    Well Daddy, I think it   s one of the nicest  things that you ever had, to be there.    Because he really found that there  were people who would like him, whether he was Indian or not or  American or anything else. Three and a half years.  Then he got a degree in Natural Sciences, it   s called. And then he  decided he wanted to see the rest of Europe so he went and got a  motorcycle and he went to North Africa first because he wanted to see     he was fascinated by the Romans and the Latin that they had put on all  kinds of granites and everything all over. He really was fascinated by it.  That   s where he got that thing that he put on the fireplace,    to live, to  9  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  love, and all       (Laughs)  Yes, and that   s in his book Talking to the Moon where he describes     It   s in that and he   s also in the introduction for another book.  For Sundown.   In his daughter   s introductory to the paper copy published by Oklahoma  Press with the English from the Latin.   Yes, where you talk about that.  In English, I put it in English so they   d know what it was. So he decided  he wanted to see the rest of Europe. He really was very taken with the  Latin. He was very interested in it. And so he got on his motorcycle and  he went all around Europe. He went to Germany, even though they had  had a war and so forth, but he went up and through Paris and everything.  Then he went to Geneva because he thought he might get a job being a  scientist to the people who were working on  the League of Nations .  After World War I, they were going to make the world better. And he  thought he could be in Geneva with that and do something to help with  science. And he did.  And so he stayed in Geneva for awhile?  Yes, he stayed in Geneva, that   s right. And he happened to go and live in  the same ponsionne that my mother was in,  with her sister .  What was she doing there at that time?  Well, her family had been there all through World War I because her  father was a financier, a very, very good money man. And he had been  asked by England to come and help get up the money for the war. And  so he took his family with him. He took his two daughters, my mother  and her sister, and they went to a boarding school, spoke French all the  time. And his wife was there and his mother-in-law was there. (Laughs)  And they all lived in Geneva during the war. He was in Britain trying to  help this guy get the money together. There were an awful lot of spies,  you know. I mean World War I was just amazing. There were all kinds  of spies there because Geneva was considered to be nothing. But it was  very, very full of spies.  Virginia Hopper and her sister were studying  music and dance.   He saw this lovely girl and she was very, very beautiful. She was lovely.  She was a descendent of all these people, very American for many,  10  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  many years and he was very taken with that. He thought that was very  elegant. He said to me once,    Well, yes, I didn   t see very many people  that were people from that kind of Europe, you know,    and he hadn   t.  All the people that they knew were all very highfalutin. (Laughter) But  he liked that. He thought it was rather elegant and upper-class.  So did he court your mother for a while?  Yes, he did. Yes, he sure did. And they lived at the same ponsionne. And  her sister was with her too and they did a lot of mountain climbing and  skating and skiing.  So your mother was active?  Oh, very much, yes. She was very sporty.  She rode horses, too.  She  was a good writer, which made him like that. Because she was very  attractive, very pretty, and very sporty, too.  It sounds like they had a lot in common.  Yes, they did. Yes, they did. And he liked her sister too, she was older.  They had a lovely time. So he asked her to marry him and he got her a  lovely diamond ring. They were married on the 24th  of April, 1924 .  Was that in Geneva they were married?  In Geneva, at the American Church. And Mother said to Daddy,    Now I  know you   ve been brought up as a Catholic. If you want to be a  Catholic, that   s fine with me. I don   t care what I am.    You know, it was  Episcopal. (Laughs) And she said,    I don   t mind it. I   ll be whatever you  want me to be.    And he said well, he didn   t care either. So they went to  the American Church and that   s where they were married,  April  24th.  They were married on Easter Sunday, 1924.  Oh they were?  Yes, they were. After that they went on a wedding trip. They went to  Rome first of all because they wanted to see everything in Italy. They  were both charmed by all the paintings and everything. I have a picture  of him going under the Bridge of Sighs  Ponte dei Sospiri . I wish I had  it with me, it   s just a little picture. But they had a lovely time in Naples  and all over. So it was in Rome that they met with   they were in a  residential hotel, not the kind that people just go for overnight. They  were going to stay there for several weeks. And so they were doing that  and then travelling around seeing the rest of Italy and all the pictures and  everything. This was the kind of place where you ate at the hotel where  11  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  you lived and then you went out in the lobby and the men would smoke  with a pipe, which he always had, and Mother would have coffee and so  forth. Suddenly they saw this man coming toward them in a white  uniform, a very tall man. It was Hermann G  ring. And when he realized  who Daddy was and Daddy realized who he was   because he was a big  flyer in World War I, very. And they both stayed, you know they were  flyers and they were talking about it. There was no meanness about it,  the war was over. But they talked about how wonderful flying was and  so forth and then suddenly he began apparently to get kind of angry  about things and he said,    Don   t think for a minute that we   re going to  stop the war. We may have had this war thing and we went through it,  but we   re going to have another war. And this time we   re going to beat  you and we   re going to beat the French, we   re going to beat the English  and even the United States.    And Daddy said,    Well, we   ll see about  that,    you know, kind of. He just thought he was talking German, you  know   not the German language, just that kind of bullish attitude.  And my poor mother was sitting there kind of nervous, you know,  because he was getting kind of ugly about the whole thing. And so  Daddy said,    Well, I don   t believe you. I don   t think there   s going to be  another war.    Well, of course, there was eventually and he had that  awful scar on his cheek when you   ve been to one of those dagger things,  the German officers. This was to show that you were a very brave  high  rival  officer. So they went up to their room and Mother started to cry.  And she said,    I   m afraid. I really think he means it.    And Daddy said,     Oh no, he   s just full of German bull. Nothing doing.    So as a matter of  fact of course, that   s what happened. But I have to tell you, and you can  leave this out if you want to, but I was conceived that night because she  was so upset and he was trying to comfort her. (Laughter) So he  comforted her.  So did they both tell you this story over the years?  Yes. (Laughs)  You   ve heard it from both of them?  I heard it from both of them, right. (Laughter)  Well that   s an interesting story.  Wasn   t that an interesting story? So I always say,    Well, I owe it all to  Hermann G  ring.    (Laughter)  Oh, goodness.  12  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Oh, dear. However, later, much, much later, Daddy found when he was  going to Washington, he found a way to let President Roosevelt know  about this and know that he was the guy   it wasn   t Hitler. I mean Hitler  was just a crazy ass that wanted to kill Jews, you know. He wasn   t  caring about the war and he didn   t know anything about military. But  Herman was the military guy. And so when he left them, oh he was very  friendly and said,    I   d like to sometime have you come to Sweden. My  wife has a lovely place in Sweden and you   d like Sweden and so forth.     And then he went. So Daddy said,    Oh, he   s just talking through his hat.  That   s the way the Germans are.    (Laughs)  And where did they go?  Well, they went home eventually. They went a bit in Rome and they  went around some other places and then went back to Geneva. And then  they decided to go home.  To the United States?  Yes, to the United States. Mother at this point was going to have a baby,  me. (Laughter) They got to New York and I was born in New York City.  They came on the boat of course,  there was  nothing else to do at that  point. So I was born right near the Hudson River in a hospital that used  to be called a    lying-in hospital    for people to have babies. So I   ve  always loved the Hudson River because I was practically on the edge of  it with this hospital. And anyway, they went to live in New Jersey where  mother   s family lived   not in the same place, but they went to  Montclair and they had an apartment. They were there for quite a little  while.  Then that summer, they decided to go to Massachusetts because it was  going to be a hot summer. They went up to, I think it was, Cape Ann or  one of those places, right by the ocean. Mother had gotten a police dog  from a man who had been in the war, German, because she had been in  Munich, too. There was a young man who couldn   t afford to feed this  lovely German police dog so Mother bought that dog (she was quite  young) and took her home. So Belliui went up to Massachusetts with  them when they went for that summer. That was the first summer of my  life and I was put in a baby carriage, a very nice English baby carriage,  right on a piazza over the ocean. And, of course, an ocean just does  something to me, it must have been that year, you know.  Then, they went back and they decided that they had to go home. Daddy  had, at this point, found out there was a lot of barren land between  Pasadena, California and Los Angeles that could be made into some  houses and things like that. So he wanted to go to California. He thought  13  it was very interesting and there was a lot of land there. So they went  home and they decided to go by the Panama Canal, which was quite new  at that point. They thought that was kind of fun and an interesting way to  go on the water. They had left me at home with my grandmother and  Mother   s sister, Auntie, because they wanted to go and see what it  would be like and so forth and not take the little baby.  Then they got to Los Angeles and she was pregnant again, she was  going to have another baby. So my brother was born in Los Angeles.  Then they got a house out in Pasadena, which was very nice, and Daddy,  in the meantime, had looked at all this barren land and thought it was,  wow, great. He loved land; all Osages do. So they bought this house and  he began buying up all this land and he was doing very well until 1929  came and that was the Depression. That   s what really ruined the whole  thing for him because he had a partner who wasn   t a very good  businessman and actually, he wasn   t a very good businessman. He   d  never been in business and he wasn   t good with money, really. But he  just was thrilled with that land and he was going to have these little  houses built and so forth. Well the whole thing just, you know, the  Depression just took everything away. It took everything he had put in,  the money, which was terrible.  At the same time they had this lovely house in Pasadena and my brother  was there, of course he was just a very small baby. They both loved  acting; they both loved to act. So they both went and acted at the  Pasadena Community Playhouse, which was very well known. A lot of  Hollywood people were there, too. We were about three miles from the  Rose Bowl. He took me, I remember, to see Mother as Minnehaha. In  the Rose Bowl they did a Hiawatha and Mother was the Minnehaha,  which is Hiawatha   s wife. And Daddy took me to see that. I was about  three and a half years old, I think. And he said,    Isn   t your mother the  most beautiful Indian girl you ever saw.    And I said,    Yes, she is.     (Laughs) Anyway, they really had a very nice time in Pasadena until the  Depression came around. It was just too bad, awfully sad. He realized  that he was not a businessman and never would be. He wasn   t good with  money or dealing with people. And he had dealt not with people that  were trying to get him, you know, because he hadn   t been in business  ever. He just was no businessman at all, poor thing. So he just gave it up  and he decided the only thing he could do was go back to the  Reservation, where he knew people and knew what was what, what kind  of job he might get or something. Because he had a family now. He had  two children and a wife.  I was going to tell you what he did with me. He had a very real feeling  that a father ought to be able to give his little daughter when she was a  baby a mind and a brain. He used to sit me   after supper, he would put  14  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  me on his lap and read to me from the Times, The New York Times. He  told me one night, he said,    Now the man that I   m reading about now,  Virginia, is being facetious.    Well I didn   t know what facetious meant  but he told me. He didn   t mind telling me. And he believed that I would  really understand it and finally I did. And oh, a few nights later, he was  reading about another man, an editorial. And I said to him,    Daddy, the  man you are reading about now is trying to be facetious but he   s not  doing it.    (Laughs) I thought he   d lose it. But he really just took such a  fancy to my mind. It was amazing. And we always were like that.  Always.  So when time went on, he got his first book in 1932. That was Wa   kon-tah.  The family let him live over the garage, over their garage over  there   you   ve seen the house probably, that pink stucco?  I haven   t seen the house in town yet. So it   s still here?  Oh yes, it   s there. And he lived there on top of the garage when he first  came back. And he wanted to see what he could do. And Laban Miles,  who was Hoover   s uncle, had been in charge  and Supt of the tribe .  He   d been with the Osages for a long, long time and so he gave this  diary of everything he learned about the Osages to Daddy and he said he  would like him to make a book out of it, and he did. That was Wa   kon-tah.  That was Wa   kon-tah.  He was very lucky because it was the book of the month in the Book of  the Month Club. And it was a strange Book of the Month Club  book   because nobody at that point knew much about Indians, nothing at all.  But it just sold like pancakes. Really, it was so interesting, so different,  and very well written. Beautifully written. He had the little pen and ink  drawings in it. They sold 50,000 copies in the middle of the Depression.  Can you imagine? Well, of course he was thrilled to death.  Now how old were you when that book came out? Elementary school  age?  Oh, gee, it came out in    32, I was born in    25,  so I was seven .  So first or second grade?  Well I just had a governess is all I had.  Were you living in California still? You and your brother and your  mother.  15  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  That   s right, that   s right.  Meanwhile her father and mother had come to  California and had their own house.  And Mother talked about going  down to Pawhuska. She went for a visit there and she found that one of  his sisters was very upset about his marriage. She didn   t like him  marrying somebody out of Oklahoma. That was Aunt Lillian, I   m sorry  to say. She was kind of annoyed and jealous about it. She said,    There  were lots of nice girls in Oklahoma you could have married. Why did  you marry her?    Daddy said,    Because she   s lovely and I loved her.     Anyway, time went on and he stayed down there. She said,    I will come  down there and live if you want me to.    And he said,    No, I think you  better stay where you are now because you have the house and you have  the two children.    And her parents had come from New Jersey to be near  her because her father was an invalid and all this kind of stuff. So he  knew her parents were there and that nothing would happen to her. So  she just went along and she started working some jobs because he didn   t  have much money to send her.  So she was trying to support you and your brother and herself.  That   s right. And so this went on for a long time. I always had letters  from him and I always had something to say to him.  You wrote letters back to him?  Yes, I did, because he and I had always been close, we understood each  other. So when I was fifteen years old I started going out in the summer  to spend at least one month with him.  You were coming to Pawhuska?  To Pawhuska, that   s right. And yes, my mother thought that was fine  and it just kind of cleared everything sad away. Any unhappiness about  it was just kind of forgotten. It just wasn   t his way to go. He was not a  businessman. And he knew his Osage people and he liked them and then  he had the feeling that he wanted to help save them because things were  going kind of tough at that point.  Did you go to public schools in California?  Never. No, never did.  Did you go to boarding schools?  Yes,  after we went East . We had a governess or somebody who taught  me to read when I was about three and a half or four. So yes, and then I  went off to an Episcopal boarding school when I was eight years old in  16  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Peekskill, New York. Mother had been there to school so she knew the  sisters there. And they took me practically for nothing because my  mother had been there at the school. But I began going to  Oklahoma   when I was fifteen. By then, he had gotten a job because with his  geology, he knew all about minerals. So he was now putting John  Collier into all this business with the Osages and all Indians. He really  found that he cared a lot about doing some things, that he was going to  do something for the tribe, and he did. And he worked very hard for it.  Because of his geology, I think it made him able to be a minerals man.  But the wonderful thing about my mother was that she never said nasty  things about him, which was very good. She had been going to have  another baby incidentally, but she miscarried. She told me I was going to  have a little sister. I didn   t get her. Just as well. But she never said nasty  things about my father, which was very nice. A lot of wives do, say  nasty things. (Laughs) But she wanted me to love Daddy and  encouraged me always to write letters to him and he would write back.  And then when he began to get money he sent us some money, you  know.  Then, my mother decided to leave California  and go East to New  York . Roosevelt came in and they thought maybe they would go to  Europe because it would be cheaper to live there. But they didn   t  because the war shown that it was going to happen. And Daddy, from  time to time, he had a friend who was the head of the press at OU, and I  can   t think of his name at the moment, but he was a great friend of  Daddy   s. He would go and visit with him and then he would have us  come and see him, my brother and I, we   d go and see him. He tried to  keep in touch with us.  You mentioned that you started coming to Oklahoma when you were  fifteen years old. How did you travel here?  I came by train.  Did the train come into Pawhuska?  No, it didn   t. I   m trying to remember where it did come in. He came and  got me somewhere at some station.  He picked you up?  Yes, he picked me up, that   s right.  What kinds of things did you bring with you? Did you bring multiple  suitcases?  17  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  No. No, just one little suitcase, nothing much. By this time, he had  begun to build his little cabin, you see. He was going to live there. He  didn   t want to live anymore with his family in the top of the garage.  And, of course, that was never a place where the family could be either.  But, of course, his cabin   you   ve been out there     I   ve seen pictures of it.  Oh, you   ve seen pictures of it, yeah. So it was just one big room really,  that   s all it was. But the fact that when he got Laban Miles    thing to do  that, he knew that he was going to be a writer.  So that really was a turning point for him?  It really was, oh absolutely, yes. And it was more than just being a  writer, he was going to do something to be good for the Osages, you  know, that people would understand them and all of that. There was so  much ugliness about Indian people really, even then.  Did you feel that yourself being his daughter?   Yes, we were close since the days in Pasadena.  When I was quite  young I didn   t think too much about it, but I remember one day we were  going to Claremore, I think. I think he was going to see Will Rogers  because he liked Will Rogers. And as we went by, I saw a sign on a  restaurant. We were in his car and it said,    We don   t feed dogs or  Indians.    I said,    Daddy, you look at that sign  Why don   t I go there and  have some lunch and then tell them who I am?    He said,    No, I don   t  want you to do that.    (Laughter) He didn   t want me to be insulted. But  I   d loved to have told them,    I   m an Osage. Hoo-hoo  And I just had my  lunch.    I was only about fifteen years old, I guess, at this point. I was  good and fresh. (Laughter)  So when you came and visited him, where did you stay?   Sometimes at the Duncan Hotel and sometimes  I stayed on a cot in the  room. One summer we had locusts.  Out at the rock house?  Oh, yes.  So his house was  ample enough  you would stay out there with him.  Oh, yes, I would stay out there, yeah.  18  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Was it a primitive type of existence?  Yes, it was pretty primitive   there was no toilet or anything.  Did that bother you at first?   Not terribly.  Well at first it would. He   d say,    Dear, go out. But look,  be sure there   s no snake.    Yes, I was kind of wishing he had a toilet but  he didn   t. He built that little house that he painted on. He was going to  put in a toilet or out house but he never got around to it. (Laughter) Oh  dear, but I guess Elizabeth had, I guess it was later, because of the  locusts came when he was already married to Elizabeth. And I  remember I was working at Brentano   s, I was head of the children   s  book department of Brentano   s in New York  in the forties  and getting  books for all the different Brentano   s stores for children. He had told me  about Elizabeth, this was a woman who had lost her husband. Did I ever  tell you about that?  No.  Well, her husband was in the oil business. He had a business selling oil.  And they had two children, a little boy and a little girl. My later  stepbrother was nine years old, I believe and he walked into the garage  and   this was during the Depression still     1930s.  Yeah, yeah. And his father was swinging from the rafters in the garage.  He was nine years old. Terrible. It was awful; I don   t think he ever really  got over it. Although he was very fond of Daddy. But it was not his own  father, you know. But he liked Daddy. So anyway, his mother was  without a husband and so Daddy started courting her. Well she would  invite him for Sunday lunch and feel sorry for him. There he is out in his  house all by himself, he can   t cook. (Laughs)  Oh, he couldn   t cook?  Oh, no.  What did you eat when you stayed with him?  Well, not much. (Laughter) We would go someplace.  Like where?  Oh, I can   t even remember.  Probably fast food places.   19  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  You would come to town?  Yes. Come to Pawhuska, oh yes, we   d come into Pawhuska. I don   t  remember what kind of place. It was just some kind of restaurant  probably, I can   t remember. Anyway, he sent a telegram and said, in  1945,    Elizabeth wants to get married so I would like to ask your mother  to get a divorce,    which was very gentlemanly of him. He didn   t divorce  her, she divorced him.  Oh, they had stayed married all those years then.  Oh yes, oh yes. Mother had no interest in  living with him then .  And how old would you have been when you got that letter probably?   Twenty years old.   You said you were working, after leaving college.  Yes, I was working. I was at Brentano   s and I was  managing the  Children   s Department and also writing articles for The New York  Times.  And this telegram said,    I want your mother to get a divorce.     And so Mother got a divorce. She didn   t care. You know, she didn   t  want to be married to him anymore, there wasn   t any point. And she  never wanted to get married again at all. So she got the divorce and he  married Elizabeth. And he really needed somebody that took care of him  and cooked meals for him and things like that, because as I say, he  couldn   t do anything in the kitchen to save his life. (Laughter) He built a  little fireplace for her in a little part of the house. Not the big room, but  he put another room on it and it had a fireplace and she used to cook on  the fireplace until she got a stove. She finally got a stove and he got  running water out there. They got electric everything.  My brother was so interesting when he first met Elizabeth, he said,    You  know, sister, Elizabeth is what I really understand now to be a man   s  woman.    He said,    She   s just always ready to do something for her  husband, no matter what. You know, if he might even look hungry, she  gets food right by him. Or something to drink.    And he did drink. He  didn   t drink a tremendous amount, but he liked whiskey. And he would  take me up to the border where they had all these liquor stores. I never  saw so many big liquor bottles in my whole life. (Laughter) And I   d say  to him,    Daddy, we shouldn   t take these things home,    because at that  point, Oklahoma was, you   re not allowed to get liquor. And I said,     Suppose they open your trunk.    He said,    Oh, they   re not going to do  that.    (Laughter) We were lucky. They never did.  20  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  What other memories do you have of coming and visiting your father?  Well the locusts were funny because it was a terribly hot summer. I can   t  remember what summer it was, but it was the summer the locusts came.  And he was married to Elizabeth so we had cots. We all had cots, all  three of us had cots out on the grass because the stone house was just too  darn hot with that kind of heat. It was a very hot summer. I liked  Elizabeth, she was very nice. I wasn   t jealous about my mother or  anything else. It didn   t occur to me. I know she knew that I liked her and  she was always very nice to me and I was nice to her, you know. And so  she came over and she put a net over me. I was lying down on the cot.  And I said,    Oh dear, do I need that?    And Elizabeth said,    You   ll see  later. Wait till morning,    or something like that.    It   s alright.    Well,  there were locusts all over the netting. You can   t imagine waking up  with these things all over your face outside the netting. (Laughs)  Oh, goodness.  It was horrible  But thank God she put the netting over me. I   d have  eaten a few of them. But as I say, my brother said,    She   s a man   s  woman. It   s just amazing when you feel a little bit hungry, you don   t  even have to say so and she   s got something there for you to eat.    She  was that kind of woman. And she was a darling, she was awfully nice.  She could strip deer when he went hunting. She would help him strip the  deer and do things like that that my mother certainly couldn   t have done.  You know, she just did anything that made him happy or made things  pleasant. She wouldn   t buy any made sauce for salad or anything out of  a bottle because she knew he liked to have it made. So she didn   t get it  out of the bottle, she made it. That was exactly the way she was.  Did they have a garden?  Yes, they did. Oh yes, her son, who went to Europe and worked in  Europe a lot, he was an Oklahoma guy, Pawhuska. That was the one that  saw his father hung. He married a French woman. He had married an  Oklahoma woman first of all but she didn   t like France. So they took  their two children, they had two Oklahoma children, and they stayed  with their father and she went home. So he was there with the children.  And he was working for the CIA but he was working on Ford money.  Nobody knew that, but it was CIA. He was a brilliant man. John Hunt is  really very brilliant. He   s my stepbrother and I   m very fond of him. He  was kind of jealous though of Daddy in a way. He liked Daddy and he  wrote a book about him actually. It was called Generations of Men. It  was published by Little Brown. It didn   t actually say it was Daddy, but  he was the character. He would always do whatever Daddy wanted him  to do, but he had the feeling that his mother was just doing everything.  21  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  So you mentioned that you started coming in the summer when you were  around fifteen. Did you try to come every summer then?  Yes, yes I did.  And you would stay for about a month?  Yes. And he would take me   for instance, my grandfather was at the  trader   s post in  Oswego, Kansas . It   s just over the border a little bit up  in Kansas and it   s the trader post. He took me there.  He was asked to  speak at its Centennial.  They had the hundredth anniversary of my  grandfather. He was shot, unfortunately, by the north people. This was  all while the south and the north were fighting. And he was shot by one  of the north guys, in the back, which was too bad. 1967 was the  hundredth anniversary, so he took me along and it was very interesting.  They wanted him to speak about it, about the centennial and everything.  And now they want me to come and talk about it. (Laughs)  So when you would visit your father he would take you places.  He   d bring me to the museum. He would just be delighted with all the  people that would come and look at it. And he would tell me about the  things that they were saying and how he got the Indians to be allowed     they allowed him to have pictures made of him. And that was due to  Roosevelt. All the arts     The WPA Program?  WPA, yes. And he made everything out of it. He got all those paintings  that are in the library right now.  Was he a very sociable person when you came to town?  Oh yes, very much so. Yes, he   d always take me around and introduce  me to the grocery man and everybody. And Fred Lookout, who was the  chief and a great friend of his. I knew all these people and so when I  came here to live, people started saying to me,    How come you know so  many of those people from way back?    I said,    Because I used to come  every summer. Daddy was here.    (Laughs) Oh dear, so funny.  Was he writing? Do you have memories of watching him write?  Yes, I do. Mostly after he married Elizabeth. She did all the typing  though.  So he wrote things out long-handed?  22  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Yes.  What kind of paper did he use?  I don   t remember. I   m sure it wasn   t an electric typewriter. It was just a  plain old typewriter but she used it. And he would write what he wanted  to write, but then she had to turn it into something readable.  Did he share things with you as he was in the process of writing them?  Oh yes, he did. Always. Yeah, he did. Always. He asked me what I  thought about things, always.  He valued my opinion.   What kinds of things did he value?  What kinds of things did he value? I think he valued people being  truthful and kind and very much he wanted them to be caring about other  people. He was very nice about people and he never spoke nasty things  about people. I never heard him say anything about he hated such and  such and so and so and so   never like that. He was a very nice man. He  was very interested in politics, but he didn   t like being a politician. And  when he was going to Washington all the time, of course that was when  I was in college in Baltimore, he would come and get me from  Washington and take me over to Washington and we   d have lunch in the  Senate dining room. Then he   d take me around and introduce me to all  the senators. And then a lot of people would come in to Oklahoma from  D.C. because they thought his life sounded so delightful. And Daddy  would always laugh because they   d say to him,    Oh, Joe, you really  have it made here. This is the way to live.    Daddy would say,    Ha ha ha,  try it.    (Laughter) He would say,    They would last two weeks and then  they   d go somewhere else.    That   s what he said. (Laughter) And he was  probably right.  I   m sorry that my brother never was as close to him as I was. But my  brother was a very interesting man himself. He was a physicist, a  scientist. He did write once to Daddy and he said that somebody had  given him a chemical set or something that the kids get, boys. He wrote  to Daddy and said,    I know that you   re a scientist and I think I   m going  to be a scientist, too. I have this chemical thing,    whatever it was,  something that somebody gave him, I guess. And he said,    Do you think  I   m going to be a scientist, too?    or something like that. Because he  thought of Daddy as a scientist. He wrote to Daddy but Daddy didn   t  write back, which was too bad. Because I don   t think he really felt he  knew John very well because he was just a baby. He didn   t have the  same relationship with him that I had. My brother   s a brilliant, brilliant  man and Daddy liked him very much when they met. He   s never called  23  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  him Daddy. He always calls him    my father,    to this day.  When you would come and visit, were you ever here around birthdays or  holidays or things like that? Any kind of holiday celebrations? Were  there any traditions?  Yes, the neighbors at Christmas time   because I never was here at  Christmas time   but Gladys Buck across the way and her husband and  his son, they were the nearest neighbors. And they used to come and  have drinks with Daddy and they   d go hunt. Daddy went hunting every  fall in New Mexico. He loved doing that. Frank Dobie and a lot of other  guys, it was strictly men. If they had wives, they   d leave them at the  farmhouse and then they   d go out and then they   d tell dirty stories. Not  really dirty stories, but strange men talk, I guess is what it   s called.  (Laughs)  Did you ever meet Frank Dobie?  Yes, I did.  What do you remember about him?  I can   t remember a thing about him except he was funny. (Laughter)  And he and Daddy were great friends and they would tell jokes and no  women were allowed at all. Not that he had a dirty mind, I don   t mean  that. But just men talk.  When you would come and stay with him in the house and there weren   t  bathroom facilities, how did you bathe and take baths?  Well he arranged, he had a pail that had holes in it so he   d have water in  it and you   d pull something (I   ve forgotten what it was) and the water  would come down.  Oh and you would shower.  Shower outdoors. (Laughter) Well it was summer. I wouldn   t have done  it in winter, obviously.  Yes. Were there horses?  No.  No horses. Dogs?  Oh, dogs. Oh my gosh, yes. Oh, mercy. Irish Setters and cinnamon  24  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  colored German things I can   t   all good hunters. And the funny thing  about Daddy   who was I talking to the other day about this? I said he  preferred female dogs because they would mind him better. He wouldn   t  have male dogs because the female dogs were more caring about  whether they got what Daddy wanted to get out in the hunt, somehow.  So he always had a female dog. Interesting.  So what else was life like at the house?  Well, he would say,    I   ve been invited to a party or some kind of thing  and you   re going to go with me.    And we   d do things like that. He had  some friends in Tulsa who were quite rich and they gave nice dinners  and things like that. I   m sorry to say that my Aunt Lillian was not  always very pleased about me because she was jealous. She said to  Daddy,    Why did you take your daughter instead of me?     Was she older or younger than your father?  I   m not sure.  He had how many sisters?  He had four.  Four sisters.  Yeah, the one that I loved   I loved two of them very much. One of them  was very deaf, I loved her. She always wanted to hear what I was doing  and how I was. She   d write me little letters and she was very deaf. She  had one of these things on their chest you had to speak into you know,  couldn   t talk to her from the back. She was very fond of me and very  fond of John. And Lillian was always kind of jealous of me, I think  somehow, which was too bad, because if Daddy wanted to take  somebody someplace it was me, not Lillian. And Lillian still was always  angry that he   d married somebody outside of Oklahoma, which is  ridiculous. He liked Mother and she liked him and that was that.  Were there books in the house?  Oh yes, lots of books.  What writers did he like?  Oh gosh, I can   t even remember. I can   t really remember. I think  European mostly. Not in a language, but European writers. I can   t think  of one right now. But people who are thinkers, you know, that kind of  25  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  person. And when I started writing books, he was so pleased. (Laughs)  What did he say about   oh I know. Somebody said to me on the phone  that they put something in about me and when I told Daddy what it was  they said to me,    Well the world would be a better place if it had more  Virginia Mathews   s in it.    (Laughs) He loved that.  Oh, that   s nice.  Anything that would say a nice something about his daughter. (Laughs)  And jokes, you know we always had jokes about things, too.  Like what?  Oh, I don   t know, the buffaloes being funny or I don   t know, just silly  things.  His book Talking to the Moon is such an observational story about  nature.  Yes.  He took thoughts from the coyotes  They sing twenty-four songs  to the moon    So do you have memories of just sitting with him and observing nature?  Oh yes, absolutely. And when we were in California I remember lying  on the grass with him beside me and we were looking up at a tree and he  was telling me all about birds and what they were doing and all these  kinds of things. He liked me to know more about nature, and he would  tell me more about it, tell me lots of things about birds. He took me with  him sometimes early in the morning to see the prairie chickens dance.  Oh, he did? What was that like?  It was fascinating. And he would take pictures of them. He loved taking  movies. He took a lot of movies. He took movies of me when I was a  little girl.  Where are they now?  My God, I don   t know. I think they   re somewhere. I don   t know where  they are. I   m sure somewhere in my world they   re there, because I had  so many things that I don   t remember. And I moved so many times.  And, of course, when I came down here I couldn   t bring much. (Laughs)  Do you still have things stored someplace?  26  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Well I had all these things that I was going to give to the Library of  Congress you see, because I couldn   t bring   37 box cartons I had of  things. I had made these television programs, lots of them, and film  things and pamphlets and library things going to   well because I just  did so many things. I did a lot with Head Start, for example, going from  state to state and getting all the groups of people who were concerned  with children or young people in each state and getting them to be  literate and so forth.  Were there places that you could go swimming in the summer when you  came?  No, I don   t remember going swimming.  Was he handy with chores around the house?  No, not very. Elizabeth did most of those. No, but what we did do, I   ll  tell you what I loved. We went to the, oh what is the name of the place,  the town? It had a hotel and at the top of the hotel they had these baths,  one way for the men and one way for the women. And every once in a  while, our favorite thing to do when I was visiting was to go there   I  cannot think of the name. I think it was where Will Rogers lived.  Was it Bartlesville or Claremore?  Claremore. Yes. And there was a hotel there.  Downtown?  Yes. At the top of the hotel and we   d go there and I would go to the  women   s and he   d go to the men   s and just have these lovely baths and  we   d both smell like eggs when we got out. (Laughter) So that was as  good as a swim.  You mentioned that he enjoyed keeping up with politics but he didn   t  want to be a politician.  No, he didn   t.  Did he keep up with world news?  Yes, he did. He was interested   he was a democrat.  So did he receive a newspaper?  Yes, he did. He did. But he wouldn   t have wanted to be   there was a  27  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  time when they wanted him to go in the senate as a democrat. Because  we   ve had very few democrats in Oklahoma, you know. (Laughs) And  we don   t have very many now. We only have one, Dan Boren, David   s  son. But he could   ve been easily, and I said,    Oh, Daddy,      I guess that  was when I was in college and I said,    That would be wonderful. My  goodness, you could be a senator.    But he didn   t really like politics. He  thought they were kind of nasty. And I guess maybe they are. I don   t  know. I don   t know. They may be and may not. You   d be interested to  know that I stood next to the desk of Lyndon Johnson in the oval office  when he was signing the legislation for the government to have  television programs for the good of the public. And they gave you pens.  I wish I   d brought it, I could   ve showed it to you. I have it at home.  You have the pen?  Yeah, I have Lyndon Johnson   s pen. I was standing at his left hand and  he said,    Virginia, here   s your pen. You certainly did a darned good job  on the legislation, the lobbying.    I was lobbying, you see. And I was a  very good lobbyist. I worked like a dog to have that go through.  What would you say were your father   s passions?  Oh, I don   t know. Well, nature, really. Animals, birds, all kinds of things  like that,  as well as trees, Black Jacks .  Of course he was a writer and he was an artist as well.  Yes, he was. Yes, he really was.  Tell me about his artistic ability.  Well, he loved making little paintings. Did I show you the one in my     my gosh, I hope I have it in here. Of the coyote?  I haven   t seen that, unless it   s in one of the books. Which I have the  books so     I   m not sure if it is or not.  Is it of the drawing that he did?  Yes, the drawing. I think you   ve probably got it.  It   s in the book, I think.  Yeah it is. It   s in the book, I   m sure. But I wanted to show you this just  28  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  for fun.  So he did drawings?  Oh yeah, pen and ink. He liked pen and ink.  Do you have a lot of his drawings?  Yes, I have quite a few. When he wrote letters, he   d always put little pen  and ink drawings. This is the thing I shot or this is the thing I went after  when we went hunting.  Do you still have all of your letters from him?  Oh yeah, sure I do. And this is, you saw that, I guess. And here   s when  he was old, which makes me sad. But here, now here this is when he   s  telling a joke. See, here   s one. (Laughs) He could be very funny. You  see, and here he was with me and my brother and the chicken. This was  in Pasadena.  Oh, that   s a good one.  Isn   t that great? Aren   t they darling?  They are. They   re wonderful.  And that   s my little brother. Daddy   s got his arm around the chicken.  That was my Plymouth Red.  Your pet chicken?  Yes, my pet chicken. She laid eggs. Yes and oh, Daddy was so pleased  because once the Pasadena newspaper came and took a picture of me  holding, what did I call her? Red something. She was a Long Island Red  or   and my brother was holding the egg. And it had a V on the top  made out of the shell. Funniest thing you ever saw. I still have that  picture, I don   t know where it is. (Laughter) But it was in the newspaper.     Little girl gets pet to give her an egg with her initial on it    and it was a  V right on top. (Laughter) Daddy thought that was very funny.  You mentioned the correspondence you and your father had with letters.  Did he have other people that he corresponded with regularly that you  knew about?  I don   t think so. Well, I don   t know. Maybe some of his friends, I don   t  really know.  29  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Did you also talk on the telephone with him?  Yes.  Did he enjoy talking on the phone?  Oh, yes. I   d always say I was coming or something like that.  Could you describe any significant historical events in Oklahoma that  your father was a part of?  Yes. The BIA, getting the Bureau of Indian Affairs straightened out. He  got John Collier, who was a very reliable, good man to take care of the  BIA and the mineral estate. He really was a very good geologist and he  really understood what it was about. He did get this man and he really  re-made the whole BIA at one point in the    30s. He was good at thinking  that people could do things. He liked people he thought were honest and  truthful and that kind of thing. And Collier was very good. He came  every other month, I think it was, when you get the head rights, you see.  Dad would go to Washington and I remember walking through a hotel     Washington didn   t have many hotels for a long time and they were kind  of old hotels. I remember when Daddy stayed in a particular one and  there were always Indians sitting in the lobby. I knew who they were  because I could tell that they were Osages.  Oh and I didn   t tell you the story about John. One of these days we knew  that Daddy was going to be in Washington. So Auntie, my aunt, took us  down in the car so that we could see Daddy. So John went upstairs in the  elevator and I was with Auntie in the elevator and John got out of the  door because Daddy was there in the hotel and he went down the hall.  We left the door open so we could hear what happened, we wanted to  hear. And John knocked on the door and the door opened. John said,     Are you John Mathews?    And Daddy said,    Yes, I   m John Mathews.     And John said,    I   m John Mathews, too.    He   d never seen him before.  Well he had seen him when he was a tiny baby, but he hadn   t seen him.  He was only about I think nine years old. And he said,    I   m John  Mathews, too.    It was so cute.  But he never really called him Daddy. Strange thing because he didn   t  have that kind of time with him when he was little. John, my brother, is  a genius. The Navy thought he was such a genius that they paid for him  to go to in Eidgen  ssische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, you see.  And he   s got a very nice wife, wonderful wife, and three lovely  daughters. And both of us brought them out. I brought them out first, the  three daughters, to come see Grandpa. And then Daddy brought them  another time, their daddy. And we had a very nice time. Katherine could  30  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  tell you because she liked John. She thought he was very nice. He   s a  nice boy.  Let   s talk about your father   s books. You talked a little bit about  Wa'kon-tah and how that came to be. So let   s run through each one and  I would like for you to tell me what you think is significant about each of  them. Wa'kon-tah was his first book, so tell me your thoughts on that, the  significance of this book.  Well I think it   s the best book he did, really.  Why is that?  Remember that Laban Miles had been with these Osage people for a  long time. So he had all these thoughts about them and whether he  thought they were going to be alright or not alright or what would  happen to them and so forth. So I think Daddy really felt that that was  the most important thing he had done. Because he tried to show that the  Osages could be people who would have a life. And from time to time  the Osages had had a lot of problems. I think the book he liked the best  maybe was Talking to the Moon.  After Wa'kon-tah he published Sundown.  Yes, and that was something, Longmans Green jumped at that because  Wa'kon-tah had been so popular and made a lot of money. Really,   50,000 or something, amazing for the Depression. Longmans Green  was a company I went to work for later but I wasn   t with them right  then. They thought they   d have a killing on it but they didn   t because not  that many people really liked that book or understood it. And it had  several efforts to sort of introduce it, but I think to be honest, the only  thing that really gave it something more than just the book itself was my  introduction. Because I wanted to show what Indian life was like during  those times. It was really a kind of a treatment that the blacks had, very  much so. I mean like the guy saying,    We don   t feed dogs and Indians.     And then the other one that   s in the book that whenever I think of it, it  makes me unhappy. A young man from Iowa was in the Korean War. He  came home in a coffin and they wouldn   t put him in the cemetery  because he was Indian. So there was all of that kind of thing going on.  So the Osages, just like all other Indians I think, just felt like nothing.  Do you think that was a difficult book for him to write?  Sundown? Yes, I do because I think he had passed through all these  senses of he was low on the totem pole and not thought much of and he  31  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  felt alienated. I think it was hard for him, but I think he realized he   d  gone through all those things and survived.  So was it a helpful book for him to write? On a personal level?  Yes, I think it was. Oh, I think it was very good for him. I think it got it  out of his system because he could write about another young man who  made a mess of life. And he realized that he had not made a mess of his  life. And he didn   t. In a way you could say that he had by unfortunately  being divorced or something like that. But it was just not meant to be  because my mother could never have lived the way Elizabeth did. She  just couldn   t have. She was a very delicate, high   I don   t know, not that  she was ever very   well, her family had had a lot of money. See my  great-grandfather was the first big man in money; Singer Manufacturing  Company. And several of those people were just full of money, wealthy  people. And they were descendants from the governors. Before America,  because the United States didn   t have governors for states, they had  governors for one island or something like that. So I don   t think so, no.  Sundown was his second book and you said that it didn   t sell as many  copies as Wa'kon-tah.  No.  After Sundown then     Well, it was sad.  Yeah, the story   oh yes, it is. It   s in many ways a difficult story to read.  Yes, that   s right.  But it   s an important story.  Yes, it is. Yes. But I think Daddy felt that by writing it, he sort of shed  anything that he had ever felt when he was young. And I think he did  feel something. For instance, I think when he went to OU he probably     because he was good looking and smart and good physique and  everything like that. But when he really got with some other people I  think he felt like change for two cents.  Then he wrote Talking to the Moon. So tell me about this book, the  significance of this story.  Oh my goodness, I don   t know. Well I think it   s because he was a nature  boy, he really was. He loved to see everything that was happening to  32  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  trees, things that were happening to prairie chickens. He liked cattle. He  and I always used to laugh when all the cattle came to the gate to see us.  He liked all that kind of thing. He liked animals and trees. And, of  course, he loved the place where he lived. That   s why he wanted to be  buried there, too.  This is family land that your family had?  Yes.  So was it allotted land?  Allotted, oh yes.  How many acres?  Altogether, I don   t know how much. We have never sold any of it.  You still have all of it?  Oh yes, we have all of it. I think it   s 500 acres all together. Allotments  you see, all of my family had allotments.  Was your father leasing it out for ranchers to run cattle on it?  Oh yes, oh sure. Absolutely. And we have the same people that we had  when he was there.  That lease the land?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. The families are just   for instance out in Shidler,  there   s a family that   s been with us for generations. And then my Aunt  Marie left me some of her land out there, too.  Out around Shidler?  Yes, she was very fond of me. And she was so pleased that I would  always sit and talk to her about what I was doing, the work I was doing;  she would listen to that. Lillian could   ve cared less, you know, but that  was alright.  Did your aunts stay here in Oklahoma in this area for the most part?  Well, one of them did. My Aunt Josephine, who I was very, very fond  of, she was the oldest one and she   s the mother of this darling cousin of  mine who   s got Alzheimer   s and I   m so worried about her. I   m trying to  33  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  get her away from North Carolina. She   s in a nursing home. Her son was  adopted and he stole everything she had. The minute she had  Alzheimer   s he took everything, power of attorney, all her money and  her land, everything. And he   s paid for her to be in this place in North  Carolina but I think he   s gone now and I   m worried about her. And  another one of my first cousins, I   m trying to get him to go down, get  her, and bring her back here. Because she grew up here and she knew  people and people would know her. Of course she   s awfully ill. But she  knows me. Because, you see, when I went to Washington always, and  I   d go all the time, I would always call her. Because I was at her  wedding, I was a bridesmaid, and we were almost like sisters and I was  very fond of her. And as a matter of fact, I told her not to marry the man  she married. Because she said,    Oh, he loves God.    And I said,    Well  does he love you?    (Laughter) I   m not so sure.  Did your father go to church here?  I don   t think he did.  So you never went to church with him when you came and visited?  No. I went to church with my aunts sometimes. Now Josephine is the  mother of our darling sister. I called her the other day and the nurse said,     Oh, there   s no use talking to her, she won   t know who it is.    I said,     She will. She always knows because she knows my voice.    And low  and behold, she said,    Oh it   s my cousin, Virginia,    right away. You see,  because I always talked to her and she knew my voice. But I   m very  anxious to get her back here. That was Aunt Josephine, she died of  cancer. All my aunts died of cancer, in fact all of them died of cancer.  The four aunts died of cancer and my father died of cancer, which is not  a good thing. My Aunt Florence was the youngest. She didn   t stay here,  she married the congressman and she lived in Washington. I used to go  to Washington and see her sometimes. She wanted very much to have  me come and spend the night and see her. And Bill is my cousin, he   s  their son. I   m real fond of him. He   s supposed to come any day now and  come see me. I don   t know when he   s coming. He   s got 400 acres and  he   s got a big sign up for it. And I said,    Bill, don   t do anything to try to  put it into pieces because it   ll just go. Wait till you sell it to somebody  that can buy it.     So Talking to the Moon was the third book and did it do better than  Sundown?  Oh, it did very well. It was published, I don   t know, somehow they  missed getting it to the press because he had a friend from Oxford who  was the head of the press and I don   t know why he didn   t take it, but I  34  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  guess the University of Chicago wanted it and that   s where it went first.  And yes, I think it was very popular. People like it because he   s thinking  about nature and I think people like it. I know the Library for the Blind  has it on a recording. And he gave 24 coyote calls, different ones. Do  you believe that? They have calls for love, because the moon   s out,  because it   s going to rain, or because there are buffaloes around, all  these things. And he gave all of those when he did that for the library     that   s Library of Congress, too.  So then after Talking to the Moon he wrote Life and Death of an  Oilman.  Yes, and he did a very good job on that. Well, that governor had given  him a place in  the State  Regents. He made him a Regent for Education  because he felt that he was so well-educated it would be a good thing.  And I   m sure it was. But there were lots of people who didn   t like that  governor.  Governor Marland?  Yes, Marland, right. But he was very generous about  tell ing the nice  things about him.  Did you ever meet him?  No, never did. No, I don   t even know when he died. I don   t think he  lasted terribly long.  So you think that book is significant because it is a biographical story  about Marland?  Yes, and Daddy made him look better than a lot of people thought he  was, let   s put it that way. I don   t know why they didn   t think so, but you  know, a man who is out to get things, and he was, always makes  enemies. You know that. (Laughs) But Daddy made him look real good  and I think he liked that, he appreciated it.  And his fifth book was The Osages: Children of the Middle Waters. Tell  me about that one.  Well, that   s the one he went up to Missouri and he spent a long time. He  was gone a long time at that. He spoke Spanish because he   d been in  New Mexico, you see. And he spoke French. And, of course, he really  was very assiduous about going all through the archives, too. He didn   t  just listen to what people told him, he went all through the papers that  they had. And it is true that the Osages really were the top people and  35  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  they   re almost half-founders of St. Louis, really. That   s why we   ve now  bought Sugar Loaf, that mound, because it   s mostly full of Osages.  Some other people too, Omahas and others. But he was there a long  time. And he went all over the country. He went to Illinois. He was the  one that first found out that Osages had ever been in Illinois. Nobody  ever thought they   d been in Illinois, but they were. And he   d go to  Washington state. He   d go all kinds of places like that to see where the  Osages had been and why they left or why they didn   t or whatever.  Did he take notes then for his books?  Yes, he did.  Had notebooks that he kept or   ?  I don   t know what he did with them. I don   t really know. I know that  some of his diaries were stolen.  Oh, they were?  Yes. Well or they were put into an auction, I think, which they shouldn   t  have been. Because they put a lot of things of Daddy   s in an auction. I  was at that auction and I was just furious.  After he passed away?  Yes.  Was it an auction here in Pawhuska?  Yes. It was from the family   s house, my grandmother   s house, I call it.  It   s now in the hands of Pawhuska, I guess. The Treasury, the Treasure  of the Osages, that   s it.  Then did he write any more books or was he in the midst of writing a  book?  Yes, he was. He was going to have it called Somebody something, so  many Hundred Mornings or something was the title for it. And he was  going to write that about his feelings about, I guess, nature, mostly,  because that   s what he really liked best. And he would sit drumming his  fingers when the dances were on and on the arm of his chair he would do  the dancing with his fingers. And he liked music. Oh, and also he really  did like acting, too.  You had mentioned that.  36  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Yes, he really did.  Which of his books is your favorite? Do you have a favorite?  Well, I don   t know. I think I liked Talking to the Moon the best because  that   s his most natural nature. He   s watching birds, he   s watching prairie  chickens, he   s watching things like that.  Do you have a favorite passage in that book that you just love?  Oh, I can   t remember right now. Probably several, but I don   t remember.  I do like, I think the book about, oh I think Wa'kon-tah is really a very  interesting book, a very good book. Because it   s all of the thoughts of  another person, you see, and he put those things together as what he  knew and it made a really excellent. As I put in the introduction  for Sun  Down,  there were very few Indians who were considered educated or  really terribly interesting. There were people who had gone to the  Olympics. And, of course, Indians were good runners and they did all  these other things. I named some of them in the book. But I don   t know.  I don   t really know.  I think the most interesting in a way is his last book, The Osages,  because that really shows the history or this group of people and it   s  very, very interesting. He went all over to just make sure that it was the  Osages. And he did know that it was. But I think that   s a very interesting  book, it   s fascinating. Have you read it?  I have not read that one yet. That   s the one that I   d like to try to find a  copy of, maybe at a used bookstore or something.  Oh, yes. The paperback one is very good, it   s not the hardback. I wish  they   d go and start the hardback again, too.  I don   t know if you had told me this or if I read it somewhere, but  several of his books were originally published by one  publisher hoping  to make fame and money .  That   s right.  Were you instrumental in getting the University of Oklahoma Press to  get the rights to the books?  Absolutely.  Tell me about that a little.  37  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Well I remember that one of the publishers, I don   t remember which one  it was, it may be Chicago, they were going to try to do something  different with that book. I don   t remember what it was. Something to do  with the   it would come to the end of its author, kind of thing. I don   t  remember exactly how it went. But I went to them right away and I said,     You   re making a big mistake about this and you must send it back to  where it really belongs.    And I got them to do it. I knew most of those  publishers, so they were willing to do it, which was good. I was awfully  glad, because it really did belong back in Oklahoma, absolutely. And  that dear wonderful guy that was his editor, I can   t think of his name  right now but he was a darling man.  Was it Brant?  No, it wasn   t Brant, who was his friend that he went to college with   who first built the Oklahoma Press . This was another man who had  been this editor. I wish I could think of his name, but I have it  somewhere. But he was dying and I went to see him.    Oh, Virginia,    he  said,    Your father was the most wonderful man and I had such a  wonderful time being his editor.    He said,    I   m very proud of you and  I   m proud that you have taken up where your father left off.    That   s  what he said, which was very sweet of him.  Do you think that your father   s writing changed over the years? Did you  see changes in his writing?  Yes, I do. I think I do because in the last one, the Children of the Middle  Waters, he really was digging. I mean he was going to be a historian. I  don   t think he ever thought of himself really as a historian before that  very much. Maybe when he did Marland, I don   t know. That was a  biography. But I think he really felt that that was a job and it was a  history job and he had to really make it. I think he really worked very  hard at that.  Did he feel a responsibility to the tribe?  Very much so.  And to the history and the accuracy?  Oh, yes, oh absolutely, yes. Very much so. Of course, a lot of it   s very  difficult to tell for sure, you know. And poor Dr. Hunter, who   s the  archaeologist that   s working on this, she was awfully pleased when I  wrote a letter to the chief and said why I thought it was terribly  important for history for us to have that mound in St. Louis and all of  that. It was really the Osages who did most of it. And there were other  38  tribes, of course, too. And poor thing, the Congress would say,    Well,  we don   t need to know who   s buried there. We don   t really know who   s  buried there.    Well, yes we do, because that   s what her job is. They  didn   t want to do it. But I   m glad they did. And what I said was,    That   s  our past history, but we have a lot of future history to do. Because we   re  not doing the thing that I very much would like us to do and that is to  bring some of the people like my brother and other people that I know  whose sons and daughters have done a lot of good wonderful work,  Osages, I would like to have them meet with the guys who are just  seniors and juniors in high school and talk to those people.    Okay, so  you   re a teacher? Why did you want to be a teacher? Do you think I  might like to be a teacher? What do you have to do to be a teacher?    that  kind of thing. Or a scientist.    I know that if my brother could come and  talk about science that he   s done, boy, the boys would be so anxious to  get there they couldn   t wait.  But now, they   re trying to get the money to go but they don   t know what  they want to do when they get there. They want to go to college, but they  don   t know what they want to do. They just want some money to do it.  You know? And I think that   s too bad. I would like to see something  done about that. I know quite a lot of people who have sons and  daughters, not in my generation, but I have friends that have   for  instance, Katherine has a nephew, Tolly, I don   t know if you know him,  Red Corn. He   s the chemist and he   s marvelous. He   s really very, very  bright. Now he lives here, so he   s right here so that people could bring  groups of kids and say,    Here   s this guy, this is what he does. He   s a  mineral man and he does all these things with minerals, with oil, and so  forth.    But they don   t do it, which annoys me. I keep trying to get them  to do that, but they don   t do it.  I tried to get money from the Ford Foundation. I had Ford money for  some of the jobs that I did, mostly for Vista. I got the Vistas going and I  got them going with books in there so that particularly in the south, you  see, before a certain time in the beginning of the    60s, no black people  were allowed in libraries in the south, so they couldn   t read. So I did a  lot of work on that one, too. I got the first Atlanta meeting of the black  university, which was called Atlanta University   that was the black one  and then Emory was the white one. So I got the two of them to get  together and they did the first one in Atlanta that was black and white. I  did a lot of that kind of stuff. I got shot at through a glass window  because I was with a black man in Atlanta and we were going past Stone  Mountain, which is where the Klan lives and works. And he said to me,  this nice black man said,    Virginia,    he said,    Now, can you get on the  floor?    Well I could do it then, I was a little thinner than I am now. And  no sooner had I gotten away from the window that a bullet came right  through. It was terrible. You have no idea what it was like in the south.  39  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  We   ll have to interview you another time and hear more about those  things. I have a few more questions to ask. Who were your father   s  favorite authors or poets or artists? Does anyone come to your mind?  Shakespeare. Yes, he really liked Shakespeare very much. He admired  him very much. The plays and the odes, oh the poems, everything.  Shakespeare was somebody that he kind of liked.  What about artists?  Artists, I   m trying to think. I can   t really think of any particular artist,  except for the masters. I mean he and my mother were just crazy about  all the masters, mostly Italian and French and all those. They loved  museums.  What did Oklahoma mean to your father?  Well it was where he grew up. And he knew everything that he knew  came from here and came from the older men because you see, he had  no brothers. He had four sisters and his father died quite young, before  he went to college, I think. So really the people he went to see and talk  to were the older men and the Indian camps and that   s where he really  learned a lot. Because it was hard for him to not have any other boys to  play with, you know, there really was nobody.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oh my, well Oklahoma means to me, of course, Daddy, and Daddy   s  family, and the Osages. And I do care very much about the Osages and I  would like to see them do better than they   ve done now. I mean they   ve  done well, but there are always people picking at them. And they   re  getting a lot of money from the gambling, which I don   t think is  particularly good. I think they need the money, but I   m afraid that the  government is going to take   any of the places that are on state they   re  going to take away. Because I think they want to get whatever we   ve  got.  Tell me about the Black Jacks and the plans for it.  The plans for it. Well, what I   m hoping is right in here. The National  Trust for Historic Preservation, that   s it. That   s what I want. And I sent  for a magazine that I knew had about Trust Historic Preservation and I  got in touch with them just by myself and talked to them and said that I  had a father who had been a very famous author and also very artistic  really in many ways and he had lived in this small house, and it was a  cabin really, one room. He was buried there and I would like to have  40  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  people be able to go and see where he did his books because he wrote all  his books there and it really was what he loved. And I think they really  could make a trust of them, I think they should. But unfortunately the  archaeologist we have is very nice, she   s been doing a great job, but that  is just one little thing, you know. She   s eager to go   now for instance,  they   re all going over to Missouri. I   m not going because it   s very   and  I don   t know how Katherine   s going to take it because it   s very rough  country. They said she   d have to bend over and crawl into the caves to  see what was inside. I saw the caves in France and they were fascinating,  but they   ve stopped letting people go in because their breathing at them  has gotten disappeared. I was afraid Daddy   s pictures would fade too,  that he painted. But they   re still in pretty good shape, I think.  Out at the house?  Yes. Because I took Marsha out there to see it and she thought it looked  fine. And I think it does. But I don   t know how I   m going to   I   ve got  to somehow find the funds. I   m sort of seeing whether Conoco might do  something to help, I don   t know. We   re going to need some funding, and  it doesn   t need an awful lot of work. The roof is alright and everything.  But the garden and all of the things around it needs to be fixed. And  somebody needs to do it. But if I could get the chief   and I hope I can  get Katherine   s brother, Charles, who is a great friend of mine. I think  he   s going to help me with this because I   ve given him the name of  some funds that I think maybe could be had. Because it wouldn   t take  much money, really. It   s not a big job but it needs to be done. And the  pathway up, gosh, it was so tough I didn   t know whether I was really on  the right road. And it isn   t road of course, it   s just full of big holes and  all this kind of stuff. But I took her out there. She was delighted with it.  Did you take the pictures out there?  My husband did. I haven   t been out there yet.  Oh, I   d love to take you out.  I   d love to go. What about unpublished works by your father?  Oh, well there are a lot of them.  Are there?  Yes, in the Western  History Collection  at OU. It   s in their library. And  I think John Hunt is the one that really has to take them. Because he  knew Daddy well enough and having written Generations of Men   you  should get that book and read it. You   d find it fascinating. Because it   s  really about Daddy, but, of course, it doesn   t say his name or anything  41  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  like that. But Little Brown published it and I think probably Lou King at  the library has it, I bet she does.  We may have it at the OSU Library. I   ll have to check.  They might. Yeah, Generations of Men. And it was John Clinton Hunt.  Did you ever harbor the idea of maybe moving here with your father  when he was living?  Well, no because my world was really publishing and television and all  these other things, movies, and going all over the states. And doing Head  Start. See, I wrote the manual for Head Start and all these things. I  couldn   t have done it here because I had to be all over the country. Mrs.  Bush, Barbara, was a good friend to me. She came in and out a lot. She  always encouraged me to do things.  We were talking about the unpublished works and you said that John  Clinton Hunt, you   re hoping that he   s going to be doing some things  with those.  I would like him to try to finish them because I think he could do it.  Because he knew what Daddy was wanting to do and the beginnings of  them. I don   t know what kind of state he   s in, he   s maybe not as well as  I   d hoped he was. I think his birthday was in January. He   s about a  month older than I am or two months older than I am.  If he doesn   t then what happens?  Well, I don   t know. I don   t know. I suppose I could try to do it myself.  Possible, but I   d rather have him do it because he knew what Daddy  wanted to do. And I think there were a lot of diaries and other things that  he had. And I don   t know   I know that the diaries he had at Oxford  were thrown out. I don   t know who threw them out but they couldn   t be  found. But fortunately, John Hunt took those things and put them into  the library there in the Western  History Collection .  So what are your plans for the letters and things from your father? As  far as the things that you have, what will happen to those someday?  Oh, I don   t know, I   ll probably give them to his grandchildren. Because  they   d like to have   they had letters from him too. And those three girls  are just wonderful girls, just wonderful. They   re all scientific, all of  them. And the youngest one, Christine, has a job that most nurses don   t  have. She   s the head of a big hospital. And another one, Sarah, is also a  very, very good scientist.  42  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  You   re talking about your brother   s daughters?  Yes, that   s right. And the other one is doing studies of bipolar disorder.  The other niece I have is studying that with a doctor, a psychologist, and  she   s very interested in it. You   re down, so down that you   ll never get  up again, you know, or you   re so high that you... But Laura is working  on that.  How did your father influence other people?  I think he influenced a lot of people. Not only Osages and other Indians,  but I think also just from his interest in nature, particularly, and history.  You see, a historian is what he really is. I have a big disk of bronze with  his name on it and its frame. It   s historical. I   m very proud of that. I  meant to bring it with me, but I forgot it. I have a big ribbon on it. It   s so  heavy, if you hang it around your neck you practically    (Laughs) I  don   t know what happens.  How did your father influence you?  Well I think he influenced me by making me want to do things that  would help other people. I think he had a lot of that feeling, too. And, of  course, I love history. I just love history. And I also must say I enjoy  politics really. I do. Now for instance, I am on the committee for saving  Social Security and Medicare. And I really work at it. I write to  congressmen and say,    What a stupid thing it is to take money away  from older people when they just have children that are going to have to  use the money to keep them alive if they want to keep them alive. Or  unless they want to put them on an ice float like the polar bear and just  send them out to sea.    Well I mean, really. (Laughs) I hope nobody does  that to me. I   ll raise hell. (Laughter) I won   t stay on the ice cube.  I don   t think that   s going to happen. What would your father say about  you?  I don   t know. I have a feeling he would say,    I   m very proud of her.    I  think he would.  I think he would, too. What do you want people to know about your  father?  I want them to know that he was a very unusual man. That he cared a lot  about his people and he cared a lot about nature. And he cared a lot  about things being right. He was very careful with other people; he was  caring about them. He was very nice   I don   t think he would   ve ever  been a politician because he thought it was not a nice thing to be.  43  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Because there are some things about it that aren   t nice, you know. But if  you are just trying to do something that   s useful for people, and what I  have mostly tried to do is for young people because I think a lot of them  need a lot more help than they get. And their parents, for example, I do a  lot of training for parents, too. About are you discouraging or are you  encouraging your kids, saying things like,    Well, go ahead and take a  bath,    do this and do that. But they don   t ask people to talk. They don   t  ask the children to talk about things. That   s why I loved Sesame Street. I  enjoyed that so much. That was lots of fun. Joan Ganz Cooney came and  got me from the National Book Committee and said,    I need you for  Sesame Street.    (Laughter) I said,    Oh, my.    And the guys that made the  Muppets and everything were just fascinating. I had such a good time at  that. I   ve had fun at everything I   ve done, to tell you the truth. Daddy  used to say that. He said,    You seem to enjoy everything so much.    And  I do. I do. I like what I do and I   m glad that I took all those cartons to  put them in the storage and had them go and get them and they did. Now  they   re going to be opened to everybody, which is wonderful.  That   s really why I asked about your letters and things, because I was  wondering if you had planned to donate them to a museum or someplace  where they would be available for researchers or for things like that?  Well I suppose I could, but I   d kind of like to give them to his  grandchildren.  Yes, that   s fine too.  Yeah, I think so.  That   s a wonderful thing to do.  The only thing they didn   t like about Grandfather was that he had heads  around his room. You know, he used to have the heads of animals he   d  shot. And when my nieces first came and saw that, they said,    Oh, oh,  oh     He said,    Well that   s alright, that   s what they   re for. They   re to be  hunted.    (Laughter)  We were talking about what people should know about your father.  He was very kind and very decent. Very decent. People just were drawn  to him. They liked him, not just because he was good looking, which he  was, and very well-educated, which he was. But there was something  about him that made people want to be with him and talk to him.  Did writing come easy for him?  44  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Yes, I think it did. I think it did. If he knows what he   s talking about. I  think it was very lucky that the first book he did was Wa'kon-tah  because that was almost ready for him, you know, because it was diaries  and he could make a book out of it. And he did. But I think it made him  realize that Laban Miles, who was a very nice man, I think he really took  all the little pieces and put them together, which was very good. And  then I think he really worked hard to write it, I   m sure, because it was  kind of like a diary, and then he had to put that into a story.  So I think really the book that he liked the best probably was Wa'kon-tah  because it certainly told about Indian people and how they felt about  things. But the other thing was nature. I mean he really loved those  prairie chickens. And he and I would go out to the Tall Grass Prairie  Preserve and look at the baby buffalos. They were so cute. In the spring  there   s these tiny little baby buffalos following after mother whose head  is this big. (Laughter) They   re so cute. He loved all those things. He  loved nature and he liked animals. He really did like animals. And when  the cattle would come to the gate to see us, he   d say,    Isn   t that nice,  they think we have something to eat.    I said,    No, they don   t, they know  perfectly well this isn   t eating time.    They just wanted to see us.  What did he teach you? Did he teach you to drive?  No. (Laughter) No, I learned to drive in Switzerland. And believe me,  that was tough. I had to back down between two cans that I would hit. I  got my driver   s license in Switzerland. It was hard. But I knew when I  came back I was going to be working for Longman   s Green. Because I  had arranged that before I came back because I wanted to be sure I had a  job.  How did your father view himself?  I think he viewed himself as something of nature. You see, he was  brought up a Catholic but I don   t really think it sank in somehow. He  had this feeling that nature had him. I can   t explain what I mean exactly  but he just didn   t   he never went to church. His sisters always did, his  mother always did.  So are you saying that nature was spiritual for him?  Yes, I think so, yes. Absolutely. I think really that   s what he thought  counted. Nature would do it somehow for him. But I don   t think he  really took much to the sacraments and all those things. Because I know  once he   d been in Great Britain, he never went to church again. I know  he would do it to please his family, if he had to. I was with him when he  died.  45  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  You were?  Yes.  I arrived on Saturday and he wanted to see the Kentucky race with  me.  He died on the   not on the date we have, not    79, he died in    78. It  was Sunday, Sunday afternoon. But it doesn   t matter. The next day was  the next day. Because I went to church that day with Lillian and I said to  her,    Aunt Lillian, I think that Daddy is going to die. And I think unless  you come with me after church you won   t see him again alive.    She  said,    He   s not going to die. That   s ridiculous. He   s not going to die.     You know, Aunt Lillian always thought nothing was going to happen   unless  she thought it was going to happen. So I got her to go with me  and I   m glad she did. She went in the morning, Sunday morning,  because it was Saturday that I got there and he and I were going to see  the Kentucky Derby. And that was the first time the Kentucky Derby  was in June instead of May. So I got there Saturday afternoon but he was  too far gone. He went into a coma almost right away. And then Elizabeth  had somebody giving him morphine, and I saw him reach down to his  stomach because he was in pain. I said to this woman,    Give him  another shot of whatever it is that you   re giving to him,    and she said,     Oh I can   t do that, he   ll become a drug addict     I said,    No, I don   t  think he   s ever going to be a drug addict.    And so then I called the  doctor and I said,    This lady doesn   t want to give him another shot,    and  he said,    Give her the phone. Do exactly what Ms. Mathews tells you to  do.    Because I wasn   t going to have him in pain. It was ridiculous. Why  should he be in pain?  So that was Saturday afternoon and then Sunday morning I took Lillian  there and she was glad she went. He said some little joke to her. He  looked up at her, she was leaning over him and he looked up at her and  said some tricky little thing. He had a special name for her, I   ve  forgotten what it was, a silly name, you know. So she kind of laughed a  little bit and that was it, that was the last she saw him. And then Sunday  afternoon, Elizabeth sat in one chair and I sat in another chair and we  were both there when he died. But that was Sunday. However, it doesn   t  matter.  What was his memorial service like? Did you help plan it?  Yes, I did. Yes, it was at the church. Well, for the aunts too, you know.  At which church?  The Catholic Church. He wouldn   t have cared but they did. And so Aunt  Lillian and Aunt Marie both came and I   m sure that he was perfectly  glad that they did. Have you seen that picture   oh you have never seen  that picture in the church, have you?  46  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  No.  Oh, it   s beautiful. It   s perfect. Each side of the altar, on the right-hand  side is the Mathews window. And it had to be on the other side another  family got another one. Beautiful. And oh, they   re beautiful windows.  And the family had to get permission of the father, the Pope, to get  permission to get Indians into the window. Because there are Indians  there, but they had never been anything before but priests and Virgin  Mary and all those things, nobody that wasn   t Christian. Which  apparently they weren   t, I mean they were half naked. And then the  other window is pretty much the same, they had to do the same thing,  get permission to put them in there. But they   re beautiful windows and  people love to come and see them. They   re huge, they   re very big. And  they   re lovely.  So you had the memorial service at the church.  Yes.  And then?  Then he was buried next to his cabin up there. His grave is there. So the  next day we had the burial. Eddie Red Eagle, he was the one that gave  the Indian last rights. And I remember he put an eagle feather in  Daddy   s casket with him. They do that. And we were all there. John  Hunt and his sister were there and of course all the aunts and everybody.  But he really wanted to be buried there. And he said,    I liked it when I  was alive. I   m going to like it when I   m dead.    That   s what he said.  (Laughs) He didn   t want to be any place else. He really didn   t want to  be   he could   ve been with the family, his mother and sisters and all,  other brothers that died and so forth, but that was his place and he really  loved it. He really did. He wanted to just be there. And so I   m glad.  Elizabeth always planted lovely daffodils around everything. And John  Hunt was a very good son. He came home from Europe because she had  a stroke and they had to get a helicopter to go away from there. And then  John Hunt was able to buy a house in town because he knew they  couldn   t go out there again, just impossible for his mother. So they had a  little house on 18th Street, I think it was. I was to go see them there, of  course.  Your father and Elizabeth?  Yes, and Elizabeth, oh yes. She stayed there after he died. I came twice  to Oklahoma from New York to see her and see how she was. I felt  badly for her. She was very nice. She was awfully pleased that I came.  47  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  And she said,    I really feel as though I have a family,    which was very  sweet. But it was very sad. It was sad for me to see him having to die  there. But I guess that was what he wanted. And I really would like to  have people go and see where he wrote because I think they would enjoy  it. Lots of people want to go. They   re always saying,    Oh, I want to see  where your father wrote those books.    I hope I can get it done. I don   t  know whether I can or not. I   ll try. National Trust for Historic  Preservation, that   s what I   ve got.  It would be nice when we have the Literary Landmark dedication if  people wanted to go out there that they could.  Yes, yes.  We could tell them how to get out there.  Absolutely. It isn   t hard. You go off the county road and then I know  exactly where to go and on the right-hand side it   s Gladys Buck, who is  the neighbor   they were very fond of them. The Bucks always went and  had Christmas with him, and all kinds of things.  Do you have to have a pick-up truck to get out there?  Pretty much.  A car won   t make it?  Well, depends on how high it is.  The grass?  Yes. There were a lot of holes because it was early you see, it was early  summer and it was quite wet. And we   ve bumped around some of these,  but I knew I was going to the right place because I knew Gladys Bucks     was over to the right and Daddy   s is to the left. And we had to go across  the grass, you see. And, of course, actually that part of it belongs to my  cousin, Bill Finn. He owns that so we can go across it any time we want  to. Well and I don   t know whether he   ll get all his land or not. He has a  big sign up for 400 acres. So I don   t know what he   ll do. He lives in  Washington.  So for anything to happen with the house as far as making it available  for preserving it and for the public to view it, will there have to be  permissions of crossing private land to get to it?  No, because it   s Bill   s land.  48  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  Would a road have to be built to get to it?  Well if it were to be a bus or something like that, if it were a touring bus  I don   t think it could do that.  But there   s really not a road to get to it?  No, there isn   t a road. But you can see where tracks have been but it   s  not a road. You go into the road and Gladys   , she   s  been  dead for a  long time, she   s a very dear friend. When Daddy died, I took all his guns  and gave them to Jordan, who was Gladys    son. I knew my brother  wouldn   t go hunting, and I certainly wasn   t going hunting. So I gave  them to Jordan and he loved to have them. But her place is over there  now. She   s dead, of course. And he   s married to people that I know up  in Kansas a little bit. They   re very sweet. When I had to have my gall  bladder out, they came and got me and took me down to Tulsa to the  hospital and everything. So they were just acting like family. They were  just sweet.  How would your father want to be remembered?  Remembered? I think he would like to be remembered as a very good  Osage who really tried very hard to put them forward in the world of  people. You know, I really think so. I think if he were around he would  say just what I said, that I would like to have people come and talk to  these kids that are in high school before they get to   you know, why try  to have money if you don   t know what you want to do with it? And  that   s what Congress is doing now. They   re getting all these monies but  the kids don   t know what they want to do. And they haven   t talked to  anybody about it. And I don   t think there are very many counselors.  There used to be more counselors for instance, for seniors in high  school. But there aren   t that many anymore.  I remember Ladybird Johnson. I was in the White House once with one  of the parties we were having. And I   ve forgotten what it was about, but  anyway, she said,    Oh, Virginia,    we were standing together and having  some sherry or something, and she said,    Virginia, I   d love to have a  social evening the way we   re having for artists and people, for Indians.  And maybe your father could come and we   d have some other Indian  people that you know. I   d love to do that.    She was a Texan and she   d  read Daddy   s books and she was very fond of them, Ladybird was. And  I said,    Well that   s just wonderful. Because think how wonderful it  would be for the kids to know that their people were having a party at  the White House.    And so we almost got it, but it was the Vietnam War  that did the trick because they had some people who came in and were  very rude and ugly and then they stopped having these socials. And I  49  Neurohr  Mathews  Neurohr  Mathews  was so disappointed. Ever since I looked at the first ladies, always with  the first ladies, and thought,    Maybe they   ll do that.    But she would   ve  done it. She was a very nice woman, I liked her. She cared a lot about  people. And she loved Daddy   s books. You know, she was just so  pleased that I was his daughter. I said,    It would be so wonderful for  young Indian people to realize that there are people coming to the White  House. How exciting     So I almost got it done. I thought Laura would,  Laura Bush, but she wasn   t the right one either. (Laughter) Her husband  wouldn   t have liked it, I don   t think.  Well, this has been wonderful to be able to interview you today. It   s  really been a privilege.  Oh, thank you, aren   t you sweet.  Thank you so much. I really do appreciate it.  It   s lots of fun talking about it.  -------  -------
