Story_ID: 534396
Speaker 1: So, let's start with, with your history.  Let's--we'll start on your mother's side of the family.  If you can give me your mother's name and spell it out for me, your mother's date of birth, place of birth, and then as much as you can remember about your mother, your mother's life (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, my mother's still living, and it's Louise [Louise Allen Davies], I think her, her middle name is Elsie.  I don't think she likes that, but Elsie ma- maiden name was Allen, and Wilkerson after being married to my father [Homer Wilkerson].  She is in her third marriage now and finally I think her happiest time, which is wonderful.  For her I think the first two were mistakes, you know 'cause she was quite unhappy.  She had five children: three from my, her marriage with my father and two from her second marriage.
Speaker 1: Now her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: And that, I have it all on the form, but she will be eighty-five this May 22nd, and she was born 1920.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: Born in Lawnside, New Jersey, and that was an area I think that was predominantly black.  Her father [Thomas Allen] was a minister and she's one of I think maybe five children, two, two sets, but the same mother and father, but she has, had a sister who died maybe five years ago who was 104 years old, who was an adult when, you know, she was a little girl.
Speaker 1: So, Lawnside, New Jersey what, what did your mother ever speak about Lawn, Lawnside?  Is it L-A-W-N--
Speaker 2: N-S-I-D-E.  I think you know they were more to themselves as, as a family.
Speaker 1: Was it a rural community (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was rural yes.
Speaker 1: Now were they farmers?
Speaker 2: It was also a part of the Underground Railroad, so I think, you know, there's some people who have done research in terms of you know the movement of slaves to emancipation areas and Lawnside was one of them, so you know a lot of blacks stopped in Lawnside.  And I don't really know what else it was known for.  I just know that it was a large black population there.
Speaker 1: So what--did your mother ever tell any stories about having growing up--I mean, grown up, having grown up in Lawnside?
Speaker 2: No, not, not really, not really.
Speaker 1: Did she ever talk about the Underground Railroad that was, that, that had come through?
Speaker 2: No I, I don't, I, no, not much.
Speaker 1: What did she--okay.
Speaker 2: My, my grandmother [Eva Johnson] raised me from the time I was, my paternal grandmother, from the time I was nine, even though I saw my mother, but when my parents separated and divorced she lived with a sister, the sister died at 104 who wasn't able to keep three children and so my brother [Homer Wilkerson] and I were raised by my grandmother from the time I was nine years old.
Speaker 1: Now as that in Camden [New Jersey] or was that in Lawnside?
Speaker 2: In Camden.
Speaker 1: In Camden.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We lived in Camden and then my mother moved when she separated, she moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because we had our aunt in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 534397
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother [Louise Allen Davies] do for, as an occupation?
Speaker 2: She was a seamstress.  She would make all of our clothes, even my brother's [Homer Wilkerson] suits.  She was just excellent, I mean, she could have opened up, you know, a business dressmaking, but she worked for a factory making coats.  Learned later that she was very good at, she just took and started taking an art class three years ago and had always been able to paint.  It's quite something.  So now she gives us paintings for Christmas.
Speaker 1: Now, who taught your mother to sew?  Did she ever talk about learning the, the trade as a seamstress?
Speaker 2: I think it was her mother, from her mother, and her mother was a housekeeper.  Her mother was from Virginia.
Speaker 1: This is the grandmother that you lived with?
Speaker 2: No, I lived with my father's mother [Eva Johnson].
Speaker 1: Your father's [Homer Wilkerson] side okay.
Speaker 2: My mother's mother--
Speaker 1: Your maternal grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: --died when I was maybe five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the one that lived in Virginia.  What was her name?
Speaker 2: Louella [Louella Turner Allen].  Turner was her maiden name, Allen's is the person she married and he was a minister.  I don't know much about him.  I think they were from Virginia also, but and we have you know a whole group of people living in Virginia who I think from what I understand were passing for white, so we don't know much about them, but my grandfather [Thomas Allen] was very, very light and I don't know much about his family or where they were from.
Speaker 1: And this is the side of the family that was in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you know are there any stories of legends in the family or any stories about any, perhaps any slaves that you know of or any other stories--
Speaker 2: Other stories, yeah, and I don't, you know my sister [Trudy Wilkerson Rose] shares to me 'cause she's more the historian, I mean, she has learned a lot of information from my aunt who died at the age of 104, but I would have to ask her, you know, but she's very good about the, the family, my, my grandfather's family and the land that they had and stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So, you talked about the side of the family that you, that, that passed being white.  Where did that story come from?  How did you get that story (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From my mother, from aunts.
Speaker 1: Okay, but tell me what your mother said?  Like what did she say they're down there passing for--
Speaker 2: Well she knew, right now she knew and she gave me the names of some of them.  They were re- I think my, I had an uncle, a great uncle who was, had something to do with Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  At that time I think it was institute and he and my grandfather, you know there, there was some land in Virginia and how they came about it, whether it was from you know slave owner--that I don't know, but one of them had something to do with the formation of Hampton Institute.
Speaker 1: Do you know your great, great uncle's name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had something--
Speaker 2: Well for me most of the time I just live in the present--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and my, my sister has lots of information and I should--
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just trying to see what you remember.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, but, so your, so your dates that your mother shared these stories with you about that.
Speaker 2: These stories about people who lived and I can't remember the towns in Virginia, but that they were, you know, they didn't want to have anything to do with the darker complexion members of the family, because they were recognized in their communities as white. So, it was them.
Story_ID: 534398
Speaker 1: Let's move a little forward with your--and let's talk about your paternal, your grandmother since you spent so much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, right. Yes.
Speaker 1: --time with her.  What was her name, where was she born?
Speaker 2: Eva Johnson and she I think had, you know, two marriages, three sons, and, but the three sons were from the marriage to Wilkerson, I think John Wilkerson [ph.].  She left Georgia with her sons.  I think it was an unhappy marriage, wasn't working out, and so she raised her children on her own.  How she arrived at Camden [New Jersey] I don't know because she didn't have any relatives in Camden.  Relatives came after her, but I think she was the first person who settled in Camden, New Jersey.  Very--I don't think she went, in terms of education, past the third of fourth grade, but was kind of a trailblazer in Camden.
Speaker 1: In what ways?
Speaker 2: Very active in the church, formed a club there that still exists.  She would on her own just raise money for various things in the community.  I mean always, there were always people in our, our house where she would entertain or have pie sales, et cetera.  There was an orphanage and a lot of black children, and during this time, you know, people had no way of getting, you know, the only place, the way they had their hair prepared it was straightened.  And she would just go and pay money to have the girls to, you know, go to a hairdresser, which is something you know, because it was run by a white organization.  They didn't know anything about that.  She always wanted me to go to college.  One of her sons [William Garfield Wilkerson] went to medical school in Geneva, Switzerland and she, even though we didn't have money, I mean I always knew that I was going to college.  No one knew how, but you know she didn't let my--her sons know that if she died before I graduated from high school the house was to be sold, so that I could go to college.  I mean, she was involved--she did a lot of--as much travelling as she could.
Speaker 1: Well, who do you think instilled that sort of attitude in her because she'd been born in the, at the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I have, it's, it's a mystery to me, but I know had she had more education she would have been like I always, like a mother, a Mary McLeod Bethune type person.  She never felt that anything was off limits for her.  I mean, she tried to stretch her wings far as--as far as she could with little education, the little training that she had, and I really don't know where she got that from, but she was quite a woman.
Story_ID: 534399
Speaker 1: Did she [Alston's paternal grandmother, Eva Johnson] ever talk about her own childhood?
Speaker 2: You know it was rural area, you know, working in the farms or you know cotton fields that kind of thing. It wasn't, I don't think it was an easy life.  She was from a family of maybe six or eight children.
Speaker 1: In Georgia?
Speaker 2: In Georgia and beyond that--she never took me south when she went.  It was quite interesting, and yet she wanted me to be exposed to everything.  Once she even told me when I was, I was a social worker at that point, and there was a group trip to Brazil and I didn't have the money and she got the money for me, had my uncle would send me the money. And I was thanking her, she said, "I want you to see the world if you possibly can."  But, she never took me to the South, but this was pre the Civil Rights Movement.  I don't think she wanted to expose me to the segregation and the kinds of things that she grew up with and was exposed to even when she would have to, when she went back to visit, of you know the whites only drinking fountain and--so, I think that was it.  I think she was just protective in that way.
Speaker 1: Because once the train got below D.C. [Washington, D.C.], she had to go to the back or seg- the segregated car, right.
Speaker 2: That's right, and here this is, this is a proud woman and to me, you know, there was nothing that she couldn't do, but yet there were some things that were beyond, you know, her capacity and she didn't have the power to change and I don't think she wanted me to see her and see the situation as it was in the South.
Story_ID: 534400
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about her [Alston's paternal grandmother, Eva Johnson] son, your father.  What was his name, his date of birth?
Speaker 2: Homer Hewlett [ph.] Wilkerson [Homer Wilkerson].  My father died in 1986.  He, he quit school I think, I think in junior high because he was the oldest and he knew that my mother [Louise Allen Davies] was having a hard time raising three sons alone and I think he just have seen, seen himself as the, you know, the male, the oldest male of the family and wanted to help her to make, make life a little easier.  So, he didn't have much of an education.  He had a tremendous personality.
Speaker 1: What's a tremendous personality?
Speaker 2: Well, he always was able to make people feel, people, when I would bring friends home make them feel comfortable, at ease, would always have a little joke or something to say.  You know, he was well liked.
Speaker 1: I would imagine you were closer to your father than your mother in some ways.
Speaker 2: I guess I was closer to my grandmother and then my mother.  You know often men who did not have the opportunity to learn what life is about, et cetera, and rushed into a marriage and other, those responsibilities long before they were ready for them.  I don't think he had the opportunity to be the kind of father that I would have liked, so I was often disappointed because he didn't take me to the circus, you know, as my girlfriend's father, but she was an only child, would, would take his, his daughter and things like that.  And you know, of course, after someone is no longer here you, you realize it, but you know I'm sorry that I didn't have the father that I would have liked to have had, even though he was always there you know it was not, it was not like he deserted us, but my grandmother was so overbearing.  Now I understand why, you know, he didn't wanna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He stayed away.
Speaker 2: Yes, he stayed away.
Story_ID: 534401
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about the mixed--I'm just gonna say mixed blood for lack of a better word, but was it Indian [Native American] or was it black and white?  How, how your origin (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: What's, what's the makeup of it?
Speaker 2: It was, it was Indian and my sister [Trudy Wilkerson Rose] would know exactly the group of Indians, where they're from, you know, Virginia but was Indian and also I think my grandfather [sic. maternal great-grandfather] had some Irish blood [sic.].  I mean I have, have an aunt--you, you know, as a black person you know what it's like sometimes growing up in, as, as we did with all the problems that we had to deal with and then problems we brought among ourselves.  I mean, where, you know, you didn't play with certain people, you know like an aunt of mine she had neighbors whose children were at the age of her children, my cousins, but she wouldn't have them play because she didn't feel that they had the same ideals and--
Speaker 1: Now were these--
Speaker 2: --dreams that she had for her children, but, so it was Indian and, and on my mother's [Louise Allen Davies] side, my grandfather, you know, Irish.
Speaker 1: Now, were your--did any of this revolve around appearances?  I mean, did your aunt not want them to play with them because they were darker skinned and she was a lighter skinned.
Speaker 2: That I don't know.  I, I felt it she didn't feel that they, the neighbors were raising their children in the way she, you know, wanted her children to be raised.
Story_ID: 534402
Speaker 1: Well, what are some of your earliest memories of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, that I was called Vonnie [HistoryMaker Peg Alston] by my, my, at home I was called Vonnie and because my father's [Homer Wilkerson] family named me Yvonne.  My mother's [Louise Allen Davies] family called me Peg because they named me Margaret after my mother's sister [Margaret Allen Bell], so you know I'd be--I'd be Vonnie and then when I'd go to visit my aunt I was Peg.  It was an interesting--I had, I had, it was a kind of an interesting life, you know, here I had an uncle [William Garfield Wilkerson] who was in med [medical] school in Switzerland and at the same time, you know, I had my, my father you know was just a blue collar worker.  There was no money yet my mother, my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] wanted me to be like a Marian Anderson because I sang in churches and teas and things like that.  And I guess it was more trying to please her and you know you didn't dare do anything that she didn't want you to do, but--
Speaker 1: What did she--
Speaker 2: --and then also going to visit my mother who lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], so it was you know kind of different from the way lot of families were, but you know we all--we managed somehow.
Story_ID: 534403
Speaker 1: So you were living in Camden [New Jersey] with your [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What--tell me do you remember the street you lived on?
Speaker 2: Division Street, 732 Division Street.  I mean that's like always, I think of those, those days and think of that, that address.  As a matter of fact when I see 7:32 on the clock, I stop and think about my grandmother and imagine and talk with them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the house like?
Speaker 2: It was a two, two story house, had a yard.  My grandmother had a grape, grape arbor.  She--this was in kind of a city, it wasn't rural, but she had great pride in this house because I guess she purchased it on her own single-handedly and she, she loved it.  She entertained a lot.  As a matter of fact, sometimes I think, I wonder if I don't entertain that much because I had the work to do, but all of my dreams, et cetera, in a sense I felt that my grandmother was living vicariously through me, the things that she wasn't able to do as a young girl she had me to do, I mean so every possible organization I was part of, you know.  She was active in the Y because she, the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  And there was a time when the YWCA was segregated.  There was a black Y and a white Y.  As soon as they became integrated she you know was very much involved with that.  I was active in the church [Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church, Camden, New Jersey] I mean, you, there was no way that you could live with my grandmother and not go to church on Sundays, so every Sunday was church and because I was her granddaughter, you know, I mean I had to be active in the church and you know the Sunday school secretary and there were recitations for Christmas and Easter.  You know she would always get the largest, the recitation for me, you know she was amazing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember any of 'em?  Can you recite one?
Speaker 2: No, but I can, I can recite some, a little of things that I would read and then recite at teas, in school, you know, not, not at school, but teas and church affairs.
Speaker 1: What was some of it, just recite something that you had to--
Speaker 2: 'The House by the Side of the Road' [Sam Walter Foss].  "If you could--when all about you or (unclear). If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you" ['If,' Rudyard Kipling] and something, but, let me see.  Now, because you have me on the spot, I was just--I think it's a, I think it's a poem by Rudyard Kipling, but it's about being a friend to man.  Anyway, maybe we can come back to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 534404
Speaker 1: Can you describe for me--you talked about the house on Division Street [Camden, New Jersey], can you describe the block?  Who were the neighbors on both sides of you, who was across the street, was there a milkman, was there a doctor in the neighborhood, what was the neighborhood comprised of?
Speaker 2: Right, Division Street where we, we lived we faced another street that was perpendicular to Division Street, which was Princeton Avenue and Division Street was a rather long street, I mean, I guess maybe about three or four blocks and it was, you know, just a mixture of blacks mostly lower middle class and even lower class.  I remember that there were some houses that probably didn't have heating system because the store across the street from us had kerosene and I could see people coming with cans to get kerosene for the oil stove.  There was a doctor who lived, Dr. Primus [Howard Primus] who lived on Princeton Avenue, and he was, he was the family doctor.  There was a--some school teachers that lived nearby and then you would have people who, you know, worked in the factory and lived, but there was, you know, it was a street as most streets were in Camden [New Jersey] of, of blacks who had pride no matter what it was they were doing, pride in themselves and proud of their jobs, too and I guess church, church life was very important.  There were about three or four different churches.  Can't remember many people went to a Catholic church, but Episcopal, Presbyterian.  We were Baptist.  It was the oldest Baptist church in, in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that church?
Speaker 2: Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church [Camden, New Jersey], and Kaighn Avenue was a very large street.
Speaker 1: Now was Kaighn Avenue and Washington Avenue of the black community, was that where all the bus- black businesses were in Camden?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you would--you had the funeral parlors there on Kaighn Avenue.  Kaighn--that was the only church on Kaighn Avenue, but as you travelled, you know, three or four blocks then you would move into white neighborhoods and white businesses on Kaighn.  Kaighn Avenue, I guess, was, that was not known as the street of blacks, but it was one of the main streets in, in Camden.
Story_ID: 534405
Speaker 1: "--Keep your head when all about you / Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, / If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you" ['If,' Rudyard Kipling] and something, something doubting too.  I think that's about (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, but, but, but as a kid you--what did that mean to you when you recited that?
Speaker 1: Well, I did look for things that had meaning for me that I felt had, you know, a message.
Speaker 2: And what message would that have for you as that kid living in Camden [New Jersey] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a kid, isn't that interesting?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you can be yourself, accept other people for who they are, (background noise) not be judgmental and I guess you know I always try--I saw beauty in, in everybody on some level.  There was some form of, of beauty and I used to sort of, whether they had like a nice personality or they had a great smile, you know, I'm not saying that there are people that maybe, you know, I didn't care for too much, but I still felt that there was something, a strength that they had.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: That they may not have even been aware of.
Speaker 2: Do you feel that you were a kid who grew up during some strife, I mean, did you feel that you, as a kid did you feel that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh absolutely, absolutely yes.  I think I was sort of robbed of my childhood at a very, very early age.  I sometimes look at young children who are carefree and--as they should be--and you know they don't realize how fortunate they are, but I, I grew up in a family that was full of conflict and it was very unpleasant and I--my mother [Louise Allen Davies] always seemed to be very unhappy I remembered once when I was about six or seven asking God to--if anything bad was gonna happen to my mother let it happen to me 'cause I felt that I'd be able to deal with it better.  So that's, that's quite a bit to handle after my parents separated a couple of times and came back together I, as a result, you know, I mean the, just the shame, you know, the children asking where, where are you 'cause I would then have to stay with my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] and go to another school.
Story_ID: 534406
Speaker 1: And I overheard her [Alston's mother, Louise Allen Davies] once telling her friend that she was going to leave my father [Homer Wilkerson] and so I was thinking oh my goodness I have to go through this again, you know.  So, at that I guess maybe I was eight and I asked my mother if she was going to leave daddy, to leave him for good and not come, not go back, I mean just because it was painful. And I had, I was playing violin in elementary school.  This is a school where [HistoryMaker] Bruce Gordon's, he's the, now the national director of NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]. His father (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was the name of this school?
Speaker 1: It was Sumner's School, Charles E. Sumner's School [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey].  I don't know who Sumner is, but apparently you know it had something to do with the black community.  He may not have been black, I don't know, but Mr. Gordon [Walter Gordon], Bruce's father, was my first principal in elementary school.  And I was taking violin lessons and I remember I selected the violin because once I heard my father say that he liked the violin.  I mean, even with the discord I remember hearing the first classical piece, which may have been Tchaikovsky's [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] 'Piano Concerto No. 1' at, at home and--but we didn't have a piano and I heard him once saying that he liked violin music, so I took violin lessons in elementary school.  And when I heard that my mother was leaving my father, when I, and I made this, you know told her, asked her not to, you know, if she was going to leave this time, not come back I didn't want to be saddled with the vi- because I knew Mr. Gordon, et cetera, a violin and they know, you know, a missing violin, so I turned my violin in and the, the teacher he was, he was asking me why, you know, and so forth and of all times Mr. Gordon was coming in.  We had lessons in the auditorium, and he was coming in and the teacher said and they called me Von then, "Yvonne [HistoryMaker Peg Alston] is, is turning in her violin."  He asked me why.  I was so embarrassed 'cause I was very shy, and I just said, "Well you know we'll be moving."  But my mother when I came home she, she said, "Where's your violin?"  And I said, "Well I turned it in," you know.  I said, "Well you said you were going to leave," you know, but anyway.
Story_ID: 534407
Speaker 1: So, for someone, you know--my mother [Louise Allen Davies] made Christmas, Christmas was so wonderful, so absolutely wonderful.  I had--my brother [Homer Wilkerson] was the youngest and when we moved to my [paternal] grandmother's [Eva Johnson], Christmas was nice, but not the way, we didn't have stockings hanging out, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did your mother make it, tell me your mother made it so nice?
Speaker 1: We had, I felt we had the prettiest tree in that whole neighborhood, and I saw a lot of my friend's trees and in addition to the, you know, the silver icicles, you know those little silver--she also had angel hair, which is very dangerous.  They don't use that now, that's really cut glass, but it was just covered with angel hair and all blue lights sometimes and you know she was, anyway it was, it was--Christmas at our home was very special.  So when we moved to my grandmother's, Christmas was nice, but of course it wasn't the same and in the afternoon I put up, when my brother who was two years younger than me took his nap, I put up stockings and I told him I said, "Oh Santa," you know.  He said, "Oh Vonnie [HistoryMaker Peg Alston], you know San- that wasn't Santa Claus," you know.  So--but I wanted to make it the way my mother had it for us, and we learned that you know there was not a Santa Claus at my grandmother's versus we always believed, we believed in Santa Claus, you know, at home.
Speaker 2: So, when you believed in Santa Claus did you think he was a black man or a white man?
Speaker 1: Oh no, you always thought, you know I mean white man. You know what I mean? You always thought white, you know.  Like Jesus Christ was white and--but we did have black, we did have black dolls from time to time, but we also had white dolls.
Speaker 2: Was it different for you getting a black doll versus a white doll?  Did you care one way or the other?
Speaker 1: No, unh-uh.  No I didn't, it didn't matter to me, but I guess, I probably had more white dolls than black dolls, but you know you, you grow up certain things were as they were and, but now you know, like when I see mothers with their, you know, black children and have a white doll I wanna run up and say, "Get a black doll please," you know.

Speaker 1: I want to go back to Charles E. Sumner High--to elementary school [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey].  How do you spell that Sumner, S--
Speaker 2: Sumner--
Speaker 1: Sumner.
Speaker 2: --S-U-M-N-E-R.
Speaker 1: Sumner.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Right, and that is who--you talked about the one, the principal [Walter Gordon], but who were the other teachers at the time that you looked up to?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Manigault who is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then I just want you to spell the names for me and tell me a little something about them.
Speaker 2: Wow. Right, right.
Speaker 1: If you can remember how to spell those names.
Speaker 2: Manigault, M-A-N-I-G-A-U-L-T.  She was my second grade teacher, and she had also been my mother's [Louise Allen Davies] teacher, and my mother was seemed like was the, the pet of the school, so that actually Mrs. Manigault kept contact with a few of the students from her class, myself and three other girls and we once had tea at her house when I was living at my [paternal] grandmother's [Eva Johnson] at that time.  But it was at Ms. Manigault's where I learned that my mother had married the second time and she didn't prepare me.  She didn't tell me, so that was very upsetting, you know, but Mrs. Manigault.
Speaker 1: What did Mrs. Manigault teach you?
Speaker 2: Well there it's general, you know, I mean, you're in a class (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, I, I, yeah I mean she taught you general lessons, but I mean even outside of that.  She is the first name that came to, to your head--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --so what is you take away from her that's in your life today?
Speaker 2: Oh I see.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now that's interesting 'cause I never thought that I took anything from many of these teachers, but--
Speaker 1: Or it could be nothing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I'm just wondering if she taught you--
Speaker 2: Yes, I don't, nothing really comes to mind except--
Speaker 1: Right, because these were--
Speaker 2: --when you, you, then, then you know teachers were, you know they were such a great profession and they took tremendous pride in, in teaching and you know they really felt responsible for the children in the class and they knew the patterns that kind of thing and made a point of, of having relationship with the parents.  Then, there was Ms. Hazelwood [ph.].  She was my third grade teacher.
Speaker 1: And what was she like?
Speaker 2: I just liked the way she--but all of these were, were teachers you just loved them, you know. Just the way she moved about.  She seemed almost like a movie star type person.  You know I just liked the way she dressed and handled herself.  She was very active or her husband was very active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Story_ID: 534409
Speaker 1: Did you know the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] as a child?
Speaker 2: I did, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did you know about it?
Speaker 2: --my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] was active.  I don't know if they had meetings, but they had also I guess org- they had programs that involved children, and it was like an intrastate, they had like intrastate projects where students would recite things and you were judged, I mean you were representing your city or your town and at one time I represented Camden [New Jersey] and you know making a speech.
Speaker 1: And you made a speech on what?  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: I, I don't because the speech was written by the head of the, the local chapter and that was really difficult because it's difficult to memorize something that's, you know--so I didn't think I did very well at that, but I do re- there was a teacher's organization that asked me to speak once.  I don't know why they singled.  They always seemed to single me out, but I had to speak to a large group of young people from all over the state, you know.  There must have been about seemed three or four hundred girls my age and I made a speech of the sky is the limit.  That was the, that was my theme, the sky is the limit.  And, even they gave me a small scholarship, too when I graduated, you know, you know maybe five hundred dollars or something when I graduated from high school [Camden High School, Camden, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: The NAACP?
Speaker 2: But--no this was a black teachers' organization.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that organization, was it black teachers association?
Speaker 2: I can't remember, but it was an organization of school teachers.
Story_ID: 534410
Speaker 1: Did any of your elementary school teachers [at Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey] influence you in any way, I mean because you became a social worker, which is pretty close to teaching--
Speaker 2: Right, well--
Speaker 1: --in some ways.
Speaker 2: But for me it was a process of elimination and being very realistic when I was going to college [New York University, New York, New York] about jobs and how you know the easiest area to get a job.  It's not that I was necessarily in love with social work, but I ruled out, you know medicine.  I wasn't, I wasn't interested in becoming a nurse.  Medicine, I didn't think I had the science background.  Teaching, I wasn't interested in teaching, so social work is based on just elimination, I mean.  When you think of business there, there were no, no one could think about--well I guess there were some accounts.  I wasn't interested in, you know I wasn't into accountant, into math to that degree, even though I was very good in math, but that was, it was it, you know, thinking what's, how can I, you know, what area can I best get a job?  Now, you know, like buyers of department stores: there were none.  There were no buyers, you know, way back in the early '60s [1960s], so and for instance art, I mean nobody took art history.  I didn't even know that there was a field called art history, but had I taken that, I don't know where I would have been able to get a job, so it was more being very realistic.
Story_ID: 534411
Speaker 1: Before we move on to, to junior high and high school [Camden High School, Camden, New Jersey], when you were still in elementary school [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey] who did you look up to?  Who do you think at that time in your life had the most (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In elementary.
Speaker 1: --influence on you?
Speaker 2: I guess my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson], some of the friends of my uncle, girlfriends of my uncle who, who would come and visit.
Speaker 1: What did these women--? What did you learn from these women?
Speaker 2: They were, some were, were school teachers, you know, people that I could just sit and talk to.  They were older than me, but I felt comfortable with them because number one they were trying to please my uncle, so you know, they took time.  They were nice to me.
Speaker 1: Well what sights--
Speaker 2: Who else? Then we had someone who, whose husband had one of fu- was one of the funeral directors in Camden [New Jersey] who was outstanding and she used to sing.  I mean for a while she was I think a professional singer and she formed a junior choir, and her name is Gretchen Waples [Gretchen Branche Waples] it was of the Waples Funeral Home [Camden, New Jersey] and she formed the junior choir and I often sang solos and she was one who thought that I should pursue, you know,  develop my voice and my grandmother would have loved that, so I had voice, she gave me voice lessons for a while until I was in high school and I was also a cheerleader and at one point she said I had to make a choice between cheerleading and singing.  So, of course, I took cheerleading (laughter), but she was you know she, she was one that I silently admired.  I don't think I ever, you know, talked with her beyond music things, but I admired her.  And as I said, a couple of members of the church [Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church, Camden, New Jersey] who were teachers, school teachers.
Story_ID: 534412
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds, and, or smells remind you of growing up in Camden [New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Well, always the, the, the odors coming from my [paternal] grandmother's [Eva Johnson] kitchen, you know, she--and the church [Kaighn Avenue Baptist Church, Camden, New Jersey].  I was very active in, in the, in the church, so just the music and we had great choirs, so the music from our church.  I was--I think I, you know, for churches it's the music that more moves me than anything else I mean like I would, I would choose the church that had the best choir and still do, I still love music and just the laughter coming from my, brought on by my uncle.  I had my--one of--my mother [Louise Allen Davies] had--my grandmother had three sons.  One was a policeman and he had such a tremendous sense of humor.  He was so popular in Camden; everybody knew him.  And when he was home, you know, it was always a joy because he had lots of stories to tell and you know much, much laughter.  So, there were some, some very wonderful moments in my grandmother's house.  You know she would have many meetings, many teas, and you know she belonged to so many organizations, so she would have teas and then the meetings of the, I'm trying to think of the name of her, her church group [Club Utopia].  It'll come to me, can't think of it right now, but most meetings were there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, what, what year did you complete--
Speaker 2: And they would have meals, she would have meals.
Story_ID: 534413
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: Did you complete Charles E. Sumner High--Elementary School [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey]?
Speaker 1: Well, when my, when my mother [Louise Allen Davies] and father [Homer Wilkerson] separated then we moved to another area 'cause I lived with my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson], so then I went to another school.  So, I was probably, I think I was in the third grade when we left Sumner--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Charles Sumner School (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, let's talk about your high school.  What high school did you attend?
Speaker 1: High school, Camden High [Camden High School, Camden, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: Camden High?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And just right off the start what year did you graduate Camden High?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay, and what type of student were you in high school?
Speaker 1: Well, I was, I think I was a fair to good students, student, I mean I always tried to get good grades.  I was, you know became I guess for two or three years a member of the National Honor Society, but I'm not certain that the edu- like for instance some teachers were better than others, you know, like Spanish teacher I think was a horror, but she, you know, she was very--how she had a job, so anyway (gesture).  I didn't learn much Spanish from the Spanish class.  But, it was as a school where I think the guidance counselor tried to direct black students to business or industrial, not college prep, and but you know my grandmother would hear none, you know, there were a group of us and we knew that we were going to college and of course no one like that could tell us what to do.  We knew what we wanted and that was it.
Speaker 2: Now was Camden a mixed school or was it predominantly black (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Camden, yeah, a mixed school, so I, I would say maybe not quite 50/50, you know, probably close to two-thirds white and a third black.
Story_ID: 534414
Speaker 1: When were you aware of the fact that you were black in the racist's sense?
Speaker 2: Oh in a racist's sense?
Speaker 1: Like oh you're black?  Or did it never occur to you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't know if it's anything that, that, should I have to, really that I have to think about, because in Sumner [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey] we were all black, but then you know the, the merchants in the neighborhood were like so, you knew that there was a difference and people didn't socialize and the school--when I lived with my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] that school was mixed.  Most of the teachers, however, were white, so but if it may, you know I can't think about if it had any effect on me because I guess my, my grandmother's plans and her designs for us was so strong that's really, that was the rule and what we went by.
Story_ID: 534415
Speaker 1: So at Camden High School [Camden, New Jersey] you became a cheerleader, you sang, what other extracurricular activities were you involved in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I didn't sing in the choir at that school.  I played in the orchestra.
Speaker 1: What did you play violin?
Speaker 2: Violin, I took violin.
Speaker 1: So you did continue to play the violin?
Speaker 2: I did yeah and I, yeah I wasn't, I don't think we had it when I went to the elementary school [Charles Sumner Elementary School, Camden, New Jersey].  I don't think they had musical instruments there, but I did take it up again in junior high school and high school. Can't think of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what were your dreams and aspirations at the time you were, at the time you reached high school?  Had you started the process of elimination then or did you ever dream to be something greater at the time, like did you want to be like Marian Anderson?
Speaker 2: No, I mean that 'cause you know when I decide, when I knew that because I didn't take it seriously even though my brother [Homer Wilkerson] who, who died last year used to always tell me what a beautiful, and he loved, he sang in California just on his own at various bars and stuff, so he sang and he was in the junior choir also, but he used to always tell me that I had a beautiful voice and you know, but I took it for granted and I didn't think much about it, so I was never--I always wanted to maybe when I came to New York [New York] and went to college [New York University, New York, New York] at some point get involved in chorus, which I never did, but he thought that I had a good voice.
Story_ID: 534416
Speaker 1: In 1956 you graduate Camden High School [Camden, New Jersey].  Talk to me about the process of getting into New York University [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To university.
Speaker 1: Like how did that come about, yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] always wanted me to go to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] 'cause she was from Georgia and so I mean you know Spelman was tops with her and, but I guess as a result of living in Camden [New Jersey] and being you know in a mixed community, being involved with the, the Y [Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA)] and I did things there that represented the Y even in, in groups of, of white girls 'cause there was something, another kind of conference of girls from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, and I represented the Y, and then I got the honor to be one of, of five chosen to be on the planning committee the following year of, of groups, so I was living in the world in terms of my head, you know, it was, it was like my grandmother, you know, not limiting myself to just a black world, but just the world at large.  And, but when I spoke about my, when I speak about the Y and that, that group where I mentioned, where I represented Camden, the head, I happen to have been involved in a pro- went to a program there, it was in high school, and the person who was in this department and had this whatever group it was of you know she was the leader, she sent me to her office to get something for her and here on her desk was a carbon copy of a letter that she had written to the organization of the YWCA saying, she was white, why I shouldn't be a part, that I was not, I was not active with the Y.  I mean, here you would think that it would be their honor, 'cause Camden was represented, but it would, it was better for her that no one from Camden be represented if it was going to be a black girl.  It was--I, I was stunned, stunned, you know, 'cause I hadn't really faced or come to grips with racism on that level where someone is smiling at you and seems to be very sweet to you and at the same time not liking you because you're black and she's an adult.
Speaker 1: Well maybe this is that moment.
Speaker 2: That may have been, you know, and I confronted her that, that letter and she, she--
Speaker 1: What? Tell me the story you say, what did you say?
Speaker 2: You know I said you know you sent me and I said, "I saw a letter on your desk where you wrote to you know the, the organization and told them that I shouldn't be a part, I shouldn't be on the planning committee," and she, I guess I was like sixteen and apologies, et cetera, she didn't mean to say this and you know she was going to write them and tell--whether she did it or not I don't believe she did, but she did a lot to save face, but it didn't matter to me because at that point it didn't make a difference because I was aware of the kind of person that she was, which was very shocking to me.  But, I guess that was, yep when I think about it.
Story_ID: 534417
Speaker 1: Another time, well again that was before I graduated [from Camden High School, Camden, New Jersey].  Graduation, the prom it was, I planned where we as a group, there may have been about twelve of us were going after, after the prom for dinner and to celebrate.  It was a place called the Hawaiian [Hawaiian Cottage, Cherry Hill, New Jersey]--I can't remember now, I guess I've really blocked it now, and this was like you know you're passing out of Camden [New Jersey] and you see this and it was the front of it was the shape of a pineapple and it looked great and I guess black people I never knew of a black person going there, but this was certainly a place to go. Your prom, you know, you want something that's really fantastic.  I called and I never made reservations any place before, but I figured here twelve people, at least twelve people I made reservations, we went after the prom, and then they told me they didn't have my name and I'm one, you know, I said, "Well let me see the book," and then my friends said, "Come on Vonnie [HistoryMaker Peg Alston]," you know as they all told me, "Let's not, let's you know, we'll go somewhere else."  I was crying I was so upset, very upset, but and you know after that, years after it was integrated, but I didn't know, but you know I had never set and would never want to.  I don't think it exists now, but anyway.
Story_ID: 534418
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the story with the prom and how that upset you, but you graduated [from Camden High School, Camden, New Jersey].  What--how did you get to New York University [New York, New York], how did you even know New York City [New York, New York] existed (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Existed, well I had--my mother's [Louise Allen Davies] sister, who I'm named after, Margaret [Margaret Allen Bell] lived in St. Albans [Queens, New York], so we would often come and visit her.  Her--
Speaker 1: Just for the record I'm going to say St. Albans is in Queens [New York].
Speaker 2: Is in Queens, okay.  And she was like the one in the family who lived extremely well.  You know her husband was head of a real estate company in Harlem [New York, New York] and it was called Bell and Hudgins [B&H Realty Corporation, New York, New York] and he was Robert Bell and anyway you got to see--we got to see another aspect of, of life.  So, that, you know we always knew we had a relative in New York.  Then, my uncle [William Garfield Wilkerson] who eventually went to University of Geneva [Geneva Switzerland] to study went to NYU [New York University] undergrad.  Well, he went to grad I guess because he started out at Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  Then, he was in the [U.S.] Air Force during the Second World War [World War II, WWII] one of the Tuskegee Airmen and he had an accident when he was in the plane during the Second War World and got, received the Purple Heart, et cetera, but he went to NYU and then how he got to Switzerland for med [medical] school I don't know and when I think about it, when his, when all of his books were returned to Camden [New Jersey] everything in French I couldn't believe how he did it is beyond me.  How he learned.  You know, but anyway, he was a gynecologist.  He settled in Jersey City, New Jersey, and again like he was like my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson], I mean he was into everything.  He was once involved in, in politics.  He was head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] of that area, you know, so, so much he accomplished, but anyway he went to NYU.  And there may have been some other schools that I wanted to attend, might have wanted to attend like possibly Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you know he heard about Howard, but I knew that my family didn't have much money and getting back and forth coming home for holidays might even have been difficult, you know, I just figured it out myself.  So, I, my uncle lived near New York, so I knew that, you know, I could probably travel with him during holidays, which is how it worked out.  But, anyway it was because of my uncle and I really looked up to him.
Story_ID: 534419
Speaker 1: What was your experience like at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], I mean, that's still the '50s [1950s], I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my good- well--
Speaker 1: --Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], it only happened two years prior to you being accepted.
Speaker 2: Right, but you know in, in the--on the university level I just wasn't aware of it too much.  I mean, most of the classes were white students, but again you know I had this with my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] nothing stopped her and I never thought that you know I or--I never thought of limiting myself because of, of my color.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this then, were you, because at the college level now you have an opportunity to participate in, in sororities, did you pledge or you--?
Speaker 2: I, well there was no, there wasn't you know the black sororities and fraternities on campus, but there was in New York [New York], and I found there was the, there were sororities.  There was the, the Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] and the, I can't think of the other one for the Alphas [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].
Speaker 1: AKA's, yeah.
Speaker 2: AKA, right, and so I did pledge, but I didn't complete it because when again I think about the amount of money I just dropped out.  Yeah, but my, my fath- my [paternal] uncle [William Garfield Wilkerson] was, was a Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and so I would have wanted to pledge Delta anyway because he was a Que.  So, but the--for--it took me a while to get used to New York City [New York, New York], to living in the, in the city proper because I was coming up from Camden [New Jersey], a small city, everybody knows each other, it's always like you know from a, from a fish pond to an ocean and so it took me awhile to get used to it.  I would cry wanting to come home and you would have adults, I mean people who were much older than you taking classes as well as students your age.
Story_ID: 534420
Speaker 1: Where did you live in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: I lived in the dormitory [at New York University, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And, and that was in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] still.
Speaker 2: That was wonderful.  That was Washington Square [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: But this was the hotbed of the beatniks and jazz and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right, that's right, that's right and poetry readings--
Speaker 1: So, what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: --and coffee shops.  It was an extremely rich experience.  As a matter of fact, my first boyfriend who I met at NYU [New York University] was a poet, he wrote poetry and his friends were poets, so some of them would give readings at the coffee shops.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any names of any of those places, coffee shops like and was your boyfriend black?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Were these black poets?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm. Black poets like his, Lebert Bethune, known as Sandy Bethune, but he had some books out and recently Donnell Library [Donnell Library Center, New York, New York] purchased his interview, his tapes, interviews with Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and he went to Paris [France].  Our plan, his plan was for us to go to Paris after we graduated, but I broke, because I couldn't think, I mean I was, think of you know like a poet, how am we gonna, how are we gonna make a living?  You know, living in the cold water flat and stuff, but it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: But it had to be exciting at the time. James Baldwin--
Speaker 2: It was absolutely--
Speaker 1: --had gone to Paris.  He was living there.
Speaker 2: That's right, he mentioned--
Speaker 1: I mean it was--
Speaker 2: --he met, he met Baldwin, Chester Himes was a good friend of his, you know, very, very rich and he had his, his dreams were greater than mine.  I mean, I couldn't imagine living in, in Europe at that time, but we, we broke up be, before that. I married somebody who was a psychologist, getting his doctorate while I was in undergrad school.
Speaker 1: And you, you got married in 1963?
Speaker 2: (Waves) Yeah.
Story_ID: 534421
Speaker 1: At the time New York City [New York, New York] was it, was it a good place to be for African Americans (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a wonderful place.  It was a wonderful, rich place.
Speaker 1: Did you ever make it up to Harlem [New York, New York] during the time, 125th Street or did you stay in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: To a hundred, yeah after I, not in my, well yes, we would come up to go to dances, you know like we'd go to the--
Speaker 1: Lenox Lounge [New York, New York]--was it popular then?
Speaker 2: --and the--well, we went to like a lot of the, the Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] affairs and the, what is it--the AK, not AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  What is the other?
Speaker 1: Alpha (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alpha.
Speaker 1: Alpha sets.
Speaker 2: Alphas, yeah my friends who went to NYU [New York University, New York, New York]--blacks--were the Alphas.  Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] was a student at NYU when I was there.  I didn't, didn't know him. He--there was a whole group of students who where the blacks congregated, you know, and then there were others who, a few who would be with the white students.  Well, he was always in the film making, et cetera, and so he was with his friends and, and they were you know.
Speaker 1: The white students.
Speaker 2: The white students, right, but you know I congregated with the, with the black students.
Speaker 1: So, I mean this is a silly question, but, I'm, I'm, I just wanna know.  So at the time like how were you wearing your hair?  Was it, were you, were you a natural--
Speaker 2: Straighten.
Speaker 1: --or were you straightened?
Speaker 2: Getting it straightened, you know and by--
Speaker 1: You were getting it straightened?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So were you perceived at the time as like a--
Speaker 2: And I would have to go, I would go to Harlem to, to the hairdressers.
Speaker 1: Now at that time was it popular to have straight hair because the natural--?
Speaker 2: It was popular, oh yeah it was--this was before the natural--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you know because we're talking 1956, from '56 [1956] to '60 [1960] I was at NYU, so that was still the era of straightened hair.  It wasn't until you know like maybe moving into the early '60s [1960s] that there were afros, so I was an afro, you know I had a big afro at that time, but prior to that yeah.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And also during the '60s [1960s], with your first boyfriend who's a poet and you're at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] were your aspirations at that time to do something artistic or you were thinking you're still going to be a social worker?
Speaker 2: Still a social worker and I worked part-time at the foreign student center that you know my [paternal] uncle [William Garfield Wilkerson] knew the person who headed the foreign student center and so you know I had the job even though he paid for my tuition, my, my uncle, the one who was the doctor paid for my tuition and also the dormitory.  But, I had to, you know, find other ways to, you know like the other money for books and stuff like that I worked part-time and then I babysat for a woman.  There was this ad on the bulletin board in the dormitory, a student's cousin who needed a babysitter and it turned out that this, this woman she was independently wealthy, but lived very simply.  She had all this, I see it vividly now, Swedish, modern Swedish furniture and all these original paintings and I mean all of the major, I mean I hadn't gone to maybe, at that, up to that point maybe a museum twice in my life, if that, you know.  I mean at that point I couldn't even name, well I named one, I could name one black painter and that was Hale Woodruff.  He work--he was a professor at NYU.  That was the only reason I could name a black painter.  But, from that experience where she had de Kooning [Willem de Kooning], Leger [Fernand Leger], Mondrian [Piet Mondrian], Albers [Josef Albers], all of these major art, Jackson Pollock, originals.  That, from that experience, I remember saying to myself when I got out of, when I got my own apartment 'cause I was going to stay in New York [New York].  You--after being in New York you don't return to a small town.  I was going to have art too and I saw the beauty of originals.  I wanted originals and I wanted--I remember saying so vividly to myself I wanted works by black artists.  It didn't matter to me that they might be unknown artists, but I wanted originals, and I wanted black works by black artists because I felt that it had, would have more to do with me.  And my first painting I purchased the same year I graduated from, from college, from NYU (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: And what was that painting?  Was it a black artist?
Speaker 2: It was by a black artist.  I, I, I met him--you know at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] there was not a Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York] at that time, but Carnegie Hall and my, my boyfriend who then became my husband, was very interested in music and, and more modern music than even the, the traditional classical pieces, but we would always go to concerts, and on Thursday nights if you waited in line you could go to a concert for a dollar, and I met one evening waiting in line this artist.  And as a result of seeing abstract, you know, it looked so easy to me so I had this dream I said, "Gee if I could get into a studio and paint, you know, I could maybe put something up by myself that I did."  And I, I met him and we became friends.  He sold a painting to me for sixty dollars and I paid him you know like I think ten dollars a month, something like that.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was a lot of money, sixty dollars for a painting, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, sixty dollars, but, and he was an abstract painter and you now all of this art that I saw for, because I had babysat and took care of, you know, of her--
Speaker 1: Was Jackson--
Speaker 2: --young child for three--
Speaker 1: Jackson Pollock at the time was he also doing abstract art?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was he doing the dripping--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and stuff at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and she had maybe you know a painting of about size behind you, that was a Jack- as a matter of fact Jackson Pollock was one, and I didn't even know who, but that was one of my favorite two paintings, Fernand Leger and Jackson Pollock were my favorite paintings.  And I would carry this baby around looking at the paintings and you know hold her and still looking at the--so I mean the paintings really, art spoke to me.
Story_ID: 534423
Speaker 1: She and I never talked about art, and it turned out that she was dating her, her lover was Sidney Janis who was one of the top art dealers in the city [New York, New York] and who handled Sidney Janis.  It's interesting--Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark]--how things--there's like you know there's like a certain, there's all these connections.  After I met Ed Clark 'cause Ed later on asked to have a show at my apartment.  That's where I showed art in about 1977, '78 [1978], but in talking he worked for Sidney Janis and Chris, Chris Shelton, two artists who I handle now were working for this dealer.  It's, it's quite interesting.  But, she didn't have, I don't think she had the passion for art that I had.  I don't know.  I still know her as a matter of fact, she married my husband [Lester Alston] and I.  She's in her eighties now, but--
Speaker 2: The woman--
Speaker 1: The woman that I babysat for.
Speaker 2: --babysat for, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, 'cause we stayed in contact.  But, I think, you know, Sidney Janis must have said this is a painting you should consider getting, and she would buy it and you know I'm sure she paid no more than maybe fifteen hundred dollars for that Jackson Pollock 'cause she still--if she had it today she could get at least six million [dollars], at least for it, but I don't think she has it today.
Story_ID: 534424
Speaker 1: But anyway, that was my introduction to art and not knowing that eventually I was going to end up being where I am, you know, you know how horoscope people will tell you what your sign is about.  And every time I would read something they would say oh you know you'll be good in business and I would say to myself well they have that wrong, you know.  There was no, I mean, there was no business, you know. I'm a social worker, et cetera, but moving ahead when I sort of got tired of social work 'cause there was so much that you couldn't change.  You saw just so much around you in terms of working with families or children in foster care.  I didn't feel that we had much impact.  I said, "Gee it would be nice to work at something that I loved."  And once I said that, I knew what it would be.
Speaker 2: And how did you know it would be art?
Speaker 1: Well, after my first painting that I purchased I continued a little bit buying whatever I could and this same artist, Earl Miller, was a member of the organization called--what is it called? it's an organization that Bearden [Romare Bearden] belonged to, Hale Woodruff, it will come to me.
Speaker 2: Was it the 10th Street--
Speaker 1: No, it begins with an S [Spiral].  Can't think of it right now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I, you know, anyway went to an exhibit that he was in, that all of these artists were in and first saw Bearden's things.  Never heard of him and he was an unknown artist at that point, and my husband [Lester Alston] pointed him out and Bearden's collages at that point were selling for $250. It was amazing.  But anyway, so through this first artist I became familiar with a lot of art.  My husband at the time was not as, you know, into art as I was, so I wasn't able to buy much, but I bought what I could.
Story_ID: 534425
Speaker 1: You graduated NYU [New York University, New York, New York] in 1960?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you started working as a social worker--
Speaker 2: As a social worker.
Speaker 1: --for the State of New York?
Speaker 2: For the--it was a private organization that, but still connected with the, yeah the City of New York [New York] in terms of it was a--worked--child care agency.  It was a foster care agency and they sent you, if you wanted to go to grad school, they would send you to grad school.
Speaker 1: And you decided to go to grad school, at?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they, they made it possible.  They paid for the tuition.  So, I went to grad school, went to Columbia School of Social Work [Columbia University's School of Social Work; Columbia School of Social Work, New York, New York], which at that time was called the New York School of Social Work, and the classes were held in Carnegie's [Andrew Carnegie] old mansion 91st Street and Fifth Avenue.  And that's where--even when it changed to Columbia School of Social Work, that's where the classes were.  It was quite interesting.
Speaker 1: And then you graduated with your master's [degree] in what year from Columbia?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-four [1964], yeah.
Speaker 1: So how long did you work as a social worker before you decided you weren't gonna make the type of difference you wanted to make and that you should pursue something you loved?
Speaker 2: The early part of the '70s [1970s], about 1971 I had a show of African sculpture in my apartment to--because I was just aware, none of my friends, none of my colleagues seem to be interested in, in art and I yet I thought it was something very important, and so I had a show just to hopefully have more people embrace the art or get to know more about at that time it was African sculpture.
Story_ID: 534426
Speaker 1: Did you know of Mert Simpson [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson] at the time and was he a dealer, because I know, was he dealing in African sculptures as well at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Mert Simpson at that time, but I did hear about him early on and I even made an appointment to visit him.  And I used to tell people that Mert, if he was not number one dealer in the world, he was, you know, number two, but I mean I, just seeing the sculpture that he sold that he was major and I was always in awe of him.  And then I read an article about him, you know, in the, in the '70s [1970s] that said you know he was number one dealer in the world.
Speaker 1: Talk to me about this first show that you had the African sculptures in your apartment.  Where did you get the work from, how were you introduced to African sculptures (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right okay.  And let me--the name of that organization of black painters was Spiral.
Speaker 1: You're right, Spiral.
Speaker 2: Spiral.
Speaker 1: I remember Spiral.
Speaker 2: But, what--
Speaker 1: And let me just throw in because their, because they, they wanted to address, they wanted to put some blackness in art.  They wanted to address blacks in the arts.  I remember--
Speaker 2: Well, they were no, you know, most of the, the galleries did not represent black artists.  There was not the exposure.  You know art wasn't, they didn't, the art world didn't see art as being universal and if you were black you, you know they just weren't interested period, and especially if you were an abstract artist.  If you were an abstract artist, they had no, you know, not, no interest whatsoever.  I mean, after a while Bearden [Romare Bearden] became known and Jacob Lawrence, but I don't think it was an accident that both of them, the works were figurative, so it almost identified them by the, the art that they did, you know, I mean of course white artists often painted black subject matter, but not, not on a consistent basis.  So, had they been abstract artists I'm not certain that they would have gotten the recognition that they finally received.  But, anyway.
Speaker 1: Just to throw in that Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] was an abstract painter.
Speaker 2: Ed Clark was abstract.
Speaker 1: And he as black, and it was through the Spiral group that--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't belong to Spiral and he may have been in, still in New York [New York] at that time when they formed, but it's like Hale Woodruff, Richard Mayhew, Norman Lewis may have been a member of Spiral, Romare Bearden, Al Hollingsworth [Alvin Hollingsworth].  It may have been a couple of others too, but they were, you know, very--you know they just decided to take things in their own hands and you know because after at the bottom, at the end of it all, it was the art that was important and if no one was going to display their art they, you know, were going to do it themselves.  So, they would rent a space and have exhibits and I think each of them would take turns manning the space and so you know there should be more information.  People should know about a very important group.
Speaker 1: That's why we're talking to you (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, good.
Story_ID: 534427
Speaker 1: Which leads us to your first show, I mean the African sculpture.  So the Spiral group, did they inspire you, did you say okay I've got to show this African work to people?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was somebody who was showing some art in his apartment and he lived in Washington Square North [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Artie [ph.]--I'm just, sometimes the names, you know, but I'll come back.
Speaker 1: But Artie was black?
Speaker 2: Artie was black.  I think his name was Artie, but he had, he had shows periodically, and, but he did other things.  I think he may have been in social work or something, but he had a full-time job, but, you know, his interests was art and he would even go back and forth to Haiti and, but in addition to Haitian artists he would also show some, some black artists, other black American artists.  But, what, 'cause I was buying a lot of African sculpture.  I was buying a lot of art after my husband [Lester Alston] and I broke up, and I could spend my money the way I wanted it was just art, art, and more art.  And at that time in the '70s [1970s], African dealers would come to the states or come to New York [New York] with a lot of African sculpture.  When they finished selling it, they would go back get more.
Speaker 1: But in what form, I mean they would come, but how would you know they were gonna be here, where would they display their work (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, how did--? You know--
Speaker 1: Was it a flea market?  Was--
Speaker 2: --I think it was, no I guess from--
Speaker 1: A newsletter?
Speaker 2: --at some point I did meet an African art dealer and through him and maybe even there was one space near where I worked as a social worker, 'cause at that point I think I was working at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] and but our, our space was on East 69th Street in a hotel and I once saw an African dealer with lots of sculpture in the lobby and I would go up to him and get information, where, you know, he was going to be.  I think it was like that.  But, one time I was--my appointment was at one of these spaces looking at, 'cause they would rent a room in the hotel, have the sculpture, and then make appointments, and a white man came and our appointments overlapped and he looked at me, you know, very coldly as if to say, "What are you doing here?"  And I was determined after that to get more if I could do it, if I could, if possible get more blacks interested in African sculpture so that it was not just a market for white people.  I mean, really the, the bulk of the collectors are whites, I mean, Merton's [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson] clients are more, you know, more of them are white than, than black.  I think it has changed, a few more, but at that time there were very, very few black people just interested in art period.  So, one thing led to another.  I'm--I was enjoying it.  My plan was then to leave the field of social work, but I wanted to, you know, a few years to work at that and as it turned out I lost my job.  I didn't get the tenure because I was, my heart wasn't in it anyway.  I didn't get tenure at City College and when you, you know, there for five years if you don't get tenure than, you know, you're out.  So, instead of looking for another job in social work, you know, I just sort of moved ahead and just decided to pursue creating, trying to create a market among blacks and getting more blacks interested in what I thought was a very important aspect of our culture.
Story_ID: 534428
Speaker 1: The first African art sculpture show that was at your apartment [in New York, New York] was that your own private work that you'd collected or were you working in tandem with a dealer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I worked with the dealer, this, this was I think 1970, 1971.
Speaker 1: How did you get people to come to that particular show?
Speaker 2: Through friends, through, you know, my colleagues, my friends, and then some of my colleagues, they would bring, bring people, but that's how, but I, it was a big production, I mean, my second bedroom I made it into a you know a, just a kind of a gallery area and hung the sculpture and I even put wallpaper, special wallpaper.  It was a big production.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But, it, it certainly, it sort of paid off in terms of the interest that you know so many people seem to be interested.  I don't know if I ever, how much I, if it was profitable, but just the level of interest was enough for me, it was very encouraging and you know even if it hadn't, I just still thought it was important you know.
Story_ID: 534429
Speaker 1: I don't remember exactly where we were because we talked about so many things in between, but we will pick up after that first show you considered to be successful at least (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, that got the wheels turning.  What was your next step into becoming a full-time black arts dealer?
Speaker 2: Right, I just, I just continued having shows.  I don't know if I ever had after that an all African sculpture show; I'm not certain, but how I went about having, exhibiting work by artist that I, I don't remember, but it was on a fairly regular basis that I did have exhibits and it seemed as if I was known as someone who was pursuing artists and my place was an outlet for artists' works and I did meet Bearden [Romare Bearden].  The person I was dating at the time--because I was shy, but I would go to all these shows and you know Bearden at that point, well even with my first husband [Lester Alston] we saw the first exhibit of his that was at Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] and that was about I think 1968, '69 [1969] and so finally I called him and he was such a wonderful person and very open, welcomed me, invited me down to his studio, which is, well where he lived on Canal Street and he became a kind of mentor.  He knew what I was trying to do, and he was helpful in many ways.
Speaker 1: In what ways was he helpful?
Speaker 2: He even wanted me to consider owning a space down in SoHo [New York, New York] and he introduced me to some gallery dealers there.  I didn't feel that based on the, the interest, I didn't think the interest had reached the level where I could maintain a gallery nor did I have the money to do that, so, but I did appreciate you know what he, what he did.
Speaker 1: What did the two of you talk about in your conversations together?  You said he became kind of a mentor.  Did you talk about African American or at the time blacks in the arts?  Did you talk about, you know, who had been influenced by the black artists?  What were you conversations?
Speaker 2: Right, I guess you know maybe his--I more or less listened I mean because sometimes when I would visit him there were--I wasn't the only one.  There were other people, so I was just there listening to him and you know it was always about art, white artists, just art in general.  But, when he and I spoke he, he was also one of the founders of Cinque Gallery [New York, New York] and that was a gallery to introduce unknown, pretty much unknown black artists to the art world and so he even offered me a job there and I worked as a kind of a PR [public relations] person, or he--trying to introduce some of these artists to other galleries, writing press release, being available during the art openings, and that's where I met Chris Shelton who ran the gallery who, he was sculptor, but a good--a very good friend of, of Bearden's and that's how he got into that business and Chris is now an artist whose works I, I sell.
Story_ID: 534430
Speaker 1: I'm gonna jump forward a little bit to 1981 where you created the bi-monthly art newsletter for--I don't know if it was for or in conjunction with 100 black women in art [New York Coalition of 100 Black Women].
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Oh, but I'd like to, to go back--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] one show--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was very important that I had.
Speaker 1: This is the, okay.
Speaker 2: This was about 1978 and Ed asked to have a show at my space, now--
Speaker 1: Now what was your space called?
Speaker 2: It was just called Peg Alston Arts [Peg Alston Fine Arts, New York, New York], but--
Speaker 1: And where was it located?
Speaker 2: Upstairs, sixth floor where, where I live and lived then, but he was handled by a dealer.  I met him at, at show, one of his shows in SoHo [New York, New York].  It was the James U Gallery [New York, New York] and huge paintings and he came up to see my space after that and at some point he asked to have an exhibit, asked if I would exhibit his works because up to that point all of his collectors were white and he wanted to know how he would, his work was received by blacks.  You know, he says, "I just need to know."  He says, "If they don't like it fine, but I would like to--."  So that was his purpose for having a show at my place, but I learned a lot from him.  I learned--he, he introduced me to some, someone who did the announcements and I learned a lot of about hanging, 'cause there's really quite an art in hanging a show and Chris Shelton was involved in that 'cause I was a good friend of his and they at one point worked at the Sidney Janis Gallery [New York, New York].  But, he was very important, one of the most important artists, first artists that I exhibited in my space (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, was this Ed's introduction to the black community, per se?
Speaker 2: That was his introduction, and it was so successful.  We had his pastels include in the living room, the hallway, even in the bedroom, my bedroom and it was so successful that he, we had another opening.  We took down things that sold and put up others and had another opening.  And one of the people who purchased a painting at that time was Quincy Troupe.  I don't know if you know Quincy, he wrote the biography on Miles Davis ['Miles: The Autobiography,' Miles Davis and Quincy Troupe].  But, he often credits me for having gotten him involved in, in collecting.
Speaker 1: So, did you title Ed's first show?  Was there a title to that show in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Yes, because his, what was called the 'Yucatan Series' and I still have an announcement from that.  He would often go on location to, you know, a different country or spend maybe two to three months, et cetera, and work while on location while there and that was the purpose for him to visit a number of places where he did travel, Egypt, China, and he had just recently come from the Yucatan [Mexico].
Story_ID: 534431
Speaker 1: So, that did a lot for Ed [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] in the black community, introducing his work.  What did that do for you as an art dealer hosting his first show (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I learned, I learned a lot just in terms of presenting an, an exhibit, and it was always, you know, I knew that I was in the right field; it all felt good.  What I was doing, you know, just felt right for me.  I mean I was doing what I enjoyed, even though mind you, you know, we're not talking about successful, often successful monetarily because there were many, many months when I didn't know how I was gonna pay my rent, but I also learned not to worry.  I also, something told me you know that you know that, that was, you know, would be work--working against me and, but just to believe that it would work out and it did.  So, it was always an uphill.  This was, this business was, 'cause I mean it was sort of unprecedented in terms of as I look back and what I was doing.  There, there was not another dealer doing what I was doing that I could speak to, that I could get some tips from.  I just learned as I went along.  I tried to buy, and at that time in the '70s [1970s] very little documentation on black artists, so I purchased whatever I could in terms of catalogs, I mean you know I had just reams of now, whenever, even African sculpture I would just buy whatever books were available on African sculpture and the first book I knew that came out about black artists with the exception of an art, somebody from, from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--now I can't think--his mind--I just can't think, in the '40s [1940s].  I can't think of the, the, the book now or the name of the person, but it'll come to me.  But, after that there was no information and early '70s [1970s] there was a book or mid-'70s [1970s] that came out called 'The African American'--'Afro-American Artist' ['The Afro-American Artist: A Search For Identity'] by Elsa Honig Fine.  And up to that point Bearden [Romare Bearden] did a lot of writing because again there was just this dearth of, of material.  There was none available and so he contributed what he could.  So, there were about two or three books that have been, you know, co-written, by Romare Bearden in the '70s [1970s].  So, I was just saying that there were, you know, very little information written, et cetera, and also no galleries, no galleries that specialized in African American art--
Story_ID: 534432
Speaker 1: And mind you I'm not, I don't feel that there is--should be white art, European art, and then you know works by black artists.  It's really a false demarcation.  I wanna say that right up front.  The only reason why I focused and say black artists, way back in the late '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s] is because a lot of, a lot of blacks didn't know that black artists existed, so we needed, I think that was very, very necessary to highlight the fact that in addition there were musicians, there were writers, and there are also artists, but I lived for a time when art is universal and you know all artists are in the same group together.  You can call it American artists if it's an American and black that would include black, white, and others.  So it's--that is my point.  It's not black art.  There is no, it doesn't exist.  It's art by black artists, but it's no different in quality from any other art.
Speaker 2: Why do you feel it's important to make that distinction?
Speaker 1: Because there is an argument.  There is, there is some schools, there's kind, not, not a school, but a thinking.  Some people think, you know, black art and yet there are, there are black artists who rightfully don't want to be categorized that way, and I don't think they should.  Norman Lewis, for instance, you know, a universal artist, I mean his art is great.  It just happens that he's a black artist.  Now, all artists bring their own experience and they, you know, learn or influenced by others, but then they develop something that becomes their own, so it's like your music, et cetera, you know you have parts of it that, strains of that are from your own experience and it could be a black experience, but beyond that there is no other distinction.
Speaker 2: So, you feel it is a disservice to--?
Speaker 1: It's crippling in a sense because it sends the, the wrong information that there is a, a difference and there is none.  You know, the artists are using the same materials for the most part, you know, they're using acrylic, they're using oils, et cetera, they paint the same, they just paint from, if it's a true artist, they paint from you know what they wish to paint, they paint in their own style, which I think all artists should develop, but outside of that it is, it is a disservice because it gives the wrong information, the incorrect information.
Story_ID: 534433
Speaker 1: So in 1981, you were creating a bimonthly art newsletter and, and also you became a member of the national, I mean the New York Coalition of Women [New York Coalition of 100 Black Women] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Coalition, yes I was asked to join that and to do something with, with the art committee, but you mentioned 1981.  In 1980, I just wanna go to 1980.  I did have an exhibit in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, which was the first time African American artists exhibited there, so that was quite, quite something and I deliberately had what was only eight artists, but four abstract artists and four figurative artists, and there was a catalog, with that and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now was there--
Speaker 2: --I'm very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Was there a name for that show?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was called 'Retour aux sources' ['Retour aux sources: Une exposition en Afrique d'artistes afro-americains'], which is return to the source.
Speaker 1: And the purpose of that show was to take Af- to take Amer-, to, to take black American artists to Africa to exhibit their work and, and the West I-
Speaker 2: In the Ivory Coast (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ivory Coast and what is the French name for the Ivory Coast?
Speaker 2: Cote d'Ivoire.
Speaker 1: Cote d'Ivoire yeah.  So how was that show received?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was publicized very well, the radio, maybe I think mentioned on, on television as well.  Bill Hudson, who was one of the artists in, in the, in that exhibit he also spoke French fluently.  He handled many of the interviews, and it came about as a result of some African businessmen who when they would come to New York [New York] they somehow were introduced to me.  They were interested in, in art and they would purchase things and so they got an idea of having this, this show.
Speaker 1: So, outside of Bill Hudson who were the other artists that you took to that, to Africa?
Speaker 2: Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark].
Speaker 1: Ed Clark was one?
Speaker 2: He was one.  [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell, Vincent Smith, Barkley Hendricks [Barkley L. Hendricks], Pheoris West.  And I mentioned Bill Hudson.  There were eight.  I'm sure I'm leaving a couple out, and I can't think right now who the others were.
Story_ID: 534434
Speaker 1: How had you educated yourself on African American art?  How did you do it?  There, there were not a lot of books being written.  There were no classes to take.  How were you educating yourself?
Speaker 2: From time to time, there would be exhibits.  I would go to art bookstores, even you know used bookstores look for, for books, even catalogs pick up wherever I could.  I would visit, you know, museums, not only looking at black artists, but like the Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York, New York] (background noise).  I was a volunteer.  Someone recommended, recommended me, so I was a volunteer at the Metropolitan Museum.  But, it was you know like nonstop, 24/7 just thinking about art, talking about art, and finding, trying to find people who might be interested in art, because I also needed to live and trying to sell art, so I would--I also had some, some sessions in my apartment where the artist would, would speak about their works, you know.  I even had someone, George Preston [George Nelson Preston], who has his doctorate in, in African art to speak (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's his name?
Speaker 2: George Preston.  Merton [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson] knows him, but he's quite a scholar in African history and then the--who I considered a well known artist to, to speak.  So, you know I did what I could to--I, I tell people that you know maybe 90 percent of what I did was to educate and inform and the other 5 percent from selling, but you know, one could not, you know, get interested in buying art unless they knew about it and I felt it was very important.  And also I realized that art is something that, you know, doesn't provide shelter, you can't eat it, all of those things.  It's, but yet I feel that it's, it was important for people to have around them.
Story_ID: 534435
Speaker 1: You also said that, and I just want you to talk about for a moment, that there, there was some day--you hoped for the day to where people don't see artist as black art or white art or, but then how do you feel about a show like the recent black art show [National Black Fine Art Show] that was here in New York [New York] at the Puck Building?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I, I participate in that and it, it's, it's necessary, you know, it's necessary because still a lot of people don't know, so it's you know it really opens their eyes when they come and see a show and there's so many artists.  So, it is, in, in that sense it's, it's quite necessary.  But, the art world, the, the ones that count that, that make a difference in determining who is going to be major well-known artists versus, you know keeping someone, you know, just unknown forever and they go by--number one they just feel that the market for art is only for what they have been doing for many years, the white artists, you know, so they're now beginning to see that blacks are buying art, et cetera.  So there is more of an interest in exhibiting works by black artists because they know that it's, people will buy, but you know there is still a kind of an ignorance.  Once, a white friend of mine who lives on the east side, and this was a number of years ago in the early '80s [1980s], asked, she wanted us, she wanted to have a show of black artists, of the artists who I represented 'cause she liked the, the work that I represented and she sort of didn't have, you know she was just looking for something to do and, but anyway she had a great address, so we had a show.  But she, her friends would come to her and say, "Why are you doing this?"  You know, "There are no good black artists."  And this was in the, this was in the '80s [1980s], you know maybe the early to mid-'80s [1980s], so there's a lot of ignorance around, but the ignorance is also perpetuated by the art world, had been perpetuated by the art world because they weren't interested in showing black artists, I guess because number one they didn't feel their white clients would be interested in buying, but now we have a whole--it's quite different now.  There's a whole market, you know, I mean, many, many blacks are interested in, in being surrounded by their black artists.
Story_ID: 534436
Speaker 1: So, in the 1980s when, I think it's New York Magazine put Basquiat [Jean-Michel Basquiat] on its cover was that groundbreaking for the black community?  Did it have any--?  Was he so outside of the black community that he was considered something--what impact did that have on what you were doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think, I, I think the latter so, he was so outside of the black community and--
Speaker 1: Now how could he be so outside of the black community--
Speaker 2: And be black.
Speaker 1: --and be black, yeah?
Speaker 2: 'Cause he, 'cause he operated in a sort of a white world.
Speaker 1: How did you see his work and what he was doing in, in reference to--?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, when I first saw this, because I first was introduced to Basquiat when I saw his picture on the cover of the Sunday Times magazine section.  I think I still have it.  I mean, I have, I keep all materials, so I still have that.  And I was a bit upset because there were so many good artists before him, still living, who did not get any recognition at all and yet on the other hand this white, this market, they could, it, it was like they could make you overnight if they wanted to and it didn't have anything to do with the fact that there were no other black artists that existed and they just happened to come upon him.  It was just jumping over all of these major wonderful artists and just deciding that they were going to cash in and develop this black artist, you know, for whatever, for, for their reasons and so I really saw the art world at work and just the amount of power that they had.  I mean, even with Norman Lewis, not Norman Lewis, Jake Lawrence [Jacob Lawrence] who was handled by a white gallery, Terry Dintenfass, but by the time many, 'cause as I said, there was not a market, very few in the early '70s [1970s], very few blacks, none of my colleagues, friends knew or cared about black artists, cared if they, or any existed.  So, Jacob Lawrence, his works were collected primarily by, by whites outside of maybe his, a few friends of his.  And what showed, what you know that was very clear when he had a show ['Jacob Lawrence: Retrospective Exhibition'] in 1974 at the Whitney [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York], a retrospective and most of the works were from white collections, but I'm losing my point on why I, brought him up.
Speaker 1: Well, you were speaking about Basquiat and Jacob.
Speaker 2: Right I was speak, oh so by the time blacks did hear about, let's say for instance Jacob Lawrence and Bearden [Romare Bearden], the prices were so, you know, for the most part were beyond, if you're just beginning to, you know, buy art and getting interested in art and you know you're not ready to pay twenty thousand dollars for a painting.  So, one of the things I also wanted to see, I wanted to see a time when we could as blacks define our artists, and but the works would have already--already be purchased, collected by us by the time the white world heard of it we already had them in our collection, not the reverse, where by the time we hear about our artists we then, we don't, we can't even afford it and so it was a situation like with, with Basquiat, I mean, his things even now, twenty-five thousand, sounds like a mere pittance compared to what these paintings go for now, but I think the starting price based on who was handling him, Mary Boone, which is a top gallery [Mary Boone Gallery, New York, New York] in the art world, twenty-five thousand dollars, I mean most people if they were interested couldn't, couldn't afford it or you know, so there was, there's that going on.
Story_ID: 534437
Speaker 1: Well, you bring up an interesting point because who makes an artist? I mean is it, I mean is it the fact that Basquiat [Jean-Michel Basquiat] was shown in SoHo [New York, New York] that made him who he was?  Is it the fact that Jacob Lawrence, you know, what, who makes an artist?
Speaker 2: Well, the artist first I think the work has to come from the artist, but then I think there are times when there's an artist who is sort of weak, you know, in terms of his subject matter, his style, that are weak (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you think Basquiat was a weak painter?
Speaker 2: I didn't initially--
Speaker 1: Or didn't like pop art to begin with.
Speaker 2: ---initially, well initially compared, taking his work comparing it to Norman Lewis or comparing it to [HistoryMaker] William T. Williams or Frank Bowling, you know I'm not gonna mention Bearden [Romare Bearden] because they were known, Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, but these are unknown, and Al Loving.  I didn't feel that it was superior, you know.  He certainly had a right to create what he wanted to, but you know, let's, let's, you know, let's make a path for some of these artists who really, whose works are, are great.  Let's do something about that if you are really interested in art for art's sake, you know, and I, I don't, I didn't think that there was that interest in art.  Yes, and at the same time someone can make an artist depending upon who that, you know, who their, what gallery they're represented by, et cetera, and their connection with the top collectors and the museums, et cetera, yeah so it's, it goes both ways, but sometimes a great artist can also just languish because they're not getting exposure they deserve.
Story_ID: 534438
Speaker 1: So we are doing our completion interview today for The HistoryMakers.  So if you can just state your name again, give me today's date, and we will start making the corrections.
Speaker 2: Okay, [HistoryMaker] Peg Alston, March 7, 2006.
Story_ID: 534439
Speaker 1: So, what we'll do is make the corrections that we need to make about your history now that you've spoken to your sister [Trudy Wilkerson Rose].
Speaker 2: Oh, I see.  Okay.  Well, I mentioned that my mother's father's father, my great-grandfather was Irish, but he was Welsh and English and my mother's grandmother was Indian [Native American], Powelton Nation [sic.].  I never heard of that tribe from West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Can you spell the name of that tribe for me?
Speaker 2: Powelton, P-O-W-E-L-T-O-N Nation, West Virginia.  One, I guess the, I guess when my, my mother's [Louise Allen Davies] side her, her grandmother--let me just get this straight--her grandmother was Navajo or part, part Navajo and one, I guess, the, the, on the father's [Thomas Allen] side the, the great-grandfather was connected to Bacon's Rebellion, I don't know that in terms of history in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: What do you--can you spell Bacon's Rebellion?
Speaker 2: Bacon, B-A-C-O-N'S Re- Rebellion, so I don't know if that was in relation to the, the Revolutionary War, but it possibly was [sic.].
Speaker 1: And how was he involved?  Did they give an involvement?
Speaker 2: No, no there's--my family, on my mother's side they're still doing a lot of just investigation into the family background.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you know about Bacon's Rebellion?
Speaker 2: I don't know a thing (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just what you told me.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And, and about the year, do you know about, you said, you said the--?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  No, going back all I know is that, let's see my, my grandfather's mother was born in 1833, but the Bacon's Rebellion had to have been played earlier, but I don't know the, the year of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't go into detail--
Story_ID: 534440
Speaker 1: And then my uncle who sent me to college [New York University, New York, New York], the one who studied in Geneva [at the University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland] was also a Tuskegee Airman.  I forgot to mention that.  I don't know his squadron (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what was that uncle's name again?
Speaker 1: That's William Garfield Wilkerson, but he was--
Speaker 2: An airman.
Speaker 1: --with the Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: Now did he ever talk, do you ever remember, remember talking about that with him?
Speaker 1: No, I know that he was injured, that part.  He was injured flying over Italy, survived.  However, his leg was badly injured.
Speaker 2: Any stories about him in the family, any heroic stories or any stories about his time?
Speaker 1: Just luckily he, he landed in a friendly part of Italy.
Speaker 2: So, he was shot down.
Speaker 1: He was shot down.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: His plane was on--his plane was shot.  It was on fire and his was late and the tail of the plane hit his leg because he forgot, he was, he was radioed that his plane was on fire.  Tried to bail out and then realized he still had his safety belt on and had to, you know, do all of that and so by the time he parachuted out the, the tail of the plane hit his leg.
Speaker 2: Okay any more corrections, anything that you can think of that we need to correct before we move forward?
Speaker 1: No, that's it.
Story_ID: 534441
Speaker 1: And moving forward I would like to--thank you, Neculai [Neculai Burghelea]--just to go over some of the dates that I've read in this article that appeared in In the Arts magazine you served as an art consultant to the Black Theatre Festival [Black Theatre Festival-U.S.A.], which was at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  What was the Black Theatre Festival?  I can't remember it occurring since, I mean, since I've been in New York [New York] at the Lincoln Center.  Does it still occur?  What was it?
Speaker 2: No, there was someone who was in the theater not living now and it just happened to have been at Lincoln Center, but what I think they had a number of performances, plays that may have been, lasted for a week and the part of Lincoln Center was, may have been the Vivian Beaumont Theater [New York, New York], and I was asked to provide photographs of actors, actresses, so I did a lot of research, and I can't remember where I borrowed the photographs from, but the whole background of the theater had the photographs supplied by me but you know.
Speaker 1: And the photographs were of?
Speaker 2: Of actors, you know, from an earlier period, anything that I could find in the field.
Speaker 1: So that, and that's, the nature of that festival was to introduce black theater to--
Speaker 2: Yes, to the, I think it was a summer program and it was, you know, probably part of, of the Lincoln Center summer program and I think, was that in 1983 or I, is the year 'cause I--
Speaker 1: The year is 1979 for the Lincoln Center (unclear).
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979] right.  I don't remember much more of that.
Story_ID: 534442
Speaker 1: Just one other thing I wanted to have you comment on was the 'African Artists in America' for an African American institute [Africa-American Institute; The Africa-America Institute, New York, New York].  It was a show that was at the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] and like fifteen other museums throughout the United States in 1978.
Speaker 2: There's a program whereby the Smithsonian, I can't remember the department now, but they put on a lot of exhibits.  There was, and it--I think it originated there, as an African-American Institute that was across from the United Nations [United Nations Headquarters, New York, New York] and I think the, I think they were the ones who originated this project.  And actually I don't remember what--and probably some of the artists, I provided some of the artists for that project.
Story_ID: 534443
Speaker 1: Speaking about some of the artists I just want--I'd like to go over a list of some of the work you've sold and if you can tell me what you remember about the artist, about the work, and we'll start with Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark].  Can you talk about meeting Ed Clark, the year you met, how you came about representing him, some of the work you've sold, your impressions of his work?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I was always, well very much taken by the contemporary artists, those living artists that didn't have much exposure within the black community, and generally didn't have exposure at all.  The exception was Ed Clark who was when I did meet him in the '70s [1970s], possibly 1976, was handled by a gallery in SoHo [New York, New York], the James U Gallery, and I saw that exhibit, I guess a colleague told me about the exhibit, and that's when I, I met him.  They were huge paintings.  And when I did meet him and he heard that I was trying to promote works by African American artists he asked to, you know, for an appointment and he met me in my apartment, which is where I did exhibit art.  And at one point he asked to have a show.  Now I would never had approached him because he had already had an outlet for his art whereas most of the artists that I did meet did not have any exposure at all, not to my knowledge.  And he requested--asked if I, if I would be interested in exhibiting his works.  Up to that point, he said his works were in collections of, you know, of white collectors and he just wanted to, since he was African American, at that time, I think we said black, he really wanted to know how his work would be perceived and accepted by the black community, and he was quite open, you know, he just needed to know.  He said if they don't like my work that's fine, but I would just like to know and so we had an exhibit in I think 1977, 1977, '78 [1978], can't remember (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we talked about that last time, I think it was called the pastels, the exhibit was called--
Speaker 2: Yucatan--
Speaker 1: The Yucatan.
Speaker 2: --Series ['Yucatan Series'].
Speaker 1: The 'Yucatan Series.'  So, let me ask you.  What were you personal impressions of his art and when you saw the work at the gallery for the first time?
Speaker 2: It was just wonderful, I mean, you know, colors, the, you know, I found the works just very pleasant, relaxing, and I learned later that the colors change according to the area that he visits and spends time, where he spends time and paints.  So, in the Yucatan series the colors were cooler than the, the, the series he had at the James U Gallery was from a time he spent in Africa.  I can't remember now what, what country, but the colors were just very warm and rich and reds and earth colors.  So, I just as, as I mentioned last time I learned a lot from Ed.  I learned about installing art, et cetera, 'cause actually he once worked, when he was quite young, at the Sidney Janis Gallery [New York, New York] and he and Chris Shelton worked together there and that was part of their job installing art for exhibits.
Story_ID: 534444
Speaker 1: Mert Simpson [HistoryMaker Merton Simpson] who is another HistoryMaker of ours (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mert, yeah. I don't know how I heard about Mert Simpson, but my first exhibit was African sculpture.  I, I started out primarily buying art for my own personal enjoyment and one thing led to another when I realized that none of my friends or colleagues seem to be interested.  I tried to play a role in, in at least I felt that if they knew more about art they would be interested in, in acquiring it as I had been doing.  And I don't know how I heard about Mert Simpson, but since African sculpture was one of my loves I learned that he was in New York [New York] and I did make an appointment to, to visit him and just the, the sculpture I was just overwhelmed by the quality of the sculpture and just his, his, his role as a dealer in, in African sculpture.  And I learned later that he was an artist.  He started, he was also a member of the Spiral group and went to Paris [France] to study, I believe, and I think it was there that he became interested in African sculpture, maybe as a way of, you know, making extra money in order to continue his studies in art and one thing led to another.
Story_ID: 534445
Speaker 1: So, you've also had an opportunity to sell work, works by [HistoryMaker] Elizabeth Catlett.
Speaker 2: Right, what I did, you know, in, in learning more about the, the artists that did exist I also went by the, the art that I loved that moved me.  In many cases I would contact the artist, and I did contact Elizabeth Catlett, and I found that the artists who learned about me or those that I did contact were very open, very--just the idea that a black person was trying to expand the knowledge of art in the black community was something that up to this, that point, you now, was just quite rare.  So, they were just willing to assist in, in many ways.  So, it was, it was quite easy once, once I met these artists and I did have some of her works.  Since I'm a private dealer, it was not about exclusive, being an exclusive dealer, but just helping to interest other people in their works and even if they were handled by galleries such as Jacob Lawrence who was handled by Terry Dintenfass, you know I could tell them at least I was able to tell them well this artist is exhibiting, you know, at, at this gallery and I think you should see the work.  With Jake Lawrence, I met him once in the street and I recognized him.  He was on Madison Avenue [New York, New York] I ran up to him and introduced myself and that started, you know, a, a lifelong relationship.  And whenever he would come to the city I would see him, but he arranged a meeting with his dealer, Terry Dintenfass, and told Terry that he would like for me to handle some of his works and how could that be possible?  It wasn't--he didn't ask the dealer, he just said this is what he wanted and it, she, she, she apparently, you know, went along with it, so I did sell some of his, at that point, his lithographs and silkscreens.  Prints are certainly much less expensive than, than originals, so I sold many of his prints that way.
Story_ID: 534446
Speaker 1: Did you find that you were introducing him [Jacob Lawrence] to a, a community that didn't realize the importance of his work at the time?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yeah, yeah.  There were many people who had never heard of Romare Bearden, and you know we're talking about the mid, late, even the late '70s [1970s] when a lot of people hadn't heard. I mean, you know I would ask if they knew about Romare Bearden.  No, and when I, I use his name is because he was, I guess the most popular black artist at that time.  But--so it was you know again something that was, we, we didn't learn about it school, we didn't, so therefore we didn't talk about it, we didn't know about exhibits.  Even if people were interested they wouldn't know where to go and so, you know, I, I think helped a little bit.  But, it was like I heard about Jacob Lawrence even before I even met Jacob Lawrence.  When I was married, my first husband [Lester Alston] once told me that he stopped and saw this gallery on the east side [New York, New York] and black artist, he even bought the book, the catalog, and he said works were selling for a thousand dollars. Now this was in the '60s [1960s].  Now my husband also we went to the exhibit at Spiral saw Romare Bearden's collages.  This is the first time we even heard of his name, and this was maybe about 1967, '68 [1968], and his collages were selling for two hundred and fifty dollars.  My husband liked his work, but didn't buy it, you know 'cause I would say, "Well if you like let's, let's get it."  It didn't work out.  So, when he came home and told me about this artist and the works were selling for a thousand dollars I knew that that was just out of, you know, out of the question there was no way we, he would consider buying a Jacob Lawrence, but, so I learned about those, those two artists especially since those were the two that most people now know about in the early '60s [1960s].
Story_ID: 534447
Speaker 1: Did I tell you about a large exhibit at the, at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], African American artists?  This was maybe '64 [1964].  It was major, and that's when, well Charles Alston was a well-known artist too and it's a piece that I saw that I liked very much and I thought it would be fun, I liked the work, and it would be a play on words since the last name was the same, but of course I was married at the time, so we didn't get it.  But, I learned later that Johnson publications [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois] purchased that, that painting.
Speaker 2: Tell me about the play on words I, I didn't get that part Alston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well Alston, A-L-S-T-O-N, and people still ask me if I'm related.  That's one question that people often ask me if I'm related to Charles Alston, but not.
Speaker 2: Got it, okay yes.  So, he--the exhibition was of his work and how much was a painting?
Speaker 1: No, this was, this was a group show.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Major group show.  Charles invited me there.  There were at least twenty artists who were in that exhibit, but this was only--
Speaker 2: At City College?
Speaker 1: Yeah, this was before I became a dealer or attempted to sell works, but it was an interest of mine, so it was nice to have attended that.  It was a major exhibit, and I don't know who put that show on.  It, it happened to have just been at City College, but I don't think City College had anything to do with the curatorial aspect of it.
Story_ID: 534448
Speaker 1: As we move forward and there are considerations--or there will be an African American museum [National Museum of African American History and Culture] on the Mall [National Mall] in Washington [D.C.], do you have, have you given any consideration to consulting for them as to what type of work should be in that museum?
Speaker 2: Well, you know this was a plan early on, I think in the mid-'80s [1980s] and there were, you know, at that time I made contact with some of the pe- people who were working with this project and I think it was the, the plan was for it to be more of a historical museum, you know, maybe similar to the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] rather than a museum of fine arts.  Now, it may be inclusive.  It may include fine art, but I think it's also one, will be one of historical documents relating to the blacks in this country and one of the--Congressman Lewis [HistoryMaker John Lewis] is very much involved with that.  So, I don't know if, you know, I can play a role unless it is going to include fine art as well.
Speaker 1: Well do you feel it should include fine arts?
Speaker 2: I definitely think so, yeah.  And if it's, you know, I, I don't know just the scope, the space, et cetera, and what, you know, is, is allotted for.  I don't at this point.  I mean, for instance, to give you an idea.  There was a museum in Detroit [Michigan] that, that opened I guess now maybe twelve years ago, again a historical museum or African American museum [Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, Detroit, Michigan] and I went to the opening because this was, you know, just something that I was excited about and again it was mostly memorabilia, historical documents, not much relating to paintings, sculpture by any of our artists.  So, while it's, it's very, very important that, you know, we have our, our history on view in a museum, it's equally important that our paintings--because our paintings work, you know, in tandem with the, with the documents that are also, I guess people want to know about.  But, you know, art is, goes, you know, hand in hand with our, with the rest of our history and therefore it should be included.
Story_ID: 534449
Speaker 1: Well, you volunteered at the Studio Museum of Harlem [sic. Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  What has been your experience with the artists in fine arts at the Studio Museum (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, now at, when I, when the Studio Museum opened which may be, I think it was 1967 [sic.], '68 [1968], they didn't have a plan for volunteers, et cetera, but since I guess art was something that was my passion I just called and volunteered and I did--so they, they didn't have a program, but you know, since somebody was willing to work for nothing they, you know, made that possible.  And they probably have a docent program at this time, but in the '60s [1960s] they didn't, but I, I just worked in the administrative office.
Speaker 1: So, are you a member of the Studio Museum now?  Do you stay in touch--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: --with the museum and what's going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so, I mean do you feel that the work there is, represents the black fine arts in, in a way that's appropriate?
Speaker 2: I think that they could do more in emphasizing these, these artists who for a number of years had been overlooked and that--you know artists in the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  I think that they could play a greater role in correcting that.  A lot of emphasis is placed on the younger artists and that's very important also, but this is the only place, this museum is the only place that can bring about just, you know, just correcting something that was overlooked.  Artists like Norman Lewis, Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark].  Most of them probably, well not only abstract, but even the figurative artists, artists who are now in their seventies, eighties.  Chris Shelton, a sculptor, and then some of the figurative artists like Arthur Coppedge who are really excellent artists, and I think that if they show the importance of these artists by paying homage to them, the rest of the world will also.  The Studio Museum is a very important museum in the art world, and all eyes are on the Studio Museum and at this, at this point I think that they will take direction from the Studio Museum, so I would like for them to, I'd like to see them play more of a leadership role in presenting all of the artists, not just the younger ones, but all of the artists who we consider are, are very good, who are excellent artists.

Speaker 1: How has your mission changed from starting as an, an art dealer and working with African and African American sculptures and paintings--the mission you started with versus what your mission is today how has it changed?
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes from time to time I will show works by other artists.  I have shown a Chinese artist who I think is very good.  Recently, I submitted works by an artist from the Dominican Republic.  Still my, you know, I, I stress the African American artists because it, we still haven't reached a level where art is looked upon as, as art.  So--
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you before you go forward does that translate, does that cross over to other minorities as well?  I mean are Chinese Americans' art overlooked equally as well as African Americans' art.  I mean are you branching out because there is a need within other minority groups as well to have their works represented?
Speaker 2: No, I would like to at some point just exhibit art that I like and introduce art to, you know, to my community and that goes beyond African American artists, but as I said, you know, my love will still be African American artists.
Story_ID: 534451
Speaker 1: We will just continue with where we left off when you were talking about artists that--why, why don't we start with the artists that you feel are important from the past who still haven't gotten the recognition that they deserve that you'd like to see more--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --people take more interest in.
Speaker 2: Yeah and when I say recognition, you know, I think these, the artists that I'm going to, to mention should be collected by everyone.  I mean, you know, on the level where you know when the artists reach a level that is considered they're important, they've achieved recognition, they're collected by, you know, by people in the art world, collectors periods, not just blacks, but white as well and so I would like--and as some of the younger black artists are, are today.  [HistoryMaker] William T. Williams is one--
Speaker 1: And, and, but okay, we'll take William T. Williams.  If you can just give me a brief description of his work and why you feel he is one that should--we should take a deeper look at.
Speaker 2: Okay, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that too comp- is that too much?
Speaker 2: --you know, yes, well I can, as much as--
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, but from your point of view, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, his, for me what I look for when I, well exhibit artists and when I exhibit artists it's like a statement I'm, I'm making that this is an artist that I think that's worthy for one to take a look at to consider, to--for use of another word collect.  I mean, I, I don't always like that word collect because it doesn't really give the connotation of what transpires between the painting and the viewer, but when, when someone wants that, that work or particular work, an art--by an artist in their home or whatever so that they can look at it and enjoy it because that's what really art is about.  It's, it's about seeing something that you like just like you see anything else that you like and you want to have.  You want to see it.  You wanna, it's like hearing a piece of music like that you enjoy, a symphony and then you want to play it, you buy the CD.
Story_ID: 534452
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Continuing with [HistoryMaker] William T. Williams.  His work should be--
Speaker 2: Right, right so what I, I, you know, I look for artists who have developed a style that is recognizable, their own style.  It's, you know, it's all right to be--to have been influenced by other artists, but an artist should then move beyond that and develop something that is unique, that is different, that you know expresses whatever it is they, they want to express.  And so they have a style that's consistent and William T. Williams has arrived at that.  He's, he's a very strong artist in terms of--he paints as all--he paints what he wants to paint.  He doesn't paint what he feels people will like, you know.  He has to be satisfied himself.
Speaker 1: If you had to give him just in a sentence his contribution to the black art world, what would he, what would you say he has contributed?
Speaker 2: Well, instead of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Of his work?
Speaker 2: --not black art world, I'd say to the art world, yeah.  Just again his own style, which is like a language of his and he has been painting 'cause he's in his sixties now.  He's been painting for the past twenty or, or so years and he--there are periods where there is a particular style and then he develops, you know, another, you know theme from that previous style and he was--his work was listed in the 'Janson's History of Art' ['Janson's History of Art: The Western Tradition'].  As a matter of fact, in The Times [The New York Times] today there is an article, front page Times about the, that book, the 'Janson's History of Art,' which is very important in the art well, I guess for students, et cetera.  But, he was the first black artist that was in the third or fourth edition of 'Janson,' which came out maybe ten years ago.  The first black artist to have a color reproduction of his work in that book.  And these artists, I mean, you know, he, he, he knows that he is a good artist, and he feels that he has been primarily overlooked because of his color.
Story_ID: 534453
Speaker 1: Al Loving who died last year is another artist.  He did, his, the last work that he, he did, last group of paintings were kinds of cut outs and in a very kind of fantasy like way, very melodious, but it wasn't just a rectangular painting.  He worked on, he works, he works with or worked with handmade paper and did these cutoffs that were just very colorful and anyone who will look at, come upon a group of, of art works and see these, these works will say that's probably a work by Al Loving.  He was, I think got some recognition in the '60s [1960s] after the Civil Rights Movement, was handled by a gallery, a white gallery and what happened after that I don't know.  He, I don't know if he, maybe he felt they weren't exhibiting his work enough, but none of these artists have gallery representation, the artists that I'm mentioning now.
Story_ID: 534454
Speaker 1: There is also [HistoryMaker] Howardena Pindell, female artist, who is I think one of the top living female artists.  Very--her, her style again, quite unique.  She used to work a lot with, with dots, which was just very painstaking, small cut outs, well not--you know how you use that, we make this little gadget that will punch holes, hole puncher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A hole punch.
Speaker 1: She would have a painting that might be eight or eight feet wide by six feet high just made from all these little dots from a hole puncher and to, you know, how long it would take to create a painting from that was just, it was just amazing, but, very beautiful and she has received some recognition, but I think she could, you know she should be receiving far more than she is.  I remember once in the mid-'70s [1970s] she was handled by two galleries.  She had two shows on Madison Avenue [New York, New York] simultaneously, but then you know I think one, one gallery closed and what happened to the other I don't know.  It had nothing to do with her work, but she's now unrepresented by, well I don't wanna say major gallery, but most of the white galleries, some of them are major.  She is handled by galleries that are, that are run by African Americans like [HistoryMaker] George N'Namdi that's based in Detroit [Michigan], Chicago [Illinois], and New York [New York], but she should be handled by Pace [Pace Gallery, New York, New York] or you know another, Gagosian [Gagosian Gallery, New York, New York], I mean that's, these are major galleries.  This is just how good she is.  She also did, has done some works where there's strips of photographs and I have one upstairs--I think you saw it--but where she paints, she cuts the photographs into strips and then paints between the strips and so it's hard to see where the photograph stops and the paintings begins because you know it was done so well.  She--and no one I know has, has done that, you know done that.  So, you know, she, she should receive credit for her innovative styles.
Story_ID: 534455
Speaker 1: You spoke about a black gallery that exists in Detroit [Michigan], Chicago [Illinois], and New York [New York].  Are there other black dealers and galleries?  Is there an association (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh sure. Not an association, but there are some that exist.  There's the June Kelly Gallery that has been in SoHo [New York, New York] for--she, she used to work with Bearden [Romare Bearden] in I guess being a PR [public relations] person for Bearden, and she opened her gallery I guess maybe fifteen, maybe even later, fifteen, twenty years ago, and she's now a member of the art dealers association [Art Dealers Association of America], which is a very prestigious association in the art world, major art galleries belong to that if they are invited.  Then there is I think a private gallery.  I think they're private, the Essie Green Gallery [Essie Green Galleries] based in Harlem [New York, New York] and as a matter of fact I spoke with him [Sherman K. Edmiston, Jr.] recently because I would like for him to consider joining the organization that I belong to which is the Private Art Dealers Association.  There's Kenkeleba [Kenkeleba House, New York, New York] in the Lower East Side [New York, New York] and I think they're a non-profit gallery, but they have made great contribution to again exhibiting works by important African American artists from the late 19th century to the present and they have often catalogs, they've written catalogs that accompany the, the exhibits.  There's Bill Hodges [Bill Hodges Gallery, New York, New York] on 57th Street.  Now all of these have like, not popped up 'cause Kenkeleba has been around for a long while, but Bill Hodges for instance, maybe twelve years old.  I think it's relatively young, you know, I mean going back to the early '70s [1970s] when there were none that existed there, you know there're a handful of very good galleries now.
Story_ID: 534456
Speaker 1: So in moving forward and sort of in the African American art arena, what, what do you think has to be done, what has been done well as far as business people in making it a, making it--art, black art--a commerce?
Speaker 2: Well more and more people, I mean today versus twenty-five years ago or thirty years ago it's almost like night and day, I mean, there's quite an interest, and not only an interest, I mean it's, it's hard to keep up with the demand.  There's a demand for a certain group of artists that's just hard to get at the present time whereas you know thirty years ago, twenty-five, twenty, fifteen years ago these artists could be, their works could be had for practically a song and now, you know, the prices have just escalated as a result of supply and demand because many of the artists are no longer living.  The work still exists, but you know, that's just a limited number and you have constantly, which is how it should be, a broadened base of people who are, who are just--each year becoming an increase of people who are interested.  So, it's, it's delightful to see.
Story_ID: 534457
Speaker 1: I mean, you know like we have what's known as the black art show.  Have you heard of the National Fine Black Arts Show [sic. National Black Fine Art Show, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Is that the one in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 1: No, it's at the Puck Building [New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the Puck Buil-. Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: In New York [New York]. And so there you see, you know, galleries and the owners from a lot of cities in the country and I think as a result of that, that show that is every year around December some people who never considered showing black artists compete or you know have been a part of this fair and have brought on black artists because they've seen now that's just--the interest has, you know, surprised them.  So you know, I mean I think it's an uneven show.  I don't think it's--it's not where I would like to see it, but it's great for people who wanna learn or wanna see art, they see a variety of art under one roof, so it's quite, quite an education for people who want to be aware of the artists.
Story_ID: 534458
Speaker 1: So, what do you hope for yourself and your gallery [Peg Alston Fine Arts, New York, New York] in your private dealing ten years from now?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I would like to see that the artists shouldn't have to struggle as, as much as they do, still do.  Some of the artists I get, you know as I said who haven't reached that level of recognition (background noise) and once that happens, you know, once that happens where they will be embraced by art lovers all over.  It can be international as well, not just national.  I will think that it would be a job well done.  We haven't reached that point yet, but I would like for that to happen.
Speaker 1: So, just to, I hate to do this, let's have you repeat just some of that because the phone was ringing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, even more personally for you what do you want your gallery to, you know, where do you see your gallery and your dealerships and your clients like ten years from now, you know?
Speaker 2: Right, right.  As I'm, I'm a private dealer, which is, you know, like it's by appointment only because my space is not in a residential, I mean in a commercial, but a residential building and I would still prefer to be a private dealer 'cause my time is more or less my own, and I can also be available to people when, you know, it's convenient for them to come to see art even after six o'clock.  Someone you know is leaving the office and they want an appointment at seven or eight o'clock.  I'm, I'm here for that.  I would like to see many of the artists who I do handle reach another level of just importance, and even if they have to, if it means that they have to leave me to be handled by a major gallery I think that's fine.
Story_ID: 534459
Speaker 1: Years ago, for instance, I wrote a number of, of galleries regarding Norman Lewis, I don't know if I mentioned that earlier, because he is, he was such a giant and was overlooked during his lifetime even when many of his colleagues who were white artists like Ad Reinhardt, Max Ernst moved on and you know became among the group of recognized artists and were exhibited at Museum of the Modern Art [New York, New York] and became part of collections of the Whitney Museum [Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York], et cetera, and even though he at one time was handled by a gallery, a white gallery, they did nothing with him.  But, you know I like to see--and so what I did was to write a lot of these museums and--not museums, galleries--and nothing, nothing happened.  This was, I guess the early '80s [1980s].  There was one dealer, Michael Rosenfeld who I was referred to and at that point Michael Rosenfeld hadn't heard about Norman Lewis, but after seeing his work did, did become interested and I think that sort of spurred him to do something in terms of representing more African American artists.  He is based on 57th Street [at the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, New York, New York].  But, it didn't matter that I would no longer be able to sell Norman's works, but I just felt that his, he should be, you know finally in the level of major artists as he deserved to be.
Story_ID: 534460
Speaker 1: When you look back over what you've accomplished since starting in the art business in the '60s [1960s] it was, but that you started in the '70s [1970s] upstairs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In the, in the early '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 1: The early '70s [1970s] upstairs.
Speaker 2: --nineteen seventy [1970], '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Seventy [1970], looking back from now to '71 [1971] what stands out most for you?
Speaker 2: Well, the fact that you're here, I mean that's, that's amazing, you know that you or HistoryMakers [The HistoryMakers] would be interested in talking with me about my role that I played in introducing, you know, some of the artists to the black community.  I think that--so you know 'cause when you're doing something that you feel is important you really don't think about what you're doing. I mean, you know, you're just doing it because number one you love it, you, it's a passion and it's something that you feel others should be aware of and you know I always felt that this was a major part of our culture that had been overlooked, I mean you know, it's sad when I think about many of the artists who from the '40s [1940s] who had to give up, I mean excellent artists who just had to give up their craft in order to survive and take care of their family and you know they were just wonderful artists that we no longer hear about or whose works we, we don't see.  There were some artists thanks, you know, I thank them for the struggle that they had to experience in order to stay with their love, who painted regardless of whether or not there were shows, and there weren't shows, but they painted because this was their, you know raison etre [raison d'etre], you know their, their reason for being and existing.
Story_ID: 534461
Speaker 1: So you expressed a sense of accomplishment having The HistoryMakers here to interview you to be--as a HistoryMaker.  Why do you feel or why did you agree to be, to be a part of The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Well, when I, you know, did a little research and I (laughter), I was, I was quite honored and felt that maybe I do have something to say.  Maybe I did make contribution, and you know just wanted to accommodate you and, you know it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And get your story down.
Speaker 2: It was--
Story_ID: 534462
Speaker 1: We were talking about the importance of history.  Why is history important to you?
Speaker 2: Well, some things--you know, there has been, everyone--there's a past and you know with, with blacks, I don't think we are aware of our history and the contribution that we have made to this country, the development of this country.  Also, I find that, or observe that the more repressed a people are for some reason there's this need to express themselves in some way artistically, whether it's music or, or writing, et cetera, and I think we have expressed ourselves through music.  We've, you know, dance, and you know art is something that people have overlooked because the expression has come so much through artistic creation in, in an artistic way.  There was an exhibit that was curated way back in the mid-'70s [1970s] called 'Two Hundred Years of African American Art' [sic. 'Two Centuries of Black American Art: 1750-1950'], curated by [HistoryMaker] David Driskell and he even had in that exhibit jugs, water jugs that slaves made and, but it was artistic, you know it wasn't just a jug for water.  You know, they, they put their own expression into that and so, you know, it has never, it has, it's just been a continuum of artistic expression that I think we should be aware of and I think you know they say that once you know where you came from you also know, you have a better idea of where you're going.
Story_ID: 534463
Speaker 1: And we will end with--we have a few minutes on this tape, so having heard your past, your history, do you have an idea of where you're going?  And is it something you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think as mentioned I saw someone last night because every time you, you, I run into people the first thing they ask: "How's the art business?" or, you know, "You're still into art?"  I mean, that's the first thing they ask and you know happen to mention last night you know I'll probably be, you know, doing something related to art for as long as I live, you know, and until I die.  I mean, it's--I'm fortunate to have been able to work at something that is my passion, and you know I didn't know what my passion was until I worked at this job as a babysitter and saw all of this wonderful original art.  I mean, I had no idea who the artists were, but it was the art that appealed to me and so I, I do feel very fortunate.  And I hope, what I tried to share with people is that art is to be around things that cause you to smile, even inside, is justification enough to, to want it around you.  Years ago someone asked me to--they gave me space in a new magazine and one of the, the caption I had written was that art is a necessity and that's how I feel.
Story_ID: 534464
Speaker 1: You're looking at a family photograph, my family with my mother [Louise Allen Davies], father [Homer Wilkerson], and sister [Trudy Wilkerson Rose] and brother [Homer Wilkerson].  From the left is myself, I guess I must have been about four or five.  My mother made that dress.  Then, is my mother, my sister is standing to the left of my mother, and then my father who is holding my brother and he, he was probably two years old.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's me in the '80s [1980s] take by Coreen Simpson.  She's known for the, the black, well they were rings--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Onyx?
Speaker 1: Yeah--not onyx [sic. The Black Cameo].  Oh I can't remember, anyway she had a line of jewelry that had black images on them.  I can't think of what, what that is now.  Anyway, she's a well known photographer and I think I had to have some photographs taken for an ad or an article and I asked her.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I received honorary recognition from the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women and that's me in the center.  On the right, was the president, Betty Adams, and the left is someone who was in the arts committee with me.
Speaker 2: And the year.
Speaker 1: The year is the '80s [1980s], maybe 1987.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is an opening at Cinque Gallery [New York, New York] and Cinque was founded by Romare Bearden, Norman Lewis, and Ernie Crichlow [Ernest Crichlow] and at the time I was working at Cinque thanks to Romi, that's the nickname, Romare Bearden's nickname, but this is one of the openings and on the far right, on the far is Norman Lewis--
Speaker 2: Okay, so I'm just going to point to that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes. And coming to your left a little the person whose back, that's Romare Bearden.  All the way to your left is Norman's wife.  You see the photo of a woman that's Ouida Lewis.  And there were probably other artists there.  I can't, I can't see, but those are the ones that stand out. I can't recognize anyone else.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): That's all right.
Speaker 1: That's my mother and I.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's my mother and I in Egypt in front of one of the pyramids.  We're on a camel, so the arm up that's me.  My mother's head is to I guess would be the left, and I went to Egypt a number of times and I established something I called the art experience in Egypt.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's my apartment upstairs where I had art exhibits, but there's not an exhibit there.  That's me and my favorite cat, Tut, really Tutankhamen, but Tut for short and he lived to be twenty-one years old, but there's a lot of art in the room and most of that art was a part of my collection.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: That was in the early '70s [1970s], maybe 1972.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I think that is during one of the art exhibits I had and again that was the early '70s [1970s].  It was during the afro period, and at times I would wear turbans.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's the only photograph I have of my father and [paternal] grandmother [Eva Johnson] together, and this was during--it was in Camden, New Jersey, and my grandmother was being honored and it was probably by her club.  Last time I couldn't remember the name of the club that she formed--Club Utopia--but as I said she made a lot of contributions in her small way in Camden, New Jersey.  She would even have concerts, sponsor concerts of the Fisk chorus, the Fisk Jubilee chorus [Fisk Jubilee Singers].  She would bring them to Camden, New Jersey.
Speaker 2: That's during--me in the booth at the National Black Fine Arts Show [National Black Fine Art Show, New York, New York], one of the early exhibits there and I think to the right of me was, is a collage by Bearden and the colorful work is by [HistoryMaker] Sam Gilliam.
Speaker 1: I'm standing at a, in Brooklyn [New York] at the Bed-Stuy Restoration building [Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, New York, New York] where there was an exhibit of works by an African artist who I also represented, Z.K. Oloruntoba and that photo was taken by Coreen Simpson.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And that's, that's one of a number of portraits that were taken by a photo studio because someone, a friend of mine felt that I should have some photos made, and this was in the mid to late '80s [1980s].
