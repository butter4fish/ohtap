 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Wednesday, March 2,  2016. I   m interviewing Jeff Jensen for the Cowboys in Every County  Interview series sponsored by  the  Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at Oklahoma State University. Mr. Jensen, you   re an Owasso  resident and president of BancFirst here in Claremore. You got your  undergraduate degree in accounting and finance from OSU. You   ve been  active in the OSU Foundation, as I understand it, and the Spears School of  Business. Thank you for taking the time to talk with me.  Jensen Sure.  Little Thunder Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Jensen I was born and raised in Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  Little Thunder What did your parents do for a living?  Jensen My dad was a draftsman for Phillips Petroleum Company for thirty-three,  thirty-four years.  Little Thunder How about your mom?  Jensen Mom was more of a homemaker. She did work here and there, but mostly  was a homemaker raising three kids.  Little Thunder What were they, brothers or sisters? Where were you in the line up?  Jensen I am the youngest. I have a brother who   s the middle child, and then and  older sister.  Little Thunder What was it like in Bartlesville as you were growing up?  5  Jensen It was very   great place to grow up as a child with Phillips  Petroleum  Company  there and all the amenities associated with having a Fortune 500  company in a town of about, at that time, probably about 28,000. We had a  lot of opportunities for athletics, bowling, swimming. All that provided by  Phillips Petroleum Company. Pretty neat place to grow up.  Little Thunder What kinds of things did you do for fun?  Jensen Well, I played baseball. Also started wrestling at a young age at the Y   YMCA .  Little Thunder Are we talking middle school?  Jensen Actually, we   re talking grade school.  Little Thunder Wow.  Jensen Yeah, and baseball was the big deal during that time period. Wrestling  during the winter time. Sports took up a lot of our activities for both my  brother and I.  Little Thunder Were there any signs in your interest in business when you were young? Or  particularly banking?  Jensen We were definitely middle class. I started working at a fairly young age. I  started mowing lawns, earning my own money. Then, I started working  pretty well full time in the summers when I was sixteen. I think my first job  was with a hot tar roofing company, which certainly, I learned really quick  that I wanted to get an education. That was not     Little Thunder You didn   t want to be a laborer?  Jensen    No, that was not going to be my career move.  Little Thunder You were managing, managing your money pretty well?  Jensen Yes, yes. I actually had to pay pretty much my own way through school.  They, mom and dad, contributed I think fifty dollars a month toward my  room and board. The rest was on me. Thank goodness for Lew Wentz loans.  I had one of those for every semester to help me pay for my tuition. Then, I  worked nights at the O   Collegian, running the press, and getting the  O   Collegian newspaper out. I did that for four years.  Little Thunder That   s really interesting. Just to go back to high school for a minute, what  was your favorite subject?  6  Jensen It was definitely math. Some of the sciences but mostly math. Yeah.  Little Thunder Had your parents gone to college?  Jensen No, neither one of my parents went to college.  Little Thunder How did they encourage you to continue your education?  Jensen There just really wasn   t any option. It was just,    You   re going.    I think my  sister, certainly set the way for us, for my brother and I.  Little Thunder She was the first one?  Jensen She was the first one. She, I think, got most of the brains in the family, but  she has her doctorate degree in microbiology and teaches at University,  UMass  University of Massachusetts , in Amherst. Actually, in high school,  she finished fourth in the nation in the science fair. She was injecting   this  was back in the    60s   injecting white mice with cancer cells and then  dissecting them and showing the progression of cancer as a high school  senior.  Little Thunder Wow.  Jensen Very bright lady. She set the bar for my brother and I, which we never met,  but that   s okay.  Little Thunder Did she go to OSU for her undergrad?  Jensen No, she did not. She went to Kansas City, UMKC  University of Missouri-  Kanas City , for her undergraduate. She was at Oklahoma City University  for part of her graduate work. Then, at Harvard for some of the rest of the  graduate work.  Little Thunder How did you land at OSU?  Jensen My brother was at OSU before me. There just wasn   t any   I mean, that   s  where I was going.  Little Thunder You had visited him on campus     Jensen I had visited him a number of times and really enjoyed the campus. I  actually started my college career off at Connors Junior College  Warner,  Oklahoma , playing baseball. Realized that I wasn   t going to make a living,  playing baseball, and I better go get my education. So I transferred to  Oklahoma State.  7  Little Thunder What years were you there?  Jensen I started the second semester of 1974, would be. I was there    74,    75,    76,  and graduated in    77.  Little Thunder Three years.  Jensen Three-and-a-half. Actually, I graduated high school in    73. That fall  semester I played baseball at Connors and then transferred at break to  Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder Did you know from the start when you enrolled that you were going to major  in finance?  Jensen No, I did not. In fact, I was three years as an accounting major. My advisor  was Dr. Anderson, who was head of the Accounting Department for years  and years. I just decided I didn   t want to be an accountant. Really didn   t  want to sit for the CPA  certified public accountant exam  and do that work.  We talked about it. About the only thing I could do, without losing quite a  few hours, was transfer to a finance degree. I ended up taking eighteen hours  my senior year, both semesters. Mostly upper level finance classes because I  really wanted to get out in four years and get into the real world and maybe  make some money.  Little Thunder That   s quite a heavy load.  Jensen Yes     Little Thunder Who   s a professor or two that stood out for you?  Jensen You know, Anderson always did as my advisor. He was very easy to talk to,  and he   s probably the one that comes to mind the most.  Little Thunder What was the environment on campus outside of your program like? The  rest of the campus environment?  Jensen Much smaller than it is now. I think the enrollment was about 15,000,  sixteen, so it was certainly much smaller, much smaller group. It was a very  fun place to be. I think, even as a freshman, you were   you made friends  easy at Stillwater and Oklahoma State. You were very welcome in most  anything you did and it was just a fun place to be.  Little Thunder Where did you have most of your classes? What buildings?  Jensen They were all over. Obviously, most of my upper level classes were at the  business school. We went to (what was it) the Classroom Building, I think.  8  We were there for quite a few of those. But a lot of them were at the  business school. Most of my accounting classes were there. My business law  class were there, which was very interesting. I thoroughly did enjoy that. It   s  kind of like the movie, Paper Chase. I can   t remember what that teacher   s  name   I was trying to remember what his name was. I remember him being  an OU  University of Oklahoma  graduate. If you had not studied your  cases, you just did not go to his class because he invariably would pick on  you.  Little Thunder You didn   t want to be embarrassed. Where did you live?  Jensen Oh gosh, let   s see. Freshman year, I lived at Kerr Drummond, actually, Kerr.  Then I moved out into an apartment with four other guys, at an apartment  complex called Century 21. My junior year I lived with one other guy on  Husband Street in a small apartment there. Then, my senior year, we moved  on out by Century 21. It   s that apartment complex further out to the north. I  can   t recall the name of that.  Little Thunder Now, were your roommates also in accounting?  Jensen Nope. No.  Little Thunder You had met them in other classes?  Jensen Yeah. The three guys that I lived with my freshman year, we were all   we  kind of met at Kerr. One of the guys was from Bartlesville, which I knew  before, but the other two, one was from New Jersey and one was from  another town here in Oklahoma. Then, my second, my junior year, I lived  with a guy that I knew from high school in Bartlesville. My senior year I  worked with a guy that I worked with at the O   Collegian.  Little Thunder You mentioned that your parents would contribute fifty dollars (is that right)  a semester?  Jensen Yes.  Little Thunder You had saved some money but also had received a Wentz scholarship?  Jensen Yes.  Little Thunder Did you have to do any other kinds of work while you were a student?  Jensen I worked at the  Daily  O   Collegian.  Little Thunder The O   Colly, yes, I   m sorry.  9  Jensen Put the paper out. We worked every night from   usually went there about  seven, got out about midnight.  Little Thunder That   s a good chunk of time.  Jensen It was a good chunk of time. Yes     Little Thunder But you enjoyed it?  Jensen I guess you could say I enjoyed it. It was necessary.  Little Thunder It paid?  Jensen Yes, it helped pay my way through school, at least, the meals. I also worked  during the summer time in Bartlesville at the Bureau of Mines, which was  my summer job.  Little Thunder I see. Did you take your meals at Kerr? Did they have any programs?  Jensen Yes, I did.  Little Thunder Okay.  Jensen Yes, I did take my meals at Kerr when I lived there.  Little Thunder Then you were cooking for yourself?  Jensen Yes, and then it was slim and far between. I think I went in weighing about  180 and graduated weighing about 140.  Little Thunder How about transportation to and from campus when you were living off  campus?  Jensen I had a car. I think it was a    68 green Pontiac LeMans. It got me around.  Little Thunder How about dating? Was that a     Jensen I had a high school sweetheart that actually is my wife now. We dated pretty  much through   she   s a year younger than I am, but pretty much   .  Little Thunder She went to OSU as well?  Jensen And she went to Oklahoma State, too. Yeah. There were some periods that it  was on and off during that time period, but ultimately, we ended up getting  married and have been so for thirty-seven years now.  10  Little Thunder Neat. What other types of activities or on campus organizations were you  involved with?  Jensen Really wasn   t a whole lot of time to do much else when I was working,  trying to go to school. I did participate in some of the intramural athletics.  We had a softball team that we called the Social Zeros. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Interesting name.  Jensen None of us were in a fraternity, we were all independents, so we just got the  name of the Social Zeros. We played football. We played the intramural  softball, but really, I didn   t have much time to do much else but go to  school     Little Thunder With the O   Colly job. How about as a spectator? Were you able to go to any  sporting events?  Jensen We did go to a lot of the football games. The wrestling matches were  something that, during that time, we used to stand in line to get into  Gallagher  Iba Arena  to watch a wrestling match.  Little Thunder Right.  Jensen For hours we were out there in line.  Little Thunder And your wife, girlfriend of the time, liked it as much as you did?  Jensen She did. Yes, she did.  Little Thunder Do you recall anything about any particular campus traditions?  Jensen No, really not too much. I remember streaking started my freshman year.  (Laughs)  Little Thunder Well, tell us about that.  Jensen Oh golly. I was staying in Kerr. Actually, I was not there. I was living on the  seventh floor. I was studying for a test. I think it was like Thursday before  spring break or something and started looking out the window because I  kept hearing this noise down there. I looked out the window and there were  thousands of people around the Kerr area. And there were streakers running  around. Yeah, it was pretty wild. I think that   s the year they threw the big     the steak place, down there on the corner. It   s not there anymore, but they  had the big cow out front.  Little Thunder Yes, yes.  11  Jensen I think the kids broke it loose and took it up to the Strip and threw it in Theta  Pond.  Little Thunder In Theta Pond. Right, right. That was an historic year.  Jensen Yes, that was my freshman year.  Little Thunder What was your favorite place on campus?  Jensen We used to go to the Gray Fox a lot after   I had a finance class with a  friend of mine from Bartlesville. He and I used to go over there and play  shuffleboard for hours before I had to go to work. I remember doing that. I  met a lot of people just over there in the backroom, playing shuffleboard.  Little Thunder How about the most popular place, maybe, to hang out with your date on  campus?  Jensen I   m not sure there was any one particular place that I would say would be  the best. There were a few dances that I remember we went to at the Student  Union. We went to a couple things, plays that were put on. Did that. I  remember we used to just walk across campus. We went out to Boomer  Lake a few times and walked around out there, particularly when the  weather got nice. I don   t know if I could say there was any one specific  place that we liked any better than any other. It was a fun time.  Little Thunder Right, right. Did you go home very often while you were in school?  Jensen Yeah, a little bit. We went home probably about once a month. Then, of  course, during the Christmas break and spring break, I went and worked.  Little Thunder Where you had your summer job. How about Homecoming? Do you have  any memories of Homecoming?  Jensen Wasn   t nearly as big back then as it is now, that   s for sure. (Laughter) Yeah,  it was not quite the event back in the early    70s that it is now. Football   we  were not real good during my time in school. No, I don   t have any great  memories about football games. Other than we got beat by OU every year,  but my senior year we did beat them in Norman  Oklahoma  that year.  Little Thunder Oh wow. Cause to celebrate there.  Jensen Yeah, it was a big celebration.  Little Thunder Did you go to that game?  12  Jensen Actually, that   s a funny story because I was headed there with my wife, had  tickets. We decided that, rather than going to the game   it was an afternoon  game   we would just go to the zoo instead. So we were     Little Thunder You missed the one time     Jensen Yeah. I went up to get a Coke at the concession stand and they had the game  on the radio. I don   t know, probably it was into the fourth quarter. We were  ahead, and substantially ahead, and it really looked like we were going to  win. I went back and got my wife and said,    We   re going back to Stillwater  because it looks like, believe it or not, we   re going to win.    We hit town  shortly after the football game ended. Policeman were out. Firetrucks were  out. Sirens were going. So, yeah, missed the game. I swore, at that time, I  would never miss another OU or OSU game until I saw us beat them. It took  twenty years. I went to every single game. It was finally a thirteen to nothing  game in Norman.  Little Thunder What year?  Jensen Oh golly. That   s the one year that the ex-Miami coach coached them. I don   t  remember exactly what year that was. It was at least twenty years from     Little Thunder I   ll look it up.  Jensen Yeah, you can look it up.  Little Thunder That   s a neat story. Thank you for telling us about that. Do you have any  special memories about the library or     Jensen Oh, yeah. Went over there all the time, particularly my freshman year. It  was difficult to study in the dorm, so I used to go to library. That   s where I  did most of my studying. When I moved out in the apartment, it was much  quieter. I usually was able to study there. But if I needed to do any research  or anything of that nature, it was always done at the library.  Little Thunder How about any special memories about the town of Stillwater itself other  than Gray Fox?  Jensen You know, no, I don   t have any special memories about the town, other than  again, it probably was one of the better time periods. I think most anybody  would say that. College is a really great time.  Little Thunder How about graduation day?  Jensen That was interesting. We did it on Lewis Field. I actually had the wrong  color tassel. They gave me the wrong colored tassel and they tried to line me  13  up with the people that were getting master   s degrees. I said,    No, I don   t  belong here. I   m supposed to be over there.    They finally got that  straightened out and got me the correct color tassel to wear, so I could  march in with the people that were getting their bachelor   s.  Little Thunder Were you and your wife engaged at that point or     Jensen No, not yet. We did not get engaged. Actually, after I graduated, I went back  to Bartlesville. Didn   t have a job at that point. Was working my summer job  again at the Bureau of Mines and was contemplating going into grad school  in the MBA program in economics when a friend of the family called me,  who worked at Home Savings and Loan in Bartlesville. Wanted to interview  me and offered me a job, so I accepted that. Shortly after that, we decided to  get married.  Little Thunder So that was your first banking job?  Jensen That was my first banking job, yes.  Little Thunder What was your job there?  Jensen I was a single-family mortgage lender.  Little Thunder Was it a good entr  e into     Jensen It was a start. Which I think, is the important thing, is to get a start. I did  meet one of the vice presidents there, named Buddy Loller, who in    78 came  down here to Claremore to this bank. Then, about three months, four months  after he came down here, he called me and asked me to come down. I  decided to go ahead and come down here.  Little Thunder What was your position when you came down?  Jensen Well, we were very, very small bank. The bank was originally opened in  1976, so it had only been open about three years. It opened with a  100,000  dollars pledged CD money. It was the old eight year, 8 percent CD. We  really didn   t have any free capital. We were paying 8 percent on the capital  we had. But when I came, the bank was  4 million in assets. They   d lost   96,000 of the  100,000, so they had  4,000 in debt. Today, we definitely  would not be here. We would have been closed. Back then, they gave you  quite a bit more leeway or latitude. The directors had to pledge another fifty  grand and we ended up participating in a Rogers County bond issue that  generated about a quarter of a million dollars for the bank. Then, in 1983,  we sold a million dollars    worth of stock and came out and built this  building in    83. Rocked along pretty good until about    89,    88,    89 with the  14  recession and the oil bust and real estate bust. The bank came very close to  failure during that period of time.  One good thing about that, is it gave me opportunity to be president of the  bank at thirty-four, which I was fairly young, but I think I was the only one  that they could find to take the job. It was a tough couple of years, but we  worked our way out of the issues. Formed a holding company and popped  enough money down into the bank to get us into capital compliance. From  that point forward, until 2011, when my partner and I decided to sell the  bank to BancFirst, we did very, very well.  Little Thunder What were some of the things you think distinguished you from other  banking services in the area or other banks?  Jensen Well, there   s not a lot of difference in banks. We all pretty much offer the  same product. I think what differentiates us during that period of time was  really the service that we provided to our customers. Banking is really a  relationship-driven industry. Creating those relationships is very important  to me and to the other officers of the bank.  Little Thunder I saw some pictures and read an article about your artwork. It   s very nice  and grounded in a sense of place. Claremore scenes, specifically. Many  Claremore scenes.  Jensen Yes.  Little Thunder What did you have to do with selecting it?  Jensen Well, not a lot, other than we hired a company gentleman and his wife out of  Oklahoma City   actually our marketing director for BancFirst is the one  that gave me their name. They came up and we said that we would like for  them to be mostly pictures about Claremore and Rogers County. I have five  offices. Three of them are actually in the city limits of Claremore. Then one  in Verdigris  Oklahoma  and one in Inola  Oklahoma . We wanted to  include the entire county, so probably 90 percent of the pictures are about  Claremore or about something in the county.  Little Thunder That was your idea?  Jensen Yes. We wanted to feature Claremore and Rogers County.  Little Thunder Right. How many employees?  Jensen I have about sixty employees at the five offices.  Little Thunder How did your background at OSU prepare you for your job?  15  Jensen I think it very much prepared me. The hard work, the dedication. Going  through the finance classes and the accounting classes. It really presented  me with, I think, an opportunity. That   s all you can ask and you just have to  take advantage of that when it presents itself.  Little Thunder Right. Right. What do you consider your biggest success at the bank?  Jensen I think, very definitely, the biggest success is   I mean, coming into a bank  with  4 million in assets, and  4,000 dollars in capital, it would be almost  unheard of for that financial institution to survive. Being able to fight  through that. There were times when we had to package up some home  loans that we made and take them over to the bank across the street and  borrow money, just so we could keep the doors open. But it was a different  time than it is now. The regulators, at the end, gave us time to be successful  and we were. Again, with the recession,    88,    89, and oil bust, the bank was  definitely on the list to be closed. We were part of what   s called the  Matchmaker program where we were supposed to, if a stronger bank came  with an offer to purchase us, we were supposed to accept that. We did have  an offer at one time and it was too low. I turned it down. Thought it was best  for the shareholders. The regulators were not very happy with me and pretty  well read me the riot act. Fortunately, the bank didn   t fail, and it survived. I  think taking the bank through those two situations, very difficult situations,  and surviving that are probably my two fondest memories.  Little Thunder Yes, a really challenging time. You   re also a member of the CIEAA, the  Claremore Industry Economic Authority Association?  Jensen Yeah, the CIEDA. The Claremore Industrial and Economic Development  Authority.  Little Thunder Oh, Development Association. I think I saw you were treasurer and  secretary at different times?  Jensen I have been at different times. I   ve actually been on that entity for, gosh,  almost twenty years.  Little Thunder Wow. I imagine one benefit is, again, relationship building.  Jensen It is.  Little Thunder Also possibly being able to help shape what happens in Claremore. Can you  talk a little bit about your work with the group?  Jensen Sure. The industrial authority is probably one of the   I think, one of the  most important associations that we have in Claremore. It helps to recruit  and bring in new businesses. Here over the past five or six years, the city of  16  Claremore has also asked us to take on the retail development in an attempt  to increase the sales tax, which is what funds any small town in, or any town  in Oklahoma, is sales tax generation. We work very closely with the City  Council and the City Manager here in Claremore and have for years. We  were originally funded by use tax and now we have a contract directly with  the city to perform these functions.  We have an industrial park in Claremore. That first industrial park is pretty  well full. There   s probably about 3,800 to 4,000 jobs out there. We acquired  another 100-acre tract and then another 150-acre tract. The 100-acre tract is  developed now. We   ve got one manufacturing company there and are  working on selling the land and bringing in other ones. We got a TIGER   Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery  grant to bring  in a railroad spur into that industrial park which was a huge deal for us. We  are really trying to be the engine that drives the workforce and the growth  for the city of Claremore. We actually commissioned a housing study here  last summer, just to be able to show developers and so forth, the need for  housing and the growth that is occurring in Claremore and Rogers County.  Little Thunder Main Street looks really good.  Jensen Yeah, Main Street looks good. It does.  Little Thunder How have you retained your ties with OSU and the Foundation and the   Spears  School of Business?  Jensen You know, probably the School of Business here recently more so, than over  the years, particularly with the new building coming out. They   ve reached  out and contacted me, and I   m sure, other alumni to be the Alumni Board of  Governors. I was fortunate to serve on that. Of course, I always go back for  the football games and the basketball games.  Little Thunder That   s great. I understand that you and your wife are dog lovers?  Jensen We are. We have a Lab rador  that is a therapy dog. She takes them around  to the children   s hospital, Saint Francis Children   s hospital, at least once a  month and sees the kids there. She also works with a couple of the schools,  grade schools, with kids that are having trouble reading. For some reason,  they seem to really enjoy reading to the dog.  Little Thunder It   s non-judgmental.  Jensen Yeah, I guess. We have another kind of mixed breed that she is working  with to train her to also be a service dog. Then, we have a mutt that   s  seventeen years old.  17  Little Thunder What should a visitor know, see, or experience here in Claremore?  Jensen Claremore   s just a really neat town. The Will Rogers memorial, I think, is  probably from a Visitor   s Bureau standpoint, one of the things that you  definitely, when you come to Claremore, you want to see. We also have the  gun museum which is the largest   we still tout it as the largest gun  collection in the world, and I think it is. We have Claremore Lake, which is  just a beautiful lake. We   re twenty minutes from Oologah Lake. Northeast  Oklahoma   s just a beautiful place, and particularly Claremore.  Little Thunder And you have two daughters?  Jensen I do.  Little Thunder Who attend OSU?  Jensen One of them graduated from Oklahoma State. She did get her degree in  Accounting and stayed in Accounting. She   s currently working at  Chesapeake     Little Thunder In Oklahoma City?  Jensen Yes, they live in Edmond  Oklahoma . The oldest daughter actually played  basketball at Winfield up in Kansas for four years. Undergraduate was from   Southwestern College in  Winfield. She was accepted into the OU PA   University of Oklahoma Physician Associate  School and is now a  practicing PA at Hillcrest in Tulsa.  Little Thunder Neat. Are people you know aware of your OSU connections?  Jensen Oh, absolutely. They always say I bleed Orange.  Little Thunder I know the receptionist was   .  Jensen Yes. I love Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder How did attending Oklahoma State and earning your degree impact your  personal life?  Jensen There   s no doubt, I never would have been able to start the career that I  started in the banking business without the degree from Oklahoma State. It   s  been a very rewarding career for me, both personally and financially. It  never would have happened without Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder What advice would you give students today?  18  Jensen It   s a foundation-building process for your ultimate career. You need to hit  the books. You need to study hard. You need to work at it because this  certainly will help you when you get out in the real world and start your  career.  Little Thunder Will you have any advice for faculty or administrators?  Jensen Be nice. No, I   m just kidding. (Laughter) I just think it   s teach the kids to  have a well-rounded education. They   re very important to the education and  to the future of our kids.  Little Thunder What do you think it is about Oklahoma State that sparks loyalty?  Jensen It   s just such a neat place and you make so many friends. There   s so many  fond memories. You   re at that age where you feel like you can do anything.  It   s just something about that university that I always call it God   s country  when I   m going back because I love Oklahoma State.  Little Thunder Is there anything that you would like to add that we didn   t cover today?  Jensen I can   t really think of anything.  Little Thunder Well, thank you very much.  Jensen Thank you.  -------  -------
