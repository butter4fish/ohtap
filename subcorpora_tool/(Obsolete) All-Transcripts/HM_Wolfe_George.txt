Story_ID: 636342
Speaker 1: And I want to ask five pa- People magazine-ish questions, just short answer.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: What is my favorite food?  Oh that's very interesting, I don't know, my favorite dumb food, which I eat when I, when I don't want to think is just grilled cheese, but it's not my favorite food, it's just like function.  And then I, you know, I like a moqueca, which is a Brazilian fish stew from Salvador, Bahia [Brazil]--that's probably my favorite food, but I haven't had it for such a long time.
Speaker 1: That is wonderful.  See you're unique in the collection. We haven't had that I don't think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I want to know your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color when I was growing up was red and I wanted my bedroom painted red, but my, my parents [Anna Lindsey Wolfe and Costello Wolfe]--my mother refused to paint my bedroom red, but then she made red drapes; so that was the compromise.  I don't know, she thought the red would be too much.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is probably fall.  I, I, I, you know, I think it's probably, I don't know it shifts sometime, but I think my favorite time of year is fall and my other favorite time of the year is sort of when--particularly in New York City [New York, New York] when you look around and you feel that spring is here and it's moving, and it's winter, it's moving out of winter into spring and you--hopefully in theory it's not going to go back being cold.  So there is just that sense of, of nature is possible again.
Speaker 1: And favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: I don't have one right now strangely enough, it used to be Brazil; it used to be Salvador, Bahia.  I like, I like Barcelona [Spain] a lot, but I think I'm in flux.  I think I'm--the Brazil is that and now it's not and so I don't know, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I think I say amazing a lot.  I think I say amazing a lot, yeah, I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker 1: George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe], I'd like to take you first about your family background, which you, you know have written and spoken about, but can we start with your mother--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and her name and you know, what you know about her side of the family can we start there?
Speaker 2: Sure, my, my mother's name is Anna Mary Wolfe, she was born Anna Mary Lindsey [Anna Lindsey Wolfe].  She was a schoolteacher and an educator and a principal and at one point--I haven't got the exact date, (audio disturbance) but at one point she stopped everything--I have a feeling it was probably in her mid--I don't know, I really have to figure it out--mid to late fifties she stopped everything and went back and got her doctorate at Miami University in Ohio [Oxford, Ohio] and was obsessed with school and education; loved school.  Her, her mother was--my grandmother, was a woman named Addie Parker, but she was married twice, so her name was Addie Parker Lindsey President [Addie Parker President] and she was, was--is--a very, very, very important, important major energy in my life.  She ferociously, aggressively protected me (laughter) from everybody and everything in the world.  She was--it's, it's interesting, on, I've seen on certain censuses she is listed as mulatto, which is fascinating to me and, and, and oh my god my mind is completely blanking on who, what her mother's name was.  It's, oh god I just said this is why you know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So Annie President [sic.], you knew her mother then, you met her mother (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I know about the mother.  I mean I, you know, I, it's, it's very interesting 'cause on--I used, I used to know all this history and, and, and her husband and you know this--and her husband was a man named John Lindsey and so, and I grew up with his brother's--which is a great uncle of mine named Walter Lindsey, who was an incredibly outrageous character and personality and then there are, there are, there are, there are various stories that, that while John Lindsey was, was the father of, of my mother, there is, there is another person named John Spencer [ph.] who was actually her, her blood father and, and on that side of the family--and I, and I spent a lot of time dealing with my mother claiming and owning that--that side of the family can trace their--is, has a very, very, very complicated history just in the sense that I--they, they trace it back that he was the first black certified teacher that, that, someone in that line of the family was the first black certified teacher in Kentucky and --
Speaker 1: Lindsey, on the Lindsey side?
Speaker 2: No, on the Spencer side, Spencer side.
Speaker 1: On the Spencer side.
Speaker 2: And interestingly enough that he had a--and but then he came to Frankfort, Kentucky and he saw a German shoemaker making shoes and he realized that he could make more money making shoes than he could teaching, so then he became a boot maker and then at one point, I believe during World War I [WWI] he got a contract with the government then he made a lot of money, and then the Depression [Great Depression] happened and the stock market crashed and he lost a lot of money; so that aspect, so that side of the family is really very interesting.
Story_ID: 636344
Speaker 1: Also, there were--and also I have this very striking picture of, of, of my [maternal] grandmother and her three sisters and they are incredibly very striking, very handsome women, not beautiful women, they're, they're handsome and very commanding women and they were the Parker girls and, and her father was the man named Andrew Parker and at one point (laughter) my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] was showing me pictures and I went, "Who's this white man?"  (Laughter) And she would say, "Oh that's Andrew Parker, who was my mother's--" who was my, who was my grandmother's father and, and you know, so I, so, so we, so, so the stories weave in and out on, on my mother's side of the family.  My, on my father's [Costello Wolfe] side it's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can I ask one question--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --on your mother's side, so there's Annie Lindsey--
Speaker 1: Addie.
Speaker 2: Addie?  Oh--
Speaker 1: Addie, Addie Parker.
Speaker 2: --Addie Parker, okay, Addie Parker was your grand--
Speaker 1: Mother [Wolfe's maternal grandmother, Addie Parker President].
Speaker 2: --mother and she was, was she a Spencer [ph.] or was she a--
Speaker 1: She was a Lindsey.
Speaker 2: --she was a Lindsey.  Now who's Spencer [John Spencer (ph.)]?
Speaker 1: The Spencer, there it's, there's, I'm saying it's one of those complicated family things.
Speaker 2: I see.  Okay, now were they--so their roots are, are deep in, in, in Kentucky?
Speaker 1: Very much so, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Very--
Speaker 2: You don't know how they came to be there, or they had just been there?
Speaker 1: I, I don't--I--there are--that's, you know, 'cause I'm editing now, so my brain isn't--because I know all, I know these stories in a very specific way, but I don't have, they're not in my brain right now; but no, very, very much so they have been in, you know that they, they've been in Frankfort [Kentucky] for a very long time.  And what's interesting, so I grew up around, I grew up around my mother's side of the family so I knew all those stories, and then recently I've come to know all these stories about my father's side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So can you talk about--now your mother was born 1921--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --(audio disturbance) as I remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 636345
Speaker 1: Let's talk about, (audio disturbance) give your father and his year of birth and what you know about him?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, I don't--oh my god, I don't know what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's okay, don't worry, you don't have to worry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can figure out my father--
Speaker 1: But, but your middle name is--
Speaker 2: Costello, which is his name, and, and his father's name was George, so I'm named after my, my grandfather, George Wolfe.  George, what's very interesting, so my father's name is Costello Wolfe, he had a twin sister named Estella [Estella Wolfe] who, who was incredibly very fussy, very, very, very, very, very consuming personality and he and my--he, she, and my father fought all the time--they're twins.  They just fought all the time.  His, his sister--he has another sister, Florence [Florence Wolfe], who just turned ninety-eight and lives in St. Louis [Missouri] and rides the bus and he has another sister [Norma Wolfe] who's ninety-five who mows her own lawn in Providence, Kentucky and so they're like--it's so, it's really, really fascinating and their, their father, on, on, on and their father was a man named, was George Wolfe and George Wolfe's parents were named Sam Wolfe and Mary Wolfe.  Mary Wolfe died when she was 106.  She was--there's an article written about her 'cause she, it ended up--I believe she was living in Muncie, Indiana at the time, which is where they ended up, which is a fascinating story and she remembers as a slave serving Jefferson Davis and she also when you--she, there are stories of that her--and she was born into slavery as was Sam Wolfe and then George Wolfe had a brother named Sullivan Wolfe.  Sullivan Wolfe in 1930, I believe he was thirty-eight years old was evidently incredibly smart, very charismatic and a leader.  They lived in Providence, Kentucky, which was a coal mining area and so he tried to organize a union, a black and white mine--an integrated union.  Some men knocked on his door on a Saturday at four A.M., told him to come with them and they were black and white men, interestingly enough, as the story goes, and he said, "I need to go put on my shoes," and they said, "You're not going anywhere," and when he turned to put on his shoes they gunned him down.  Now the thing that's really--and this was in Providence, Kentucky.  The thing that's really fascinating about this--well, one of the things--everything about it is fascinating, what's really fascinating is the paper the next day or whatever day, the next day the paper came out, it said, the headline was "Negro Leader Slain."  The fact that they used Negro and the fact that they used leader is astonishing, is astonishing.  His wife [Lillie Gray Wolfe] was watching from the window, she had a coal oil lamp--these are certain, very details that Florence in particular has told me and my father told some of this, this is a huge story and, and it was reported--so that happened like on a Saturday, the newspaper came out and I have a copy of it somewhere, the newspaper came out, there was never a trial, nothing ever came from it and that was that and his wife took her three children and left town.  This is just an astonish- there's so many aspects of that story, I mean he could sing, he was so smart, he was just like this, this heroic figure and he was, and he was gunned down at the age of thirty-eight.
Story_ID: 636346
Speaker 1: My father's mother was a woman named Eura Wolfe [Eura Hale Wolfe], now, this is being, this is being debated by, (laughter) by the white descendants, but in theory and someone has done and I haven't verified on it, but a relative, has, has been doing all this research. In 1580 a sixteen year old boy left Yorkshire, England, came to the City of Baltimore [Maryland] as an indentured servant and his great-great-great-great-great-great-grand (makes sounds) daughter I think ten-whatever was a woman named Florence Cross [Florence Cross Hale].  She married a man, I believe his name was Thomas Hale who was a mulatto, they had eleven or thirteen children, one of whom was my grandmother, my father's mother, Eura Wolfe and they have like, something like 160 areas of land in Christian County, Kentucky, (laughter) so it's just sort of really fascinating.  I saw that he was a solider in the Union Army during the Civil War and so there's just all these extraordinary, fascinating things.  One of his, one of his sons was the first policeman in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and they all lived around Hopkinsville, Kentucky and a lot of them are still there.  Because of, because of Sullivan Wolfe and his union organizing, after, after he was killed none of the other Wolfe--none of the other men with the name Wolfe could get employed in the mines, which is where they were working.  My grandfather was also--George Wolfe was also a carpenter; so he then moved his wife Eura, once my father [Costello Wolfe], my father had grown up, away to, to Muncie, Indiana, so, and so, so, so, so therefore growing up I knew them from living in Muncie, Indiana and we would occasionally go to Providence [Kentucky], which is where he was from, but only recently have I gotten in touch with the people from her side of the family, you know, who grew up around Hopkinsville, Kentucky.  So it's just this very, very, very, very interesting mix of people, then, I mean I, there are these, it's, it's so interesting like, like--and I have tons of, I have tons of photos of various people in the family, there's also there's a story of, of someone also on that side of the family who was in the Union Army doing--and I, this is a story that's really upsetting and I want to find, try and find out more details about it, this, the, the last time--I believe it was one of, I'm trying to think it would have been, it would have been George Wolfe or one of Sam Wolfe's brothers, yeah, the last time he was seen he was in the middle of, of battle screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs (laughter) while this battle was, was going on around him, so there's these really fascinating, just incredible people who, who, who are, you know, who, who just, who they got, who they like, surround me in, in a, in a, in a very interesting way.  Also one of the quite interesting stories about--and these are stories, so certain things are documented, but these are stories, one of the interesting things about Mary Wolfe is the story that she was sold twice and, and when you look at a picture of her, which is what's really fascinating, she, she looks, she looks like an Eastern European woman, and so her--there was this story that her mother knocked a white man down and was promptly sold and so in my mind, in my storytelling invention, I am (unclear) that the white man was in fact the father, was the, was the plantation owner and was the father of Mary Wolfe, and she knocked him down 'cause there was--I think some- you know, somebody was being sold and she ended up being sold.
Story_ID: 636347
Speaker 1: You know what I mean, so these--I love these stories, they're just frag- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So how are you--where are these stories coming from, George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe]?
Speaker 1: These stories are coming from various people in my, in my family.
Speaker 2: Family, so, and, and have you talked at length with the aunts, that you're, you know, the one that's ninety--?
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight [Wolfe's paternal aunt, Florence Wolfe], I'm going, I'm going to go see, I'm going--she, she told me a lot of the stories, but, the, the thing which was, which was interesting is my father [Costello Wolfe] would tell these stories about Sullivan Wolfe and there was, and it was this incredible fervor that he would have and they shot him down like a dog and his wife [Lillie Gray Wolfe] and children were standing there, the wife was holding a coal oil lamp.  There is such incredibly, unbelievable specific details because you could tell these stories were passed on and on and on.  And then the one, at different times I've, I've had you know--oh, there was, there was another sister named Amanda [ph.] who got along with nobody and then there was this and then (makes sounds), so I have these fragments of personalities of all the people, so that therefore there's, instead of just the facts it's also I'm just beginning to get, I was beginning to get the details about who the personalities were, you know and--
Speaker 2: But you also have some of the photos, which is in- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah I do, yeah I do, yeah I do, I have, I have the photos.  I have this study photo of my, of--I remember, of my, of, of, of a lot of people on my grandmother's side.  It's so, it's so, what's so very interesting to me is (audio disturbance) a lot on my mother's [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] side of the family, the figures that were incredibly striking and--I wouldn't have used the word, dominant, but, very, the women were very forceful and very commanding.  On my father's side of the family the men were very forceful and very dominant, so a lot of the stories, I mean, you know, you know, my, my, my grandmother, my father's mother, Eura [Eura Hale Wolfe], they--her nickname was Lamb you know, because she was so gentle and once again, she, and, and once again you see and you go inside and, and then history is so extraordinarily complicated because you--there's a--I remember she, she was, she had, her skin was white, she had green eyes, she had you know, long hair and, and, and, and then George [Wolfe's paternal grandfather, George Wolfe], George was, was, was, was very dark and very handsome and you can see all--and he had a lot of Native American, he was Cherokee, so there's a lot of Cherokee on both si- on my mother's and my father's side of the family, so  this is this weird combination, so it's--it's not weird, it's very common--Cherokee and then the Native American, and then white and then the blacks, so it's just fascinating to just, knowing these various stories.  My, my [maternal] grandmother was a, my, my Grandmother Addie, Addie Parker Lindsey President [Addie Parker President] was a very forceful, very, very forceful figure, and a very commanding one and, and at, at one point--anytime anybody did anything to me, said anything to me, did anything to me, she would either, either confront the people or call them up and say, "You know, you did this, or your child did this, so something did this and you, and you can't do that to my baby," boom.  So it was, so I grew up with this like, this forceful person who--and, and in, in many respects I often say, I say I think the reason why my, my creativity is so vivid and it's so intimate with me because I didn't have to evolve any weapons of survival for a very long time because I had my grandmother.  She was such a protective force in, in, in, in my life.  And I remember at one point--and she lived down the street from us [in Frankfort, Kentucky], I remember very specifically at one point I moved in with her and, and I, at one point I, years later I, I, I said to my, I said to my mother, I went, "Why did I move in?  Was there something going on in the house, or some comp- ," (gesture)?  She said, "No, she, she just wanted you to live with her," and so, and so I did and so we would, and so I, I lived, I lived down there with her and I'd wake up and she'd make breakfast and then when it'd come time for school I'd go down (laughter) and I'd knock on my--door and then we'd go to school.
Story_ID: 636348
Speaker 1: I also went to this school--this Rosenwald school [Rosenwald Laboratory School].  Even--it has the name of Rosenwald, but in--I think it started out as a Rosenwald school, but it wasn't.  It was connected to Kentucky, Kentucky State University, which is where just about everybody in my family went.  I went for a short period and then I left 'cause I was--
Speaker 2: So it was a lab sch- it was a laboratory school right?
Speaker 1: School, yes, yeah--
Speaker 2: It was a combination of Rosenwald roots and then laboratory school?
Speaker 1: Part laboratory school at Kentucky State College [Frankfort, Kentucky], which later became Kentucky State University--and--
Speaker 2: So I want to ask, did, so, what, what, what, what is street--or, well, first of all, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 1: My earliest-earliest memory is I can't walk--it's very specific--I can't walk, but I can sit up and I'm sitting on a yellow rug, this is very specific to me.  My parents [Anna Lindsey Wolfe and Costello Wolfe] claim, said I didn't remember this: "No it's too specific."  I'm sitting on a yellow rug, my [paternal] grandfather, George Wolfe builds up blocks and then I knock them down and he applauds (laughter) which I think informs so much of my aesthetic and my relationship.  That is literally--and that is, it's, it's burned into my memory and I guess, I know I can't walk, but I can sit.  I'm perfectly, you know what I mean, I don't need anybody but I'm sitting there and he'd build the blocks and I knock them down and he'd cheer, he'd cheer and, and, and, and, and there, and at one point he--because at one point we, we, on, on our house--and he was a carpenter.  Actually I have a chest that he built in my house.  And at one point a tree fell in our house and my parents took--and, and so he came in there and helped and so they used that to build you know, a second story into the house and he came in--so he spent a certain amount of time around my family which I'm sure when it happened, but that is it, in a very--that is my first memory.
Speaker 2: Well you would have been, you would have been less than one year old at that point really 'cause you're walking.
Speaker 1: I'm not walking yet (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And usually--I know, usually people, kids are walking, not always but when they're one--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --so that, that's--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 636349
Speaker 1: Can you tell me the address of your house?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: 216 Blanton Street (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let's talk about your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: It's, it's, it's now a parking lot for this unbelievably hideous building that's a state building that I think is the department of transportation that is so incredibly ugly and doesn't belong in Frankfort [Kentucky], which has a lot of Victorian houses and small houses.  So I grew up 216, it was 216 Blanton and there was a, and there was, I remember there was this woman named Ms. Blanton [ph.], I have no idea if she was--what relationship she had to the street, but I think she taught piano music.  And then there was--our house was here and but it was some kind of a duplex because my parents [Anna Lindsey Wolfe and Costello Wolfe] rented out the other side and then my [maternal] grandmother [Addie Parker President] lived down the street also on Blanton Street and then there was some woman named Ms. Jenny [ph.] who hated kids but anytime people were playing and the ball went into the yard they would send me because I was cute and she would give me back the ball.  There was this woman across the street from us named Ms. Samuels [ph.], and I remember she would tell--I didn't, I don't remember the jokes, but she would tell kind of like dirty, bawdy jokes to my mother and I didn't know it specifically at the time, but I could tell by the nature of the laughter that's what it was.  There were, and then next door on one side of my grandmother's house there--or not, I don't know if it was next door--these, some of these people I'd really have to write about (laughter).  There was, there were these people named Angela [ph.] and Memphis [ph.] and Memphis I remember was dark-skinned, and Angela was, I think she had very light skin, I have almost a very specific image of her, and they would drink and then they would curse each other out and my grandmother would go off on them anytime they would do that and then next door to my grandmother on the other side was a woman--it's the South so everybody's Ms. Helen, Ms. Thelma, Ms. This--was Ms. Helen [ph.] and she would sit on the--I really, I really--she would sit, she had, must have had polio or something, but she would sit on the front porch, of her front porch with a red rubber ball and just squeeze it, that's what she did and she had--and my grandmother was perpetually at war with her (laughter), which was, perpetually at war with this kid named Sonny who would, who would like, it's like you know, my, my--he would, who would like, he just would torture her and she--he drove her completely, totally crazy.  And then I remember at one point it, it, it, it was just this neighborhood 'cause I remember at one point (laughter) I don't know if it's funny, these stories are very funny to me, is my mother's sewing machine was stolen and, and my mother--and nobody knew who it was but, every, everybody knew it was Sonny (laughter) and so my mother said, called Sonny and said, "I want you to come see me," and he said--he went to see her and she said, "Sonny, did you steal, steal my sewing machine?" She said, "Tell me the truth, tell me the truth."  He said, he said, "Yes ma'am."  She said, "Why did you steal it?"  And then he said, "Well because I wanted to fix my shirt," which was of course a lie.  So my mother said, "Well if you bring me back my sewing machine, anytime you need it, someone to sew your shirt I will do it."  (Laughter) So he brought her back the sewing machine.  Months later we're having dinner and somebody knocks on the door and it's Sonny Hayes [ph.] with a torn shirt wanting my mother to sew it for him, (laughter) which is just sort of like--
Story_ID: 636350
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I remember my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe]--at one point I--my, my mother came to--when, when I was twelve, she came to N- to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] to get some advanced degree work and I came with her, so I spent the summer when I was twelve at the peak of the hippie movement living off of Washington Square Park [New York, New York] with my mother and I, we were going--I went to go, we went to see I think 'Hello, Dolly!' [Michael Stewart] with, with Pearl Bailey or something like that and I went to--during the day I went to a ticket place and I purchased--and my mother gave me the money to buy the two tickets and then I came back and I had the change, it, it was another Broadway 'cause it was two tickets and they were front mezzanine and they were, maybe two tickets were sixteen dollars or something like that, or I think it was something like that and I brought back four dollars and my mother said, "No, I gave you, I gave you a fifty dollar bill," and so I said, "Oh, oh," what- whatever, whatever, so my mother goes to a ticket place in New York City [New York, New York], which was on 23rd [Street] or 34th Street, or wherever it was and she talks to the man and said, "You made a mistake, you (makes sounds) he gave you this, you didn't give him the correct change," and I remember saying specifically, he said, "Lady, I would buy the Brooklyn Bridge from you," and he gave her the correct change.
Speaker 2: So she was pretty amazing, your mother?
Speaker 1: I think there was an authentic, I think my mother had this authentic sweetness to her, an incredible earnestness and a sweetness and I, once again I think that because my [maternal] grandmother [Addie Parker President] was such a formidable force that that sweetness was just there and I think and also I, and, and, and, and I think a, a, I, I, I, I don't think like lying or--lying or deception was just a part of her makeup.  I don't, I don't--it just, it existed.  I remember very specifically I--there all, all these stories and it another thing that was just interesting, when I was growing up I wasn't--I, n- all the stories that were told to me were stories of empowerment, of people existing in defiance of, not, there were no victim stories and I remember very specifically my mother graduated from college [Kentucky State College for Negroes; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] and she was in downtown Frankfort and she was, walked into a store and some woman said to her--a white woman who was, owned the store, or some, some relationship to the store and said, "And it's very good that you now have your degree, but you should come be my maid," and my grandmother went into the store and she, you know, and she did, and she did the very--and I gave her--she gave her a piece of her mind and there were always these stories of (gesture) no, no, no, no, you know.  I remember a, a dog chased me and, and, and--when I was playing in some field and a dog chased me and I ran and told (laughter) my grandmother and then she knocked on the woman's door and said, "You need to lock up this dog otherwise I'm going to call the police and have you locked up."  And, and there was just this, there was a kind of you know, this was Frankfort, Kentucky.  I was born--first six years of my life were segregated, but there was just a kind of, no, you're not going to, you're not going to do that to mine.

Speaker 1: And I think growing up in that neighborhood where every- where the personality of, of everybody was--I remember there was some woman named--I think her name was--I called her Ms. Pie [ph.] and then at one point I went--I said to my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe]--I started writing a play about them--I went, "Was she a lesbian?"  (Laughter) I mean, and my mother said, "Yes!"  In which, I didn't, don't know that, how I knew that.  I don't know how I knew that because then there was also--so, so, so, so there was this street, there was this, so, so there was, there was this street and then there was Blanton Street and then Blanton Street led to this area that was then called--which was an all-black area which is where, which is where you know--it was called Crawl [Frankfort, Kentucky] and it was, and there and it, it was you know, it was your, you know, it was your, it was a typical southern neighborhood just in the sense that there were, you know, there was the restaurant, the Tigers Inn [Tiger Inn], there was, you know--Jackson Robb had the funeral home, you know what I mean, so it was just this complicated net- network and it was on the lower, it, it was, it was on the lower part of, of, of, of, of, of Frankfort [Kentucky] and so anytime there was a, there was a, there, there, there, there, the Kentucky River would practically overflow and then it would flood this whole area and so the, so Crawl or the Bottom as it was sometimes called would just be completely and totally invaded and Blanton Street was up slightly, progressed up to higher land and so that I remember when that happened our cousins came and lived with us and so there are just all these stories.  And interestingly enough there, at one point I, I, I, I wrote some preface to some book about Kentucky ['Community Memories: A Glimpse of African American Life in Frankfort, Kentucky'], but at one point there was this playground right there and then there was a building that the Salvation Army had there and I later found out that on that site was a slave auction, was a, a slaveholding thing, so it was very, you, when you look at the geography of how, of towns it's so interesting because then my street started this area and it goes on down to--you know what I mean?  And then there, you know, and then you periodically read stories about one point during a voting (unclear) there was a, there was a shootout and all the black people were on one side of the street with guns shooting back at the white people, it's just really, it's just fascinating all these stories and, and, and they're just, they're, they're ingrained into the fabric of the place and they get buried over time because people stop telling them, but you're around them and you're hearing these stories you know.  My, you know--the Spencer side [ph.] of my family also, I, I met these people late in life, they just--once again they grew up in this same town and it's just, it was just this incredibly you know, I describe it, it was a town too small to be cut in the middle, that was cut in the middle by a river and then sometimes--so you have a black university there [Kentucky State College; Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky] and then you have this, you know, this, this small little town that was segregated and, and, and but then you had black businesses and then you know, so it was this very--and it's the state capital, you know, so it's just this very, very complicated you know, network that I grew up around and, and, but, and, and then there was the First Baptist Church [Frankfort, Kentucky] we would go, you know.  So I grew up in this incredibly intricate, complicated, woven neighborhood and I felt this incredible--I, I remember I felt this incredible sense of Negro responsibility.  It was ing- you know, it was ingrained, I think it was just part of that generation that was being groomed to integrate and so there was this extraordinary sense that every single thing that you did was reflective of the race and that's both--it gives you this incredible sense of, of responsibility, and it's also incredibly suffocating.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: It's extraordinarily suffocating.
Story_ID: 636352
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about, well two things which you were, you were, you were doing a beautiful job of describing your neighborhood.  I would like to ask you about two more senses, one is sounds--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and the other smells--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know if I can take you back to your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I have an incredible--I don't, nothing sticks out to me just in terms of an incredible sense of smell, it was just very fas- it doesn't, it just sort of doesn't.  It really, I mean I, I search, but there, nothing, I don't, nothing, nothing even goes like zing to my--it just sort of doesn't exist.  Sounds were, you--sounds were, sounds were, were, were, were very, I mean there, it's, it's so interesting there--sounds are very specific.  I, you know there, I remember at one point in, in, in the First Baptist Church [Frankfort, Kentucky] there was the young adult choir, there was the, and there was the senior ladies choir there and they, they would always sing without that (makes sound) that, that very high pitch sound and I remember very specifically one time, I was in Salvador, Bahia [Brazil] with a friend of mine, George Callilee [ph.] and there was this old black church that was built by former slaves right in the Pelourinho district and these women started to sing and it was the exact same sound and I was just going, "What the hell is that?"  It was just very, very fascinating, so I remember those sounds.  I also remember, it's, it's very interesting, at one point I went back 'cause--KET [Kentucky Educational Television], which was the you know, the education (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, PBS [Public Broadcasting Service].
Speaker 2: --PBS of, of, in, in Kentucky that did a documentary about me ['Signature: George C. Wolfe'] and they had a bunch of my cousins there and, and people were talking and they were--and, and one of the things they said to me, they said, "When you were little you didn't--and people would play games or play house, you would give people lines to say," and I remember at one point, interestingly enough I remember at one point I went to--I was visiting Wolfe family in Muncie, Kentucky [sic. Muncie, Indiana], which is where a lot of them moved to and they said to me--I don't remember this at all, that there was some TV program that was on TV--on and, and at one point they said, "Well did you like that George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe]?"  And I went and pointed to the credits and said, "My name's going to be there."  (Laughter) I don't remember any of this, but, "My name's going to be there."  It's not like, "I'm going to be in it"; "My name's going to be there."
Story_ID: 636353
Speaker 1: You do talk about even dissecting, you know, I think you talked about at the age of five was it?  A show, was that, or did I read that right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I remember, yes, I remember very specific- yeah.  So at Rosenwald school [Rosenwald Laboratory School, Frankfort, Kentucky], Rosenwald was a very--Rosenwald school, it was a very--the principal of the school was this woman named Minnie J. Hitch, who was very, very severe, but very smart and I realized in many respects was, was probably the first director, (laughter) first theater director I ever knew without knowing it and, and we would put on a Christmas play and at the end of the year we'd put on a school closing play, probably it was like maybe ninety people, mainly kids, maybe who were in eight grades at Rosenwald and we'd put on these enormous plays and she would always direct them and I--there was a part of my brain that was sort of exhilarated by that time.  I mean I, as early as I can remember I was obsessed with theater, which is an odd thing because, I mean obsessed with it, very, very, I mean (audio disturbance) from the very, from the very beginning before I could remember it.  I remember at one point I got--I was given for Christmas a, a showboat, a showboat that had little scenery pieces that you could put in there and I would just, and I was in heaven with this because there was a backdrop and there were legs and then there were middle ground and foreground, there was a whole stage there and it, it, which, which was, it, it was very, very interesting, so it's you know, I was obsessed, I was obsessed, I was obsessed with, with, with theater from the very beginning but at Rosenwald, she would put on these plays and, and, and, and I remember just--you, I, I remember studying them.  I remember when I went, came to New York [New York] and I saw 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] at the State Theater [New York State Theater; David H. Koch Theater], I remember s- I was studying it, I realized--(background noise) and a lot of times I would sit there and watch TV and I would sit on the ground and I was studying the rhythms.
Story_ID: 636354
Speaker 1: --So it was, and, and it was very much, and it was, it was a school that it was y- once again, everything, you are special, you are smart, you are amazing you are special, you are smart (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At the Rosenwald school?
Speaker 1: Right.  At the Rosenwald school [Rosenwald Laboratory School, Frankfort, Kentucky].
Speaker 2: So I, I want to ask a couple questions, so how many, what, your, your siblings in birth order, 'cause this is the other thing I find, you're a middle child right?
Speaker 1: Well, ye- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is--and so can you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes and no; well, I, I have an older brother, William Wolfe, who is eight years older than me, who--I had a kidney transplant about fifteen years ago, he gave me his kidney.
Speaker 2: Which was ama-
Speaker 1: Amazing.  My sister is Elayne [Elayne Wolfe McNeil] and she's seven years older; and then there is me, George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe], and then I had a younger brother named Elliott [Elliott Wolfe (ph.)], who died when he was fourteen months.  And then I had an adopted younger brother named Stephen [Stephen Wolfe (ph.)] who died when he was thirty-three from you know, from alcohol and abuse, body abuse.  But you know, so I was and, and, and Elliott was seven years younger than me and, and Stephen was ten years younger than me and so, so I was, so I was the baby for a long time (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well you were the baby and the thing is, what I find interesting is that you've got the George Costello, you know, William didn't get that--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --and I--you know and that's what I, I just, that strikes me you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --as--
Speaker 1: Well it's also very--what's interesting is my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] stopped--I have this extraordinary picture of the first class that my mother taught.  It's the, it's the contact sheet for the first class my mother taught when she first started teaching at Georgetown [Georgetown High School, Georgetown, Kentucky], it was a--it's like a Georgetown--and, and there's this picture of her all the way across the top and she--my mother is very, very, very, very, very, very pretty and then there are multiple pictures of like each of the kids and so it's just this sheet; it's an extraordinary photograph, but my mother stopped teaching to give birth to my older brother and sister, then she went back to work at a library when she was--Mero Street Library [Mero Street Branch Library, Frankfort, Kentucky] when she was pregnant with me and then she went back to teaching at Rosenwald and she was a teacher there and I went to school there, whereas my older brother and sister continued to go to school at Mayo-Underwood [Mayo-Underwood School, Frankfort, Kentucky], which was the segregated black school at the time.
Story_ID: 636355
Speaker 1: So you have this protective [maternal] grandmother [Addie Parker President]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, who allows you to be--I'm just wondering when you're young, you know besides this, can you describe yourself as a young person, can you do that for me?  I know you had this--but how would you describe yourself?
Speaker 2: I think that I was extraordinarily sensitive.  I would, I was sensitive.  I would even say, I would use the word delicate, I, that, and unbelievably willful, so (laughter), so there was this incredibly bizarre--so, I mean delicate, if you looked at me wrong you could hurt my feelings so easily.  I would cry.  I would cry, I would cry so easily and I would grow up with that, "Boy's don't cry, boy's don't cry," I mean I would cry.  I would just cry so easily.  I would get overwhelmed so easily, but at the same time it was like if, you know how kids love to be thrown up in the air, no, we're not doing that, no, kids turned upside down, no, no.  And I realized that in many respects the, the, the fragility of my emotional base was me manifesting my will before I fully knew how to, you know, because I was very, very willful.  I wouldn't--if I didn't want to do it, I was not gonna do it.  I was not gonna do it.  I, I, you know, I had, I stuttered very heavily when I was growing up and I remember very specifically--so I went to Rosenwald school [Rosenwald Laboratory School, Frankfort, Kentucky] and I stuttered, but they also knew I was very, very smart, then I go to Frankfort High School [Frankfort, Kentucky], which was a predominantly white high school where my older brother [William Wolfe] and sister [Elayne Wolfe McNeil] went and I think they had a very traumatic time 'cause they went around the time where it first became integrated and I got there and, and, and because I am so sensitive and because I'm so aware of--because I was, and I was unbelievably spoiled too, (laughter) I was unbelievably spoiled and, and I ran with it.  I wasn't just like, oh no don't spoil me, I went, oh no, spoil me.  So when I went to Frankfort High School and because I stuttered and also I was just sort of freaked out by being in this environment that seemed eighty times more barbaric than anything I'd been in, I was overwhelmed, and so I, I didn't know this at the--and, and so I just knew that people had decided I was stupid--the teachers there, that administrators had decided I was stupid.  I, I sensed it without anybody saying and I, and I, and I was there, so as my freshman year it was just incredibly awkward and my sophomore year was incredibly awkward then the end of my sophomore year my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] went away to Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] to begin work on her doctorate and I went along with her.  The, the thing which is very interesting, every single time my mother was redefining herself she brought me along.  When she went back to work she brought me along.  When she came to N- when she came to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] she brought me along.  When she went--I, I think it's you know, that every single time she was reasserting herself she brought me along was, which is a very interesting thing, so I went to Miami University with her and I joined this theater program and, and I spent the whole summer there and it gave me an incredible sense of command that I hadn't figured out.  I knew I had it but I hadn't figured it out, so then I came back and I went like, oh, you know, oh, theater, oh, I'm funny and so I remember coming back--even my first, first year it, I remember going, you all are dismissing me, I know you're dismissing me, by the time I leave this school I'm going to run it (laughter).  I remember thinking, going back to that delicate thing and that willful thing, but I just made a vow to myself--it wasn't even a vow, it was more so, oh no, this is going to happen, by the time I leave here I will run it and by and, and so by, so by being funny, that's when I start to gain popularity and power and then by the time I left I was editor of the school newspaper.  I was editor of the Sunday edition of the school newspaper.  I was a drum major.  I was a terrible drum major.  I was head of the literary magazine club.  I was this, I was this, I was this, I, you know what I mean, so I just became boom, I will not be dismissed in anyway shape or form.  And then I later found out that every single thing that I sensed was, was affirmed because they--the guidance counselor called my mother over, and they wanted to put me in some remedial classes, and she went, "You're crazy; no, that's not happening."
Story_ID: 636356
Speaker 1: George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe], so let me, so what y- how old are you, or what grade are you when, when you go and she's at Miami University [Oxford, Ohio] and you take--is that the freshman (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm, I'm, I'm, it's the end of my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Sophomore year.  Now the other thing the Rosenwald school [Rosenwald Laboratory School, Frankfort, Kentucky], does it go to --
Speaker 2: To eighth grade--
Speaker 1: Oh so it went to the eighth grade.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, so then your ninth, your ninth grade is the beginning of high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and that's--okay 'cause a lot of times were, around that time tenth grade was.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And it was traumatic, that was a very, like, where am I, what is this, oh my god, it just feel--'cause I had gone from such a protective environment.  I'd been, there'd been--you know my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] taught there.  I--you know, you know my first, my first grade--and each teacher taught three, three grades which is fascinating and, and you know, my first teacher was Ms. Bowkler [ph.] who was like, who would, who, who, who nurtured my art, my art, my creative--I'd stay--you know my mother--it also, it was that, it was that time where those, those teachers would teach and then school would end what, at 2, 2:30.  My mother would leave there five o'clock and all the teachers stayed there and planned and did work and so while they were standing there doing all their work, preparing for the next day I'd just sit around and, and play and you know, and, and work in ceramics or draw or read or whatever and then afterwards my, my, my mother--or sometimes right after school my mother and Ms. Bowkler would go around in the surrounding areas of Frankfort [Kentucky] buying antiques from (laughter) from, from, from, from poor white people in the area who had, who, who didn't know, had know idea what they were, or they'd buy them from antique places, so they'd go--so I'd be just in the back seat with them while they would go antiquing, antique shopping all around the surrounding areas of Frankfort.
Speaker 1: So where is your father [Costello Wolfe] in all of this?
Speaker 2: My father's working all the time.
Speaker 1: He's working--
Speaker 2: He's working.
Speaker 1: --all the time--
Speaker 2: He's working all the time.
Speaker 1: --and he is working in the, in the--
Speaker 2: State government.
Speaker 1: --the state government.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So this is--you're clearly middle class--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean, I mean in the black commu- you're--?
Speaker 2: I think, I think, it, I think it--we started out as--I think my family started out as, as lower middle class and kept on (gesture)--
Speaker 1: Going up.
Speaker 2: --going.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Cough) And then so, so you, so you have this integrated experience, 'cause you're born nineteen fifty--
Speaker 2: Four [1954].
Speaker 1: --four [1954].  Okay, so which you know is--so, so you're having this, so how is integration?  So you're saying your sister [Elayne Wolfe McNeil] and brother [William Wolfe] have a much more difficult--they go to Frankfort [Frankfort High School, Frankfort, Kentucky], but they have a much more difficult time?
Speaker 2: Time, yeah, 'cause it was much more brutal--
Speaker 1: So it's much more brutal, so they are a part of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You come in now--how many blacks are at Frankfort, do you know?
Speaker 2: Oh it's in, it's a number of them, I mean it's, it's like it's, you think about it, it's probably I would say, probably it would be 30 percent, there'd be 30 percent, maybe 30 percent and I mean there is a black entrance into the school, self imposed, and then a white entrance, you know and it's just all of that, it's all that you know, it's all of that legacies you know, it's just all these legacies that are, that are interesting and compelling and suffocating all at the exact same time.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And I, but also I know--it's so very interesting because also I--just before I start high school I spent a summer in New York City [New York, New York], so I'm like going, oh, oh, oh (laughter) let me get through this (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because that's when your mother is going--
Speaker 2: My mother's going to NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  I'm--oh, got it, got it, got it, got it, got it, you know, so that, the, the idea of leaving, the idea of not belonging, the idea of know- I grew up knowing I didn't belong there.  I, it was very clear to me, it was internal: I don't belong here.  I don't fit in.
Story_ID: 636357
Speaker 1: Now where is church playing a role?  Can I just ask that, is it the Baptist church you--?
Speaker 2: First Baptist Church [Frankfort, Kentucky], yes--
Speaker 1: So you grew up Baptist?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so, songs and tradition, I mean 'cause Baptist is very, it's fire and brimstone.  Was it a fire--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't fire and brimstone, no there--
Speaker 1: It was a more proper Baptist church?
Speaker 2: Well, it was like, it, it, the, the preacher was this guy named Reverend K.L. Moore [Kidd Leon Moore, Jr.] who was very smart, who had a subscription to The New Yorker (laughter), who had a subscription to The New Yorker.  But there's an aspect of, of the church that requires--it's--that, that requires a kind of you know, on Communion Sunday you know, certain people would shout and do that sort of stuff, but it's, it's, once again, frank- it's not just one thing, it's, it's not just one thing.  There is, and I there is, there is the, there's, I think there is a Methodist church and then there's another church, I don't, I have no idea, you know, I don't remember--
Speaker 1: Congregational or Episcopalian?
Speaker 2: Eh, I don't know whether it was Episcopalian, no, there, but I think it was probably you know Methodist and then, I don't know, I have no idea, but they, they were there, but, but, so, so this town had you know, but this town and this church, you, so you had professional people and you had, you know what I mean, so it, there was not one dominant black energy, you know, very specifically, so it was a mixture of things.  So you know, and, and at one point you know, after one, after I go back, after I go back, you know, after I've achieved you know, visibility in my career I remember Reverend Moore saying you know, you know, "So Skip Gates, talk to me about blah, blah blah, and (makes sounds)," so there are these, it's these people, there are these people, there is this incredibly--there is a degree of like sort of the sophistication and then there's a degree of ruralness and then there's a degree of black people in the town together and (gesture), and you know, and so it's a mixture, so it wasn't like, you know, so it wasn't like--you know.
Story_ID: 636358
Speaker 1: Can I ask one other question about your high school [Frankfort High School, Frankfort, Kentucky].  So you do, you're president of all the- you know, you do very well in high school in that way.  Are there other blacks that are doing as well as you, in that, are you, I mean, or active, as active you know with all the organizations?
Speaker 2: I think they're active.  I'm the most, I'm, I'm probably the most, I think I'm probably--yeah because, yeah--there's a guy named Jimmy Dixon [ph.] who plays all these sports and is very smart and this--yeah, it's, it's going on, I think I was probably the most active because I was probably in some respects the most overtly ambitious and, and, yeah, so I'm not doing it in isolation.
Speaker 1: So when did you turn from stutterer to having--
Speaker 2: Theater.
Speaker 1: --a gift.  So theater was it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause there's rhythm, and I knew the rhythm, but also I realized the panic comes from my brain working faster than my mouth, and but also there's this, you know, I'm left handed and I think there's some studies, I don't know if they are true or not, that when the parents try to switch your hand and your, you've already decided what you want to do and somebody's trying to make you do right hand, I don't know, you know what I mean, so all of this.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember at one point, I remember I used to, it's, it's so interesting you, you own these things--I remember one point I used to--and then after I graduated from high school I went to Pomona College [Claremont, California] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well you went to Frank- you went to--
Speaker 2: Kentucky State [Kentucky State University, Frankfort, Kentucky], the one--
Speaker 1: Kentucky State--
Speaker 2: --and I went like get me the hell out of here because I'd grown up around that world.
Speaker 1: So, but that's what I'm wondering, so, how, so when you get to the point that you are think- you know, it's anticipated that you're going to college, do you apply to any pla- how (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's a foregone conclusion that I'm supposed to go there and then, it's a foregone conclusion because everybody--and so then I go and I'm there and I went get the hell out of here, get me the hell out of here.  And so I applied to Denison [Denison University, Granville, Ohio].  I applied to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois].  I applied to Sarah Lawrence [Sarah Lawrence College, Bronxville, New York] and I applied to--and then my younger brother, Stephen [Stephen Wolfe (ph.)] is, is living with my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] in Oxford, Ohio while she's getting her doctorate and I--he's in a production of 'Oliver!' [Lionel Bart] and I go to see it and I take him to the cast party and I meet a woman there named Jenevrah--and I think her name is Jenevrah Hornbooth [ph.], I think that was her name and she says, "Oh, I go to Pomona, and they have a really great theater program."  And I went, "Oh, well I'd love to know about it."  And so her mother on the campus of Miami University in Oxford, Ohio tracks her--my mother down, I don't know how she did it, and there was--she found--and my mother brings back from Miami a piece of cardboard with the address for the admissions office, and so I apply and I, I got accepted to, to those four places.  Each of those other places it's cold and it snows (laughter), and Pomona it does not, so I went, I'm tired of the cold weather.  So I'm out of there, I'm out of there, I can't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause they, they all have good theater departments.
Speaker 2: They all have, they all have good theater departments, but it's also, it's just sort of like, I don't, I, I, you, there's, I don't, I don't, I have ambitions and I have, and I have, I know I can't you know, and also southern black people are so conservative and they're so reactionary and I'm just like, I, I, I've been out--so I grew up around that university, so there was no escaping, it was just more of what I already knew and it wasn't--didn't find it particularly interesting.
Story_ID: 636359
Speaker 1: You then go to Pomona [Pomona College].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It is '73 [1973], is it '73 [1973] or '74 [1974] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell me what you find there, George [HistoryMaker George C. Wolfe], what, okay, let m- let's talk about that?
Speaker 2: What do I find?  I find--
Speaker 1: 'Cause how large is Pomona at that--is it--?
Speaker 2: Pomona, how large--well it's five schools there [Claremont, California].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's Pomona; Scripps [Scripps College]; Claremont Men's [Claremont Men's College], which is now Claremont McKenna [Claremont McKenna College]; Pitzer [Pitzer College]; and Harvey Mudd [Harvey Mudd College].  And Pomona is the largest, I want to say five thousand people, I'm not sure if that's correct, and there's a very active theater program and there are all these incredibly, really interesting, really smart black people who are attending all the five schools, who are there and they're really smart, they're really fascinating.  And my mother [Anna Lindsey Wolfe] (laughter), my mother later told me she was, she was sort of scared and horrified that I was going to go to Pomona and cease to be black (laughter), that wasn't her language.  And instead it became a certain kind of politically, a political you know--it activated something inside of me because there, you know, it, it was there, it, it was there--.  I always, I always feel I'm just at the, I'm at the end of something and the beginning of something, so I got to experience the end of segregation and the beginning of integration, and then I'm getting at college and I'm there just at the end of student unrest and the beginning of complacency (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
