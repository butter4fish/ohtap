 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Also joining me today as an interviewer is Tanya Finchum.  Today is Monday, April 20, 2009 and we   re in Lincoln County,  Oklahoma on the Duggan Homestead interviewing Regina Duggan. This  interview is being conducted as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Families Oral History Project. Thank you for joining us today.  You   re welcome.  Well Mrs. Duggan lets begin by learning     It   s Ms.  Ms.? Oh, sorry.  My brother   s been married four times. He   s been married enough for the  both of us  (Laughter).  Glad we got that on the record. Ms. Duggan, do you mind telling us a  little bit about your family and how you came to acquire this land?  My grandfather homesteaded it in the Land Run of 1891. In fact, for  many years the tree that he slept under the first night was standing.  Shortly after my dad   s 90th birthday a strong wind came. It was dead for  quite a while and blew it down so it no longer exists except as a pile of  rubble. But my grandfather owned it until, I believe, around the 1940s.  My grandparents and his family lived here until 1917 and then they  moved to Shawnee. My father   s oldest sister lived here approximately a  year. She died, I believe, of Typhoid Fever in 1918 and then they moved  off and his next oldest sister moved in with her family and they stayed  here until, probably, the 1940s.  5  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Then my grandfather decided it would be best to go ahead and sell the  place. And, of course, he had always wanted to keep it in the family  name and so Daddy showed an interest in it and he contacted his other  family members to ask them if they were interested in it. By then they  had all went their own ways and had their own places and things. So  instead of actually buying this place from his dad, he bought them a  house in Shawnee, a smaller home that they were needing to move into,  and paid for that. In paying for that, he got the deed for this property. He  rented it out for several years and then his older brother moved into this  house, I would say probably in the early 1950s, and started    baching     here and taking care of the cattle and the farm and everything. In a sense  after my grandfather died in 1959, Daddy   s older brother, Uncle Sam     not the official Uncle Sam, the other one   kind of became my  grandfather. He was 13 years older than my dad. We would come down  here almost every Saturday. We lived in Shawnee; I was born in  Shawnee. So we   d come down here on Saturday and always bring him  something to eat and everything.  Then when he passed away in    66, it was a decision either we were  going to have to rent the place out, possibly sell it or move down here.  And so I decided to go ahead and move down here. I   ve never regretted  it. I   ve loved it. I went to school here for two years, graduated from here  and then went on. Sorry to say I didn   t go to OSU, I went to East Central  but (laughter) I did graduate from there and then I lived in Shawnee for a  short while. And then I moved back here in    83. I worked for the  Southwestern Bell Telephone and when they closed the office there, I  didn   t want to transfer any place other than Shawnee and my parents  were getting up in years, and so I just decided to move down here. I  added on to their house. After they passed away, it was deeded over to  me. I   m just proud to say it   s been in our family for over 115 years and  it   s really only had officially four owners so that   s not too bad. And just  three generations.  Originally when your family participated in the run, where were they  living?  It   s my belief that they were living over by Keokuk Falls. It   s just a little  bit south of Prague between here and the interstate, I-40. Now I don   t  know how long they lived there. Like I   d said before, I wish I   d just  been able to sit my dad down because he could tell the stories, you  know. Or even some of the older people even if I   d been able to get it on  audio tape. But as in most cases, you don   t think of things like that until  it   s already over with and too late. But they moved here I believe right  after the Run. His second oldest sister was born just within a week or so  after the Land Run in 1891. My grandfather was originally born in  Tennessee. He came here   they lived in Missouri for a short time. My  6  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  grandmother was from Kansas, so I assume they met somewhere around  Ava, Missouri and then they came here to Oklahoma. I guess it was just  for the free land and everything. I do have the deed that Teddy  Roosevelt signed that my grandfather received in 1901. In fact I think  there   s a copy of it over there. I   ve got the original at the house. But in  1991, we had the 100th anniversary of the place here and that   s when I  officially decided to call it the Duggan Homestead. We had a big  celebration and I decided to open up the house and have everyone come.  It was really exciting so now I   m trying to do it every five years to try to  keep the family going although there   s not that many Duggans around  anymore.  Did it have a name before it was officially named?  No, no. Just the farm. We   re going to the farm.  And how many original acres?  The original was 160. But since then my dad bought 80 from his older  brother. There was 80 acres to the east of this, he purchased that. And  then when my uncle was living here, we purchased what we called the  south 80, another 80 acres. So all total right now, there   s around 314  acres.  Wow, that   s a lot.  Yeah. It would have been a little more than that but my dad deeded some  land over to my nephew, who lives down the road.  Well tell me a little bit about the original structures. I know we   re in one  right now.  Right. Well as far as I know, the two front rooms were the original  house that was built here on the property. I always thought it was built  right here but when I received a picture from my cousin, it stated on the  back that this was a picture taken I believe it was in like 1897 or  something like that prior to its move to its present location. And that   s  something I never even thought to ask my dad about. But I think the  house was originally a little bit to the north of here, then it was moved  up here and I would assume probably the reason it was moved maybe it  was near our water source. So it was moved here and then of course the  original barn still exists on the property and then we have a smokehouse  out back here that is probably close to 100 years old as well. At the time,  none of them qualified for the Centennial Structures because they were  covered. It wasn   t as it existed 100 years ago. Each of the barns, we had  put tin on them. Well if we hadn   t had, it probably wouldn   t have  7  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  preserved, it would have fallen down. And then, of course, the house is  covered with the siding too, so it wasn   t original.  And the windmill as well?  The windmill probably came about, I would say in   probably in the  1930s or    40s. It might have been a little earlier than that. But when we  first moved here, we didn   t have indoor plumbing and I   ve used that  pump many times to pump water and bring it in the house. (Laughter) It  never failed, Mother would wake me up in the morning and say we need  to wash. The wind would be blowing very strong, and as soon as she  would say    wash    the wind would completely die down. So I   d have to  sit out there and pump buckets upon buckets of water so we could get  the clothes washed.  Well as a little girl, tell me about your remembrances of the farm and  what you would do?  Well it was just an old playhouse. Like I said my uncle lived here and  we   d come down every Saturday. A lot of times I   d go out here south of  the house. The trees there and in my own mind I would make my own  house, like the four trees there, that would be the living room, this would  be the kitchen, you know. And of course, we had horses back then.  When I was probably ten or eleven years old, I had a horse that I more or  less considered my own. And I wanted to ride it. Of course Daddy would  be out working, working in the fields or working the cattle or something  like that and finally he told me,    When you can saddle the horse by  yourself, you can ride by yourself.     I still to this day cannot imagine how I was able to do it. I mean I tied  the horse up and climbed up on a box and picked it up   I still have the  saddle I used. The horse was extremely gentle and everything. But I  threw the saddle on and I got it tightened. And when I went over there  he said,    Well you saddled it, you can ride it.    That was my Saturday  outings from then on after. I mean, I always came out and rode the horse  and went across the creek. We have a creek called Deer Creek going  through our property and in the summer when it was really extremely  dry, I would get on the horse and I would ride down in the bottom bed of  the creek from one end of the property to the other, and I always  imagined myself as being in the Grand Canyon because it was real  straight on one side and high up on the other. Of course nothing near as  huge as the Grand Canyon. But it was still exciting to be able to do it. Or  a lot of times I would take a book to read and I   d go out and get a shade  tree and loosen the saddle and let the horse graze, and I   d lay down  under the tree for a while and then come back to the house. That   s one  thing I regret. I lost my horse last year. I hadn   t ridden in quite a while,  8  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  but I just miss having a horse on the place. It just doesn   t seem right  without a horse.  Did you have many family chores that you had to do?  Really, Uncle Sam did most of the chores when I was growing up. Now  after we moved down here, of course, I had to feed the chickens and  gather the eggs and maybe help pick vegetables, and things like that, out  of the garden and all. But mostly Mother and Daddy seemed to do most  of it. But I guess they spoiled me since I was kind of more or less the  only child. I have an older brother but he was gone into the Air Force  when I was five, so I was the only child for a long time.  So in the early days what were the primary sources of income? Did you  have a lot of cattle?  Crops and things?  Yes.  I was looking over the questionnaire that you sent me and I really don   t  know. I   d almost have to ask my cousin to see. I know in my lifetime  Daddy had grown wheat and even had a combine. They may have grown  cotton but I   m not sure. I remember Daddy talking about cotton but I  think that may have been after they moved to Shawnee. But I know they  usually had cattle and I know they had hogs when they were younger,  because like I said they had the smokehouse to smoke meat and  everything in. I think they were fairly self-sufficient on the farm back in  the early 1900s because I know they had a milk cow too because that   s  one of the stories that Daddy loved to tell. When they moved from  Prague to Shawnee they milked the cow before they left, and my  grandmother had put the milk in the back of the covered wagon and by  the time they got to Shawnee, it had turned into butter. She didn   t even  have to churn it because the roads were so rough   That   s pretty good. So nowadays, you have 314 acres, what do you do  on this acreage?  Well mainly just raise cattle. Just recently I   ve started to try to go into a  butcher beef business. In other words, each year save out about two or  three of the calves and creep feed them and feed them out. And then I  have a guy that comes and takes it. And then I sell it as hanging weight.  It brings in a little bit more income than if I had them just come in and  pick up the cows and sell them at the market and everything. And I think  it serves a good purpose because I can assure them there   s no hormones,  they   re all naturally fed. If they want to come out and look at them, they  9  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  can come out and look at them and everything. And they   re all well  loved because like I said, I name all my cows so they know who they  are. The only thing is the ones that I do keep, I usually change their  name into a beef name, like last year I had one calf that I had named  Tubby but he turned into T-Bone. And then whatever the S was, I had  him to Sirloin and Quarter Pounder. (Laughter)  That   s love.  That   s true.  Do you have hired help that assists?  Well I have the Mennonites from over in Paden; they come and bail my  hay for me, so it   s just more or less contract labor. But that   s one way  I   ve learned to save money on the farm. If you can do it yourself, you do  it yourself before you try and get anybody else to help you.  Wow.  So it   s amazing, during this ice storm in January I had one cow that was  getting ready to have her first calf and it was that first day of the horrific  ice storm at five o   clock in the evening and of course they were already  saying on the news don   t get on the roads and everything. And this cow  was getting ready to have her calf. Luckily I had my pull chains and I  thought maybe I can pull it. And I still do not know how I pulled it out  in that snow, but I pulled the calf. And then two days later I had another  one and I pulled it too   Wow.  Yeah.  So describe a typical day on the farm. What do you do? How early do  you get up?  Oh well, I   m mainly a night person. I usually stay up reading or  something late at night. Usually go to bed around 11:00 or 11:30. Most  of the time I get up around 7:00 or 7:30. Right now, I don   t have to go  out to do many chores. But like in the winter time I have to go out and  put feed out for the calves. And then of course if I see   since I bale big  bales of hay I have to see if the hay is ready to be fed so I can get the  tractor out and put the hay out for the cows and everything. Of course in  the wintertime is usually when my calving season is so then I have to go  around and check the cows and make sure none of them are getting  ready to have a baby. But I   ve already had 22 this year with 10 more to  10  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  go. Yeah. But I   ve got a big break because my last one was just born in  February, so I don   t know why these are later, but I was glad for it, I  needed a little break.  Lots of work.  Yes, yes. And like I said, there   s always something to do around on the  farm. And if you don   t get it done one day, it   s going to be there the next  because nobody else is going to do it. But you just have to prioritize and  then a lot of times when I   m needed somewhere else, I have a friend that  needs some help so I have to go help her. And then I   ve got a girlfriend  who I feel like is a sister who lives in the City and I try to go up there at  least once a month to help her husband out as much as I can. So it   s  busy. There   s something new everyday. Like yesterday I thought, well I  don   t have anything to do, but I went out and the cows were hungry so I  had to feed them.  Now equipment on the farm has sure changed over the years. A lot of the  farms we visit we   ll notice a lot of old equipment sitting around. Do you  have any out here?  Yes.  Can you describe that for me?  Well one of them is an old drill that my dad bought and had used for  quite a while. But I think eventually I   m just going to turn it into some  sort of planter. And then the other oldest thing that I have out there is a  manure spreader that my cousin   s husband just put together from   I  don   t know exactly how he did it. He, to me, must have been a genius to  figure out how to do it. But anyway, he built it and it   s got wooden sides  and everything. But old things, I still have my dad   s tractor that he  bought brand new. It   s a 1964 Minneapolis Moline and every time I get  on it   I can close my eyes and see my dad riding on it. So when I get on  it, I feel like I   m either sitting on his lap or he   s sitting on mine. So I feel  like I   m real close to him at that time. Daddy even still plowed with his  horse. We had one horse that he had fixed with a harness. And when we  needed our garden plowed and everything, he had an old plow that you  could hook up to the horse and we used to plow the garden with that  because he said the tractor was too big to maneuver in there and he said  he could maneuver the horse a lot better. It   s changed a lot.  How old were you when you first learned how to drive a tractor?  You know really and truly Daddy wouldn   t even let me on the tractor.  He was real bad at explaining how to do it. When he started getting up in  11  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  years and wasn   t able to get on the tractor then I just really had to learn  more or less by trial and error. This was probably 10 to 15 years ago. I   d  been on the tractor maybe sitting on his lap and everything when I was  younger. But as far as actually driving it myself I was quite a few years  up.  Can you talk a little bit about what holidays were like?  Well of course like I said I didn   t move out here until I was almost 16,  so holidays were in Shawnee. But especially birthdays, my Uncle Sam,  his birthday was in September like mine so we would celebrate. This  was the kitchen we would celebrate it in, I guess because it was the  biggest room in the house and closest to the food because I can  remember   from memory and also from several pictures I have   a big  table with food spread all over it and the whole family gathered together  to sit down and eat and everything. It was a lot of fun.  Do you have a favorite recipe or dish?  Well, Mother never wrote it down, but my favorite is her chicken  dressing. She makes it more as a casserole type deal because she puts a  lot of chicken in it or turkey or whichever meat we have. And several  years before she passed away, I finally told her, I said,    Now Mother,  I   m going to watch you. I   m going to try and write down everything.    So  I   ve made it several times since she   s passed away. It usually turns out  pretty close to hers, but I think that was about the best. I   m more of a  vegetable and a meat and potatoes person than I am too much on  desserts, although I love to make desserts too but I shouldn   t eat as  many   What about home remedies?  None that I can remember, although I think maybe last year I should  have learned a little bit better. I was weed-eating over here along the  road and I ran into a hornets    nest. I   ve later found out that with a hornet  or a wasp sting that you can take like a copper penny and put on it. Now  whether that works or not I don   t know but I have a feeling if I ever get  out there again, I   m going to have a penny handy. Because it really     they stung all over my ear and my whole side   my ear was swollen.  One ear was almost twice the size of the other one for almost a week.  But no, I don   t really remember any home remedies other than that one I  read on the internet.  When you were younger did you participate in 4-H or FFA?  No. No. If they would have had FFA available to girls when I went to  12  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  school, I probably would have. But at that time, it was only FHA and I  said I don   t want to be a homemaker, I want to be a farmer. So since  they didn   t, I didn   t participate. I don   t remember if they had 4-H here in  Prague when I moved here. So no, I didn   t. I wish I would have been  able to.  You described for us riding your horse through the creek bed. What  other things would you do for fun on the farm?  In the summer time we   d make homemade ice cream and my  responsibility was once they put the ice and everything on top to sit on  top of it. And then of course I   d reach down and get some of that ice  that   s got all that salt all over it. And then we used to have a big long  bench over here toward the east of the house and we   d buy ice cold  watermelons and slice them and sit up on that bench. Each one of us  would see how far we could spit the watermelon seeds in a contest.  (Laughter) So between watermelons and ice cream it worked out pretty  good in the summertime.  If you had a smokehouse, did you say you had hogs?  Well that was when my grandparents were living. Daddy and Uncle  Sam, I think they did have a few hogs, but we didn   t smoke them  ourselves. We   d take them to the locker plant and have them taken care  of there.  Did you have a cellar?  The cellar was dug out out there. But it was getting really dangerous  after several years and so Daddy just caved it in because he was afraid it  would fall in. In fact the last time I think I remember going down there  with my mother   we stored some of our canned goods down there. We  were going down the steps and I looked on the wall and there was a  humongous centipede on the wall and I completely froze. I grabbed a  hold of my mother and I couldn   t move and Mother couldn   t move me  either. I think she finally shook me to get me out of there and I said,    I  don   t want to go down there again     Cause it was   sorry to say it was  orange and black, I can still remember. But that was East Central   s  colors, too. We have a storm shelter over there at the new house too, but  it retains a lot of water and then when Mother and Daddy got up in years  it would have been too dangerous for them to go down the steps. So if  there   s tornadoes or something I have a little linen closet that I pull  everything out and I just go in there and hopefully I   m away from the  windows and in the center part of the house. And then of course I have  to have all my dogs in there with me, too.  13  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  No close calls with tornadoes through the years?  No, no, no. My closest call was earlier this year. I was visiting my friend  in the City when that tornado hit up around Edmond. I had crossed NW  150th and Pennsylvania about 30 minutes ahead of when that tornado  passed over. I kept looking in the back and around   I mean it was  looking all dark and everything. I had a radio on and they said you need  to seek cover and everything and I thought well all these other people  are going, I want to keep going and get home. When I got to the Lincoln  County line, I thought oh I   m home now. There wasn   t a drop of rain  here. Didn   t have any problems. The sun was already out when I got into  town here. But no. Now Mother and Daddy had a close call with  tornadoes back in the   I think it was    70 or    71 when a horrific tornado  hit here in Prague but it mainly hit south of town. Their electricity and  things were out. But that   s when I was in college so I wasn   t here for  that. But it was terrifying to hear about it and not be able to get a hold of  them either.  Well speaking of cellars it makes me think of canning. Did your mom do  a lot of canning?  Yes, she did. We canned green beans and then of course she canned  pickles and tomatoes and pickled beets. I don   t care to use the pressure  canner so if I have any extra green beans, I usually just freeze them now.  But I still can a few pickles and pickled beets. My niece by marriage,  she just loves pickled beets, so if I have any extras I know what to give  her.  Now I noticed when we were talking about the structures, that you said a  lot of them have been reinforced through the years.  Right.  Can you talk about some of your efforts to preserve the buildings and the  structures?  Most of it was done by my parents as far as preservation was considered.  They put the siding around this house to keep the wood intact. And then  of course Daddy covered the log barn down there. And of course since  then I   ve just had it spray painted to protect the metal on it as well. But  that   s about all the perseveration that   s been done on them.  So tell me a little bit about the barn. What do you use it for? And what  did your dad use it for?  Well, I think when it was first built it was probably built to house maybe  14  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  the milk cow and a place to milk the cow and then for their mules and  horses and things. It has a hay shed with a hay loft in it. Since then,  when my uncle was living here he raised goats and sheep, that   s where  he milked his goats down there. Of course, had a lot of barn cats and as  usual when he was milking the goat, the cat would come and he   d squirt  the milk trying to get it in the cat   s mouth, to get a direct hit. But since  then a lot of the heifers that I would keep for cows later, after they   re  weaned, that   s where I   d put them to feed them, up until about three or  four years ago. That was the sole place they went to be fed and  everything. It   s still useable although it does need to be cleaned out.  And where do you feed them now?  In my new barn. A couple of years ago my nephew came down and he  decided to build me a new barn. And since the last one was built in the     60s I figured it was about time to get a new barn.  Approximately how big?  It   s 50 X 60, all metal. I still can   t believe my nephew more or less built  it all himself, just with the help of two of his sons and a big wench. He  would   and of course he did the welding. He   d put the braces up and  the tresses up and get them up in place and then get up there and weld  them. But anyway, it   s really nice. I buy square bales of hay from a  cousin and because he brings the hay out on a semi truck he insisted that  the doors had to be at least 14 feet high and at least 14 feet wide. So we  went with that. He wasn   t too happy when I went with the overhead door  because he preferred the ones that open up. The overhead door is much  handier and he was able to get his semi through last time, so it   s no  problem.  Well tell me about some of the other current structures. I know we   ve  spoke a lot about the old structures, but describe the current structures.  Right now   well there   s a total of four barns. The old barn, then there   s  two other barns. One was built probably in the late    50s and the other  one was built in the    60s. The one that was built in the    50s, I think,  Daddy had planned on using it as a place to store because that   s when he  had wheat and he had a combine and he wanted to keep it out of the  weather during the winter months and things. Then later on we used it to  store hay and there were feeders on either side to feed the cows in the  winter, when we needed to. In the mid-60s they built another barn and  that was after he bought his brand new tractor. And, of course, then he  wanted a new barn to put his tractor in  So it   s mainly just been for  storing the tractor and his tools and right now there   s just a lot of junk  and the excess metal from my metal roof and different things left over  15  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  from my barn.  The second oldest barn is a tile barn. It was made out of red tile, or part  of it was. It was built in the early    50s and it was specifically built as a  hay barn with feeders on the side and then they even had cement  granaries so he could store his wheat in there. Then back in the early     60s he would take old hay to a mill here in town and they would grind it  and make grind feed because Daddy would keep some of his cows until  they were probably 20 years old and they didn   t have any teeth. But if  we could ground feed they were perfectly happy because they could eat  that, you know. So anyway, he would bring the feed back to town. He  would put that ground feed, store it in those granaries and things.  Then of course the new barn, and then there   s two other sheds. One that  was probably a chicken house back in the    40s but several years ago I  had a cement floor put into it and now that   s where I house my mowers  and tillers and my small equipment. And then my daddy built a granary  also because he finally found out that a cement floor really wasn   t good  for wheat because the moisture collects around it. So he built all wood as  a place to store his wheat. Well that didn   t go over too big because then  there were cracks in it. The wheat fell through the cracks and the mice  could get in. Now it   s more or less a place just to feed my cats. I think  right now I have two wild cats. I guess you   d call them feral cats. But I  just put feed out there and then there   s a little hole that they go in. But  the dogs can   t go in to eat, so they have their feed.  When he was doing the wheat, where would you have to take it to  market?  He mainly just used it for his own purposes. I don   t think he really ever  sold any of it. He just put it up. And then I think he probably took it in  with the hay to have it ground for that ground feed to put the wheat and  the hay and the molasses and things together.  And the cattle, how did they get to market?  My daddy had a cattle rack. After my uncle passed away, he would haul  them as best he could usually to as close a market as possible. There  were some times that he would take them to the City or he would hire  someone. And then of course right now what I do, I sell mine over in  Bristow. I just give them a call the day I want them picked up and they  come and pick them up that Friday and then they sell Saturday. So I  don   t have to have any worry with that.  No moving them from pasture to pasture too much then.  16  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  No. And they are fairly easy to get from pasture to pasture because they  know me and all I have to do is whistle and they   ll all come to my call.  If I   m going somewhere, they go with me because they think I   m going  to open a pasture or something.  How many are we talking about?  Right now I   ve got 61 head.  Wow.  And that   s really more than I   d like to have, but of course a lot of them  are calves that I   ll be selling in the next month or so. And then there   s  about four or five older cows that I think I   m going to have to sell too.  If you keep one until their 20s, then what?  Well right now I don   t keep mine probably   well I   ve got one or two of  them now that are 12 and I   ll probably sell them, because each year  when I have the vet come out and work the cows, he checks their teeth  for me. If I tell him, now that one   s old he   ll check their teeth.    Well  their teeth are about gone, you better think about selling them.    No, I  don   t keep mine near that long. Although we did have one cow   as I  said I name all my cows. This one I named after my grandmother, my  mother   s mother. I think we kept her until she was 15 or 16. And I think  she had either 16 or 17 calves, because there was a couple of years there  she would have had two calves in the same year. She   d have one in  January and then she   d have one in December. She was a good cow. I   ve  got a lot of her calves out there. In fact one of the calves that had her  first calf this year is the three or fourth great-granddaughter of the first  cow Daddy ever gave me. So I can trace it back that far.  Is this written down or you just   .  Yes. It   s actually written down. Yes. The great-great-great-great  grandmother   s name was June and her name is Pansy.  When he had the combine, did he go around with the combine to help  others?  No, it was just strictly for themselves. He had bought just an old used  combine. It wasn   t new material or anything because he knew it was just  going to be for himself. He did have a small mowing machine. You  know one of those that   s on that scythe kind of deal that stands up with  the blades that he used to mow the hay, but he never did have a hay  baler. So a lot of times he would cut the hay, then he had a rake that he  17  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  would rake the hay and then they would just come and bale it in square  bales years ago. But I found out the round bales, you get spoiled real  easy with those because it   s so much easier to let the tractor do the work  then letting them out.  Well what about relationships with neighbors? Did people pitch in and  help?  Well this area is not so much a farming community anymore. People live  out here but very few have cattle, maybe a few have horses, maybe a  horse or a mule or something like that. Or you know, maybe a couple of  cows but as far as actually raising the cattle and stuff there   s just not that  many around. I have one neighbor who lives about a mile from me. He   s  real good about if I call him,  he helps  if he   s able to. But a lot of them  are getting up in years and you really can   t depend on them either. So  many of the neighbors around here, I may know what they drive, but I  don   t even know who they are. And it really is sad. I know one of the  neighbors that used to live down the road, in fact they had just moved  down here shortly before my uncle passed away and they became real  good friends with my parents, even to this day. They moved to  Arkansas back in the    70s and probably every other week she either calls  me or I call her and she   s going to be 90 years old in June. They were  just the best neighbors. At the drop of a hat, if you needed anything they  were there. And really right now you just don   t have that kind of   but  like I said they   re just not here. They   re out working, doing their job.  And when they come in they   re tired and ready to rest.  Do you think it was different 20, 30, 40 years ago?  Oh yes.  Can you remember if your father or your uncle had neighbors pitch in  and help?  Oh yes, yes. In fact these same neighbors who were living here in this  house in the fall of    66, they had a horrific fire across the road, a forest  fire type deal. Daddy was out there until one or two in the morning  helping put it out. And you know, neighbors from all over came. Prague  is like that. If there   s a fire or something, like there was a trailer house  down the road. People were coming and saying,    Is there anything we  can help with?    and everything. But it was a lot different years and years  ago. It was just more of a communal atmosphere in one particular area.  It   s not that way anymore.  So is it tough to be a farmer nowadays?  18  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  (Laughter) Well I don   t really consider myself a farmer, I consider  myself more of a rancher, I don   t really farm that much. It   s tough, but  it   s nice. It   s just like I said when I pulled that calf and how I got that  mother up. Her very first calf and to get up and start licking that calf, I  mean it just gives you such a feeling of accomplishment. And then you  see how they   re growing up and everything. And then of course it hurts  when they have to haul them off, too. That was the first thing when we  started butchering our own calves, they said,    How can you do that?    I  said,    Well, the only thing is I tell myself if I   m not eating it somebody  else is going to.    When we first started butchering calves, they would  come out here and kill the calf on the place. I finally told the guy, I said,     Look I just don   t want to see it and I don   t want to hear it. If you can  give me about ten minutes    til I can get in the house and close my ears  after the calf is gone I   ll be alright. But I just can   t hear it right now  because I   ve had to raise this calf.     I figure it   s tough once you give them a name.  Yes. You see, that   s one reason when they   re going to be butchered I  change it to a beef name.  (Laughter) That way you kind of know what   s coming.  Right, yes.  Oh, Sirloin.  I know, I know. Although these are going to be the first of the alphabet,  so I have to come up with names with an A and a B. Beef would be  okay, but I don   t know what A is going to be. And then C and F, I guess.  Filet would be okay.  We could probably think of names all day. Do you have a favorite  farming or ranching activity that you enjoy the most?  Well that   s checking the cows and just watching the calves be born. I  prefer not assisting, but to actually see them be born and get up and run  around. And when I had my horse too. There   s nothing more beautiful  than watching a horse run out in the pasture when they strut their tail up  and they   ve got their nose up in air and everything. So that   s my favorite  of all of them.  You   ll have to tell me your horse   s name.  Well her registered name was Taurus Countess but I called her Star  because she had a star on her forehead. But the one I grew up with, her  19  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  name was Dolly. And then her sister   s name was Dilly. It was Dilly  May, Dolly May, and then they had a sister in between that was Starlight  because she was kind of a palomino. And to me she kind of looked like  stars sparkling. But that was the thing that absolutely astonished me, too.  My uncle, we had an old mare named Sally, she was a pinto. He got on  her and rode her almost halfway to Meeker to these people who had a  stallion so she could be bred. Well Sally had her first colt, Dilly, in May  of 1955, May 13. Then Starlight was born May 15, 1956. And Dolly, my  horse was born May 17, 1957. I thought, how did he get it a year and  two days apart? Then I found out they have their colt, if you can take  them in they breed back real quickly, and that   s how he did it. But I  mean they were a year and two days apart, each one of them.  Have you walked pretty much every acre on the farm?  Yes. Now that I don   t have a horse to ride, when I have to check fence I  have to get out and actually walk and check all the fence and stuff. So  that   s another thing, I have a cousin coming   that ice storm several  years back destroyed a couple of trees and they   re landing on the fence  so he   s supposed to come and help me cut the trees down so we can get  the fence up and I can turn the cows back out there because they   re  wanting an extra pasture. But yes, that   s a great deal of fun too, just  walking over the land, to know that this is the same land that your  ancestors probably walked across and everything.  How long would it take you to do the whole thing?  Oh gosh, I don   t even want to imagine. Because really just   of course  the thing is when you   re just fixing fence it could take two or three days  to actually walk it all because by the time you actually have to stop and  fix fence, you can   t get it all done in one day. But to walk it, you could  probably do it in probably close to a day. But you   d have to have plenty  of water and maybe a lunch with you in order to finish it.  And you   d find your way? You wouldn   t get lost?  I don   t think so. I remember one year back in the    60s after my uncle  passed away, Daddy and I were out   some cows had gotten out and it  was late at night. He had gotten home from work and we went out on the  horses. We got out in this wooded area that we   d been through many  times, but now it was dark and all the trees were covering even the  moonlight and the stars and everything and we got completely turned  around and Daddy didn   t know where to go. Finally he said,    I   m just  going to turn the horse loose and she   ll find her way back.    She found  her way. She wanted to get back to the barn was what it was. But she got  us out of there. We   d probably still be roaming around in those trees.  20  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  But yes, you could get lost, especially at night. But in the day time, I  pretty much know my way around. And then if I have the dogs with me,  they   ll show me the way.  And there   s just one creek across the property.  Yes.  Does that serve as a landmark?  Yes, that   s true.  Has water ever been an issue then and now?  Not so much around here. Now sometimes when there   s a lot of rain that  creek will go over its boundary. You know the sides of it are probably  up to 15, 20 feet in some areas. But you can see from the residue and  trees and weeds and stuff that the water has come up after the water goes  down and you see all these drift wood and things that are all up on top  that really shouldn   t be there.  Are there ponds for fishing?  Yes. I keep telling people they might as well come up and fish because  there   s fish in there that   s never been caught. I bought a fishing pole  several years ago and I never have time to go fishing myself. But yes  there   s one real good fishing pond. Well there   s three that are all  accessible. One is an older pond that my cousin and his father dug out  back in the    40s. But the others were dug out with dozers and things like  that that my daddy had built.  Do you swim in them?  No. I don   t swim  (Laughter) No and I really think it would be kind of  dangerous to swim in it because especially the one where most of the  fish are, there   s still a lot of tree trunks in there and a lot of algae and  stuff at the bottom. And I know probably there are fish hooks in there,  too. My uncle, of course there wasn   t recycling years ago, he would  throw like his old glass bottles and stuff in ditches and see, if some of  those got broke it could be very dangerous. I don   t recommend anybody  swimming in the ponds.  Snakes too.  Oh yes. And snapping turtles.  21  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Finchum  Duggan  Do you remember any extension workers or home demonstration agents  stopping by back in the early days?  No, no, I sure don   t.  I noticed the ceilings in here are taller than other parts of the house. Is  there a particular reason why?  I think it was just to keep it cooler. And then of course with the   see  that was the flue for the wood stove we had in here. And, of course, we  had these cabinets built in    66 after my uncle passed away. But there  was a wood stove hooked up there. I made a great chicken fried steak in  a wood stove.  So then and now, if you had to get to the grocery store, where would you  go?  Well to Prague. Of course I go to Shawnee about once a week, too. But  mainly here just to Prague to the store. Of course years ago there were a  lot of local grocery stores. And in fact just a mile south of here on the  highway there was a small grocery store. A lot of times when we   d come  down when my uncle was living here, sometimes we   d spend the  weekend and on Sunday morning we   d go to church and on the way  home we   d need milk or bread or something. And instead of going to  town we   d stop just two miles from here and get what groceries we  needed and everything.  Well you mentioned a little bit about how the neighbors have changed,  there   s not a whole lot of farming going on. How has this area changed  through the years?  Well a lot more housing. I know my cousin, he owned the mile section  just south of here and there were no houses on it at all. Now there are  three mobile homes and about four or five actual houses, too, on that  property where he ran his cattle. There   s just a lot more houses built.  When we moved out here in    66 there was just three people that lived on  this road, us and then the neighbor across the road and then one further  down the road north of here, and nobody to the east. There were no  houses at all going to the highway.  What do you envision from the farm in the next 100 years?  I was thinking about that. I don   t really foresee   it probably won   t even  be in my family anymore. You know I   ve made arrangements for it to be  deeded over to a nephew but he doesn   t really have an interest in  farming. He has two boys, they like to hunt a little bit. They come out  22  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  Nykolaiszyn  Duggan  here and hunt in the fall sometimes and fish. I just think they   ll probably  put a    for sale    sign up on it. I wish it wouldn   t happen but I   m afraid it  will, because that was one of Daddy   s greatest wishes, to keep it in the  family as long as he could.  Well do you have any favorite recollections of your dad or your mom  that you   d like to share with us?  Oh, well my mother and dad were both in their 40s when I was born. As  Mother said, I was a    change of life    baby. I changed their life in more  ways than one. My daddy, I never remembered him with anything other  than white hair. He started turning gray when he graduated from high  school in 1928 so by the time I came around in the    50s he was already  white headed. But it ran in his family too because he had several  brothers that turned gray very early, too. But I don   t know, I just   oh  gosh, stories about Daddy. I could go on. When we lived in Shawnee   I  wish I   d been able to write down some of the stories he told. When I   d  get ready for bed, I   d say,    I   m ready for my nighty-night story.    Of  course our bedrooms, there was just a small bathroom in between so he  wouldn   t even get up to come into my bed to tell me a story or read me a  story. He would just be lying in bed with Mother and tell me a story just  off the top of his head. And those stories, some of them I can remember  bits and pieces of them but I can   t remember the whole thing. And it just  absolutely infuriates me that I don   t remember the stories because he  was a great storyteller. And my mother was a great cook.  Is there anything else that you would like to add that we haven   t asked?  I know we went through several questions.  (Laughter) None that I can think of.  Well we   d like to thank you for taking time out and telling us about your  homestead. We appreciate it so much.  Thank you. I   ve enjoyed it.  -------  -------
