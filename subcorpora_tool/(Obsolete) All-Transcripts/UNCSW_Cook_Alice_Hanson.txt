Mary Frederickson: Some of the women were saying that there was a difference in the purpose of the Bryn Mawr school and the Southern Summer School and that was why they didn't want to       . They said that the Southern Summer School had more limited aims than to extend educational opportunities to women workers Alice Hanson Cook: I don't suppose it was hollow but. ... I'm trying to think what it might have meant. I think when the Bryn Mawr school started there was an idea that the kind of education which women might achieveand of course at that time the summer session was quite long. It was eight or ten weeks. Whereas the Southern Summer School never really had money to operate for long periods. In fact Bryn Mawr, after the 'thirties, didn't either. But the original idea at Bryn Mawr was certainly that the kind of education that women workers would get was a kind of general education. Science was an important part of the curriculum. At Bryn Mawr. Louise Brown, at Welisley, taught science. And English literature was an important part. M.F.: Which was very different Cook: Which was very different from what was going on at Southern. The thing that puzzles me a little is that by the time ALES was founded and a question of affiliation might have come up, I would have thought that Bryn Mawr had moved much more into a labor directed, one might almost say page 2 vocational kind of education. But maybe not. the goals and ideas may still have been M.F.: One thing I wanted to ask, in reformers and New Dealers Cook: Well, I was never enthusiastic about that formulation. But it was done because one of the members of Doris' committee is a professor of sort of 20th century American history and very much interested in the reform movement. He. . . well, what we all missed in Doris' thesis was any conceptualization. It was very difficult to get Doris to write a thesis which was anything except a simple narrative taken from the notes. For her to place this in the historical setting or in an ideological setting. It was extremely difficult for her to do. She really has no feel for that kind of thing. She's fair from the best mind I ever had among the students and so on. And this whole theoretical concept, conceptual approach was very foreign to her and very labored. Now I think that her man here, her American history professor. . . well, I know that he absolutely insisted on this kind of thing at a Ph.D. thesis level. As he had every right to do. And he accepted her performance as marginal in that regard. He really knew nothing about workers education, so he was not in a position to judge whether. . . how correct her analysis was. He only wanted an analysis of this kind. I won't say that he insisted on a particular one. I'm sure he would never have done that. But he wanted an analysis of this kind. He wanted this movement put in the larger historical and social and ideological setting than Doris really, on her own, unassisted, would ever have been able to come through with. So that explains the Maybe there's. . . at least . That's possible. dissertation page 3 emphasis put on that thing. And I won't say it was. . . you know, the rest of the thesis doesn't build to this point. And the reason it doesn't is because it was, in a sense, pasted on in the construction of the thesis. If I were you, I wouldn't feel bound by it. I think you might examine it to see whether it satisfies you. M.F.: Cook: Very different. Much more elementary and so on. Much more regional. M.F.: But a lot of these women did seem to be. . . . Cook: Well, I do not quarrel with Doris' general statement. Most of these women had their origins in the Progressive Era. You know, as young college graduates they must have been very much influenced if not by the Teddy Roosevelt ideas certainly by the Wilsonian ideas. They all went to university in the 'teens, either before the war or during the war. And as a matter of fact their alliance with women workers came as a result of the development of the Y at that point. At that point, under Lucy Carner. M.F.: The Y is the group that is just incredible. . . Cook: It is incredible. It was way ahead of its time. M.F.: And as far as I know nothing has been written. . . do you know anyone who has. . . ? Cooki Well, it has been worked on, although I don't think. . . from the wrong perspectives. I think the last thing that was done as I recollect page 4 was done in the '30s or '40s. M.F.: I was hoping for fairly recent dissertations and dissertations in progress and couldn't find any. Cook: Well, it could very well be done because in contrast to the YMCA which had kind of a welfare approach to men workers. The railroad YMCA provided lodging for men when they were away from home on their trips away from home. M.F.: And their approach to the racial problem was very different. There's a book, The Racial Factor in YMCAs Cook: But all these women. . . .                          Deakman, who was never with the schools but who was very much part of this group, very close to Eleanor Colt and Louise McLaren. She never left the Y, whereas these others did. Lucy Gamer never left the Y. No, Lucy took a job with the Chicago Council of Social Agencies and was head of the group work department in that. She did leave the Y. She's living. Somebody told me yesterday                          Deakman died two weeks ago. When I got the tele- phone call about her death, I was told that the memorial service would be last Sunday in Chicago and that Lucy Garner was coming to it. Lucy must be 90, easily. She lives in Germantown in Philadelphia. Very active Quaker and member of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. But Lucy was. . . following Florence Sims, was the woman in the Y who set up the war service program, which was mainly a program for industrial women drawn into the war industries. All these women were of that vintage. Either coming out of college then. Eleanor Emerson with whom I lived graduated from Vassar in 1918 and went immediately to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to work with industrial women in Bridgeport. And page 5 remained in the labor relations field all the rest of her life. M.F.: Was she with the Y. . . , Cook: She was with the Y. When I went to work for the Philadelphia Y after I came home from Germany in '31, Eleanor was my supervisor there. And Eleanor was a close friend of Eleanor Colt's, who went to Smith. And Jane Smith        Smith, went to Bryn Mawr. But they all came out of the women's colleges. Which at that time, you know. . . . People forget, the women's colleges were founded mainly because intelligent women couldn't get in to the good men's schools. And Bryn Mawr was meant to be the woman's Harvard. And it wasn't founded until 1892. M.F.: Thomas? Was it M. Gary Thomas? Cook: M. Gary Thomas was the president. And Hilda Smith was her dean. Hilda must have graduated from Bryn Mawr about 1912. Annetta Deakman graduated here from Cornell in about 1912. All these women were university educated women at a time when that was most unusual. Put them apart already. And having gone, many of them, to the women's universities. ... I don't know where Lucy went. I don't know what her university was. But having gone to universities at the time they did. . . well, they were certainly strongly influenced by Wilsonian political concepts and probably by the first Roosevelt's. M.F.: I was trying to work on their motivations for going into this kind of work                                                   and work that out with the effort to build a class consciousness among women workers. Cook: Well, class consciousness goes a little too far. But certainly a kind of self-consciousness, a sense of worth and dignity. M.F.: Identity. Cook: Identity. The kind of thing we talk about now in consciousness- page 6 raising for women was the kind of thing we were doing then. But we didn't have that vocabulary. M.F.:                                                                I mean class consciousness was used. It was used by Lois MacDonald in some of her economic Cook: There was no word for it. . .no other word, certainly. And it was a kind of class consciousness, but in the sense that, you know, the parties monopolize that, it shouldn't be. . . . M.F.: I was confused Cook: I'd put it. . . yes, I suppose. You know, nomeclature like everything else runs in styles and that's the way we talked about it then. But there were other words that were stylist economic words at the time. Planning was one. Because for the first time planning, on a national scale, had been done by the Russians in the first five year plan in the early 30s. And planning suddenly became a new and very exciting concept. But if one talked about being a planner. ... I remember when I came back from Europe in '31 and went to work for Eleanor Emerson, she was full of planning. And long range planning and stuff like that. And it was an interesting concept. It was the sense that you could kind of mold the future. That was all inherent in the idea. M.F.: You could control. . . . Cook: You could control the future. M.F.: And that's what you were telling the workers. Cook: In a sense. It was things like that which, let's say, the parties were also trying to popularize and gain acceptance for. A different set of roots and essentially a different set of definitions. Its a kind of common vocabulary with different meanings. page 7 Somewhat different meanings, not absolutely. M.F.: They were overlapping. Cook: Overlapping. Because there's no question that people. . . much of the motivation of people in this period derived from the party. I'd say in my own case. I became a party member, a socialist party member, after I had already built certain allegiances and concepts and kind of got my nose pointed in the direction. Knew where I wanted to go. It seemed to me [instrumental/incremental]. But it wasn't where I got started. M.F.: Cook: I knew Elizabeth Oilman fairly well, though that was accidental because Baltimore was not part of my tract. But I really got to know Elizabeth Oilman. . . . Well, I saw her at national party affairs to the extent I went to them. I really didn't go very much. And she was a name. But then. . . oh, it would be much later. . . no, not so much later, in the mid '30s, when I went to work for the CIO, I got to know a man from Baltimore, Ken Stotty, who was a kind of protege of Elizabeth Oilman's. He had been a young student when she was an older woman and head of the party and the party figure in Baltimore. Ken [Stotty/Doty] and his family got to be very intimate with me and my family. And later Ken's wife became very seriously ill and I took his children and had them for over five years. So that our relationship became very, very close and it remained that way ever since. So that I got to know Elizabeth Oilman very much more as a reflection of herself through Ken than because I ever knew her first-hand all that well. M.F.: She was on the advisory board of the school during page 8 Cook: Yes she was. Well, she would have given some money. She had money. M.F.: That's what I was thinking. I ran across a letter that she had written to Frank Graham in Chapel Hill and she was very worried about. . . she said she ran into one of the students from the school and she said that it was communist affiliated and she wanted to know, because if it was she wanted to get out. She said "I feel I owe a contribution as long as I'm on the advisory board." Cook: Uhhuh. Well, there were certainly people in the school who either had communist affiliations or were very close to it. Now Holly Ransdale was such a person. Have you run across her name? M.F.: Yes. She taught labor dramatics? Cook: She taught labor dramatics. M.F.: She lives very close to Lois MacDonald. Cook: Well, I'm not even sure if she's. . . . yes. I'm not sure she's still alive but she may well be. M.F.: Cook: She was an interesting woman who I got to know rather well because I never knew her until I went down the first time to Southern. And because she lived near Philadelphia, she drove down with me. At that time it took a couple of days. Or two nights and three days to drive down to North Carolina from Philadelphia, with no good roads and no fast cars. So year after year we had these trips together. Long talks. She took her young son with her very often, Carlo. Then we were there. We were thrown together, really. It's a very isolated situation. There was no life with anybody in the community. Often there was no community. We were in a very isolated location. And Holly and I got to be rather intimate page 9 friends, in the kind of way one does with a passenger on a ship, you know. I mean that ends when you're no longer in that setting. But we had a lot of liking for each other. Somehow it never endured once we were back in our respective Pennsylvania settings. But we always took it up very happily each summer and we were quite close. Now Holly had been married to a man who, until recently, was the joint board manager of BIOG in Philadelphia. He had not been that                                            . Then she had divorced him. She had been at Brookwood with him. They had divorced. Carlo was his son. His name was Ross. Carlo Ross. And she had taken up withI don't think they were ever married but in any case it was a long, long, devoted, monologous relationshipwith a DaneI think he was Danishwhose name was Roose. So she went from Ross to Roose. His name was Carl Roose. Her son was Carlo Ross. Her second husband, or companion, was Carl Roose. I think that it would be safe to say that her probable membership in the communist party dated from her alliance with Carl Roose. I remember our having a long, long, long discussions on evening walks and so on about the party. She never tried to recruit me for it but it was clear that if she was not a member she was at least very, very close. I think in fact she told me that she was not a member. If I remember correctly. Simply because she was rather frail. She simply did not have the physical stamina to maintain the discipline and activity which the party would require. But it was some such reason. Not that she doubted that that was where she belonged or that her sympathies. . that she in any way took exception. But that physically she could not stand up to the requirements So, now, of the people there, in addition to Beulah Howard there was a girl Janie Something from Alabama who was also a long, long time student and page 10 assistant to the school. Louise used to bring these girls back to the school, not as students but as kind of assistants and helpers and tutors. And they were very, very useful because they had that kind of earthy quality of the native southern worker                                      kindness and compassion and generosity and sharing with neighbors and family and so on and making do. And both those girls. ... I remember when Beulah became a communist party member. I don't think she had been at the time of the Elizabethtown strike. But she did, at some point later, become a party member. And there was one summerI'm not sure I can remember whichwhen she was clearly preparing herself to join. She was reading basic Marx and stuff like that, which was probably way over her head. But working like a beast at it. M.F.: Cook: She wasn't opposed. M.F.: I mean but she wasn't. . . . Cook: I don't really know. To some degree, she's a puzzle to me and I think Mac would be the clue to it. He may have been a party member or ... he may never have been accepted as a party member. The party would have been out of its mind to take him. But he, I suspect, had arrived at a point where he thought of himself as a communist. Now I would doubt very much that Louise ever quite got to that point. But her deep, deep, uncritical loyalty to Mac would have. . . M.F.: Cook: Not only prevented her saying anything. It would have meant that she must have been in terrible conflict. M.F.: What about the relationship between those of you who were socialist party members and those who were. . . I mean. . . . page 11 Cook: We got on perfectly well. M.F.: Was the attitude of Elizabeth Gilman unusual? If there's anyone who's a communist I want out. Cook: No, that's not unusual. In fact I was very, very critical of the communist party during that whole period. No, that was part of being a socialistthat one was very anti-communist, very doctrinaire anti-communist. No, that would not have been unusual. M.F.: Howard Kester Cook: Yes. Well, Howard Kester never had a close connection to the school, but he was another native southerner who was a radical. However, he was never a communist. Of that I'm confident. M.F.: He was a socialist, wasn't he? Cook: He was a socialist. M.F.: Cook: Well, he was in the unemployed organization and I think he may very well have been under attack and subversion by the communists atihat point. M.F.: Was he ever there when you were there Cook: I'm sure he was, but I also saw him in Philadelphia. He was working with the Southern Tenant Farmers Union which was, of course, socialist inspired and supported to a great extent. And he was a very loyal Norman Thomasite and so on. So that part of his job was to raise money to keep that thing going. So he came to Philadelphia certainly once a year. We put on a meeting for him and so on where we could talk about the Southern Tenant Farmers, very much like the Chavez union these days, you know. I mean it had that same aura. M.F.: Do you remember if there were women, sharecroppers, who came page 12 to the school as students. . . in particular. . . . Cook: No. Maybe if you named a name to me I. . . . M.F.: Myrtle Lawrence was one. Cook: I never heard of her at all. M.F.: Harriet Young  was quite an active political party member  Cook: As I remember, Harriet Young was not a sharecropper. She may have worked for the. . . . M.F.: She worked for the union. Cook: . . . union, yes. M.F.: She wasn't a sharecropper. Cook: Harriet Young had been at Commonwealth. She had been a student at Commonwealth back in the year I was there. But she was not. . . I'm not even sure she was a southerner. She might have been. She was In school in Arkansas, but I don't think she was from Arkansas. I can't remember. I think she came from Ohio. M.F.: Is                                        a southerner? Cook: Uhhuh. M.F.: She was from Kentucky? Cook: Can't remember. But she was certainly a southerner. M.F.: Oh, one other thing. I know you probably have to go to. . . Cook: What time is it getting to be? I'll have to go at two o'clock. M.F.: I have about a quarter 'til. difficult to pin point The female consciousness at the time of the workers especially. I've found so little that would indicate any kind of anger over wage differentials or. page 13 Cook: There was very, very little. Very little. Part of the problem was that wages were so depressed in any case and unemployment so general both for men and womenthat I think we were all caught up in the, you know, the overall economic catastrophy. And it was not distinguished as between men and women. To some extent between black and white. But, you know we never had blacks at Southern Summer School. Partly that was because of the law, you see. Under the McLaren administration, we never had a black as long as she was there. I think by the time Brownie took it over, Brownie would have pushed ahead. Brownie was a much more militant personality than Louise. M.F.: I was thinking that the school. . . the change was tremendous when                              took over. Cook: Yes, yes, M.F.: Changed direction. . . . Cook: Everything, Now Brownie is a totally different personality and a much more militant, much more. . . well, just much. . . if I say straight forward I suggest something that perhaps shouldn't be there. But a kind of frontal attack on things. A real militant. M.F.: In a way the program seemed to diminish because it was restricted almost exclusively to upper South Cook: Well, there was so little money. One of the problems. . . . I was no longer active in the school at that period, so I really. . . now I'm talking entirely from second hand. But there was so little money that the work had to be reduced to, let's say, weekend courses. M.F.: Institutes and Cook: Institutes and conferences and that kind of thing. Indeed, that was true of workers education generally, you know. A great deal of that went page 14 on at Hudson Shore, too, because these resident programs simply couldn't be financed any longer. So part of that was a decision of necessity. M.F.: And that even happened before McLaren quit. Cook: I'm sure it did. When did she. . ,? M.F.: She quit '43 and I think her last residence school was in 40 and maybe *4l. Cook: Well, you see the war came in there which would have made it extremely difficult to recruit and get people and so on. So that partly it would have been the war. But partly the difficulty in raising money. Partly the fact that the, . . well, you know, workers education got another injection, life giving injection, with the organization of the CIO. Because those unions. ... In the first place, they organized women but not only women. They badly needed, and totally lacked, trained local leadership. To a great extent their national leadership was imported from other unions. The miners' union or the amalgamated clothing workers shared staffs and trained people. And then there was this big recruitment of university trained people like myself                          husband and Ken Doty and so on. So that there was an infusion at the upper, professional level. But at the plant level it was a case of massive training, of people, sort of shop stewards. So that the schools, to the extent that they could get union support, could get it if they would help with this tremendous job of steward training. Very elementary, very localized. You couldn't have those people travel very far. They couldn't be away from the shop long. They couldn't get time off. And to some extent, all of these readjustments in the shape, form, structure of workers education was a response to very specific, immediate needs and, therefore, sources of money. Workers education ceased to be, or diminished in being, the work and financing of the page 15 middle class. Do-gooders. And became a function of the trade unions. Now one of the things of which you should be aware and I think may be a clue to what was going on at that period is that thanks mainly to Eleanor Colt, who was acceptable on both sides of the political fence. Now I mean trade union political fence. Don't forget the trade union movement was sharply divided and at war with each other, CIO against AFL. One reason that Brookwood failed was because it could not get support from the conservative AFofL side. In fact was strongly under attack by them. And the CIO was not yet formed. And even when CIO was formed, it had very little money. It was a hand to mouth thing with loans and so on from wealthy unions like the Amalgamated and the Mine Workers and the rest. But, Eleanor Colt's real contribution was that she had good relations, thanks to the kind of painstaking, Louise McLaren-like, nurturing of contacts and even conservative contacts, you see, Eleanor had access to - both wings. And those conferences, the Washington birthday conferences, which were run annually, was one place where people of both wings could meet and talk and exchange ideas and recall old days and debate without having to be enemies. Now, to some extent Louise        had done that for the South, as well. M.F.: I was thinking of this in terms of. . . when A. J. Musky He was going to come and speak one time at the school, or he was going to present a part of the program, be responsible for part of the program. And Mary Anderson, who withdrew her place from the advisory committee because he was going to be there. And McLaren very definitely picked to go in the direction, in his direction. I mean she didn't withdraw and say "All right, we won't have. Cook: No, she would have felt that that was too much to ask of her, page 16 * even with the loss of Mary Anderson. MF.: But at the same time, she never seemed to completely alienate those on the. . , right, Cook: No, no. I remember her calling on. . . now if I can remember the names. There was a man in North Carolina who had a fantastically interesting name. He was the CIO director there for a long time. He's an old miner. There was also an old member, . . Tennessee. . . from the barber's union. All these were very picturesque old, blind people with whom she kept contact. And of course she welcomed the new blood that came in with the CIO and was personally, you know. . . placed great, great hopes in the, . . . M.F.: Well, after '37 and '38 new life is pumped into the school as far as activities, conferences. There's a great, . . . Cook: Well, but. . . a lot of that was WPA. M.F.: Money. Cook: That didn't come from the union. It came from WPA. And there was a man who was WPA director for North Carolina named Carl Thompson. He was a newspaper man and I think one of the early members of the newspaper guild. But that is rather beside the point, because this connection with PWA and his support of the school, I'm sure precedes the founding of the guild, which must have been '38 or '39. But in any case, Carl Thompson. . . . There was a WPA workers education program in North Carolina. So that Carl Thompson had money to send women to the school. And there was a summer. . . it must have been '35 or '36. . . when we had a very large school. M.F.: I remember. 40 or 45. And you had a whole unit. Cook: That's right. We had a unit of unemployed in addition to the page 17 regular enrollment. And that was thanks, you see, to Carl Thompson, Not to the unions. In fact the unions weren't yet really in there. M.F.: When you were working for the CIO, were you working in the South? Cook: Partly I was working in the South. And I visited the school the summer. ... I didn't work for them very long. About two years. Because then I had a baby. But I went to work in '37 and Philip was born in '39 and I stopped work two or three months before he was born. So that I really only worked about a year and a half. But I was working for the rayon division of the textile workers and I had a circuit. I was education director. I had a circuit which included. . . began in Chester, Pennsylvania, Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, included Lewistown, Pa., Needvllle, Pa. Then I dropped down into West Virginia. Parkersburg and Nitro. And then to Roanoke, Virginia. So I was in Roanoke and I sometimes stopped off at the Celanese Plant in Frederick, Maryland. So that I was in the upper South very much. Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, West Virginia. M.F,: Cook: I think it was later. In any case. ... no, it was earlier than that. She was a very close friend of John L. Lewis and at one time there was a rumor that she and John L, Lewis were going to marry. It wasn't true and I don't know whether there was ever any foundation to it, but she was a very close friend of John L, Lewis. No, she worked for the CIO while he was president, which puts in quite early, before Hillman, M.F.: But it was after you were there? Cook: Well, she always worked. . . when she was working for the CIO she was working out of Washington. She may have made many trips Into the page 18 South, but she was working out of Washington. M.F.: Fortunately, she's written a book on. . . . Cook: Yes. How long are you going to be around? M.F.: I'm not sure. I was planning to leave this evening, but I haven't finished going through the papers and think I should. Cook: I was wondering if you'd like to come out for supper at the house tonight and then you can talk with Eleanor Emerson, also, who while she was not in the Southern School, knows all these people. M.F.: Oh, I would really like that. Cook: It would be pot luck. [Discussion of how to get there for dinner. Not transcribed]
