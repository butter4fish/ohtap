Speaker 2: It was a big, we had about six or seven rooms.  And living room, dining room, kitchen, like back in those days most of them had their own kitchen, their own dining room, their own sitting room, we called living room, and then the bedrooms.  I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you have indoor plumbing?
Speaker 2: I remember, oh no, wasn't no indoor toilet, not back in those days no, we had a spring we had to go around and get the water from.  And I remember we had a, my dad [James Evers] had a tub up, built up on, on a scaffold outside the back porch.  We keep it full of water and it caught rain, rain water.  And we, when it get low, Medgar [Medgar Evers] and I had to go and get water from the spring to fill out the tub.  So ma [Jesse Wright Evers] would have water to cook with.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And your, your father built this house, or was this something that you purchased?
Speaker 2: We built, I think my daddy built, I don't know I, I'm just a kid 'cause we lived there all my life.  So, I, I don't know how they got it.  I'm sure daddy built it though.

Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, and tell me about the other people in the neighborhood?  Who are your friends?  Say if you went on a, on a square block.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me who lives in that area?
Speaker 2: Well, Ms. Ada Atkins and Reverend Atkins, who was a jackleg preacher then.  We'd called him (laughter) and they lived right next door to old man (unclear).  And, (cough) and then the McIntoshes lived right in front of us.  And they're all gone now too.  The Needhams lived sort of south of us, they're all gone too.  Who else?  That was about it, I guess.  The Wansleys lived up front of us.  Sort of, you know, back in those days it was strictly a colored neighborhood wasn't no integrated neighborhood.  It just all colored folks or all white folks.  Given we lived right together.  Funny they go integrate--we all been integrated white people.  We always lived right close to each other all the time.  And then the white people was Ms. Payne bless her heart.  Ms. Payne, good old white lady.  And we used to pick up the pecans for her all the time.  Medgar and I and we'd share the pecans.  And, who else?  I can't remember more now, Frank Gaines who owned the grocery store.
Speaker 1: Frank Gaines was he black or white?
Speaker 2: White, no, no blacks owed nothing, white, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your friends tell me who your friends were in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well Robin Smith [ph.].  Rob, he's gone on now.  A.J. Needham, Henry [Henry McIntosh (ph.)] and Debbie Jane McIntosh [ph.], Archie Lee and Cloris [ph.], oh who else I don't even now.  That was those were my close friends.
Speaker 1: Close friends, okay.
Speaker 2: Boys growing up you know. Played ball together, mar- played and shot marbles together, things of that sort.
Speaker 1: Okay, so besi- besides shooting marbles, what else did you do in the neighborhood for recreation?
Speaker 2: We, we played basketball, and had our basketball coach.  And we played baseball and I had the bas- baseball field that we played on.  And shot marbles, I'm a great marble shooter.  I used to win all the marbles.  And we were playing with jump the, jump the rope you know and things of that sort.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Very simple stuff.  Wasn't no high tech--high exclusive stuff back in those days, just simple things that we created.  And we lived very happily.  And the neighborhood was so close together.  Until you know, we was everybody's, James Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers] belonged everybody, Henry belonged everybody.  If I did something wrong Ms. Atkins whip me just as quick as my mother and I better not go home and tell my mom then I got another whipping.  But that's how neighborhoods were then.  People loved and respected each other.  And white people back in those days although there was, there was racism but, but if they like you, they like you.  And, and, and they were close too.  'Cause they always lived together, you know. That's something I, as I got older now, lived, integration?  We were always lived next to white people.  White people lived, lived next to us.  On each other and on the land.  So, one of the things now another thing, mean being integrated 'cause we were all living together like that.

Went off to school to college and had our own--we at Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi], went to Alcorn, had our own room there.  And I always let him sleep on the top bed, 'cause I always figured somebody'd bother, let me get them first.  I always thought I was the tough one and he was always the meek, nice kind, one who all the time make peace.  And I was always stirring up something.  I'd start up a mess in a minute.  Then he'd, "Oh Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers], no Charles."  And yeah we was very close.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother [Jesse Wright Evers] work outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Daddy [James Evers] said one thing, "Your, your job just to take care of my chi- our children," so mother stayed at home.

When they slowed--the old freight come through there and slow down.  And changing something and we'd, I always catch one of them cars; I loved to ride a freight train.  A little--just a little piece, but my mom [Jesse Wright Evers] and them told you, "You better not get hurt," 'cause it was wide open, wasn't protect you.  We'd run and catch the train and ride down to the depot and jump off.  Yes it was a railroad track and we used to watch the trains pass every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had that--back in those days they had passenger trains and freight train.  The passenger trains would haul that people.  And the freight trains would haul them, you know the freight and stuff.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How far away was it from our house?
Speaker 2: Just a little way, just less than a mile.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and describe the school for me?
Speaker 2: We're all in one room.  One big room, the teachers taught us all one through, through eight.  And that's we're all in there together.  And, had like the first grade of there, second grade over here, and third grade there.  And then on up to eighth grade.  And she went go one class to the other.  And one big ol' board, black board we used to write on.  We all used the same black board.  And that's why most of us never got too much education because, you know, the teacher probably didn't finish the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your, your teacher?
Speaker 2: Ms.--yes, in love with her.  Ms. Anderson [ph.], lordy yes.  I was a little ol' mannish boy, crazy about Ms. Anderson.
Speaker 1: What, what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Fair.  I passed, I'm no A student, I'm a B student I, I passed I never failed.  But I, that's, that's it.
Speaker 1: And what, what did you like to do as a, as a student?  What was your favorite subject?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to like to make money.  I used to always hustle.  Pick up Coca-Cola tops and cans and sell them.  And we used to always--and pick up pecans things of that sort, yeah.

Speaker 2: Just a kid yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so through the eighth grade, and, did you have any aspirations of what you would become?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I'd say after high school?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I always--had to work for my dad [James Evers] and uncle [Mark Thomas].  So, I had no, I either work in the funeral business or helping daddy carry lumber sticks they would stack lumber with (gesture), you know.  And so that's all I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I got a little bit older, I don't--well you say don't get ahead but that's all I knew just work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well we'll (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And playing.
Story_ID: 652311
Speaker 1: Well tell me a little bit more about it because remember that, that years from now people may not understand how the lumber business was, how it was run at that time.  So, if you could just give me a little description of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) One (unclear)--yeah, the lumber business you know, it was, you had a saw mill.  Cut down trees and whatever, whatever lum- kind of lumber you needed, was one by twelve or two by twelve or two four, then that saw mill will cut to that.  Then my daddy [James Evers] had the contract of stacking, there was no kilns in those days.  A kiln is where you put it in there and they steam dry.   You had to, the sun had to dry it.  So, daddy's job, had the job of contract in Decatur [Mississippi], Newton [Mississippi], and Hickory [Mississippi] I believe stacking the lumber on the yard.  He had men to work with him--for him.  And once they sun dried it then they had a (unclear) called planer mill.  Planer mill is where you make the lumber (gesture), the, the, the, they smooth it out, making it smooth.  And that was daddy's job, to stack the lumber and make sure it dried.  And when it got dry enough let the person know it's ready to go to the kiln to be smoothed out.  To be lumbered out, cut into whatever they wanted to cut it.  Make two by fours out of it or whatever, the tree would already cut it down.  He'd, he, he would stack it.  We called him, he had a contract and he was the only one had the contract, I remember back in those days.
Speaker 1: And, and how many people did he have working with him?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't know, he had any number.  He had some in Decatur, some in Newton, some in Hickory, I don't, I know how many, but I know he had people, those, those were his con- his, his lumberyard, they called it.  So, he had people working stacking them up in there.
Speaker 1: Oh I see, okay, all right.  And then you also talked about funeral business.  So, who owned the--
Speaker 2: My Uncle Mark Thomas was the, was the--owned the funeral home there in Forest [Mississippi].  And (cough), pardon me in Forest and in Mount Olive [Mississippi].  And as I, I was growing up I worked for them and daddy, him and daddy.  And then I became interested in the funeral business.  And I became very involved and I learned all things about what to do with a person's body.  And then I--we had one in Philadelphia [Charles Evers Funeral Home], and when I got, when I came, well you say don't get ahead.  Then that's when I, that one became mine in Philadelphia, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 652312
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that later on, 'cause we're still in elementary school [at Decatur Consolidated School, Decatur, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So, now you finished the eighth grade and what are your, your plans after eighth grade?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, that was when I went the [U.S.] Army I believe, I think I went in the Army, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when you go onto the Army you're how old, seventeen?
Speaker 2: Eighteen.
Speaker 1: Eighteen, okay.  All right, so what made you decide to go onto the Army?
Speaker 2: Well they bombed Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii].  And I--everybody was talking about fight to protect America.  And I wanted to go.  And I volunteered and went in the Army in 1942.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so at, at home are, are you listening to the radio to get this information?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's all we had no TV then.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, well, before we go forward let's talk about some of the radio shows that was one of your forms of entertainment.  What did you listen to on the radio (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We, we listen to that station in Nash- what was that station in Nashville [WLAC Radio, Nashville, Tennessee]?  (Unclear), anyway.  I used to love to listen to blues stations, where they played blues. [HistoryMaker] B. B. King and I grew up together.  And we used to--I listened to any kind of blues Muddy Waters and all that people.  And who is that other blues fellow that a lot of--all the blues guys loved to listen to him.
Story_ID: 652313
Speaker 1: And you said that you and [HistoryMaker] B. B. King grew up together?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did he live?
Speaker 2: Up in the Delta [Mississippi Delta].
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh and he, we used to always, always argue, "Why you had to always drive the damn tractor?"  And I had to plow the mule.  He, "You can't drive, that's why," (laughter).  Anyway that's another story.
Speaker 1: No, well there you can tell me that story though.  What, what age were when you became friends?
Speaker 2: In a (unclear)--pardon?
Speaker 1: You were teenagers when you became friends?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, then I went into the [U.S.] Army and we got separated and he did too.  So, we came back and got back together.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, yeah but tell me this story 'cause it sounds like it was funny, of, you all working together working on a tractor, was it a tractor (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Farm yeah, see back then they had old--them old type tractors, you don't even know anything about them.  They were hard and B. could drive the hell out of them.  And he would drive the tractor and I had to plow the mule.  And I didn't like plowing, walking, I'm walking and he's riding.  And we would talk about that, but you now, it was just boys talking.  And he, he, he'd hit back, "You can't drive," and I couldn't, you know.  And I, but I could always plow the mule, oh, Kate [ph.].  Sam [ph.] and Kate, those were our mules.  I can see them right now (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and, and what land were you plowing? Who's land was this?
Speaker 2: Our land, we worked for we, we used work for different people.  And when they hire us to work for you know, we'd plow and work for them.  My, my daddy [James Evers] used to own quite a bit of land.  And we'd rent the land to people and they'd raise stuff like cotton and stuff like that.  And then they'd hire us to work.  The, the thing that we could do.
Speaker 1: Okay, how, how did your father first acquire land, do you, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I, we always owned land, all I knew, I didn't know, I guess daddy bought it from them.  I know they had to buy it from white folk, 'cause they owned land.  But we always owned land.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I've never rented, we've always owned our own home.
Story_ID: 652314
Speaker 1: Okay so we were talking about the--working on the land, but I still wanted to go back also to, to the funeral and, and how you came about and what it is that you learned to do as far as the fu- funeral business was considered.
Speaker 2: You know, some things you don't discuss about the funeral business, you--what you do is well I learned how to work with my uncle, how to handle bodies, how to go get them.  Oh god, a woman your size is a two man, 'cause back in those days had to have, they didn't have no stretchers.  And my job and, and George's job, Mark, my cousin had to go out and get that big woman and bring out her out to the road to the wagon.  And oh, "Uncle Mark [Mark Thomas] I--." "Shut up boy."  That was my uncle.  We'd go out and get Ms. Annie [ph.] or either Mr. John [ph.] and put them on, in, on the wagon.  It wasn't no cars, no hearses like that then, wagon.  And bring them on into the funeral home, or bring them out to the road, to where you can get, get to, the funeral wagon.  And that was our job.  "Ms. So and So died yesterday," or last night.  And George said, "Uh-oh Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers] here we go."  And that was my cousin George Evers.  He's gone too.  And our job was to get the--Uncle Mark go out there with us, "Come on boys."  But, they all, I remember how they always protect women though.  I've never seen a woman naked dead, never.  I mean not when we'd go pick her up.  We'd go pick her up and then Uncle Mark would always make sure she's covered with a sheet, completely.  And when we'd pick, and he'd show us how to pick her up.  And a certain way you pick up a dead person.  'Cause they're stiff.  So, it depends on, you gotta know how to pick them up, in case, 'cause, you know, they are dead.  But, you, you take the leg and, and then the body and then the head, head part.  And you lay them down, and you acted like it's gonna hurt them.  But, handle them (unclear) with care.  And Uncle Mark was very, very vicious about that.  "Don't do that body like that, you lay Ms. Anne down."  I used want to say, "Dad she's dea- Uncle Mark she's dead."  You better not say that, he'd knock you down and then your daddy gonna whip you for saying it, and being smart.  So, you know those days were good old days 'cause it made us what we are today.
Speaker 1: I see, I see, okay.  All right and now when you're about ten is, is there an incident that makes you decide that you know, civil rights would be something that you would pursue latter on in life?
Speaker 2: Not really no, I didn't know a thing about it.  We didn't know all we knew back in that point in time was the colored neighborhood and the white neighborhood.  And they all right there together.  Now, I never understood as I got older about integration.  We couldn't sit on the same table together.  We couldn't go into the same restaurant together but we lived together.  And right now, and, and, and, and in--our land in Decatur [Mississippi] right now is just right next to white folks.  And they own land and are still there.  We don't own it no more but white did live, I guess Ms. Natalie's [ph.] children must have owned it.  I sold all ours after--Liz [Evers's sister, Elizabeth Evers Jordan] and I sold all our.  'Cause I wouldn't ever go back there.  And no I didn't, I think (unclear) forget, we gave it the City of Jackson--of Decatur.  Our land there belongs to the City of Decatur.
Story_ID: 652315

I must have gone in the first World War II, I stayed in there like four years and came out and I went back when they had the, had the Korean conflict [Korean War].  I had to go on back to the Army.  I was in the reserves [U.S. Army Reserve].  I guess about ten years in all, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and what was your, your MOS [military occupational specialty] what type of job did you do?
Speaker 2: I was the tag constructor for my (unclear), built, we built pontoon bridges and we built roads and, and operate dozers, bulldozers building road through the--and for the infantry to follow us and go through.  We were, I was in, I was a combat engineer.  (Unclear) and we--but we had, we would, it was the engineer the, the combat engineer right here, the infantry right there, so they were right in front of us, fighting the enemy as we built roads for us to get on through and bridges.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and what was the Army like?
Speaker 2: Segregated (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause it was, as far as, yeah okay.  So, tell me how do you feel you were treated?
Speaker 2: At the time we didn't know we thought we're supposed to be colored soldiers and white soldiers.  Yet we all, I, you know, I do remember I was like, why, why--I don't know why we got a white battalion and a colored battalion?  And I, I sort of questioned it back then but no- we didn't dwell on it because that's the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay all right and, and any--any incidences while you were in the Army that you could remember that you would like to share?  Or any stories about what happened during your time either in the Pacific or in Korea?
Speaker 2: Not really. No more than we worked hard and I, when we moved to the Philippines I fell in love with a young girl by--Felicia.  That's when I really being to find about, out about segregation.  Because she was white, or well Filipino, we weren't supposed to, I wasn't supposed to, to be dating her.  And today why I'm a bachelor today, because I couldn't bring Felicia home.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Back then you know, it wasn't no such thing as marriage, you know, intermarriage back then.  And I fell in love with Felicia and I must have been oh about twenty-two or twenty-one something like that.  She fell in love with me; there was never no sex.  I don't know today whether she's a man or woman but I loved Felicia.  And that's why I know it ain't sex, it ain't all sex.  And but because she was Filipino, she's not my wife today.

Speaker 1: What else can you share about your, your childhood as, as far as what you like to do?  And if you could, talk about some of the things that you and your brother did together.  You talked about you and B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King], how you all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --worked with what did you and Medgar [Medgar Evers] do as well?
Speaker 2: Well actually we did, and this may be broad, everything together.  We, we worked together, we played together, we'd fight.  I'd always start a fight we'd beat up on all--we'd always double team on anybody.  If they mess Medgar I was on them.  If they mess with me, Medgar was on them, we'd both.  We were bad about--we was bad about fighting.  We never--and Ms. Atkins [Ada Atkins] or Ms. Payne, and we loved old Ms. Payne, she's a white lady.  Good as she as could be, she had a lot of pecan trees.  She had a little army with kids, she'd always have, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers] and Medgar pick up all my pecans."  So, we'd pick up the pecans for her and put them in the barn.  Then go back and steal half of them that evening, after we'd put them in the barn.  Take them same pecans and that's why I always say, "Man," I say, "white people ain't so damn smart."  I take them same pecans up to old man Sam Massey, who was a dirty old white man.  He didn't like colored, and we were colored back in them days.  Call you a nigger in a minute.  And he, he had, had a old, back in those days, wasn't like it is now (gesture) store, it was just push it all out on the platform and little office where the store was.  We'd carry old man Sam all our pecans, and he'd buy them.  And we'd see the bastard, you know, mess the scale, wasn't, wasn't, wasn't treating us right.  But, he left all the pecans out on the platform.  Wasn't no house like this, just out there on the platform.  And Medgar and I said, "We'll get that old rascal."  We'd go home and soon as dark came, we'd take our wagon and go steal half the pecans back.  And, and they never caught us.  And go to show how dumb he was and we'd go right back, right back the next day and sell the same pecans to old man Sam.  And we see him doing the same again.  That kind of thing you know and we'd used to get him.  And we'd thought, we thought we'd get him and I guess he thought he was getting us, so.  Those the kinds of things we did.  And we used to always like to chase, we'd call them my enemies.  See and those are our neighbors just things like that just boys stuff never nothing major.
Story_ID: 652317
Speaker 1: And you and your brother [Medgar Evers], did you all used to go on vacations in the summer?
Speaker 2: Oh no, we never know nothing about no vacations.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean visit relatives?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we used to go right, right here in Forest [Mississippi], in Jackson [Mississippi], we had cousins and we'd come occasionally.  And go to the zoo [Livingston Park Zoo; Jackson Zoological Park, Jackson, Mississippi].  That was a big thing.  And come to Jackson go to the zoo.  And we'd used to come in and go to the zoo and go back home.  I'll never forget I had a pair--a pair of grey shoes, brand new grey shoes.  And never had a pair like that, they were killing my feet.  And I wore them (unclear) until my daddy [James Evers] gave me enough to change (unclear) give me some more.  And I, and I had some grey shoes and I came to Jackson to the zoo and it was hot, in July, August and them shoes hurting my feet.  And, and I was sweating and hot, that was a miserable trip to Jackson.  I never forget that one.  And other than that we'd come in and visit and we'd sometimes spend the night, most time we'd go back home.
Speaker 1: Oh I see, okay.  And, and what about shopping for clothes and so how far was Jackson from Decatur [Mississippi] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixty-five miles, sixty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Jackson, but Decatur, between here and Meridian [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you come to Jackson to be able to go shopping?
Speaker 2: To do big shopping, we'd call.  'Cause our little old town was Decatur and Newton [Mississippi] had nothing, ordinary stuff, everyday stuff.  But, to come to shop and buy some them had come to Jackson.  And we'd come over here and go down and shop.  And I, and I always, I, I guess as I got older I thought why do we have to go in that room (gesture).  We couldn't go in an ordinary dressing room, like anybody that, this, this dressing--no that's colored, a little old hole.  Women and the men, boys and girls go in the same one.  But the whites had a big old, I can remember that very well.  Our room where to go in and dress, change clothes or just try on clothes, we couldn't do that.  I remember it very well.  But, thank god that's all gone.
Speaker 1: Do you remember whether you mother [Jesse Wright Evers], did you all ever order through catalogs?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], oh yeah, mom--we bought a lot of stuff through Sears and Roebuck.  In fact, she ordered a lot of our clothes through Sears and Roebuck.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at, at your house?
Speaker 2: Nothing really other than Christmas, we celebrated quite a bit and Easter and Mother's Day.  Other than that it was just another day.  We never, I don't think celebrated Father's Day, but I know Mother's Day and Easter and Christmas was very important to us.
Speaker 1: Did you all have any traditions that were different from anyone else?
Speaker 2: Beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: Were there any traditions that your family had that were different from anybody else (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None that I knew of.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: They worked the heck out of us (laughter). I mean my mama and my daddy worked.  My ma took care--took care of us and made us work.
Story_ID: 652318
Speaker 1: What about religion, what, what church did you attend (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I brought--yeah, I brought up Church of God in Christ, that's why I don't dip, I never dip, chew, smoke, drugs, or none of that.  I don't do it to this day.  I always sold it after I got it found out what I could do, make money.  But, I never used it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: I promised my mother [Jesse Wright Evers] I would never do it.
Speaker 1: So did you go to church on, on?
Speaker 2: Every Sunday, all day, every Tuesday all half the night, every Friday half the night and back again all day Sunday, yes.

Speaker 2: (Cough) Pardon me.
Speaker 1: Did you attend the convocations (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Because the Church of God and Christ had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We all had to go, but you know just kids we just, we just there 'cause mama was there.  We sit over there, "You better sit down and be quiet."  One of things about the Church of God in Christ be they very strict on the children.  Wasn't no such thing as letting the children being bad, oh no, not when we came along.  Parents didn't allow, 'cause everybody was our mama, everybody was our daddy.  And, and if we did something or other that mama didn't want Mr. Edward [ph.] would whip us and I better go home and tell mama and then she'd whip me.  And don't let mama tell daddy [James Evers] that I did--and then daddy he would never whip me (makes sound) but he'd fuss something like that.  Daddy never whip me, never did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) so your mother was the disciplinarian?
Speaker 2: Oh Lord, yeah.
Story_ID: 652319
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Jesse Wright Evers] a good cook?
Speaker 2: Oh yes indeed.  That woman could make some cake that make your mouth, oh yeah and cooked, we'd--potato pie, sweet potato pie oh out of sight, and chicken and dressing.
Speaker 1: Some of your favorite things, okay?
Speaker 2: That's what my daddy [James Evers] wanted her do that, "Your job to take care of our children."  Daddy had no education.  So mama took care of all the things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The one thing I loved about him he wasn't, he wasn't afraid.  See most black--colored folks were scared of white folk, daddy wasn't scare of no white folks.  And daddy was (unclear), "He's just another old peckerwood (laughter)."  And he'd do this (gesture) same--, "That hurt?" "Yeah." "That--same hurt me hurt that peckerwood too."  But, he never was afraid of white people.  They all, all respected everybody.
Speaker 1: So, they respected him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: As he respected them, okay.
Story_ID: 652320
Speaker 1: Okay so, now when you come back from the [U.S.] Army.  Now but, before that, let's see, now I know you have heard about lynchings and things like that going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah, I knew about them.
Speaker 1: What, what, what do you know about, what do you know about that?
Speaker 2: M- Mr. James Tingle [sic. Willie Tingle] and now I think about it, it calls--brings back bad memories now.  Was one of our leading citizens in Decatur [Mississippi] and the, for some reason they lynched Mr. Tingle.  But, they claimed Mr. Tingle had said something to a white woman, which I, which was a lie.  We always knew that, I was a old--a little young thing.  They took him down to the fairgrounds and hung him.  And that's the thing I hate I ever saw.  And they had us, we were--left him hanging there.  And most of the colored folks went down there and saw him hanging there.  I can remember that right now.  And that's the one thing almost made me hate white people.  But, my mama [Jesse Wright Evers] always told me (gesture), "All white people ain't bad.  All white people ain't bad."  And I remember that very dearly.  They hung Mr. Tingle for no reason.  Even if he was gonna, he wasn't raping her.  And I said after I was grown up, I said, "What the hell so what."  White people, white women always been--bothered black men.  Let me tell you when I was a kid.  I was working at the store--did I tell you about, I ain't told you yet.  I was washing dishes I was and Decatur right now that same little old restaurant still there.  And this white gal, me and her would be there the first thing there in the morning.  When I'd be washing dishes, she'd come up behind me and rub her breast all on my back.  I said, "Ms. Ed [ph.] please don't," 'cause it was right on the street.  And if any white man had walked by and saw her doing that then they'd have blamed me.  I said, "Ms. please don't, please don't do that, please don't do that."  She just keep rubbing her, I just, finally I got out, out from under her.  I left that, that restaurant and I ain't been back to work there no more.  I went home and told my mother.  That's when I start leaving home.  And I told me mother about it, she said, "Just be careful Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers], don't you--you don't have to go there no more," so I said, "Okay."  So, I didn't, I left and went to Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  That's when I started drifting, all over.
Speaker 1: Well and what, what age was this?  What age were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was about fourteen.
Speaker 1: Well what age was it when Mr. Tingle gets lynched?
Speaker 2: About the same time, all of it was about the same time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Just thinking, that was a terrible--ooh that shocked the colored community, and the white.  'Cause Mr.--people liked old Mr. Tingle.
Speaker 1: Who was Mr. Tingle?
Speaker 2: Just a, just a old, a well known citizen, colored man in Decatur that worked for different people.  And I still believe this, this white woman, I still blame--she's dead and gone to hell now thank god.  But I still believe she could have saved him.  But, she wouldn't dare.  And he, they claimed he, he was going, trying to go, or something like that, trying to--he, Mr. Tingle ain't did that.  We all knew about that.  But, there wasn't no white, no black gonna try rape no white woman (laughter).  Because the white woman--they didn't even know what the cuss words was.  That's why now when I see white and black couples together I just admire, 'cause I know the price that's been paid for them to be together.  And see white people and black people living together like we do now, I just, it just sends chills through my body.  'Cause I know the price our older blacks had to pay, to get us to this point.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And old whites had to pay.  'Cause see even in that time all white people, all white, I'm not saying 'cause he sitting back there (gesture), a white man, all white people ain't bad.  And all black wasn't good.  But, why the hell would they wanna go and destroy him 'cause the color of his skin.  It's ignorance, I said it to, to all my white friends, "You all just ignorant," and they was.  Well, I say, you know I got, I said it to them any number of times, "You all can't do without us and we can't do without you all."  I said, "First of all even your old grandmamma know they would mistreat us then leave you all in there while they go out and get drunk.  And leave us, they let us raise you all from little kids up until you got grown.  They fixed your meals, they do everything for you, but yet they hated niggers."  I say, "You all just ignorant." I tell my white friends that and they, "You all just ignorant," I say, "Now that you all know better I'm sure glad for you all."  And one white woman, "I'm glad for you all too," (laughter), oh Frank [ph.], so it just, just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It's been such a wonderful thing has happened.  Wait now just because just because it was in Mississippi, the same damn way it was in Chicago [Illinois] and New York [New York], wasn't no different.  B. B. [HistoryMaker B. B. King] and me, and Jackie Robinson are the best of friends.  And Jackie could not stay in the hotel, when he became, in New York, in Chicago.  So, and it's, it's, racism is a terrible thing, it's a sickness to hate somebody because the color of their skin.
Speaker 1: Yeah, color of their skin.
Speaker 2: And there I go.
Story_ID: 652321
Speaker 1: Jackie, when did you met Jackie Robinson?  How did you become friends?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't, you know, I used to just meet people.  You see people, I just meet them.  I never felt like nobody no different than me.  You, you have something you doing, what you doing is different, you no different than I am.  You know, I (unclear), I come in say, "Hey how you doing I'm [HistoryMaker] Charles Evers."  And, and how'd I meet Jackie I don't even remember how I met Jackie now, but we became very close.  He used to stay in my house when he'd come into town [Decatur, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] the same way.  Sammy and I, we got so we were, he and I used to go, he loved to own stuff, didn't pay for a damn thing (laughter) Sammy Davis.  And we were down in the Bahamas.  And went on a (unclear) and we out there I say, "Sammy, suppose one of them big waves come and turn us over?" "Oh man don't talk like that."  One of them big wave come and kicked us over in that little old yacht we was on.  And we was very close, Sammy Davis.  Died broke as a jack rabbit, didn't have a dime.  But, he, he lived it up.  Fast as he made it he spent it.  And Frank Sinatra really stood by him.  That goes to show you that you can't all white people is bad.  All white people, or all black people is, that's just not true.  There're individuals who ain't worth a cuss, white and black, Chinese and Japanese and all the rest of them.  But, as a whole, people are just good, (unclear).  And that's why I live, that's why I don't allow nobody in and I've owned it for thirty years.  Better not hurt nobody's feeling here.  Like when they called and told me, "You--." I say, "I don't, I don't remember. Am I supposed been here?  When did we set this up? I don't remember when I set this up?  My wife probably did that didn't she?"  Okay, go on there I go.  You notice I just take over don't I (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 652322
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's go to you're, you're coming out of the [U.S.] Army.  Now, you have, you and your brother [Medgar Evers] had visited Chicago [Illinois] before this time, is that not right?
Speaker 2: Well, let me see, did I go to, yeah.  We visited some--we had friends in Chicago just visiting, we didn't live there.
Speaker 1: No, no visiting I'm saying as a youth before you went into the Army had you been to Chicago before that time?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so, did I?
Speaker 1: No, okay?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, it's been so long (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, when you come out of the Army what happens, when you come out of the Army?
Speaker 2: That's another sad story.  We flew in, flew us in to Camp Shelby, Mississippi.  And in Camp Shelby we got off the bus, on the plane they carried us to the camp.  And at camp had the coloreds still, still that silly old mess.  The colored troops were over--soldiers over here and the white troops were over her.  And when we get in to come home, which is to Jackson [Mississippi] (unclear).  I got on the bus in my uniform and sat down.  And oh buddy, "You can't sit down there nigger."  And what he say that for I went off.  And, "You gonna sit back," I say, "You so and so," I don't know what all I even called him.  "Do you realize that I'm wearing (unclear) went and fought for you?"  I used to be real nasty mouth. "You SOB, you," I say, "and you gonna sit there and tell me I can't sit anywhere there's a seat?"  And he said, "That's what I say," I said no, I said, "Well I'm, I'm sitting here."  So, he jump up and went and got the police and they arrested me.  In uniform for sitting on the seat.  You know, America's been so low down.  Thank god it's so good now.  Ain't good enough but, it's so much better.  Anyway that was an experience I had come out of the Army.  And I got out, and they let me out and I came on home to Decatur [Mississippi].  And I never forgot that.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after coming home?  What was your first job or first activity, once you got home?
Speaker 2: Oh I didn't do anything.  I mean (unclear) I mean I went I thought, I enrolled in school.  Going back to school.  Went to high school down in Alcorn [Mississippi].  And stayed in the dormitory, came out of the high school and went on to college at Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi].  And then I--mean time I was operating, helping my uncle [Mark Thomas] with the funeral business.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I came I took over the funeral home in Philadelphia, Mississippi [Charles Evers Funeral Home].
Story_ID: 652323
Speaker 1: So, when do you get involved with civil rights or the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Medgar [Medgar Evers] and I started NAACP, before I went, before I went to Chicago [Illinois].  Here's what happened.  Roy Wilkins, Gloster Current [Gloster B. Current], the so called big shot darkies who's head of the NAACP, had heard and, and President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] had heard about Medgar and I trying to get Negroes to do certain things.  Let me tell you how got that, here I go again.  One day Medgar and I was in Decatur [Mississippi] standing on the courthouse square.  I like to tell this story.  And an old white man, half bent over, walk by me and look at me and said, "Let me tell you niggers something."  I flinched and Medgar said, "No, no Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]." "You all niggers won't never be nothing. Until you all learn how to vote."  I looked at him, "You hear me?  Until you learn how to vote."  I say, "What do you mean by that?"  He said, "Who's the mayor?"  I said, "I don't know."  "Who the sheriff?"  I said, "I don't know."  "You see what I'm telling you?  You see what I'm telling you niggers?"  So, Medgar kept telling me, "No Charles, no Charles," 'cause he, he's always the peace maker.  So, he said, "Until you all learn how to vote, you ain't gonna never be nothing."  And that stuck with me.  And I told her [sic.], I say, "You know what?"  I went home and I asked my women, then they didn't know.  And they didn't know, I mean I think they knew but they didn't know, they just knew of them.  And from that day on, we went back, went back to Alcorn [Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College; Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] and started getting our school mates to go back home in their neighborhood up in Delta [Mississippi Delta] and get our folks and go register and they had hell broke out.  That's when we started.  And John Kennedy was president and just become president.  And he heard about the Evers boys.  Course, I mean, 'cause at that time, for, for, for niggers trying to register in Mississippi was, that was headlines and he got up and he, and he called Medgar, President Kennedy called Medgar.  And Medgar went and met with him and they became friends.  And then when he was killed and Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy] and I were friends before when that sort of put the family together.  Between Medgar and John and me and Bobby.  And then when John was killed--they both came to Medgar's grave, and when John was killed I went up and Ethel [Ethel Skakel Kennedy] and we had, by that time we had gotten to be good friends, the Kennedys and, and me.  And that's how it happened one of those kinds of crazy ways.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then we, then after that I became--Medgar became head of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay, well (unclear) let me see we're in 1948 now.   So let's, let's before we go forward.  You all start the NAACP, now was first chartered in, in Vicksburg [Mississippi] right?  And then they had to recharter it again?  But, do you know about the Misssis- Mississippi State Conference, which led a lot of the, the demonstrations and voter registrations (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Medgar was the head of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Medgar was the one that lead that.  'Cause became Medgar took over it was quiet, it was very quiet.  But, Medgar became the field secretary of the NAACP.

Speaker 2: Oh yes indeed.  Aaron was president of the branch up in Clarksdale [Mississippi].  He was the first black elected official in state--Mississippi State Legislature.

All of them gone, I'm the only one left.  Isn't that something, and, and I look around all the time say, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers] are you next.

But, Dr. Mason along with the rest of us.  He led us and we followed him on the beaches.  And they (unclear) but see, I ain't never turned the other cheek.  And we weren't supposed to, but I'd fight them, I'd fight them rascals like nothing.  And we all got fighting down there and totally, finally we totally integrated the beaches.  Now we can go, you can go around there now.  And slip on your, your bathing suit and sit down there as long as anybody else, there, whites all around you don't think nothing about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Under Gilbert Mason, sure did.
Story_ID: 652324
Speaker 1: So then you, okay so now we can move on to, to Philadelphia [Mississippi] and you become a deejay of, of what?
Speaker 2: W (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about the radio station?
Speaker 2: Well I, I was what happened was I owned the funeral home in Philadelphia.  And they were advertising my Barrow (unclear) the name of my, Evers Funeral Home [Charles Evers Funeral Home, Philadelphia, Mississippi], Thomas Barrows Association [ph.].  See Tom [Thomas Barrows (ph.)] was my uncle.  He had the, he had the, I had the funeral home Uncle, Uncle Mark [Mark Thomas] had the insurance.  So, it's a combination.  So, I wanted to, wanted to--Harvey Cole [sic. William Howard Cole] was a little old white boy who owned WHOC [WHOC Radio, Philadelphia, Mississippi].  I heard my advertisement and I said, "Hell this ain't nothing."  I went out there one day, as usual hot headed.  I say, I say, "May I speak to Harvey?"  No, no, "Mr. Cole?" I say, "May I speak to Harvey Cole the owner of the station?"  Then she, then she went and got.  "[HistoryMaker] Charles Evers out here." "Hi Charles, hi how you doing?"  I say, "I, I don't like what I'm hearing on the radio about my funeral home."  "What you mean?"  I say, I say, "Who's going to buy Evers Funeral Home and Thomas Barrow Association?" He said, "So then, you do it."  I said, "I will," just like that.  And you see my picture up there that's how I started.  He carried me in there and, and sat me down between them same two tables or, they're somewhere, they out there, he sat me, do you see them?  Sat me down between the two at, (gesture) that's WHOC.  And that's when I--showed me how to spin 78s [78 rpm record], at that time, records.  Showed me how to spin, said, "Now you advertise your own thing."  And that's how I got adver- and I started advertising my own funeral home and on Barrows Association.  And then were I made the mistake at I started telling Negroes go register and vote and good God almighty.  The heat came down on Harvey to fire me, Harvey wouldn't fire me.  And that's why I have so much respect for a lot of, for white people 'cause all of they all wasn't bad, wasn't bigots.  He said, "I'm not going to fire him for that."  And he kept me and they, they just started taking all the contracts await from WHOC and I quit.  By that time they sued me.  And claimed that I was doing something, just a total lie.  That I, that I was disturbing the, 'causing problems before I left.  They sued me and downtown at the courthouse, there in Philadelphia.  And got a seventy-five thousand dollar judgment against me.  And back in those days seventy-five thousand dollars was like a million dollars now, come on.  Well, I have no seventy-five thousand and they came to my house and took, took my, I had just bought my wife [Evers' ex-wife, Nannie Laurie Evers], I was married for a little while not long, took my furniture, a brand new dining room sit down right here and bid off for thirty-five dollars.  And by that time they'd fine somebody I might have got broke I was realizing it's time for me to go.  So, I called Medgar [Medgar Evers] and told him, "I'm gonna go," I said, "I'm going to Flint, Michigan."  At that all the Negroes were going to Flint.  "I'll try to get a job and I'll be back.  But, then we going to go down in Central America, South America and buy land we ain't gonna, and we ain't gonna never come back to America no more."  And that's where he was, so I saw you take care and be careful (unclear).  And I got my old '41 [1941] Ford and, again here I go about white people.  I got just outside of Chicago [Illinois] and was run- I was running out of gas.  I always kept a cup with pennies and nickels in it.  I pulled into this service station and I was trying to count pennies.  He asked, "What you doing son?"  "I'm trying to get some money to buy some gas."  "Get back in your car."  I looked at him I didn't know what he meant.  I said, "I need the gas I'm going to--."  He filled my tank up and didn't charge me a dime.  And I went on in then, into Chicago and I said I'll stop there.  My sister [Elizabeth Evers Jordan] charged me seventy dollars a damn week to sleep on the floor, where her daughter slept.  Wasn't nobody good to me back in them--'cause everybody thought I had money.  I had no money.  Anyway, so that's, that, that was it.  That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I started going from there.
Story_ID: 652325
Speaker 1: I just want to go back and just--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --clarify a few things.  Now, Harvey Cowan, he was the station manager?  Who owned the radio station [WHOC Radio, Philadelphia, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Harvey Cole [sic. William Howard Cole], he owned it.
Speaker 1: Oh, he owned it, but you said somebody wouldn't fire you, who, who?
Speaker 2: Harvey, Harvey no he wouldn't fire me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, Harvey.
Speaker 2: I left, says, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]," I say, "I'm going out 'cause they gonna put you out of business."
Speaker 1: But who, who was, who's started the lawsuit to sue you?
Speaker 2: Somebody said I, no I know what it was.  (Unclear) you forget things, at that time I was married.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And who were you married to?
Speaker 2: Nannie Laura, Nannie Laura McGee [Evers's ex-wife, Nannie Laurie Evers], didn't last but I was married.  And she was coming out to the radio station where I was and some white ladies ran into her and they tore my car up.  And they sued me.  And the judge got a judgment against me.  That's how that came about.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  All right so you go onto Chicago [Illinois], now you were going to Flint [Michigan], so?
Speaker 2: Flint.
Speaker 1: You decide to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got to Chicago and couldn't get no further than that.  And that's where I stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you said with your sister [Elizabeth Evers Jordan].  And, and so this is when you do what?  What, what do you do, you're looking for job?
Speaker 2: Looking for a job.
Speaker 1: So, so what do you do?
Speaker 2: Got a job at Swift Packing Company [Swift and Company].  Couldn't carry that damn heavy meat, had me carrying half a shoulder of meat.  And I had never worked before in my life, nothing, nothing like that.  But, I, I jumped right in and I carried it 'til I could get a better job.  And kept looking around, just look, 'til I finally I decided I'm going to do what I used to do.  Yeah, I'm a bootlegger by trade, I, I used to make my own, made all my own whiskey, sold whiskey for years and, and home brew.  I said, "Well doggone it," I said, "I know what I'm going to do.  I can go back to doing what I was doing in Mississippi."  And I started back to bootlegging.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I ain't stopped.
Story_ID: 652326
Speaker 1: Okay, so you know, as we were talking you know, off camera, you were talking about bootlegging.  And I said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there was a list of things that, you know, have been written about what you've done.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, as far as the mafia--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all these different things.  And you were like no I was never no pimp.  So.
Speaker 2: No, oh no.
Speaker 1: Tell me about it?
Speaker 2: No, what I was--
Speaker 1: Running numbers or anything like that?  You, you tell me what it is that you did, okay?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, well I did what they said, but I wasn't a pimp.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I was, I was an in, I had a house I guess a house of prostitution I guess you'd say.  And I gave the girls--they had their own rooms.  And what they would do I would get paid for whatever time they had to turn a trick with somebody.  But they paid me at the office.  And then whatever she got out of it that was her business.  And that's why, so I, so I wasn't, they wasn't really hustling me, for me.  They were hustling for themselves.  And one pretty little girl I'll never forget out at 63rd [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue].  And she staring at me, hustling trying to get.  So, I go to her, "Come here," I drove to her.  I say, "Come here."  "What you want?"  I said, "Let me talk to you a minute."  So, she come to the side of the car.  She said, "It's five and two."  I say, "What do you mean five (unclear)?"  "Five for me and two for the room."  I said, "I, I don't want none of that, (unclear)." I say, "How about work for me."  "Work for you?"  Cute little thing.  And I said, "Instead of you doing that.  Why don't you come work for me?"  "What do you mean work for you?"  I said, "I, I have a place for I can put you up and let you stay.  You'll have your own room and whatever you make is your business you pay, I get paid so much per head."  So, I get mine first, yeah and you come back (unclear) to get to you.  And then she looked at me and she said, "Are you serious?"  I say, "Yes I'm serious. You are out on the street hustling. I'm going to hustle for you.  Come on and get in the car and let me (unclear)."  I don't know.  I say, "I'm not gonna bother you.  Come on and get in the car, let me carry you show you where my house at."  So, if you ever, you ever, go to Chicago [Illinois]?  At 62nd [Street] and Normal [Boulevard] right now, I hope that building is still there, I owned that.  And I had a, three story.  And I carried in and introduced her to the other girls that where there.  And that's how that started.  And I got my money when they come in, somebody wanna date you, pick you out, then you pay me at the window.  And you came upstairs, where you got, I don't know what you got, and it didn't matter.  So, what I'm talking about, I never was no pimp.  What, that was, a pimp was a guy on some- bring all the money and give to me.  I didn't did do that.  No, I ain't never done that.  Now, what was the other thing?
Story_ID: 652327
Speaker 1: What about running numbers?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Did you run numbers?
Speaker 2: Oh no, oh yeah, I had my own numbers.  Yeah, I remember I, I was working with Chester Beady [ph.].  Now, Chester was a big time number man in Chicago [Illinois].  But, Chester was having trouble with the mafia.  I said, I said, "Chester, let's call the head of the mafia and, and, and sit that cracker down, just like that."  "You can't (unclear)."  "Can we just try?"  So, we call the headquarters and we told the man, told him we wanted to speak to Petro [ph.].  And he came told, he (unclear), "What do you want?"  "Well we want to have a meeting."  Chester just, he's halfway shaking.  I said, "Man damn these crackers, they same as in Mississippi."  We went and had a meeting he made (unclear) and he had let us come in.  We sat and talked.  And we said, "Now we understand that you telling us we can't have jukes."  I own my on juke box and my own place.  I had two or three different places by that time.  I was rolling by that time.  And I had me a couple of juke boxes in my own place.  He telling me I can't play it.  I said, "Let me tell you one damn thing, you gonna tell me I can't put juke box in my own place, and you can put them." "Yeah, that's what I said." "That's not true."  "What do you mean?"  I said, "We're not gonna--." I said, "Listen now you stay over there with the, with them white folks.  I'm gonna stay over with the color folks.  Now, I'm going to put juke boxes in my place.  And whatever it takes to put in there, I'll keep 'em there.  You understand that."  "You know who you're talking to?"  "I don't give a damn who I'm talking to, I'm telling you about my own personal business."  (Unclear).  And he finally said, "Well how many places you got?"  At that time I had three, I said, "I have three and I have one in Chicago at six- 77 [77th Street] and, and, and Indiana [Avenue].  I got another one at, at," yeah, I'm getting old and forgetful, 63rd and no, 12th, 12th Street [Roosevelt Road], what was that?  What is 12 Street in Chicago?  What is that 12th Street, 12th well anyway 63rd Street and 12th.  I had another one in Argo, Illinois [Summit, Illinois].  And that's where I ran my club out of Argo.  And I said, "You can't put no juke boxes in those places."  "Well?"  I said, "You can't put no I own those I'm putting my own juke boxes in."  So, (unclear) we got up, I said, "Don't you cross me and I won't cross you."  And, and he (laughter) he just standing looking.  I say, I say, "Man ain't nobody thinking about these crackers."  And just like that and he sitting there like you sitting there.  "Ain't nobody thinking about these crackers."  I say 'cause he's got his business and I got my business, this the mafia, now.  "But, he run," they don't run a damn thing in the colored community.  What he talking about?  We (unclear), where you get that from.  And that's how I started selling my bootleg whiskey and making, and went back to making that whiskey cornrow.  And I've been blessed. God, I don't know (unclear) has been so good to me.
Speaker 1: So, and then you, you would make the, you would do the, make the, you said it was corn liquor?
Speaker 2: Whatever they wanted, corn liquor, home brew, or wine; whatever they wanted.  I had it in my basement.  That was my distillery.
Speaker 1: And, and who else was helping you with your business at this time?
Speaker 2: Rudy Shields was my top enforcer, he died last year.  That hurt too.  Rudy Shields took care of all my security to make sure that everything went out the way I wanted.  And I just sort of sat there and directed.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and running the number so you, you held your own bank?  For the numbers?
Speaker 2: Well, not really.  I ain't, somebody might try to say that.  Medgar [Medgar Evers] and I organized State Mutual Savings, State Mutual Savings and Loan in Jackson [State Mutual Federal Savings and Loan Association, Jackson, Mississippi], and Reverend, and Reverend R.T. Smith [Robert L.T. Smith].  That was a savings and loan by that time Negroes couldn't have no bank.  Was organized as State, it's now Liberty Bank [Liberty Bank and Trust Company] here now. No, no I didn't own it, but we, but we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, we'll, we'll, we'll talk, we'll talk about that when we get a little closer.  I, I was referring to running the numbers you know, how you have, your own bank?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The mafia usually would hold the bank for people who were running the numbers.  But, I know in Harlem [New York, New York] they had, they ran their own bank, black folks did.  And I was just wondering if in Chicago you did the same thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did the same thing, I kept, I ran my own.  I didn't whenever somebody--that's when I got in really got in trouble.  My manager let a guy hit me for twenty-five thousand dollars.  And I came home (unclear), I was talking about, hit a woman.  I came home that morning about four thirty.  At that time I was married for a little while.  My wife [Christine Evers] met me, "Why you come home this time of morning."  Whap, and I knocked, she fell all the way down them stairs.  Now, I, I, before she hit the ground I grabbed her, "I'm sorry, but don't ever asked me no questions."  I say, "You (unclear) can stay, you can live like a queen.  Don't ever question what I'm, when I'm coming home."  And then so that's, I mean that's what I'm talking about that.  Then I picked her up and got her straightened out.  And ain't--that was the end of that, that marriage.

Hiding him from the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], they gonna kill him too.  And, and we did the investigation of who killed him and why he was killed.  And that's what we did.  So, I was working with Medgar and Medgar was the head.  I just worked with him.  And furnished the money.  I was still bootlegging 'cause I didn't want the people to know I, I was bootlegging, running all kinds of stuff.  And old folks think and if you have some money you want to get rid of, and need it covered up bring it to me and I'd loan you money and I take it, yeah.

Speaker 1: So, tell me, tell me about that day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh god.
Speaker 1: --tell me about when you, when that happened?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I was--I had been on one of my runs.  And me and my boys came to drop me off.  I said, "What are all these damn cars doing at my house?"  And when I came--that time I came in the house people all full of house, full of people.  I say, "What are you niggers doing in my house."  I used the word nigger quite loosely.  "What you doing in my house."  Say, "Go see your wife, she back there."  "What are you doing in my house?"  I was in the racket then and I'm thinking it's something else.  (Unclear) and Nan [Nannie Laurie Evers] said, that's my wife's name.  Nan said, "Sit down Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]."  "What is it?"  She said, "They shot Medgar."  (Unclear), "Oh they can't kill--the Evers, we don't die that easy."  She said, "No Charlie he's dead."  And what he say that for I went crazy.  And I called all my thugs up.  That same night I sat there grieving over Medgar.  I said, "We have to go to Mississippi.  We going to Mississippi and we gonna kill white folks until they kill us."  And then Pete [ph.] said, "Oh Charles please don't, please don't, oh no it's (unclear)."  So, I called to talk to Myrlie [HistoryMaker Myrlie Evers-Williams] she just all broke she couldn't even talk.  I said, "Well I'll be there tomorrow."  The next day, back in those days you, you, you could, you could carry guns on the plane.  I put on I had a sawed off carbine.  I got on the plane with my carbine and my .38 that I got, you just saw the one there.  I keep them with me at all times.  And I got on the plane and came on down to Mississippi.  And brought three of my thugs, my main, these two thugs.  And we, we close to, just going to kill white folks 'til they kill us.  And I was sitting in my off- I sitting in my office by the desk.  It was like the door opened and I was sitting in Medgar--and it was Medgar's office then, on Main Street [in Jackson, Mississippi] here.  And like Medgar said, "Charles no," I could hear his voice say, "No, do it my way."  And I just kept looking around like I'd hear him talking to me.  I looked I got up you know, out my chair I keep hearing voices.  And I sat back down and could hear him saying, "Charles no, do it my way."  And that was registering to vote, get people to register to vote.  And I called my thugs in, I said, "Y'all come in here, we gonna change our plan," just like that.  All within the, the moment, "And we not gonna kill no white folks."  "What do you mean?"  I say, "We's not gonna kill them.  We gonna do what we can to try to Negroes to go and register and get 'em elected."  Back at that time we no elected officials in Mississippi.  And that's how it happened.  I can get emotional as I talk, but anyway, I.  You know, that's how it happened on that part.  And we, we kept rolling getting more regis- now we have the highest number of any state in the nation, we got more blacks elected in this State of Mississippi than another state in the nation.  Well, simple there's more of us here than there is in other states.  So, that's, that's but that's how it happened.  And that's why I changed from killing white people and hating white people to doing what's right.  And getting people registered.  And get, getting make sure that black people are involved in doing something constructive, rather than.  That's why I'm so upset now with, with black people. We hate each other, for no reason.  Since, since well you don't want to hear all that.  Anyway, since January, twenty-four blacks have been killed by a black in this city.  Okay go on with the story.
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll, we'll get to that point as well.  Okay, so this is now Medgar had also worked with James Meredith?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were the ones who got him to go.  You know, Medgar first applied [to the University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi].  And anyway so then we got James Meredith to go, and we sponsored James Meredith.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. So, oh Medgar did apply to go that school.
Speaker 2: He tried didn't, didn't they wouldn't never accept him, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right and then James Meredith applied a couple of times as well.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we finally got him in.  We were there with him went in.
Speaker 1: And, and that was with the help of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], right (simultaneous)?

Roy told me, "You can't be president," the hell with that, I don't have to be a field secretary.  I said, "I'm gonna have the Mississippi movement."  I named it then and they, "Well no that's, that's for the," and we ain't going to be no more NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I said, "To hell with y'all."  That was Roy and Gloster [Gloster B. Current], them head big shot niggers living up in New York [New York] where it's safe.  I organized, I brought Rudy Shields and some more with me.  So, we started organizing, C.C. Bryant got in.  C.C. Bryant, head up the NAACP down in, got different ones head up the NAACP in different places.  And we started moving on.  And we got started getting Negroes registered.  And I said, it was a white man told me, "'Til you niggers start register and voting ain't nobody thinking about y'all."  I remember that and we kept doing that and today we got the highest number of any other state in the nation.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Not because I did it, but that's because we did it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so actually so when you came back you were, you were not, were you appointed the field director at first.
Speaker 2: No, yeah well anyhow I took I thought I told you.  They--I came back as just as Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers], older brother of Medgar.  And I was in his office and Roy Wilkins who headed the NAACP and Gloster told me I couldn't be here.  I said, "To hell with it."  I started organizing the Mississippi movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just like that.  And I going take, take over all the branches anyway.  'Cause I knew how they all felt about Medgar.  Then they finally decided they wanted me to be a head, take Medgar's place, and named me field secretary.  I said, I said, that little old five thousand, let me tell you.  Sir, don't get offended what I say 'cause it's that way I am.  I said, "Let me tell you niggers something in New York.  You never gonna tell us niggers down in Mississippi what to do."  I say, "We gonna do it our way."  And that's when we started our boycotting.  And I, and I kept, I went back to selling my whiskey and my beer and my stuff illegally, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I made money I, I was able to do it.
Speaker 1: So, next thing that happens is the March on Washington with Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you participate in that?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know Martin and I was very close.
Speaker 1: Oh no I, you have to tell me about that okay?
Speaker 2: Hm?  No Martin King and I was very close, yeah we.  He big in that old thing but he said, "Charles the only thing about it I don't believe in them guns."  I say Martin, I say, "Why, why you always around me then.  You don't be," he say all my men full of guns.  I said, "That's only for protection."  He always talking about you know, we nonviolent, well I ain't nonviolent.  I say I'm nonviolent as long as you don't hit me. You hit me I'm gonna knock you ass off (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We yeah, we were very, very close.  And we got pictures together everywhere I don't know where all of them are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, he stayed at my house.  And he said he felt safer there than anywhere he stayed.  'Cause he knew I had security.  I had men outside.  I always protected him, I, like now still got my own protection.  So, when I came in I, I didn't you'll to see it.  You didn't see that gun did you.  Okay, good.  I always get out my car with my gun in my hand.  'Cause even right now you got a lot of threats from--particularly from blacks 'cause they have a problem with me about different things.  So, I just don't take no chances.
Speaker 1: So, can you describe how you felt on the day in Washington [D.C.] at the march?
Speaker 2: Very good to see so many people, good Lord.  And marching for Medgar, for Martin, for equal rights for everybody.  And there was no disturbance, and just a great day.
Speaker 1: I know, a lot of people talk about civil rights where actually in the South people were actually fighting for equal rights.
Speaker 2: Equal, that's all.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: That's we ever wanted, all Medgar and I ever wanted equal rights.  And then they named it civil right I guess they couldn't think of nothing else, but it's equal rights.  I don't want, I don't want to be superior to no one.  I don't want no one to be superior to me.

Speaker 1: After that, then Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is killed, and--
Speaker 2: Oh god.
Speaker 1: --you talk about that you were friends, you know, with the, Medgar [Medgar Evers] was friends with John and you were very good friends with Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy].  So, tell me what, what that was like?  And about your re- tell us about your relationship with the Kennedy family?
Speaker 2: Well, we just became like Evers family, Kennedy family, that's all, that's all I can say.  I'm close to Ethel [Ethel Skakel Kennedy] and all them now.  In fact, I was with Bobby when he was shot, I was there when he was killed.
Speaker 1: Were you?
Speaker 2: I was right there, I was right there, yeah.  When he was killed.  We were in Los Angeles [California], campaign, we'd won the election.  And when, and the when he went down stairs to the big ball, down to receive it and greet the people.  And he said, "Come on Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]." "I'll watch you on TV."  "Oh come on damn it."  I said, "Okay I'll be on down."  He and Ethel and the rest of family went on down before me.  I said, "Well hell, I'll go on down."  I know I like that cracker, used to call him old peckerwood cracker all the time.  I knew that cracker (unclear).  So, I went on down by myself and I always stand right in front of him because he spoke too long.  I always, I always do this (gesture) to him, when time was up.  And so, I, I was came in as I always do, stood right by in front of him.  He was on the stage speaking.  And when he got--kept going, I (gesture) he was always watch me 'cause, I knew he's, he's, "Well I see it's time for me to go, I guess I spoke too long," or something like that.  And thanked the people for it over and over again.  And he turned, I thought he was coming down and let's go out the front [of the Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California].  When he turned he went back through the ki- I never understood that to this day, why'd he go out through the kitchen.  I guess that's the way he was supposed to go.  Went back through the, that's where they shot him back in the door.  And now I heard the shot.  I thought it was balloon, had balloons everywhere.  And so I heard, "They shot the senator." I broke on the stage he was laying I picked him up just held him.  (Unclear), "Bobby please don't leave me, please don't leave me, please don't leave me us Bobby," and Ethel is screaming, I told Rosey Grier, "Hold Ethel."  And, "Somebody call, call an ambulance, call a hearse quick, an ambulance."  So, we got an ambulance I went with him to the hospital I stayed with him.  He died I was right there.  I, and we carried him back to New York [New York].  And that's another violated, then the men I saw going in to sit, I said no, they put in a casket, they, in there with the casket from New York, from California to New York.  Right beside Bobby all the time.  And then we left there on the train coming back from there.  We had nothing but a stop, they brought him back to, to Washington [D.C.] to bury him.  You know I couldn't go to that funeral.  I just couldn't, I tried and I just couldn't.  And that was the last time I saw him.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I don't want to talk about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.  We were so close and he believed in me and I believed in him.  He, he would have made the greatest president.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: No, that's, that's fine.
Speaker 2: And here gone, my brother and him.  I have nobody left.  So, but the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh.  That's what I have live by that.  I'm sorry.  But that, that's why I'm very remorseful about Bobby and Medgar so.  And Ethel and I are supposed to go up there next month.  She's down in Florida right now.
Speaker 1: Who is that?
Speaker 2: Ethel, Bobby's wife, Ethel Kennedy.

Speaker 1: After this in 1964, the Civil Rights Act of '64 [Civil Rights Act of 1964] is passed.  And then the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] is passed in '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you were helping to get so many people registered to vote.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When was, when did you register to vote and when was the first time you voted in an election?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember, no point in lying.  But, I'll tell you what happened.  We used to have mass meetings every Tuesday night in Fayette [Mississippi].  By that time I was really active in Fayette.  And this, this lady came down and there was election time coming up.  And this little old lady came running down the aisle, "Mr. Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers], Mr. Charles," I say, "Yes ma'am."  "Won't you be our mayor?"  I say, "I don't know nothing about--." I say, "No, no."  "Oh would you be our mayor?"  I said, "I don't think so."  And the crowd said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."  And we had a packed town hall.  I say, "I don't know how to be mayor."  "You can learn."  And I hadn't thought nothing about ever running for office at all.  So, when she got through.  I looked at her and she say, "Everything you ask us to do we do it.  Now, we asking you to be our mayor."  I say, "Yeah you gotta elect me.  You gotta do--," and I wasn't even registered, I was registered in Jackson [Mississippi].  So, I thought about it I said, well what the hell they want me to I guess I'll go on and do it.  Go run, I didn't think I was gonna win.  So, I registered moved my, my membership, my registration to, to Fayette.  'Cause I was still registered here in Jackson.  And I ran for mayor, I didn't campaign at all.
Speaker 1: Did you, well did you move to Fayette at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I see I always I had property in Fayette and always lived there.  But I kept I always lived, I always lived all over.  I always lived in Fayette and here.  But, I always lived here was my main home and Fayette was home when I was from here.  So, I had a residence, I had my home there but I had no residence.  My residence here so I got residence there.  And when I, when I election time I didn't even campaign, they elected me.  So, come on.  And that's how I became mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stayed mayor sixteen years.  And I told them that was enough.  I say, "I been here long enough now."  "No."  I say, "Yeah I gotta go now."  Then I, I didn't like this chancery clerk [Kennie Middleton]. Oh god he was one of the old kind of selfish darky.  And I ran against and beat him, and I became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh well, this, wait let me just back up, just a little bit okay?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Because I just wanted to talk about a few other things that happened before we actually get to you becoming mayor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 652335
Speaker 1: The Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March] in Alabama.  Were you involved in that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, me and [HistoryMaker] John Lewis were right together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me?
Speaker 2: But, see the different between me and John Lewis.  I fought them crackers he wouldn't.  I said, "John don't let that peckerwood beat you like that."  "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]," and I, I was fight them pecker and one came up and hit me I said, "I'm gonna kill you, you redneck bastard you."  I got a dirty mouth.  And he looked at me and I say, "Come on."  And he and I tied I knocked him down and then they jumped on me, and just about got.  But, they beating John, but he wouldn't fight.  We were right there together.  John will tell you was right together, he wouldn't fight.  So we not, I'm not nonviolent.  You rest of you niggers be nonviolent if you want to.  If that pecker hit me, I'm going to hit him back.  That's what happened in, on that.  I finally, they finally put us all in jail.  But, I got right on out, they let us out.  And we lived to march on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The next--that Monday we went back I stayed in jail then, again.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you know [HistoryMaker] Amelia Boynton Robinson?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Amelia Boynton Robinson, Amelia Boynton at that time.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She was part of that, that march as well.  And--
Speaker 2: There was so many of us, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, no problem.  All right so after the march well then 1968.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated.  So tell me about what's going on then, in your mind (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was headed, I was headed to the field when I got the word.  That Martin had been shot.  But, didn't say Martin been killed.  And I got them to call my office back here.  And my secretary Ms. Louey [ph.], "Yeah, yeah mayor," I mean not mayor, mayor, "Mr. Evers, he's been, he's been killed."  I said, "No."  I turned around I went straight to Memphis [Tennessee] and he was.  And we I don't know, we all went crazy, you know, for a while.  Finally got settled.  And I went to Coretta [Coretta Scott King] and told her, "Whatever you need me to do Coretta."  She said, "Charles," she said, "I know you, see you not the nonviolent."  I say, "I'm I ain't going to never be nonviolent, Coretta."  I say, "Look, I say look at Martin, look at Martin."  And, "Yeah but I--don't you--," I said, "I'm not gonna to be nonviolent."  And we talked, we kept arguing, arguing back--back and forth, back and forth.  And (pause) that was a sad day.
Story_ID: 652336
Speaker 1: --That you used, hands that pick cotton now picked the mayor.
Speaker 2: Pick the mayor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Pick, pick.
Speaker 1: All right so let's, let's talk about that and the community and what they--are you ready?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so now let's, let's talk about you're you've already told us that you haven't you didn't have to campaign.  And you hadn't thought about running for it?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Mayor.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you know about the other mayors and that did you realize that you would be the first African American mayor?
Speaker 2: No I didn't.  I sure didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay so, and tell me what, what was your platform.  Once you decided that you would run for mayor?  What was your platform?  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My thing--
Speaker 1: --you had a slogan, what was your slogan?
Speaker 2: To, to be equal and I want, I, most of it was to white people.  If, if I'm elected you'll don't have to leave.  We're not gonna run y'all out of town.  We're not gonna take anything from you.  We're gonna make sure that we all treated equal and fairly.  And that's what I did.  And few of them left.  But, didn't many of them leave.  They tried me.  And they stayed there and we, we, we built Fayette [Mississippi] to where it is.  When, when now it's going back down, because it wasn't nothing.  We made sure that all the streets were paved in every neighborhood.  They weren't down when I became mayor.  Then I brought in houses, so they come out of them the shacks and shanties.  They got new houses all over Fayette, now.  Because I, I, I'm whatever I need to be, I'm a Republican, Democrat, Independent, whoever's in power I always try to be with the power.  And 'cause you if you're in there with the power you get something out of the power if there's something that you want done.  And you gonna find a way of reaping the benefit to you anyway.  And you know, being brought up in the Church of God in Christ I always believe that, do unto others as you have them do unto you.
Speaker 1: So, you ran as an Independent on, or as, for this election or what?
Speaker 2: Well, they just running, I just ran.  They want me I mean they drafted me I didn't run to run I just went on whatever they wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now Fayette, it was a large African American population?
Speaker 2: All town, yeah, about 90, about 80 percent.
Speaker 1: It was like, oh what percentage?
Speaker 2: About 80, 75, 80 percent.
Speaker 1: Eighty-five percent black.  Okay, all right so that you?
Speaker 2: But nobody was elected.  There was no elected officials (laughter).
Speaker 1: There were none?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Story_ID: 652337
Speaker 1: So what happens let me see, the, the next year, man of the year by the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Okay and who is the governor now [John Bell Williams]?  Do you remember was at that time (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Damn, no I really don't know who it was.  It's been thirty years ago (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) okay, all right.  So now it's in 1971 you're gonna run for--
Speaker 2: For governor [of Mississippi] didn't I.
Speaker 1: For governor.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now tell me that.
Speaker 2: I came in second, scared the hell out these white folks.  I came a strong second.  And Bill Waller [William Waller] and I ran.  He was my dear friend.  And he came in, and became the governor.
Speaker 1: And, and what was that election like, I mean, I mean you had to campaign for that?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh yes went all over (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I went all over.  And I was threatened fair.  A couple times had some threats but we didn't pay them no attention 'cause I always carried my own protection with me at all times.  And they took care of me.  And people, I went in to black neighborhoods and public places like the courthouse square.  In front of post office, I didn't go into nobody's neighborhood, no white neighborhood, nothing like that.  I wanted everybody to come.  And I, and I was, I was blessed, I never was--I was threatened once or twice by somebody, by (unclear), but they didn't do anything.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what did you hope to accomplish by becoming governor?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was hoping to do what I hoped every governor do, include all of us.  And give black and white an equal opportunity to become participants in our state.  And, to let us become accepted as the governor, as the mayor, like I've done.  And now we have the highest number of black officials in the country.  No other state has as many elected officials black as we have.  And that's one of the things that I was hoping for.  And for black folk once they get elected do what an elected official is supposed to do, provide services and protection and a good will in your community.  Don't go in, "I'm black and I don't want you--." I don't allow that.  I got a program on, on my station [WMPR Radio, Jackson, Mississippi], I threaten to put off.  They getting too black.  I, I'm, he be here today, I'm going to tell him if you do it one more time you out of here.  I don't believe in racism no kind of way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lost my dearest man in the world, my brother, because of--he was ignorant, the man who killed him.  Just didn't know him.  If Beckwith [Byron De La Beckwith] had met Medgar [Medgar Evers] for ten minutes he wouldn't have killed me.  And, and I know racism is like ignorant, it's something that's stupid.  Hate you 'cause you black or white, come on.  I mean just like if, because something you do to me.  But, just look at you 'cause you black and I'm white I'm gonna hate you.  Come on, that's just pure ignorance, you know that.  And white people just been taught that from their great-grandparents and half of them slept around?  Look all our high yellow blacks.  Because them old dirty white men got them--screwed our women and got babies by them.  And then look at our, look at us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that, you know, I've, I've--again I don't like to 'cause I get real angry because of, white people are now realizing that they were our problem.  They should have taught us how to be loving, and respect for each other, not against each other.  And now, we are our worst enemies, black folks.
Story_ID: 652338
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's talk a little bit about the fact that the man that killed Edgar--
Speaker 2: Medgar [Medgar Evers]. You said Edgar.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry I, I'm sorry I meant Medgar.  And the fact that how did your family when he was arrested and, and then tried and found not guilty?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't like it.
Speaker 1: I know, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We didn't like it but what could we do?  They, they you know, you got a jury and, and the prosecutor and they had found him not guilty at the time.  But, we kept on pushing.  Find him and did find guilty and I told him, and I wouldn't go to the trial because they got totally, the prosecutor, "I don't wanna come."  They begged me to come.  I say, "Well I know I cannot sit there in that courtroom with Beckwith [Byron De La Beckwith].  And look him, and he have that smirk and grin and carrying on."  And now, when they got ready to go, he walked by the table and walk by and said, "Listen did you kill Medgar?"  "The nigger's dead ain't he."  I'd broke his damn neck.  And it, so, wasn't no point in Medgar and me both being in trouble.  I just didn't go to the trial.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Well, yeah, because I, I just wanted to get your take on the fact that they did admit to, to the murders and because of double jeopardy they weren't, he wasn't tried again.
Story_ID: 652339
Speaker 1: You ran as a Independent for, for mayor [of Fayette, Mississippi]; and you said that William or Bill, as you call him, Waller [William Waller] becomes governor and do you believe that he did a, a good job as governor--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --or what do, what do you feel about his administration?
Speaker 2: I admired Bill because he tried to do something that hadn't never been tried.  He tried his best to bring I believe more people together.  Because not the color of their skin because they Mississippians.  He provided some opportunities for blacks, he appointed blacks that had never been there before.  And he just--I just like Bill, he's just a good man.  And when he died I was right there.  Not in, the day he died I was there, he (unclear), and all the time he was sick I went and visited him.  And he was just a good man.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Happened to have been white, but he was right.
Speaker 1: Okay all right so, let's see Richard Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] is president now, during this time.  Now, I know you have been an informal adviser to a lot of presidents.  Which presidents did, did you counsel?
Speaker 2: Nix- oh, Nixon, Nixon, Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush], Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Reagan and I got to be real close.  But, you know what I can say this to you.  Our first black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] never called me one time and asked me to do anything.  And it didn't really bother me in a way, but in a way I say all the white presidents I has either had a desk in the White House [Washington, D.C.].  But he just didn't know me that's all.  And I think his problem was he didn't wanna overdo the black thing.  But, my thing, how in the hell can overdo something you never had.  And I had a problem with him the whole time he was president and still have.  He didn't appoint enough blacks at top positions.  And how in the hell could he appoint Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] secretary of state?  That heifer fought him every step of way when he was running for president.  She ran for it and her husband [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] fought him.  Then he appoint her secretary of state, I said, "Man you must be out of your damn mind."  So, I never forgave for that (unclear), you know there we go. I better be getting--but he out of there now. The hell with him.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  But we'll, we'll talk more about that when we get to that--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No I'm sorry I mean that. I ain't got no--whole lot of love for him.  The hell with him.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But he could have done more, for everybody.  And why shouldn't he, even white folks say that.
Story_ID: 652340
Speaker 1: We were talking, okay, Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] we said was, was president, and now--
Speaker 2: I liked him.
Speaker 1: --the next thing that happens for you.  You're selected as a Mississippi delegate for the Democratic National Convention [1972 Democratic National Convention, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you had run as an Independent.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And now you, you're elected and this is in, in Miami [Florida].  So tell me about that--
Speaker 2: Well, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause I think George McGovern is--
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: George McGovern was selected as the presidential candidate that year.  That you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't nothing to make talk about just that I had to, had to be the one, be the one after nominating him, at that time.  (Unclear) no I tell you he couldn't win.  But, we got him to make a try something.  If you don't try you don't win.  And we, we, we raised a lot of folks and a lot of stink.  But, they know he didn't (unclear).  We, we were treated very well by the Democratic Party, but we still living under segregation and discrimination.  Sad.  And I never understood, I still to this day why would you want to segregate against somebody 'cause the color of their skin?  I just don't understand that.  I don't or like, won't like you because of what you do or how you treated me.  Not because you white or black.  And you know and some of my dearest friends now white as that, that door.  I mean it's friends, ain't got nothing to do 'cause they white, it's friends.  Just like the Kennedys now we just as close as close as we can be.  And I don't know I'm not trying to brag and drop names but it's true.  So and but me and, me and the Obamas never was so close.  I think Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] had a fear of people thinking he's doing too much for his own people, for black folk.  But, he was half and half anyway, his mama [Ann Dunham] white and his daddy [Barack Obama, Sr.] black.  So, what the hell he (unclear) what they're doing?  He just.  He just up there.  I did support him, reluctantly.
Speaker 1: You said you did support him?
Speaker 2: Reluctantly.
Story_ID: 652341
Speaker 1: Once again you, you run for, as a Independent for U.S. Senate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your hopes at that time, when you were running?
Speaker 2: I wanted to win, so I can become the first, not the first. It would be the first black senator since Reconstruction, in Washington, D.C. [sic.].  And I would care things that no other person would care, equal rights.  No one talks about that just equal rights for everybody and make damn sure that no one's denied equal rights because of the color of his or her skin.  And I'd, I'd used that the whole time I was there.  Do unto others as you'd have them do to you.  And I would have hired black and white on my staff.  I'd have hired women and men on my staff and that's something most of them just don't do.
Speaker 1: All right so who, who actually won that election, for U.S. Senate. Do you remember in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 2: Oh, it wasn't Waller [William Waller]. Who, who was it? I don't know who it was. I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: You don't remember, okay, no problem.

Speaker 1: Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] becomes president.  And, and so tell me about you relationship with Ronald Reagan, and how that came about?
Speaker 2: I think it's because of Reagan, he needed, he did a lot of reading I found that out.  And evidently he had found out about what I, what we were doing, Medgar [Medgar Evers] and I was doing in Mississippi, on voter registration and equality.  And he sort of reached out to me.  And I became, he offered me a job just like this president did.  Offered me a job I said, "Mr. President, I ain't never work for no white folks in my life.  And I, I don't wanna, 'cause if I work for then you have an opportunity to fire me."  This what I told him, looking dead at him.  "If I stay as your supporter you can always respect me to that point, you, you can't hire or fire me."  "Well it's just--."  I say, "Nah Mr. President, I just don't want no job."  I told this president [President Donald John Trump] the same thing and it ain't been a month ago.  So, I don't take jobs, I like to make my own money, my own way, 'cause if I make it that way then nobody get upset.  So, and he sort of took me and asked, could he call upon me to help him out when he needed me.  Now, I knew, I knew what that he talking about.  I, I say, "Mr. President, why don't you let me just sort of be your colored advisor on colored folk's issues." They said we was colored back in those in them days.  Colored issues.  "Will you do that?"  I say, "Yes sir."  And then he headed on down south.  Then he sent Marlene and I, that's daughter wasn't it?  Maureen [Maureen Reagan], who I'm talking about Reagan?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, then he became real close to the people in Africa.  And, and, and they needed somebody to go to Senegal, you ever go to Senegal, Dakar.  And downtown Senegal, there was a place called Jackson Square [sic.].  [HistoryMaker] Charles Evers and Marlene took one of the air forces and a crew to Senegal, Dakar.  And I'm the one who accepted that for the United States and brought it back to the president.  So, we, we so we just and he had, had me do a lot of little things like that.  And doing them here and there but and I just like him; he straightforward. I like he was tough.  See I like tough men.  And Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], I couldn't never stand him.  That's sad to say, and the man never, didn't even know me.  But, I got to ask, I got to ask her, I got ask what was her name, what is his wife name?
Speaker 1: Rosalynn [Rosalynn Carter]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He, if he wanted to go to the bathroom, "Rosalynn, can I go to the bathroom?"  I'm going to an extreme I know.

Speaker 1: What about Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon], 'cause we, we didn't, even talk about Vietnam [Vietnam War] and, and, and Nixon and Watergate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: --I, I like Nixon.  He and I got to be good friends. So, naturally I ain't gonna say negative about him, 'cause I liked him.  I didn't agree with some of things he did.  But, he still was a friend of mine.  And I was a friend of his.  Anything he thought that, that the black, the colored needed, he'd call me and ask me what this, what this and that now.  And I would sit down and give him my advice and then I would be going into the community wherever they having trouble and try to settle things for him.  I'd go in there for him.  You remember Nixon went to a lot of black communities now during his presidency a lot of people don't know that.  And, but, that, that, then they didn't publish that, I don't know why they didn't publish that.  But, we did.  I like Nixon he was, he was a--
Speaker 1: Did any of these presidents come to, which presidents came to Jackson [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: When they--the one now [President Donald John Trump] came here a couple of times.  And President Bush [President George Walker Bush] came here.  He, he spoke at the Medgar [Medgar Evers] (unclear).  George the younger one.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) George W.--okay.
Speaker 2: He came, spoke for my brother's memorial service.  Who else?  That's about it I guess.
Story_ID: 652344
Speaker 1: So, then you run for mayor again and you lose to Kennie Middleton.  Tell me about that election in 1981 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was tired of being mayor.  And I didn't want to be mayor, I wasn't campaigning.  Kennie was a young boy who wanted to be something so I said, "Run."  He ran and then, what, I didn't win? I beat him, didn't I? And then I stepped down.
Speaker 1: No, well.
Speaker 2: Did I?
Speaker 1: No the first time you lost to him in '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: Did I? I don't remember.
Speaker 1: And then in '85 [1985] you win against him.  Once again you, you win against him in, in '85 [1985].
Speaker 2: Did I win?
Speaker 1: Yes, 1985 yes.
Speaker 2: I don't know why I did that 'cause I being spiteful.  Old folks say just being spiteful I didn't need to be there 'cause I (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay so, what, what you do, what do you believe, 'cause you, you told me all the things that you, some of the things that you did for Fayette [Mississippi].  But, what was your greatest accomplishment do you believe?
Speaker 2: I think the greatest accomplishment I always say was bringing together the races there.
Speaker 1: And how did, how did you?
Speaker 2: I because the beginning worked together, there was no fear of each other.  I don't, I because I was so open and down to earth with them, the whites there.  And 'cause I went to them and asked them to do things.  Not to leave them because we were colored in charge.  "I'm gonna treat them just like I treat everybody.  I'm not gonna let nothing to happened to y'all.  I'm not gonna boycott you or put you you'll out of business.  'Cause we need your store, we don't own no stores."  So, I went to them and talk to them from a business standpoint.  And, and somehow or another the Dorseys [ph.] who were all white and the (unclear) and the McMillans [ph.] and all them white people, they listen to me.  And I, I'd just go to their business, sit down and talk to them as the mayor.  And began then they naturally they had blacks worked for them in the different business.  So, they began to see that.  And I think that helped to bring together a lot.  And a lot of them didn't think I was gonna be as fair as I was.  The thought because I headed an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and become, I was gonna get even.  I never did that.  I don't believe in getting even.  I believe in equality, being fair.  And I asked them, I asked a lot of the white businesses, the few white businesses we had there, to hire color folks, and put them positions--not just hire them and let them cut your yard and sweep your ground and all that stuff.  Let them work in the stores.  And they did it.  They'd pick out their special kind of colored you know a woman or a man but that kind of thing.  And I guess the Lord just give me these things and not try to get even with nobody.  I don't do that.  I, I, I never, people who I know have fought me I just ignore them and keep them here. They can't do nothing but just think unto themselves.  And I, I, stayed protected and you saw them when I came in.  I always got, I, I have gun in every room, in every car and they in all my drawers I got a gun only for protection.  And I won't use it unless I have to, but I, I have it right handy.  And so for that reason I guess people know me and most of them know it.  You see [HistoryMaker] Charles Evers you know he got a .38 on him.  And not to attack but to protect anybody from attacking him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's fair.
Speaker 2: How much more?
Speaker 1: All right so, not much longer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 652345
Speaker 1: You lose the, the mayoral race in '89 [1989], but you've already served for twenty years [in Fayette, Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Yeah, too long.
Speaker 1: Okay and but you join the Republican Party, tell me why the switch?
Speaker 2: Well, because let me tell you why I never was a really Democrat because the Democrats were always our enemy.  Eastland [James Eastland] or Stennis [John Stennis] or (unclear) or Strom Thurmond, all them were dirty racists, Democrats.  And first for me to become a Democrat I'm a part of them.  And I, I saw but I did become a independent Democrat because it was the only way to get in to political power.  And just didn't wanna be and I wanted to be a Republican.  Because the Republican Party are the ones who gave us civil rights, under, Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] started it.  Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] carried it out but the Republican Democrats--I mean Republican senators in the [U.S.] Congress they the ones voted for it.  All our Southern Democrats voted against civil rights.  And economic rights.  So, why should I be a part of a party that vote against whether I'm to be free and be, be for a party that's against us, no.  And I always like to, I like to I like (unclear) and I was good friends.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: Jeff [ph.] something (unclear) of New York.  And I, I like I sort of like I like the Republican, they more, right they seem more level you know.  Look at Bush, Bush and them hired--appointed more blacks to top positions than any president we ever had.  The Bushes [President George Herbert Walker Bush and President George Walker Bush].  And like I said Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], I just like him, he just crazy, I used to say crazy old peckerwood, but you knew where he stood.  Wasn't the kind of guy, "Well I, I no." He say, "Bam, bam, bam."  And I like direct people whether you white or black it doesn't matter be who you are.  And I like that about Reagan.  I thought that about him, maybe he wasn't but I thought he was.  And this scandal came up. Well it wasn't really him.  It was his party and him.  He was a part of it.  Well, let's don't get into that. I guess we'll leave that alone.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet, well of course you did if you were friends with Reagan, Nancy Reagan.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of people talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Beautiful woman.
Speaker 1: --the fact that, she had a lot of power behind the man.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think about that?
Speaker 2: Every woman does.  Don't you have power behind your man?  All right then if you don't you ain't you, yes indeed.  Every man--who am I, I ain't never had a wife long enough to say anything about this, but I'm saying it.  Sit down with his woman and discuss things.  And every woman discuss things with her man.  Whether it got--it ain't got to be president, he could be a shoeshine boy.  But you talk and you decide what's the best thing for you all to do, to get what you want.  Don't they?  So, I, I why they got to say it, yes she had influence with him. That's his wife.  And his children's mother.  I'm always defending him now.  He--ain't never say negative thing about him. I just like him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he liked me.
Speaker 1: You didn't talk about, well you--very little about Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]. He, he kind of wasn't on your--?
Speaker 2: No he wasn't my type.  I didn't, I didn't like Bill Clinton particular 'cause I just don't think he's a presidential kind.  And I thought he was too whorish.  I think a man, we all love women, but be discreet about it.  See Bill he would screw a gal in his office.  Come on now, you president of the United States.  And, and he treated, I just thought, I just didn't like him.  Because of his character.
Speaker 1: Well, you know Kennedy, who you were friends with, you know, he was no saint either.
Speaker 2: Oh no, but he, he but was discreet about it.  Uh-oh. Which one, Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy] or John [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy]?
Speaker 1: John.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John, yeah.  John love--we all love women.  You think at ninety-four I don't love women? I sure don't love no damn man (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so you already expressed how you feel about Obama, President Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Weak, I thought he was weak.
Speaker 1: And the, and his elections, okay.
Story_ID: 652346
Speaker 1: Let's go back a little bit to, because we want to talk about where we are today at this radio station [WMPR Radio] here in Jackson [Mississippi].  So, you, you first become a deejay back in the '50s [1950s] right, in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, WHOC [WHOC Radio], no, I--in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay, In Philadelphia, I'm sorry in Philadelphia, Mississippi (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) WHOC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And in the 1950s, 'cause we really didn't go into about radio and deejays back in the '50s [1950s] in southern radio or black radio.  So, do can you talk to that and tell me, how you were listening to as you know, because black radio really, 1950, there were a few but since you were going back and forth to Chicago I'm sure you heard a lot of the, the deejays because they were prevalent in, in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but most of them were just, were just comedians.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And I mean that, I mean most of the deejays that I knew the black ones were they were all joking and carrying on and carrying on.  You know cracking jokes and that type of thing.  I didn't know of any really serious deejay back in that day other than Al Benson.  Al Benson you, you know of Al Benson?  Now Al and I were good friends.  But Al was a business deejay, businessman and a--Al, I learned a lot from listening to Al.  But, in my case I always thought Al was always about, let's do something, politics.  The other, [HistoryMaker] Herb Kent and all them they all you know Herb Kent?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They joking and having a lot of fun and carrying on, all them guys.  But Al impressed me.
Speaker 1: What about Howard Miller?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: Or, or what was the other, Halloween, what's his [sic. her]--Martin [Halloween Martin] I think his name?
Speaker 2: I didn't know him either.
Speaker 1: You didn't either of those.  Okay all right, but Chess, Chess Records?
Speaker 2: Chess, Chess, old Leonard [Leonard Chess].
Speaker 1: Lennie Chess, yes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He and I had a couple of run ins but that's all right.
Speaker 1: Well he's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 1: You had a couple of runs with about what?
Speaker 2: Well, he would, what he, what Leonard wanted the, and he said, he did end up, he's dead now, I think he is dead, I know he is now, yeah.  Leonard wanted to own everything and he wanted everything to be, whatever he wanted to put it where he wanted to put.  I said you can't put it in my place, unless I let you.  And what you, you can put it, you know, he (unclear) in the juke box business.  (Cough) And that's one of our biggest, first argument came in.  You can't own no juke boxes in my place, he wanted to know why, 'cause it's mine.  And the (unclear) went on, but we finally got to be fairly (unclear) but we never became buddies.
Speaker 1: Right, but he, his leadership helped Don Cornelius was on his radio station right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois], yes okay.  That was the first twenty-four hour radio station correct?  Okay so, now tell me how you get here and how you have been at this radio station?
Speaker 2: Thirty years I been, when I, I took it over about twenty-nine years ago.  We the first and the only black 100,000 watt radio station in, in this area in the Mississippi.  And the lady Mrs. Young [ph.] who's a friend of mine, asked me about a radio station.  I say, "Well I don't--." I didn't believe it could be done.  Because they wasn't, wasn't letting blacks have no radio stations.  She applied for it.  I didn't want to because at that time I was very controversial you know, cussing white folks and kicking black folks.  So, I knew (unclear) the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] wouldn't, wouldn't gonna let me have it.  And she applied for it and got it.  And we got a few other folks, with names to go onto (unclear) and then we got the license.  When she got the license then she hired me as general manager.  I got in as manager I fired all of them.
Story_ID: 652347
Speaker 1: So tell me about once you, you said Ms. Young [ph.] got the license and everything you fired everybody, so tell me?
Speaker 2: Well, after I came on and got, got the position and I got in.  I we had disc jockeys that was clowning and I don't like that.  You know, it's my job, you don't (unclear) clowning I don't like that.  And they were clowning so I had, and board of directors were really the ones.  And somebody I finally able to get rid of them one at time.  And they had lawyers on board and doctors and they didn't know a damn thing about running nothing.  And so, I finally got and got my folk on the board.  My two daughters, my grandson, me and one more.  We own the station [WMPR Radio, Jackson, Mississippi] now.  Ms. Young died and like I say I you know, I'm a businessman that's why I like Trump [President Donald John Trump] and everybody, love or hate him black or white it's being in charge, and now we're 100 percent in charge.  And when I'm gone it will go Wanda [Wanda Evers] and Charlene [Velma "Charlene" Evers Kreel].  That's Charlene's desk here.  And Wanda's desk over there, my daughters.  And I had brought to the Evers family.  And the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] okayed it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay so tell me and in twenty-nine years what have accomplished with your radio station?
Speaker 2: I don't know, we, we, its open to the public so.  We what I, I think we, we brought aware of certain things they wouldn't have known had not been for my talk shows and others about what goes on in the community.  And bringing different people on, different ones have shows, thirty minutes shows they talk about different things.  And before me, blacks didn't have that opportunity.  Couldn't get on no white radio station and talk about white folks or talk about what's wrong in Mississippi.  But, now at this station, you can talk about anything you want talk about.  As long as it's within, not racist, if it's racist I don't allow that.  If it's issues or things of that sort yeah.  Yeah but we make people aware you can own a station or do is apply and see if there's a, a frequency open apply for it.  And because you black or of color don't mean nothing.  Can you qualify.  Do what to qualify to get that station, to get that station.  And if you get in (unclear) they issued to you.  Now we got blacks on the FCC too.  And they will be into more of what they listening to, than when it was all white.  They ain't got black anywhere, in there.  So it's--I think we've done a lot here to help open the community's eyes to white and black folks.  They know this is not a racist station.  Any white'll come on here and they let you know they ain't afraid to come on this station 'cause they know I'm not, we don't allow that here.
Speaker 1: And you have a religious programs as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and who are some of your, your staff members besides your, your daughters, your deejays or?
Speaker 2: Yeah my deejays, and see deejays I got them all I mean, understand you, you don't I don't pay you a dime, you on a commission.  So, you go out, and what you do you help get business, you get 25 percent of everything they get here.  I pay the highest commission of anybody in Jackson [Mississippi].  But, who pays 25 percent commission to anybody.  But, that's what I do.  And that's how they so loyal to me.  And my security a young man I raised two of them I raised from--he just went through there then--from youngsters.  And they're my security, they're security to make sure the locks are all clear at all times.  And that no one can come and bother nobody.  We don't allow nobody hanging on the outside there.  You come on in.  See black folks love to hang out.  And I know that.  But, when somebody know you, "You want something, you, you want something?"  "Oh no I just hanging." "You can't hang out there." "Oh why?" "'Cause I said you can't hang. I own this, you can't hang in front of my place."  And I'm not nice either. I'm just good.  So, why be nice, nice ta- people take advantage of nice people.
Speaker 1: Did you have a radio show of your own, a time slot?
Speaker 2: I have it now.
Speaker 1: Did you--tell me, tell me about that (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the senator also that we met earlier, the senator, that was here?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, John Horhn, he has a, he has a show here too.  John he has a show.  See I try to let people have shows and express their views and let me, if I like it I leave them on.  If not I cut them off.  I don't give them no, I don't give them no four or five year lease.  Nothing like that now.  You lease at the will and pleasure of [HistoryMaker] Charles Evers, if I like your show you stay on.  If I don't like it I cut you off.  Just that simple.
Speaker 1: Does, does everybody come in live or, or are there some people who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All different ways.
Speaker 1: --can send in tapes?
Speaker 2: They're all live, most of them are live.
Speaker 1: Oh most of them are live.
Speaker 2: I want, I want them to come in and get exposed to something I never had an opportunity to.  And I tell them, I say, "Now someday you can have a station."  And this things getting bigger all over the world.  We on the Internet, you can get us on the Internet.  We go, we hundred thousand watt, one of the biggest stations in the country.  You don't get no bigger than that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and you have web presences as well as you said, okay.  So, you on the web as well.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you'd like to talk about?
Speaker 2: I hope not, I hope not, I hope not, I think it's--my time is running out.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I, I just want to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and most of all I, I just want to thank you all for--
Story_ID: 652348
Speaker 1: Well the last thing I want--wanna talk about is about Trump [President Donald John Trump] and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the fact that you're a Republican and you did say that you supported Trump.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and, and I just like for you to tell, tell me why (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was one of the first blacks to support him.  First of all and number one he's a businessman, number one.  I felt he could help to create, we need businesses in Mississippi.  And I felt like if, if, if anybody could do it, he would bring in, bring in business.  Number two, he's, he's blunt and straight. I like that.  He don't have nobody write his speeches, he do his own stuff most of the time.  I don't always enjoy or agree with him.  But, that's, that's who he is.  And thirdly and, and all he's independent I like rich folks, he ain't gotta steal nothing from us.  He don't get no salary, like I don't get no salary.  Couldn't get no salary from the, from the country.  And most of all I just like Trump.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What type of businesses would you hope that he would bring to, to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: What, whatever we gotta, what I talked to him about it.  We have--we are the world's greatest catfish processing plant.  You know that.  Ain't got a processing plant.
Speaker 1: Y'all send your fish to China?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, good, how'd you know that?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: They go to China first and then send it back here, we get it back.  Come on it don't make sense.  So, I told Mr. Trump I say we'd like a processing plant up in the Delta [Mississippi Delta] somewhere near Mound Bayou [Mississippi].  He don't know Mound Bayou is an black town.  But (laughter) he don't know that so I say near Mound Bayou.  Things like that, I, I this is how I talk I ain't saying he gonna do it now.  I told him what I wanted.  What he should help us to do.  And he agreed about the processing plant that we need it.  Things like that, and, and he's a man you can talk to, that's what I like about.  You ain't got to go through a whole lot folk you can call him up.  I can guarantee if you have something to say he'd listen.  Craig [ph.] got a black--you know that black guy sitting right there, I told him the other day, I said, "Hey, you must be the nigger communicator."  He, "What do you mean Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers]?"  I say, "Well every time I call you answer the phone and hand the phone to the Percy [ph.]."  (Laughter) He's funny, they traveling and they over in, all over.  But.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And so, do you agree with Trump about illegal, illegal aliens, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: You know, (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I agree.
Speaker 1: --about building a wall and--
Speaker 2: No, wasn't that we all been talking that wall now before Trump got in there.  What I, what I agree is that everybody should have an opportunity here.  But, come through the process you know.  Don't just come I, I yeah I agree that illegal people come here illegally.  And take our jobs and all that kind.  No, they should be here.  We can't go to China, we can't go to India, why, what's so bad about people, "He upset--."  Hell no, they shouldn't be coming here unless they come illegally--come legally.  That's all I'm saying.  That's all Trump is saying.  And he saying illegal aliens.  Some of them that--who have commit crime but look at the blacks who committed crime.  And the whites committing crime.  So, you can't just lay it on them.  My whole thing is have a process and go through the process.  And if they come through the process let them come.  How did we get here?  I say it all the time.  "Y'all," I say, I say I tell my white friends I say, I say, "You peckerwoods brought us over here as slaves you came and took this country from the Indians [Native American] and killed them and made us become the supplier and builder and didn't pay us a damn dime.  So, now I don't want to hear that mess about equality, do you?"  That's why I fight for equality now so hard.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Am I crazy?  Be honest with me now?  How do you feel about me really (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I like you.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, I just didn't know.  A lot of people don't like when they get through because I, I they say I'm too, too blunt or something direct.  Well, what other way can you be.   You know, how you gonna lie, I ain't gonna sit and lie to you about nothing, that I can't back, why.  Let me tell you what my mama [Jesse Wright Evers] taught me, "You're gonna talk to me, you can't remember a lie," try it.  Are you married?
Speaker 1: I was, no.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay I say that, why I say that because tell your husband a lie about something yesterday and tomorrow and you can't tell you can't remember what you told him to save--but tell him the truth what you can always remember the truth and that's what I live by the truth.  And that's why I live by I'm just me.  I, I don't believe in marriage because I know I'm not gonna be true to any one woman all my life.  I never believed in that.  And but, now tell you I want marry you and ain't gonna look at no other woman but you for the rest of my life, and I'm ninety, ninety-four, ain't got that much left.  But I mean I when I was a youngster, "So why, why people take them kinds of oaths?"  It doesn't make sense to me.  But, I'm just one old darky believe that way.

Speaker 1: Tell me what, what do you want your legacy to be?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: If he said it he meant it.  That's all I want it to be. He's truthful, he ain't gonna lie to you about nothing.  You may not always agree with what he's saying, he's not gonna lie about it.  That's all I want them to remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, because this is going to be a video that will be watched for a hundred years from now.  If you could send a message to the future generations what would it be?  What would you say?
Speaker 1: The same thing, it's the same thing, do unto other as you have them do unto you.  That's all I can say.  You treat people like you want to be treated.  No different white, black, poor (unclear), ain't no matter.  Treat people like you want to be treated.  And try to have, do all you can to own something.

Speaker 1: What do you think Med- your, your brother [Medgar Evers] would feel about today and how the United States, the situation in which the United States is in, now?  How, how do you?
Speaker 2: What kind of situation you talking about, situation (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you think, what do you think he would feel about today?
Speaker 2: I can't speak for him, I never did, I tell people that all the time.  I only speak for Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Evers].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he and I were totally different in many ways, many ways totally different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's much kinder and much more respectful than I am.  And I know that but I'm me.  I can't be nobody else but me.  He wouldn't dare sit and tell you that he didn't believe in marriage.  (Laughter) I know he wouldn't tell you that.  And I, I don't believe, I think it's a joke.  That's sort of silly crazy but I do.  'Cause most married person at some time or another saw somebody else doing their lifetime that they sort of had some kind of idea about, some feeling for.  But, you married and you can't do that.  I don't believe in that and that I think a man should do whatever.  If you got a wife respect her.  And therefore I say if you don't believe in marriage don't marry.  I got nine daughters, six mothers.  But, they all mine and ask their mothers, I didn't marry them 'cause I know I wasn't gonna be true to them that way.  But, I took care of every last one of them.  Can't none of my children say they ever suffered one thing.  Not one of them.  I don't allow that.  All their mothers gotta do is pick up the phone say, "Charles, Sara [ph.] needs this," or, "Henry [ph.] needs that." "Johnnie [ph.] needs this and--," and they on with it.  That's a man's job.  I have a problem when I was a mayor [of Fayette, Mississippi] all them years and judge.  I was rough on daddies who didn't take care of their children.  'Cause a child's here because you got get with their mother and got them.  Now, don't let them suffer.  And I'm the same way now, I don't like my grandchildren, I be on them.  And my grandson, or a couple of my grandsons, don't you do that.  If you do you gonna deal with granddaddy, and I ain't nothing easy to deal with.  When you was wrong about your children or your wife.  So, can see why ain't I married don't you, (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did it come back to your mind the names of your other daughters?  You said Pat [Pat Evers], Carolyn [Carolyn Evers], Wanda [Wanda Evers], Yvonne [ph.].

Speaker 1: Yvonne, you said Yvonne.
Speaker 2: Rachel [ph.], Cheryl [ph.], and Kita [ph.].  How many is that?  I think that's all.
Speaker 1: That's eight.
Speaker 2: Eight, well who'd I miss?  I think that's it, I think I don't know.
