Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Okay, today is October 22, 2007. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  the Oklahoma State University Library and we are doing a project  called Women of the Oklahoma Legislature. I   m here today at the  Capitol with Kathleen Wilcoxson who is in the     State Senate.  And elected in     1996.  And again in     2000 and 2004.  So you are termed out in     2008, I have one more year.  I   m glad we   re catching you now then.  Yes.  Our first question then is to, not really a question but just tell us a little  bit about your childhood, where you were born, siblings     I was born in Lawton, Oklahoma     A native Oklahoman.     and grew up in Owasso   which is north of Tulsa, in a very small  community at that time. We lived out in the country. I had two brothers  5  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  and two sisters. My mother and dad finished high school. My dad was a  World War II veteran. We grew up in a small, rural community   very  close family, very involved in our church. In fact, that was our social  life, our church and our school. And we look back now and think,    What  in the world did our folks do to inculcate in all of their children the  importance of education?    Because we all have finished our doctorates  and are very professional people and it   s been an amazing life and  experience to watch all of my siblings and their families and spouses  achieve so high.  What birth order are you? Are you the oldest?  I   m the next to the oldest   second daughter. My sister and then I and  then my brother. My mother had five children in seven years and so she  was very busy.  I   d say. (Laughs) And where did you get your degrees from?  I have my bachelor   s degree in elementary education from Southwestern  Oklahoma State University. It   s in Weatherford  Oklahoma . And I have  my master   s degree and my doctorate degree from Oklahoma State  University, all in education.  When did you get interested in the political arena?  Well my first experience was in the eighth grade when Henry Bellmon  was running for governor and he won, as our first republican Governor  of Oklahoma. I think that was about 1962. My mother suggested that I  read the newspaper, which I think today now how fascinating that was,  but she encouraged me to read the Tulsa World and cut out all of the  articles on Henry Bellmon, so I did. I put them in a scrapbook and when  he won, I wrote him a letter   and I was in the eighth grade. I wrote him  a letter and gave him this scrapbook. The interesting part of that is and  something I   ve learned since then was that he never wrote me a thank  you note. And my mother never forgave him. So when he ran for  governor and United States Senate, and then governor again, it was very  difficult for her to vote for him because he ignored her daughter.  (Laughs)  So with that you probably send a lot of thank you notes yourself.  I try. I try to at least call and tell people thank you.  Well how did you come to run for this office?  I was very involved in politics off and on through my adult life. When  6  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  my predecessor, Senator Helen Cole, retired or announced her  retirement, some of my friends called me and said,    Have you  considered running for her seat?    Well I   d always talked about running  for House but to run for Senate, to me, was an amazing thought because  all the senators I had known, except for Senator Cole, had been very  wealthy, very powerful, very tall men   or at least that was my  perception of them. So for me to run for senate was quite an experience.  But one of my friends just said,    Why don   t you run?    I talked with my  husband and we started looking at it and doing some of the things that  people told us we ought to do to even consider it. One day, I remember  standing in my kitchen and I said to my husband,    I think we might  could win this.    It was really an awesome experience to see that I was  perceived as a viable candidate. It was fun.  Who was your campaign manager?  My husband. I had the greatest campaign manager and he took such  good care of me. He   s so smart and we won that campaign with five  opponents. We had a primary, a run-off and the general election. But  because I had such a great campaign manager, we won that with like   36,000 and today those campaigns are just astronomical. But I   ll never  forget the time   I was so tired and I was out in Mustang  Oklahoma   and it was pouring down rain, just pouring down rain. I was tired and  you can   t imagine how grueling a campaign is. I thought,    I have to stay  out here in the rain.     Then I realized how awful I probably looked and nobody wanted to  answer their door to a wet woman so I went home and my husband and  one of our volunteers were in the garage making campaign signs and the  sun was shining. He said,    What are you doing home?    I said,    Well it   s  raining in Mustang,    and I just started crying. This is what a great  manager   this is a good story. I just started crying. So he said,    It   s  okay.    And he took me upstairs and tucked me into bed and I felt so safe  and so secure and I knew I   d never have to go knock on doors again.  Two hours later he came back and he said,    It   s time to wake up and  here are your cards. You need to go knock on doors some more.    So he  never let me quit. No matter how tired and grueling and discouraging it  gets, you have to have someone like that to support you.  Did you have a slogan?  What was my slogan?    Preparing for the Future Today,    that was my  slogan.  Each time or just the first time?  7  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Each time.  And you said you did signs, so did he help you put those up?  He did everything. He was awesome. He organized my campaign. He  didn   t make phone calls and he didn   t knock on doors but he did pass  out brochures and he organized my life for me. He understood the data  and how to do all that hard work.  What was election night like?  It was exciting. Because I think we pretty much knew we had won. We  knew if we won the primary, we would win the general. And so after we  won the primary, people started paying attention to me. It was a fun  night, though. Thousands of people   we went down to J.C. Watt   s  watch party because that   s where all the republicans were hanging out.  My parents came and my husband was there and my daughter was there.  My sister and her husband were there. It was fun.  And what about swearing-in day?  That was not so much fun as memorable. For me to get to walk onto the  Senate chamber floor as a Senator for Oklahoma and stand up there and  swear to uphold the Constitution of the United States, Constitution of  Oklahoma, and to really realize the support and the trust that 70,000  people put in me were very humbling, and to this day I rarely walk onto  that chamber floor without that feeling of awe and praying that God will  give me the wisdom that I need to do what is right.  Well where was your office your first year?  It was in the little corner. No, really I had Senator Cole   s office because  nobody wanted it. It   s a very nice office. It   s up here on the fifth floor  but it has no windows to look out. A window, you know, is very  important, for status, and I had no window. So I got to keep her office,  even though it was one of the biggest. I had her office because it had no  windows. It was okay.  How many years did you have it?  I had it for as long as I wanted it. I think I had it for ten years, come to  think. Then I moved in here. I like this office because it   s on the corner  and it   s got a big window and big enough for a couch.  It does have a nice view.  8  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Great view. And I thought since these are my last two years, I would like  to have an office with a window.  Sure. Do you remember the first bill you presented on the floor? Or at  least the feelings that went behind it?  I don   t really remember the first. I think I may remember it. But I  thought for sure that my own colleagues in my caucus would not ask  questions of me and make me defend it but we have a tradition on the  Senate floor that when a new senator introduces his or her first piece of  legislation, that it is tradition to give that person a terrible time and to  ask questions that are totally off the wall and could not be answered but  that new Senator has no idea that that is what is happening. And then the  senators debate against it. So it   s just truly funny now to see it happen to  all the new senators. And we then just all vote against the bill. (Laughs)  Kind of a little bit mischievous.  Yes. That is the initiation to the Senate floor.  Well what was the first bill that was passed through? Or your favorite  bill?  Well it isn   t my bill but it   s a bill that I consider very, very important  and we have been recognized at the national level on the importance and  the quality of this bill. It was Senator Penny Williams    bill but I put the  good stuff in it as far as reading instruction for early reading and how we  as state policy makers can make sure that our children are getting the  correct instruction in the components that are necessary for successful  reading. I got to do that and that was important to me, and I was very  proud of that.  Any so far that you haven   t been successful with?  Oh, most of my bills are not successful. My bills are   many of them  focus on education. Last year I had a bill that I couldn   t believe went  down and that is that our graduation rates in high school are very low. I  was addressing an issue that I thought would be very important and very  helpful in our young people understanding the importance of a high  school graduation. Even my own colleagues voted against it. So I guess  it wasn   t a good bill. I   m going to try again though. (Laughs) Sneak it in  this time.  What committees have you been a part of?  I   ve always been on the Education Committee and this year I   m the co-  9  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  chair of the Education Committee and that   s been a real honor because  there   s never been a republican as the co-chair of the Education  Committee. So I have had a wonderful time on that and have enjoyed  being in the leadership. I   m always on the Finance Committee, which is  a difficult committee but I asked to be on that one because it   s a very  important part of our state government because we look at taxes and all  of the issues dealing with finance in our state. I have learned a lot about  state government from that committee that I didn   t know about before.  Health and Human Resources, which I really enjoy because I   m very  interested in how we deal with our people   our most vulnerable  citizens, I   m very interested in that. So those are my three main  committees and then quite often I   m on various appropriations  committees.  You   ve co-chaired, have you chaired?  No, the democrats have always been in control of the Senate for 100  years. We   re 100 years old this year and the republicans have never been  in control of the Senate. So I always tell my friends if you don   t like  what   s happening in government, then you need to check with the  democrats because we   ve never been in control. This year was the first  time that we had twenty-four republicans and we also have twenty-four  democrats. So it   s been a historical year. We   ve set precedents that have  never happened before in state government, particularly in the Senate  because we have 24-24. We   ve had to divide the power equally and it   s  been fun to watch people outside of the Senate when they put bets on us  as to when we will implode. But we have been very determined     democrats and republicans   that we will not implode, that it will be  very successful with how we deal with one another.  Senator Judy Eason-McIntyre is from Tulsa and she is my democrat co-chair  and we laugh because the only thing she and I have in common is  that we are both short and we are both women. (Laughs) She   s as black  as I   m white and she   s as liberal as I am conservative. In fact, on the  conservative rating, she was 3  conservative and I   m way up in the high  80   s or low 90   s. I   m conservative. So here we have these two women  who are totally opposite of one another but we   ve also prided ourselves  on being a role model on how two women can be so different  philosophically yet our goals are very much the same. Our goals as co-chairs  of the Education Committee is that our children will get quality  education, that there will be accountability, transparency   so we   ve  worked very hard for that. Sometimes we disagree, but most of the time  we   ve been very successful in achieving some of our goals.  Do you interact with her much outside of that meeting?  10  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  No, she   s from Tulsa so she goes home quite frequently. I live here in  Oklahoma City so I go home all of the time. One of the challenges I  have faced as a legislator is that it gets kind of lonely because of the  twenty-four republicans, I   m the only woman. So that   s been very   gets  kind of lonely. And the men don   t mean to leave me out but I   m not one  for golfing and they   re not one for tea parties, you know? (Laughs) So  when we go on conferences and conventions, it gets a little bit lonely  there because there isn   t a way for us to really socialize without our  spouses. And I don   t go out with the men. That doesn   t look good.  How about with the other women in other parties?  We do have times where we   the women will call a caucus just for  fun   kind of get the guys off track and we do have women   s night out  once in a while. And that   s important.  Any other gender differences that you see?  No. Somebody asked me that the other day. Do men treat me differently  because I   m a woman on the Senate floor? And I say,    Men treat me  differently off the Senate floor.    They are very respectful to me. They   re  very good to me and take care of me. But on the Senate floor, there is no  gender on the Senate floor and I appreciate that. I mean,   we   re there  for work and they don   t care if I   m a man or a woman or what color I  am. They evaluate what I have to say on the basis of philosophy and  their district and what   s best   what they perceive is best for the state. It  doesn   t matter. And that   s the way it ought to be.  Do you have a particular political philosophy?  Oh, I have a political philosophy. I   m very conservative. My philosophy  is very conservative I guess because of the basis of who I am as a  person. I   m a Christian and so I   m pro-life and my vote is always pro-life,  pro-family. I don   t want to increase taxes because I know what  impact that has on families. I   m very much pro-business, so I support the  tort reform laws and the worker   s compensation reform and tax structure  reform. And people say,    Well doesn   t everybody do that?    No. So  that   s where our philosophies really begin to diverge is when it comes to  issues like that.  Describe a typical day for you during session.  Oh, those are so fun. I   m going to miss it so much next year. But a  typical day would start very, very, very early in the morning about 5:30  when I walk my dog. He and I walk for two and a half miles with my  neighbors. That   s really important. Some people don   t think that   s an  11  Finchum  Wilcoxson  important part of the day but it   s very important because it energizes me  and it wakes me up and it gets me moving. So we walk for two and a  half miles. Then I   m back home and I go very quickly then to get to  work here on time.  When I get to work, there   s always food. Somewhere there   s food and  breakfast everywhere. That   s interesting because a lot of people   a lot  of different associations and organizations will bring breakfast in. So  some days the farmers will have some food in here and the next day the  electric co-ops will have food in here and the next day some education  association will have food in here. There   s just food all the time. And we  have meetings all morning in our various committees and then at lunch,  somebody will have lunch for us   same kind of associations and  organizations.  Then we go at one o   clock into session. During the busiest times of year  we   re there in session and that   s when we vote on the bills that have  passed the committees. So that   s when the great debates happen and  we   re sometimes there till 5 or 6. Then after that we go eat again.  (Laughs) That   s when we go to receptions. There are receptions all over  the city. So if you really want to party, you go to all of these receptions.  And invariably, after the receptions, then we have dinner. We go to  dinner with various organizations.  It sounds like we party a lot. Well I guess we do. But it   s important  because that   s when I really begin to talk to people about issues that I  don   t have any idea about. And so that   s when I talk to the electric co-ops  or PSO  Public Service Company of Oklahoma  or OG E   Oklahoma Gas   Electric  or AT T or Cox Cable or the farmers or the  bankers or maybe the savings associations. Because every one of them  has their issues and every one of them is concerned about a bill. Either  they   re for it or they   re against it. And it   s very important for me to  know both sides of the issues and that   s when I learn a lot about what   s  going on about all of these issues that I have to decide how I   m going to  vote.  Even though it sounds like we are partying, that   s when we meet a lot of  people and do a lot of networking. Then after that some people go out. I  don   t know where they go,but I go home. (Laughs) And thank goodness  I get to walk two and a half miles the next day because they say on the  average, a person will gain thirty pounds their first year in the  legislature.  Men and women?  Well I promised myself I would not. I tried to eat strawberries and  12  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  carrots a lot   at those receptions especially. Yes, it   s very easy to gain  weight because it   s a sedentary job and there   s food everywhere and it   s  not just food, it   s very good food.  Do you get to walk it off when you campaign the next time?  Then four years later we walk it off again. But that   s a lot of pounds in  every four years, so you can   t walk it off. You just have to quit eating.  You have to be very, very strong. But I still need that fellowship and that  social part of our work here because that   s how I get to know, as I said,  many of the issues.  Do you have a mentor?  Not any longer.  It was Helen Cole?  Yes; however, now I am the old lady around here now. Helen was a  wonderful mentor. She told me one time,    When you walk onto that  Senate floor, you owe nobody anything. Not one person on that Senate  floor   ,    she said,       voted for you. You don   t represent any one of  them.    And I thought that is an awesome concept. So when a Senator  will come up to me and say,    Do me a favor and just vote for this.    Uh-huh,  no, not if I don   t think it   s the right thing to do because that   s not  why I   m there to do another person a favor. My purpose there is to  represent my district and also do what I believe is best for the state.  How do you come up with the bills you want to present? Do constituents  bring     Sometimes constituents do. Sometimes as we read the newspapers we  see an issue that we need to address. For example, I had one maybe last  year or the year before, but I was reading the newspaper about this  person who won the lottery   millions of dollars in the lottery. And the  law says that anybody who wins the lottery has to identify themselves to  the Department of Human Services so that if they owed back child  support, that money is taken from their winnings, because that   s only  right. Well this person who won all this money, put his money in a trust  so we never knew who that person was. And I understood why that  person would put their money in a trust because it was a huge amount of  money and we know what happens to people when they win huge  amounts of money. So he wanted to protect himself and his family and  his earnings. The law was silent on the issue of a trust, but it was  against the law to not identify the winner. So that   s how I decided we  needed to look into that.  13  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  The new law that we have now requires the winners to identify  themselves to the DHS   the Department of Human Services for back  child support   but also for back taxes. No Oklahoman should win  earnings on a lottery and still owe the state taxes. But we were also very  careful in stipulating that that person   s identity will be protected. So I  think we took care of both issues. But that   s how I did that, and that   s  how I came up with that, is because I read the paper. Most of the time in  my education bills, I do my research on education. I know what that   s all  about.  Have you had the same assistant all twelve years?  I have. Well no, that   s not true. Senator Cole had an assistant and she  was a delightful lady and if it had not been for her   her name was  Estella   I couldn   t have survived. I had no idea what I was doing when  I walked in here. I had just come from a 5th grade classroom and so  when I walked in here, she just took care of me and it was wonderful.  She knew my constituents, she knows state government, but she passed  away the next year. And Deborah Purinton came in and started working  with me and just takes care of me. She runs my life. She   s good.  Is it unusual to have one for that length of time?  I think it is. I think it is. But she   s just been wonderful to me and very  good to me.  Do they do some of your research for you?  Not in the Senate. She doesn   t do any of my research and I wouldn   t  expect her to. But I   ll tell you what she does do   she takes care of my  constituents. When there is an issue out there, she knows where to go in  the bureaucracy. One of our jobs as a state legislator is to help work  through the bureaucracy for our constituents and Debbie knows exactly  how to do that. I get flowers quite often. I   ll come in and there   s a  beautiful bouquet on her desk and I   ll say,    Well what did I do this time  to get this bouquet of flowers?    But that is her job is to take care of my  constituents. When the phone rings and she answers it, I tell her I want  them to know that they are talking to me as well. Her assistance to my  office was critical in the success of my two re-elections.  Have you had any disappointments?  In the legislature?  Mm-hmm.  14  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Oh, it gets disappointing when you have goals and you just never quite  meet them. A person would never be a legislator without being an  idealist and without having huge goals and being a visionary. You  wouldn   t put yourself through the grueling campaigns if you didn   t have  those goals and ideals and visions. But at the same time, I   ve learned  that most of the state doesn   t have the same goals and ideals that I have  and they   re not wanting to work in that direction, at least as quickly as I  would like to. That   s the disappointment.  As you finish up next year, what are your plans? Are we allowed to  discuss it?  Oh, absolutely  I   m going to go back and teach 2nd grade and I cannot  wait.  2nd instead of 5th?  Yes. That   s what I am, a teacher. I have been so blessed to be in the state  legislature for twelve years. Not many women get to do this in our state.  And I feel truly honored, but my real calling in life is to be a teacher.  I   m going to go back and teach school and do professional development  with young teachers   mentor young women. Wouldn   t that be  awesome? I can   t wait. I cannot wait to go back and just get to do that  again   finish my career how I started it.  You mentioned you had a daughter, do you expect her to go into  politics?  I don   t think so. I just expect her to give me a grandbaby some day.  Well does she come and see you in operation here?  She did when she was a little girl. Now she   s grown and married and  doing her own thing now. But she   s proud of me. She has seen how hard  it is to do this.  Not a 40-hour week.  It is not a 40-hour week and it   s hard to get here. That   s what I tell  young women. I   ve had young women talk to me about running for a  particular seat. One time my Republican leaders brought in a young  woman and they said,    We want you to talk to her and encourage her to  run for a particular senate seat that   s coming open in the next year.    And  she was a beautiful young woman, very intelligent, highly educated,  successful in her career and I was just very impressed with her. I said,     Well tell me, do you have children?    And she said,    Yes,    that they  15  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  were two and three or something like that. And I said,    Oh   what are  you going to do with your children in a grueling campaign? What are  you going to do with your children when you   re here and they   re at  home?    Because four months out of the year   really a lot more than  four months out of the year, we   re here.  Since she said,    Do you think I ought to run?    I said,    No.    (Laughs) I  really think that women looking at a position like this, need to  understand that their children cannot be first in this job, if they want to  be successful. Or at least, it would be just awesomely difficult. And I  said,    There   s a time and a place and it will be surprising how quickly  twelve years will pass when that seat comes open again.    So she didn   t  run and you know, she has been back to my office several times and she  has told me several times,    Thank you,    for encouraging her to take care  of her children and then do this later. Because always you can do this  but you can   t always have your children at home.  Any other advice you would offer them if they didn   t have children?  What else would you have to tell women who are considering to run?  Considering running? Well you have to know who you are and what you  believe, and that   s sometimes difficult to really know exactly what you  believe. You   ve got to have a passion for something. Then if you do  decide to run, you have to know that you have to work harder than  you   ve ever worked in your life   ever. You have to have a fire in the  belly because you can   t win unless you have that passion and that fire in  your gut because it   s just too hard to get out there and knock on  thousands and thousands   literally thousands of doors   total strangers  and say to them,    I want to be your state senator or your state  representative.    And then, we have to work very hard. Women have  to   well I guess we don   t have to work any harder than men, but I think  we do. I really do think we do.  Do you want to elaborate on that?  Well, I don   t know. I think when I talk with women legislators, they  know the issues and they know the pros and cons and what   s going to be  hitting them when they deal with it. I came in as a school teacher. I  didn   t even know how to read a statute, didn   t know how to work those  books. So I   ve had to work very, very hard in understanding law and the  consequences of the law.  I have a note to ask you about school vouchers   that   s just recent  though isn   t it?  Oh, I wrote an editorial about that. Yes. That   s kind of interesting and  16  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  more people have remarked about that, but that is not a sword on which I  would die. But one of the senators had a bill that, in effect, provided  vouchers to children who were learning disabled or who were  handicapped in some way. And, you know, special education costs local  school districts a whole lot more money than would just regular  education. It costs a whole lot more. So what we were going to do is to  say these children could take a certain percentage of the money that the  state would automatically pay for that child and that parent could take  that money and enroll that child in a special school where that child   s  needs could be better met, perhaps, and then the parent would cover the  difference. But at least they would have a little bit of state monies. It  turned into a real debate.  I was shocked that people were not willing to consider that because  you   re not only helping the school district and the state financially, but  you are giving parents a choice to say,    I think my student   my child  could do better at this private school   , but yet we   re helping them out  financially with their own taxes that they pay. That was my idea of it.  But it turned into a really hullabaloo and so the senator who carried that  legislation said,    Well why don   t you write an editorial about that?    So I  did. And more people have spoken about that than about any other issue.  It comes up when you Google your name.  Really? Are you serious?  I   m serious.  Well I better write another editorial then about something else. (Laughs)  The other thing I came across was the drown nights.  Oh yes. Oh that   I could not believe it when a few constituents told me  how students are encouraged to go to these clubs and drown themselves,  literally in beer. And sometimes they   re minors. I don   t remember  exactly how we addressed that legislation. It was very weak by the time  the restaurant association got through with us and by the time the  different clubs got through with us, it was a very weak piece of  legislation.  But I think the purpose that really came out of that was that we let  people know that we   re aware of what   s happening in these clubs and if  they are encouraging minors to come in there and drink, then we   re  watching. We want parents to know what their children were doing. I  think what it really has done is educate the public and the providers that  this is not acceptable behavior on the part of our young people or the  17  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  clubs. Can you believe it? Drown night? Encouraging young people to  drown themselves in alcohol? Well, that   s how they kill themselves and  destroy themselves. I just don   t understand that.  Well that   s one success. You got that passed at least. And you are in  interim studies. Let   s see, dropout rates and GED requirements, tobacco  tax reinforcement     Well that   s somebody else   s. My interim task force this summer is  looking at the impact of dropping out of high school. When we look at  the impact financially to the state, it   s unbelievable the revenue we lose  just in income tax over that person   s lifespan because their income is so  low just compared to those students who graduate. Then when we look  at the incidence of people in poverty and in poor health   the highest  incidence of those people are dropouts. The highest incidence we have  of teen pregnancy, suicide, and people in crime and in prisons is in the  area of high school dropouts. The greatest majority of those people are  dropouts. So I would like to say that before I leave the legislature that  this is something that we address and that we don   t make it easy for  students to drop out of high school.  Right now we have a law that says that they are compelled to go to  school until they   re 16 and I would like to say that we strengthen that  and we let young people know the dangers that they are going to face  and the hardships that they will face if they drop out. And the law  today   this is unbelievable to me   the law today says that if parents and  the school administrator think that it   s in the best interest of a young  person or the community for that person to drop out of high school, all  they have to do is sign a waiver and that student can drop out. My point  to the whole legislature   and I lost this bill last year, I cannot believe  it   when is it ever in the best interest of the student to drop out of high  school? It   s never in their best interest   never. Why would we have it in  state policy? We shouldn   t have it in our written policy. So that   s my  passion this year. We   re going to look at that. And I   m going to try  again. I am not quitting on that one until I   m out of here.  And then you still won   t quit.  And then I still won   t quit, no.  Do you have any favorite memories? Any that come to mind or surface  to the top?  I don   t know that I have a favorite memory. I just know what an honor  it   s been to be here and to serve and that people like me. (Laughs) I was  over in my own district a couple of weeks ago and one of my  18  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  constituents said to me in a public meeting,    When we voted for term  limits, we didn   t mean you.    And I really appreciated that because they  don   t want me to go. I could get re-elected again but I think that term  limits has been really good for Oklahoma and twelve years are plenty  and I can go back and do what I did before and let somebody else come  in who has new ideas, new energy, highly motivated. So that   s good for  Oklahoma. I think some of my favorite memories are just the fact that I  have made so many friends and I appreciate this state.  Have you gotten to meet any famous people? Like any presidents or  such?  No.  No.  Well, Miss Oklahoma and Miss America and lots of artists, wonderful  artists and great authors and tremendous athletes. I   ve met lots of  wonderful people.  Were women supportive of your efforts when you were getting elected?  Could you tell us if more women voted for you or not?  I don   t have any idea. I don   t think so. I ran only against men so there  were five men and then the little short school teacher woman. (Laughs)  But I was talking to a campaign consultant and he said,    Kathleen, you  are exhausting your opponents.    Because I outworked them. The only  reason that people vote for other people   it   s not because they   re a  woman or they   re black or they   re white or anything, it   s because of the  philosophy that you present and the fact that you outwork your  opponents. I outworked them and I was determined. I told my mother,     I   m not going to lose this campaign by ten votes. If I lose this, I want it  to be by hundreds and thousands of votes.    Of course I didn   t, I won by  70  my first time and 72  my second time and the third time I didn   t  even have an opponent.  Then you should go one more time.  (Laughs) I don   t think people vote for a woman because of the  uniqueness of it. I don   t think at the state legislature or any local  elections anymore that the fact that you   re a woman makes any  difference, or that it   s a handicap one way or the other. It   s just who you  are as a candidate.  Do you anticipate keeping in touch with the women who you   ve met  during your service here or colleagues?  19  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  Wilcoxson  Finchum  I hope so. But you know, it   s just like when I left teaching. Those friends  just   I still have them and I still meet with some of them. But life  changes and I will get new projects but I can   t imagine losing a lot of the  friends that I have now. But you know I   ve learned this   even though  we   re very good friends today, we have to make an effort to keep our  friends. So I have to make an effort that I need to call my friends and I  need to go out and have a cup of coffee and talk and keep up, because if  you don   t, people get busy.  Did any of your siblings go into politics?  Not a one.  You   re it.  (Laughs) I   m the only one.  Were they surprised when you did?  Not very. I guess because I   ve been so opinionated all my life. When I  actually ran a campaign and actually won, I think surprise was there     the element of surprise. But they   re proud of me.  Were your parents at your swearing in?  No, my sister came. My sister and my husband and daughter came.  That   s special.  Mm-hmm.  Well I usually end with the question, when history is written about you,  what would you like it to say?  What a nice question. That   s a good question. I need to think about that.  I want it to be that,    She lived what she believed.    I am a Christian and I  want my life to reflect Christian values, integrity and compassion and  good will, forgiveness   all of those Christian characteristics that we  have to work so hard on. That I was a woman of passion and I believed  in quality education, I worked hard to make sure we have the best  education that we can have for our young people. I want them to say,     She was a good mom and a great wife.    I would like people to always  remember me being a great 2nd grade teacher or a great teacher of  teachers or a great bible teacher because that   s who I am.  Thank you very much.  20  Wilcoxson  Finchum  How did we do?  We did great.  ---  ---
