 Finchum  Today is September 30, 2013. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re in Midwest City, Oklahoma today to speak with  Ethel Norris, who recently turned 100. This is part of our Oklahoma 100  Year Life Project, and we   re happy to have you here.  Thank you.  Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Eight/twenty-four/thirteen   and just exactly where I was born, it was  close to Paris, Texas.  On a farm?  I   m not too sure. My mother has always said that my sister, who is just  younger than I, was born in Paris, but I never asked her where I was  born. (Laughs) But my memory goes back to Paris, Texas, I feel, where  my memory starts.  Is that where you went to school?  No. This is when I was just a little thing, I guess, like three. I remember  my brother telling us that we were going to move. We were living in  Paris, Texas at that time. So we moved to Powderly, Texas.  And when did you come to Oklahoma?  Nineteen twenty-three.  So quite a while ago. Why did you move here to Oklahoma?  5  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Well, my dad, for years in my life, he would live at one place   I   m  guessing   about two years, and then he   d want to move some other  place. Each place he moved to was a farm. Most places, I guess all  except maybe one, he would find a place that I guess the homesteaders  had maybe passed away, and the children had no need for the home  place at that time so they rented it out. So my dad somehow, in thinking  back, he always found good places for us to move to. They were passed  their heyday, let   s say. But for us, they were fine, the homes. And we   d  have plenty of land to work, which I had brothers and all. Back then, the  parents that we knew anything about and had big families, they kept  their boys busy so they didn   t get into any trouble   farm work and help  make a living. We   d have a pretty fair orchard. The trees were still  baring fruit. Even though we were just renters, we had all the food we  could eat. My mother loved gardening. Then we had the fruit, and we  had plenty of exercise. We were out there. (Laughter) We were out there  with the older brothers and all, working.  Did you have particular chores?  Yes.  What were a few of yours?  Now, my sister and I were more the same age, so the child that was up  ahead of me   one child born just lived a few days. So that made a  further distance   he was much older. But my sister and I were near the  same age so we kind of picked what chores kids of a certain age did.  Well, I really think my sister thought the dishwashing was a rougher job.  So she let Ethel have the easier job. Well, I liked making beds and  cleaning the house. (Laughs) Seemed like if there was something, two  jobs going on, she would take the hardest one, somehow. And if she  didn   t, I would talk her into it. (Laughter) If there is too much cotton on  my rows, if it looked like    Boy, I   m going to have a time getting all that  picked,    I   d say,    Mamie, you want to trade rows with me?    and she  would. Then, when she would get way ahead of me, she would pick my  row of cotton up with hers, piling my cotton right there in the middle of  the row, so when I came along, I   d get my cotton whether I had to pick it  or not. But even today, she would like to just be good to me.  Anyway, well, where am I now? Well, chores. So that   s about the way  the chores went. In the house, we had more chores outdoors, fieldwork.  We were out there. Whether we did much work when we got out there,  or not, my dad saw that we were out there. I guess he was assuming we  was busy, but we enjoyed ourselves out there in the field, taking our  lunches many times, taking books. After school was out, we   d carry  some of our books, looking at those. We   d make a game of one goes to  6  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  one end of the row, and the other start at the other. When we   d meet,  we   d have to say a verse or something. Growing up, you wouldn   t think  that two kids out in the field, cutting grass or picking cotton, would have  any fun but we did, we managed. I   d bet we had a happier life than kids  in the towns, crowded up even more so than this court out here. If they  get outside their little lawn, they   re in someone else   s yard or something.  We had the fields and creeks and all to explore, and meadows. Well, let  me get off of that. (Laughs) I had a happy childhood.  And you had brothers and sisters. How many older than you?  I   m the seventh down the line.  Did any of your brothers have to go to World War I?  No.  Or, II, I guess?  No, no.  So got lucky, there. Was religion an important part?  Well, not formal religion. Our parents taught right and wrong, but we  usually lived in a community that only had a school, and not a church. In  some places, I don   t even remember seeing a church house. But in the  summertime, there would always be some preacher that would come and  hold a revival during summertime, like two weeks or three weeks. So we  would always attend that.  But other than  that , my dad didn   t believe in working Sundays.  (Laughs) One time, I hurt his feelings. This was many years later. I came  home and my, the front yard was getting raw. Well, he would turn the  milk cows in the yard to eat the grass. Well, when I could, I   d mow. He  said,    Ethel, this is Sunday.    And I was a smart aleck. Only time I ever  smart alecked to my dad. I said,    Okay, Papa, you just be happy that   s  all I can find to do wrong.    I   ve thought of that so many times. My dad  didn   t have another word to say.  But in those days, after fieldwork was done, like a few short months  during the summer, we would find jobs. Jobs were hard to find in those  days for girls, I guess   boys may be easier. But anyway, there were  times that maybe I had a job that only got Sundays off so that   s why I  was mowing on a Sunday.  What was the name of your elementary school, the school where you  7  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  went?  Well, it was each two years my dad would move to new ones. (Laughs)  Well, let   s see. When I first started school, I don   t remember the name  of the school. I don   t think I went much. I don   t think the school  checked about that, much. When we moved to Ladonia, Texas, it was  farmland. Cotton, cotton, cotton. We went to one school that I think was  called Pecan School. It was real black land. We didn   t have roads like  we do now. It was something to   usually schools were about a two-mile  distance from home. I don   t remember ever missing a day being sick or  too rainy, or what, or cold. But when we moved to Hugo, we moved to  two different places. This is when we lived down there, each about five  miles apart but we went to the same school. So from, oh, I guess I was in  the third grade through the eighth we went to the one school. Usually,  there was just one in my class. Sometimes it was two or three, but very,  very seldom. Schools weren   t crowded at those times. (Laughs) Not that  it made it easier for me to learn, but anyway. We didn   t have too many  in school.  What would you take for your lunch during school?  Oh, maybe a fried dry apple pie or something like that. Just fried hog  meat of some cut. We didn   t have much of a variety.  How long did you live in Hugo?  Well, we moved there in    23. Well, I don   t remember the year I came up  here to work in the   well, first I went from there to Denison, Texas to  the egg plant. Hugo didn   t have many people, I mean, many jobs. We  lived at the edge of town. So after moving to Hugo, I stayed there from     23 until I was   when I started school the fall that I was in the eighth  grade, somehow they made a rule. I never questioned it or wondered  why but it was, I thought, unusual at that time. They said,    The eighth  grade, if they pass a test, they will not have to continue in school all  year. They will be graduated from the eighth grade.    Well, we took the  eighth grade test, the two of us, and passed it. So I started high school in     29   January of    29   into high school at Hugo, which is about five  miles from our place. At that time, we lived on the highway.  So the winter of    29 was a cold, cold time. My brother drove that old  cold Ford car, without a heater at all, to school. But I walked home to  my new home, not out there five miles on the highway, because my dad  had bought a place in Hugo, just outside the city limit   a ten-acre place.  So I can remember walking home, and there was still ice on the  sidewalks. We had a pretty steep hill. That hill, as the years went by,  didn   t seem very steep as it did that afternoon. Anyway, so we lived  8  Finchum  Norris  there until I went to Denison and worked in an egg plant. After that, by  that time, my brothers and others had grown up and lived elsewhere. I  have to think about what my train of thought was.  The egg plant, what did you have to do there?  I wish I could draw a picture, but I don   t have the words to draw a  picture of it. You had long tables in this long building. So there was long  tables, and you worked with a whole bunch on this side line and a whole  bunch on that side. Within the center, in front of you, a round hole and a  barrel sitting under that. They set a big five gallon bucket of eggs down  there beside of you. In front of you, there is a little tray built up with a  blade across the top. You picked these eggs, crack, crack, and you had to  shake good before you dumped the shells over in the trash barrel. There  was a hole made for them. So that was my first job away from home,  other than maybe working for someone and keeping their children while  they worked. So I felt grown by living away from home. I lived in an  apartment, which was just always one-room, but an efficiency, at that.  A neighbor girl thought I was so  grown up , she says she wants to come  and work with me. So here she comes, and she worked at the Kraft  cheese plant. I never did see her place of work, but she would walk, too.  She had quite a little distance to walk. I found an apartment just kind of  across the street from the egg plant so I didn   t have all that walk, but she  seemed to really enjoy it and liked her work.  I did have a brother that was in the service. Not during the wartime, but I  think my mother had to sign for him to be in there. He joined the Army.  He was in the Army, oh, I don   t know how many years he went in for it,  but when he had to re-enlist, in taking a chest X-ray, they found he had  TB. So he was in the hospital, some, but then checked himself out. The  doctor at home didn   t find anything wrong with his lungs, or so he says.  So he gets married and comes to Denison to work in the egg plant, he  and his wife. Then, I guess it was just about a year   s time, they had a  son, but in the meanwhile, my brother, working at the egg plant also got  a part-time job. They were building Denison Dam at that time. So he  was driving trucks with I don   t know, hauling sand, I guess, or hauling  dirt. Whatever they do with trucks. So he got sick. He passed away when  his son was just about six months of age.  Where can I go from there? Okay, so after working at the egg plant, one  of my girlfriends, an acquaintance for years and years, ever since we   d  been in Hugo almost, she says,    How about civil service examination?     Well, the one that was in charge of the civil service examination office  was a neighbor of mine, or of ours. So Florence and I decided to take  civil service examination and I didn   t seriously think about further than  9  Finchum  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  just taking it, what it added up to. Well, so we passed it. We got our  notice. Mr. Bell told us about it. Then we had an appointment to come to  the employment office here in the city. So Florence says,    Well, yeah.    I  guess she was more serious about it than I was. She said,    Yeah, we can  take the bus to Norman and spend the night with         she had a brother,  and his family lived in Norman      the next day we can just get the  Interurban, or something, and come on up here to the employment  office.    We had to first sign in at the employment office here in the city.  So we did. Well, I   m taking up so much time.  No, you   re good. Go ahead.  You   re doing great.  Well, I can cut this short. I don   t have to go into all this detail.  So you got to the city.  I   m just getting to the good part. (Laughter)  That   s what we want.  Oh, I   m getting to where I want to talk all the time.  Go ahead  That   s what we   re here for. That   s why we   re here.  Let me see if I can go on. So we find ourselves here at the employment  office. So we   re sitting in there, and there was a lady sitting in there. We  sat down by her, and she kind of starts talking. She says,    Are you girls  here signing up for work?    or something like that. We said,    Yes, we   re  to work at Tinker Field.    So we mentioned where we were from and that  we spent the night last night with her brother   s family. So in the talking,  she says,     I have  a son in there being interviewed right now. I have  two children. That one and his sister, which, they   re twins. My daughter  got a job at the Bell Telephone Office before she graduated so when she  graduated from high school, she had a job already. But my son is just  now reporting in there for work at Tinker Field.     She sits there awhile and says,    Where are you girls going to stay  tonight?    We say,    Well, we   ll probably go back to Norman.    I had  never thought of  what we would do . I   m glad Florence was. She was  more mature than I was at that time, for sure. I guess she   d worked  through it all, the taking of the civil service exam and how you have to  go about it all. Florence says,    I guess we   ll go back to my brother   s  because we haven   t looked for any place here. We wouldn   t know where  to look.    Well anyway, after a while she says,    You know, I have an  10  extra bedroom that we never use. Would you girls like to rent it and have  a kitchen privilege? I   m not far, just two blocks down to the bus  stop   you will catch to come to Oklahoma City to catch the bus going out to  Tinker Field.    Well, she seemed nice and all. We just hadn   t met many  people that wasn   t nice, we just didn   t know the other side of life.  (Laughs) So we says,    Well, yes, we   ll do that.    So we did. We lived  with her. I never saw the girl. I guess she didn   t have to get up as early  as we did.  Anyway, but   I   ve lost my train of thought. We lived there about   I  don   t know whether it was a week or two weeks. Everything was  working out fine, it seemed. Then Florence was assigned to the  parachute department of work because when she fell one time   back  then, people from lack of money or this and that just did without doctors,  almost. We didn   t know much about doctors, for sure. We were never  sick. Anyway, when her dad or whoever fixed her forearm back in a  slant, somehow, it got it to where it didn   t straighten up. Later, she  continued to have to hold her arm about like that   stationary. So the  parachute department was   after she was interviewed in Tinker Field     that was where she belonged because she could sew or hold material, or  do everything, and work machinery with that kind of handicap she had.  She had a man and a woman that was a boss out there. So the lady gets  acquainted with Florence and where she lives and all, I mean, where we  were staying. She says,    Well,  we  live in that new housing place just  across Twenty-Ninth from Tinker Field. My husband and I are kind of  having a problem. We have two children and there is going to be a  change in our hours to where one or the other will not be home with the  kids a few hours each day. Would you like to come and live with us,  room and board?    Well, that sounded good, and closer. There, I don   t  know what this lady was charging for a room and kitchen privilege. I  don   t remember any part about that, now. We thought,    Well, yeah,  we   ll have our whole salary.    Okay, we did that. We lived just in our  suitcases. So we packed our suitcases, and Florence was not a person  who laughed or did things, but some of the things we   d do and happened  to us   we   d get to laughing about it. She got to where she could just  giggle and laugh, like when we were to ourselves, about what happened.  Like,    My, we   ve gotten away from one good home, and here we have a  chance to get into another, plus we don   t have any expenses.     So that goes on until the husband and wife works   somehow, maybe he  had to go on a training period or something. I don   t know. But it became  back like it was, where they could. Of course, each having different  shifts, they didn   t see much of each other, maybe, but it worked out for  their two little kids. About five and six or something was their age. So  about that time, Florence   s other boss in her department, said something,  11  Finchum  Norris     Why don   t you come out and live    We have rented the Marrin  Apartments there on Broadway. We live in the basement, but my wife  takes care of renting to people upstairs. We have apartments to rent  every now and then.    So Florence and I thought,    Oh, an apartment of  our own,    and all. Okay. So we packed our suitcases up, because we   d  have had to move anyway, because these people just didn   t have that  much space in a little house. Some of those places there across from  Tinker Field were just little houses.  But anyway, so we moved to the Marrin Apartments. Boy, we thought  we were uptown at that time. From Hugo, living there, we couldn   t even  hire a taxi, wouldn   t dream about spending money on a taxi. I guess it  was all a mile and a half to downtown Hugo. Well up here were  streetcars. Oh lands  We seemed like we were   every time we would  turn around, someone was nice to us, and helpful. So we lived in this  apartment until   she had an older sister that got married and her  husband lived in Boswell. That   s   oh, thirty miles, let   s say, from Hugo.  So anyway, that was going to leave their mother without anyone. So  Florence quit Tinker Field to go back to stay with her mother.  So now let me see. What happened to me around that time? Okay. We  had this one family   three girls and a younger brother   that I don   t  know when their mother passed away. I think it was years before. But  their dad was just a drunkard, so he was sitting in the middle of the road  one time and the car ran over him. So it was just the three sisters and the  brother. Well, they worked at the   Oh, I haven   t even mentioned the  pecan plant. Okay, way back, years earlier, they had a pecan plant set up  in Hugo. We picked pecans a couple of years or so, inside of a building.  It got so we could carry big loads of pecans home and pick them out and  carry the nuts back to the plant. Well, anyway, I missed out on all that  part. So these girls, I got acquainted with them during that period of my  life, earlier there in Hugo. We were writing letters, and they decided to  come up here,    Would it be alright if they came up?    Okay. They stayed  with us until they had jobs and rented them an apartment. Okay, what  happened to me after that?  What was your job at Tinker?  Machine lathes   big machinery. I mean, big. Why they put me on that, I  don   t know. Anyway, I guess I was only a woman. A lot of the machines  would be in kind of sections in a big building. Usually, there would be a  woman working in each one with a bunch of men. Okay. I guess I got  the most simplest job, more than likely. Anyway, how to use a  micrometer. They   d gauge the threads on a bolt or whatever they needed  to repair some airplane that came in that was damaged during the war. If  it was metal, it might come to our department, whether it was in our  12  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  section or not. There were so many sections. Anyway, a bolt of metal,  stainless steel   you turn the machine on and having to set it to just  where it makes threads, and the bolt that goes on that   that type of  work. Anyway, at first it was kind of frightening. I said,    Oh, I don   t  want to know anything right now. Just tell me what to punch to turn the  machine off.    I thought,    I   ll mess up and I   ll sure want to get the  machine stopped.    But anyway, I was satisfactory, I guess, in there.  But then my mother got sick so she didn   t have anyone. Wasn   t anyone  left at home but my mother and dad. They were getting on up in age  after having all those children, and here we   re way passed grown. They  weren   t young. So I went down and stayed with her until she got to  feeling alright. That happened a number of times, after this. At different  jobs I   d work on, I   d quit to go down to stay with my mother and dad  while they were having problems. Overall, they were really healthy, but  there were times they needed someone around. So when I quit Tinker  Field, I didn   t know enough that I could ask for leave or something like  that and come back to work. I thought if I just quit, that would be it.  Okay, so I quit.  An aunt of this Florence that I first came to Tinker Field with, she had  moved to Oklahoma City from Lawton or somewhere. Her two sons  were in the service so she was tired of living down there, I guess.  Wanted to move to the city so she rented a big house over close to  University Hospital. Said she had a room for rent. So, I rented that from  her for a while. After getting acquainted and renting from her, she  became a lifetime friend and eventually married a neighbor of mine.  This is in later years, that lived across the street. I asked her if she   d be  interested in meeting my neighbor man. Well, that comes along further.  I   ll talk all evening.  So you played matchmaker.  Yeah. She moved out there and his house was a little thing. Somehow or  another, I guess she had managed to have a little extra money. Her two  sons always looked out for Momma seemed like. One son moved out  there. I   ve skipped a part of us, what happened to us before I moved out  in that area. Oh, dear. It takes a time to go over your life, minute by  minute. (Laughter) Discussing little minor things.  At what point did you get married?  Well, I haven   t gotten to that part. Let me skip this that I was going on  about. Florence   s aunt rented a big old-timey house like so many years  ago people built, if they were able, full of big living rooms, dining room,  kitchen, three bedrooms or so on the other side. Anyway, so where did I  13  Finchum  Norris  go from living with her?  You had quit     One time, my dad was putting fruit up on the house to dry for winter use.  We   d put it on the roof of the house. He fell off the house and broke his  two ankles. No   heels. Bruised them so that he couldn   t walk. So he  was off of work for a while. It may have been that time that I left this  place and went down to Hugo and spent some time. While I was down  there, this lady that I had  gotten to know , Florence   s aunt, Fanny, I   ll  call her now, as she became known. She wrote and says,    Ethel, I   ll tell  you what I   m doing, now.    She had been, years before this, over at the  old   that big Christian church, if you know Oklahoma City and  Broadway. Marian Hotel   there is a big Christian church over there in  the same block of that Marian Hotel. Well, she had cooked at different  big churches for Wednesday nights or any time they had suppers. So  that   s the kind of work she did. She says,    What I   m doing now, I   m  working down at the Cerebral Palsy Institute down at Norman. When  you can get back to work, come and live with me. I just get on one  street, right close to me, and breeze on down Sunny Lane,    I guess,        to Norman. I go back and forth to Norman to the Cerebral Palsy  Institute and cook down there now.    So when I was able to leave my  mother and dad alone again, I came up and stayed with her a while.  Later, there was a lady   I wish I could remember their names, but I  don   t   that had a husband that was a notary public, if I   m saying that  right. That was his job. But he had lost his mind. He was just   no mind.  He was either going to bed or she   d get him and set him up and go into  the kitchen to eat. That   s all he did. No conversation, no disruptive  attitude or anything. But she had a mother   I don   t mean to say but     she also had a mother living with her that was, I think she was ninety-three  at that time. She was up and walking and doing for herself, moving  around. She didn   t have to have help, but her daughter, of course, did the  cooking. Okay. So she says,    Would you like to come and live with me  to just kind of be company, just do a few things that she wasn   t able to  do?    So here I moved from Fanny   s place, living with her, down into  Norman. Caught a bus out to the Cerebral Palsy Institute. That went on  maybe over a year, and that place went out of business. Lack of funds.  Okay. Let me see, I guess I came to the city with Fanny, then. I don   t  remember getting an apartment or anything. After that, of course, Fanny  was looking for work, too, then and I was, too. Okay, now I can   t keep  up with Ethel. (Laughter) Okay, yeah. I   m skipping another part of my  life. Well, there is a couple of things. I guess when I came back from  Tinker Field, maybe, I didn   t dream about going back to reapply. I  thought that was just over with so I got a job as a nurse aide at  St.  14  Finchum  Norris  Robertson  Anthony  Hospital. I   ve never been around Catholics or anything, but I  just loved them all. One sister, I thought,    Oh, she is just my buddy.     Everywhere I went, seemed like I turned around and there she was. But I  didn   t think,    She   s just checking on my work.    She   s a person that does  her rounds and inspects the rooms and the bed, all the springs had been  washed and it had such a fast turnover, oh dear. I worked in the  maternity ward helping the nurses with their bedpans of patients. That  was an experience. Things have changed so much. People wouldn   t  believe some of the things that    Anyway. Well, okay, I   m going to  jump way ahead. That was a job that I didn   t mention. Maybe sometimes  when I   d gone home and come back, what I did.  Anyway, I thought,    Well, I   ll call Baptist Hospital   St. Anthony   s, I   m  not hearing what I   m saying. I   ll call St. Anthony   s to see if they need  any help.    It was like noontime, and whoever answered the phone out  there says,    Well, the sister that takes care of that is on her lunch period  now. If you   ll call back soon, you can talk to her.    Okay, meanwhile, I  thought   well, that was the time Fanny was still living in that house she  had rented just on Eighth Street, right back of the hospital. I thought,     Well, why not call University Hospital?    So I did. I told them who I  was and what I had been doing in that place that closed from lack of  funds and if they had a job. The person that answers,    You are already  our employee, they tell me.    So Cerebral Palsy belonged to University  Hospital someway. We were considered employees, even though we  were in a separate place. I say,    I   m just off of that job, and I need to  visit my folks so if I could wait   ,    I think it was about a week later, I  said,       and come to work. Let me take vacation time or a period to take  care of my visit.    They say,    Alright.     So after that, I came back. I didn   t have to go through the rigmarole of  employment. They had the records, I guess, from me enrolling down  there. So I started there, and I don   t remember what the year was. I can   t  remember. I think all the records that has any dates or really years is in  the safety deposit box in the bank. So I start there, get acquainted with  Clara May   s dad, and from here on, it would take another day or two to  share all my details if I go from minute to minute. So eventually, when I  retired, my twenty-five years at University Hospital and the two years I  got credit for, for working at a Cerebral Palsy hospital   I retired with  twenty-seven years of hospital work.  When did you get married?  Clara May, what was that     Probably around 1949 or    50.  15  Finchum  Norris  Robertson  Bishop  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Robertson  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Robertson  Finchum  Norris  Nineteen forty-nine or    50?  Forty-nine, I think. September of    49     I married Bill in    51. That was about a year after you married Dad.  So you were married, later. You married later in life.  You were older when you got married.  Yeah, yeah. I think I was thirty-eight. So, now life is just beginning,  another phase of it.  So you got married in    49?  Yes.  Did you have children?  No. I ended up with this one  Clara May . She was fifteen when her dad  and I got married. Her mother had it annulled. She went to California  and met a guy, and they married. How many years you and Bill had  together?  Fifty-two.  Fifty-two? He was a Navy guy. They lived elsewhere, but on their  vacations, they   d come back to see us and her mother. Meanwhile they  had four children and eventually Bill retired from the Navy. I mean  spent his time in the Navy, I guess you   d say retired. After that, he  interviewed at Midwest City Hospital for electrician work. So he worked  there until he retired from there. Then, lived how many? About ten years  or so with Parkinson   s disease. That   s what he passed away from.  How long were you married, then?  If I can remember   fifty-two years. Or was it fifty? Clara May, help  with dates.  I don   t remember.  That   s good enough. What was your job at the hospital?  I ended up as a LPN. When I got a job at University Hospital, when I  came back from my little visit between jobs, I was sent to the polio  ward. That was a bad season, that summer that I worked there. They  16  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  Norris  didn   t have air conditioning, and, oh, I   ll tell you. The little old patients,  some adults, but so many little ones   we   d have to hot pack them.  That   s something else to describe. So after polio season, like late fall,  they closed the ward, the polio ward out there. There are so many things  I can   t get them all straightened up. I get some before the others.  Well, after we were married, I think it was November   we were married  in September   my husband was reading the paper. He says,    Here   s a  place for sale.    Somewhere around here, I have that little old newspaper  item, about three lines and about that long (gestures) that we cut it out.  Okay, something about a place for sale   fifty dollars a month with the  idea of owning the place. Okay, so we were living just across the alley.  Again, I   m skipping over so many things to make it come out smooth.  Ferrell had an apartment there when we were married. I had had a  garage apartment behind a person   s house, just next to his. But anyway,  so that   s where he was living when we married. I was living in another  apartment. I wish you could see him, read my brain picture. (Laughter)  While I was still living next to him, just prior to marriage   oh, lands,  there   s so much.  How did you two meet, eventually?  I usually had a day job. You know, seven until three thirty, but there for  a period of time, I was working night shift. Eleven until, oh, whatever  time   seven. Where did I get off on that? Well, anyway. How we met     I was working those night hours. Okay. So here comes break time in the  middle of the night. We went to one little room set aside. In it, they  brought food from the kitchen, whatever was left from that day   s meal,  they would package that up and bring it up there. So, sometimes it was  quite good and sometimes it was just like bread and butter or jam, or just  little. Okay, so we met in there. That   s where I met him, eating. He was  a security guard at that time. I guess that was his first job after your   Clara   s  mom and he was getting a divorce   after that, and you  Clara   came up here to stay with Ferrell and all. So that   s how we met, at the  midnight snack. (Laughter)  I   m kind of curious because we don   t find too many centenarians like  you that was a step-parent. What was it like being a step-parent?  When we were married, Clara May went on back to Chickasha or  wherever with her momma. Okay, so Clara May would come up to us  and spend a time. Well, I thought,    Oh, I don   t know hardly how to treat  a step-daughter.    I thought,    Oh, I   ll just treat her like she was some  other kid.    So I felt that she treated me like   that I wasn   t that old   but  just like a girlfriend. She   d say,    Ethel,    and back there for those years, a  few anyway, I   d have just one day a week  off . Then it came available  17  for us to get a day and a half a week. So it was kind of mixed up.  Sundays only came on blue moon days or something. So Clara May, as I  say, she came up to spend the night. The next day, she says,    Ethel, what  are we going to do, today?    Like, looking for something fun. I thought,     Well, if it was me, I would do some washing and cleaning house.    You  know, home chores. I said,    Well, let   s see       I don   t know who  thought of that.  Anyway, I haven   t even mentioned where we are living, now. That little  ad in that paper about that rent house. I   ll bring it down closer to where  we are now.    What are we doing today, Ethel?    Just about a little before  that time, Ferrell got acquainted with a nice family, a nice man. He  brought his wife to see us. She was real nice. Seemed like they were  doing well. They had a little one-seated coup. So the four of us get in the  one-seated coup, go out to  Lake  Overholser and fish in the evenings.  So okay, this guy says,    Would you guys be interested in buying our  little car?    Well lands, we hadn   t ever dreamed of that either. We  decided to buy it. He was buying a larger car.  So now, he sees this ad. So when it came time that our hours kind of  meshed, we went out there, right over here, down Twenty-third to, not  Air Depot but two blocks this side of Air Depot and Twenty-third. Told  us to turn off Boyd Street   Twenty-third down to Boyd Street and down  a block and which house it was. Southwest corner of the intersection was  where the house was. So we come out and saw the place. There wasn   t  anyone at home at that time. We looked around. I said,    Oh, my dad  would like to have something like this.    Thinking about the black land  that we lived in Ladonia, prior to my talking about cotton and all. I don   t  know, thirty-five bales of cotton a year. We did that the couple of years  we lived there. Well I thought,    Oh, my dad would sure like this black  land,    because I knew how rich it was from living down there. That it  was just like gold. Okay. So we go on back. I guess we made an  appointment for some time when the man and his wife was home, and  came out another time and looked at it and inside. We said we   ll buy.  We thought fifty dollars a month, that is about like rent. Maybe we could  have found an apartment that was thirty-five or so. But with the idea that  money going in on ownership of the home. It was an acre of ground, a  two-room house, huge rooms. So we buy it. We move out. I think it was  Christmas Eve that we moved out here, which is just down over here just  a little ways by the Baptist church that is up there on Twenty-Third  Street. Anyway, so we moved there. He had it all deep plowed and they  had their kitchen full of big old baskets and tubs of half-green and green  tomatoes that they had raised. We didn   t see all the land where they  grew because he had plowed it up, deep. But we saw worlds of  tomatoes. So I knew before I saw the tomatoes how rich this dirt out  18  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  here was. So we move out there. I think it was Christmas Eve.  Anyway, at the time Clara May comes up to visit with us and says,     Ethel, what are we doing today?    Like what fun, (Laughs) not my  chore day. So all we thought of and I don   t know where we came up  with it. Just down a block or two blocks on Air Depot. Air Depot ends at  Twenty-Third. The street continues on down, but just over a little old  creek and a woodsy area. So we went down there and explored the  woods and all. Clara May is pretty much an outdoor person. Growing  up, she had a similar living situation, you know, outdoors and things. So  we ended up living at that place twenty-three years.  Meanwhile, we added on to the house. We planted fruit trees. We got a  rototiller and worked that land because my husband had the same type of  background living that I had   very similar. So we planted garden and  all. Come summer, we canned and got a canner. As the years went by,  twenty-three of them, it changed a lot. Even earlier, we had a little old  henhouse thing on the property. That was all other than the house. We  bought chickens. So during those years, all those years, we worked out  in our acre of ground and we had chickens, geese and all kinds of fowls.  We never did have turkeys, but anyway. They just ran wild, you know.  There wasn   t any   just all over the acre of ground.  If you fast forward a little bit, I want to know   what is your secret to  living a long life?  I don   t have any. I guess it is inheritance because my mother and dad  was hearty, healthy people. I don   t know.  What is a typical day like for you?  Then?  Today. What time do you get up and what do you do and when do you go  to bed?  Right now?  Yes.  Oh. Oh, different times, but here just of late, I   ve been going to bed  about nine thirty. If I don   t get a hold of Clara May and some of her  good books and stay up until many hours later. This summer, I   ve been  so busy I haven   t had time to read. So much has been going on.  What keeps you busy?  19  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Robertson  Bishop  Norris  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Just everything that needs to be done in the house and outdoors.  Do you still mow your own yard?  Well, I did until after the flood. I mowed it all. The yard and I count the  alley that joins my strip of ground. But my neighbor over here   he has  asked for mowing jobs around a lot of the people. He   s always been over  quite often wanting to borrow a twenty. So I thought,    Well, he really  needs the work.    They both smoke, he and his wife. They have a dear  little boy. He   s precious   little old guy. Anyway, so I   m so sun-sensitive  that I wear two hats. (Laughter) So I keep from the sun, but I  really enjoy, I feel good   I feel better when I do some hard work that  pulls my muscles and all. So here of late, I   ve let him do the mowing.  He does a good job   detailed work. So I think,    Well, I can find  something else to do.     Do you usually do outdoor work when you can? Are you outside a lot?  Yeah. There   s still plenty of yard work out there   flower beds and  things. Just recently, I   ve had a lot of extra work. I hired things done that  needed to be done. Cleaning the cellar and, oh, just jobs after jobs.  My dad had a saying that when she passed on, they   d have to bury her  face down or she   d dig her way out. (Laughter)  Now you said the floods   were you in the May 20th tornadoes? The two  weeks     What?  The recent tornadoes, back in May, were you involved in that?  No, we   ve never had a storm   strong wind that damaged anything out  here. We   ve had a few high water deals over the years. But the water,  even this time, and I guess this is worse after this tornado down there in  Moore, and all. All the extra rain everywhere, it seems like. It didn   t get  up under my back tire wheels out there in the driveway. So I could have  stayed here all that time, but they wouldn   t let you. You couldn   t even  get a car out from here. It would drown the motor as you   it   s lower  down there as you drive into the courts. They wouldn   t let people take  the car or try to take the cars out. Some of them were already stalled.  Did you ever think you   d live to 100?  No. Well, after my husband passed away   he was ninety-two   I  20  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  thought, well, I guess I   ll probably live four or five years at the most.  Here it   s the 28th, was that yesterday? It was my wedding anniversary. I  thought, it   s been thirteen years   in November, when he passed away, it  will be thirteen years in November that he   s been gone.  Do you have a motto or philosophy that you live by?  No, I don   t think so. I never realized.  How did you celebrate your birthday?  Well, the celebration really was down at Antlers, Oklahoma. Nieces and  nephews from Virginia and all over Texas and from Elk City and all met  down there at the home of, not my oldest brother. My oldest brother  passed away when he was eighteen during the First World War   bad  health time at that time. That   s when he passed away. But my next  brother   he lived to, I   m not sure, ninety-two or three. He did and it  seemed like so many of the families had like nine children. That ended  up with a lot of them. By the time they got married and having kids, I  had nieces and nephews galore. But the thing is, in the summer, we go  down there when different ones can make it from far off.  My oldest brother that lived, they lived in West Texas, but they moved  back to Oklahoma down in that area. The oldest daughter married a  neighbor boy. They built a home there on the highway between Antlers  and Hugo. As their nine children married and built homes all around  there, one became a pretty good carpenter and built different homes  around. When my niece and her husband eventually passed away, they  left that house, the kids did, just empty. It has never been bothered. But  when they have visitors from a lot of places and big meals, they come  there and have that as their place. So that   s where we went for my main  birthday. It was after that when I had several occasions here.  Anyway, there was something I was going to say, and I forgot it. Oh,  well. A lot of nieces and children having children and living around the  neighborhood of Antlers and around   ones that live fairly close around  here   go to a little church down on the highway about three or four  miles. All the family comes back here after church to have just an  evening   each bringing a dish or so. That   s where they all meet, rather  than going to individual houses. That   s been going on about   how many  years ago has Margie passed away? A good many years. They just left  that house empty, there, for their place of meeting.  Did any of them have anything to do with the circus?  No, no. But some of my nieces and nephews   I think it   s just the ones  21  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Bishop  Norris  that live around Elk City   we all went down there and spent several  nights down there and they went out, or we all did, to the cemetery at  Hugo where all my folks are buried. Then to this Barnum and Bailey  part of the cemetery down there. They all enjoyed that. Then we had  another cemetery that the old-timey ones like my granddad and a lot of  the aunts and all are buried fairly close to Rattan, Oklahoma. Let me see  if I can   t highpoint something and let you folks go on. I guess I could  talk the rest of the evening about my interesting life     What I want to know is when history is written, what do you want it to  say about you? What do you want to be remembered for? What type of  person do you want people to say you were?  She was a very nice person. I guess that   s all. (Laughter) I don   t know.  That   s a tough question.  Let me see if I can skip something or highpoint something and let y   all  go.  What type of books do you like?  Books? Just interesting romance. I   m not   (Laughs) I like to read stories  of people and how their life was. Some of these authors can make the     has the word power to seem like it makes the people so real. You could  just   seems like    Okay, now, I haven   t even mentioned about living  here. So twenty-three years down there. I got tired of writing all the  things down. I kind of highpointed some things here. So after twenty-three  years at this two-room acre place, maybe two blocks from here, we  ended up here. Why? Well, there was a Tinker Field young guy that  would come by the house, drive by, and he would say,    Are you  interested in selling this place?    or this and that. He   d come by every  now and then. So this place, this mobile home came on sale and we had  been inside and knew the people because they went to the church.  I haven   t even mentioned church up here. After our years kind of got  settled, we started going to a church that is up here right now. So I  started to a women   s bible school class. After a few years, as we tried to  get new members and all coming in, they   d have children. No one was  too interested in a nursery. I guess the women, having grandchildren and  all, raised their own and then having their grandchildren   they would  rather have a Sunday, quiet with other women in Sunday school. So I  thought, well, okay.  Some  of my work at the University Hospital   I  worked four years in the toddler-age ward. I thought,    Well, I think I   ll  just volunteer to work in the nursery.    So I got started working in there.  I worked there for the kids   here they are grown and having kids.  22  (Laughter) Laughing about,    Oh, yeah, I remember Mrs. Norris,    when  they were kids and here they   re grown and all.  Well, that   s not bringing me on down to this place here. Okay, yes, it  does, if I can keep my thoughts right. So this church up here, after years,  as so many churches do now   about all you see in the churches I have  visited since this one had to close, they   re mainly just being elderly  people. Not up having a bunch of three or four kids or young teenagers,  or twenty or thirty. Not any of that. I don   t know about you folks, but  anyway, I lost my train of thought now, again. Okay, so that church,  from lack of attendance, lack of funds, finally the preacher just had to  say,    We   re just going to have to close.    So they got the whole Baptist  Association   they have to go through a whole rigmarole when a church  closes and all   so finally we got all that behind us and in the process,  this preacher was invited to a big church over on Britton Road   invited  to a huge church, there.  Okay, so when they went to that, I told the wife, I said,    Sissy, I   m not  moving to that church. It is just so far away.    By this time, I   d gotten to  where I was hard of hearing so it is hard to talk to someone. I   ve tried  two different pairs of hearing aids, and not doing much better. I say,    I   ll  just find some church around here.    Clara May took me to several she  thought was good. I like a small church where I can get to know people  and all.  But  I started going to two churches over here, one in the mall  where Dillard   s used to be. They have the whole Dillard   s section of the  mall over there. One of these churches that plays a lot of music and  such. I went a few times and the parking lot would just be crowded with  cars. Then I   d see momma and daddies like thirty years of age coming  holding little sissies and brothers, little kids    hands. All ages. Getting  inside and looking at the people, all of them were concentrating   their  attention was so on what was being said and done. They weren   t talking  to each other or having their phone. So it was an encouragement to me. I  thought, guys coming back from fighting for us, when they see that type  of audience    Okay, maybe they   d feel more like it was worthwhile that  people over here are trying to learn to do the best they can and make life  better. It was encouragement. So I go over there. I haven   t been going  this summer because the car gets so hot. I come in and get in the car, and  it is like holding my face in the oven.  Okay, y   all will never get to go home if I don   t shut up. So this place     we   ve lived here thirty-three years this year, in October of this year. This  month. Okay, we bought it in this month, thirty-three years. So we knew  the people living here because they went to our church. They were  Tinker Field employees. Well, eventually, he retired. His wife retired,  too. They were both workers. They moved to Arkansas, around closer to  their kinfolks. So we ended up down here and we thought,    Well, we   ll  23  Bishop  Norris  Finchum  Norris  Finchum  Norris  let that boy have our place,    because we thought we were at that time in  life, getting old enough that we should slow down a little. Besides, we  could have that part of the alley turned into a garden, which we did. That  way we   d have, maybe, plenty of work. I didn   t tell you about the two  collies my husband had trained, going to obedience school and all, and  going to a lot of meetings over the period of time, all that, while we were  down there in this other place. All the bees, like thirty beehives and  honey, and some of our experiences in that.  If you want to, you can add those to the transcript. We   ll send you a  copy and you can add some of those stories, if you want.  Well, anyway. So we ended up here. Then in 2000, my husband passed  away and I   m still here. I   ve had a lot of   especially two good  neighbors after moving in here. I knew them before I moved in here, so I  knew that we   d still have those. Okay, those two women during the  years, my husband thought they were a lot of fun to be with. He enjoyed  them as well as I did. Going to Oscar Rose to the senior programs over  there for years, and classes and things, which was important. We got  with a travel club that we really enjoyed. We went a lot of places over  Oklahoma and some places out of state and over to some of the parks.  Then we went to England for a week. Flew over there. I thought,    Oh,  Ferrell and I have done more than we ever dreamed as kids we   d do.    I  think,    Oh, we   ve been well-travelers. Even going overseas.    (Laughs)  We   ve been down to   We had a Caribbean cruise down off of Florida. I  thought,    Oh, we should be happy. We   re still having the little  Oklahoma tours.    Before we got with the travel group, we would just go  ourselves. Short trips. Well, I guess that   s all.  You had a very good life.  I have  I sure have.  Thank you for sharing it with us.  Well, thank you for having patience.  -------  -------
