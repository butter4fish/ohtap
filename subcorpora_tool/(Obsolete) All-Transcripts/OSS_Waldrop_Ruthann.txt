 Nykolaiszyn. Today is Tuesday, November 18, 2014. I  am in Stillwater, Oklahoma, interviewing Ruthann Rogers Waldrop today as  part of the O-STATE Stories Oral History Project. Thank you so much for  joining me today.  R. Waldrop I   m glad to be here.  Nykolaiszyn Ruthann, I   d like to learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell me  where you were born and the year you were born?  R. Waldrop Okay, I was born in Pawnee, Oklahoma, on February 20, 1942. I gave you a  little extra information there, but I want to also tell you that all I did in  Pawnee was be born because my parents lived in Perry  Oklahoma , and  they didn   t have a big hospital there. My dad was from Pawnee. He wanted  me to be born in Pawnee, so I was.  Nykolaiszyn Okay. Why don   t you go ahead and tell me a little bit about your mother and  your father?  R. Waldrop My father grew up in Pawnee on a farm, one of six boys. Among other  things, when he was growing up, he was the drum major at the high school.  Then, he was the state president of the FFA  Future Farmers of America . In  that position, he was given help to go to college. They tried to make sure he  got to go to college. At first, he wasn   t even going to try, and so then  they   said,    That   s ridiculous. You should go to college.    He ended up going to  Oklahoma State University, which then was Oklahoma A M. He worked  his way through college. He was the janitor of the Methodist church and a  variety of different kinds of jobs, but he did get his degree. Then he got a job  in Perry, Oklahoma, as the agriculture teacher at the high school.  Meanwhile, my mother grew up in Chickasha, Oklahoma, and Chickasha  was the home of Oklahoma College for Women. When she was old enough  to go to college, that   s where she went. She lived on campus, even though  her parents had lived there, and she worked her way through college by  working in the dining room. I think she ended up supervisor of a lot of it.  She went to Oklahoma College for Women, and she majored in drama and  English with, I think, a minor in languages. When she got out of school, she  taught somewhere for a year, (I forgot where) and then she ended up moving  to Perry as the English and drama teacher. That   s where my parents met.  They dated secretly that year that she met him because it was against the  rules for teachers to date each other. At the end of the year, they went in and  told the superintendent that she would have to resign because they were  getting married. At that time, it was against the rules for married women to  work. No one was more surprised than he was that they were getting  married. (Laughs) He didn   t know that they even had that going on at all,  but they did marry, and a year later, I was born.  Nykolaiszyn Go ahead and tell me their names.  R. Waldrop Okay. My mother   s name was Elizabeth Green, (she   s Elizabeth Rogers)  and my father is Murl Rogers. The part I left out was that after they married  and I was born, World War II came along, and he enlisted in the Army. He  never was sent overseas. He just rode around. Mother said he fought the  battle of the troop trains. He was sent all around to different places. When  the war was over, he got a job, more or less what I would call in this day and  age, mentoring the soldiers that were farmers. He was sent out by the  Veterans Administration to check on them and see what they could do to  help them to be successful. He went to various places in Oklahoma, but  ended up in Hugo, Oklahoma, the home of, at that time, the Al G. Miller  Circus, which made it a really fun place to be.  After a while, he was offered the job of chamber of commerce secretary,  which was the executive secretary. It was like a director of the chamber of  commerce. While he was there, he was able to help them to obtain a glove  factory for the city, which really helped the economy and made him kind of  the hero of the town. Through one of the people there, they recommended  him for the job of the first full-time director of the Oklahoma State  University Alumni Association. He came here when I was in the eighth  grade, and it had just changed from Oklahoma A M to Oklahoma State  University, maybe the year before it. It was just right at that time. One of the  things that he did was that he offered people memberships.  If they joined the Alumni Association and they had an old diploma that said  Oklahoma A M College, he would give them a new diploma that said  Oklahoma State University. He hired me to go to the registrar   s office, I  believe it was, to look up all their records to make sure they really  graduated. That was my first job was doing that. (Laughs) Then, I think for,  like, twenty-five years   you may know more than I do. My mother   s told  me, and I   ve forgotten. He was the alumni director, the first full-time one, so  he started a lot of the programs that they still have going at Oklahoma State  University for the alumni.  Nykolaiszyn Well, let   s back up a little bit and talk about growing up in Hugo. What was  that like for you?  R. Waldrop I liked living in Hugo. I thought I was the luckiest kid in the world because I  lived where they wintered circuses, not only the Al G. Miller but some  smaller ones, too. I have a memory that   s just a great memory, and that is  sitting with this little girl at lunchtime. I think I was in the fourth grade and  she was in the second or first. All I know is she was really little. She was  small enough that her feet didn   t reach the floor, and her name was Perky.  She said,    Just call me    Perky Percolator   ,    and she sat there and told me  about her sisters that were trapeze artists. I just thought that was so cool. At  that time, there was a movie that was being made called The Greatest Show  on Earth which starred Jimmy Stewart as a clown that was in disguise. It  was a great story, and I think (I   ll say the wrong person) the blonde that was  the star, I want to say Betty Grable, but I may be wrong.  Jerry Waldrop Hutton.  R. Waldrop It was Betty Hutton. Her sister was the stand-in for Betty Hutton to do the  trapeze acts, so she was telling me all about that. I just thought that was so  cool that I knew somebody that knew somebody that was doing something  that sounded famous. Going forward, I later was able to go back to Hugo  and ask about that situation. The owner of one of the circuses said,    Oh,  yes.    He told me the name of the family, and he told me Perky became a  trapeze artist. That was kind of fun to know that. Every year at the   not  year, but we thought of like the year   the beginning of the summer, the year  for the circus to go on the road, they started out by having a big parade in  Hugo. The whole town turned out for it. The thing that made it so special  was that they had on all their new costumes. Everything had been made for  them over the winter to start over again, and they were just sparkling new,  everything about it. We got to see that.  Then they always put on a performance for the Hugo people, so I went to the  circus every year to see before they took off. I also had a girl in my Girl  Scout troop whose father painted the wagons. Now, you might think  painting the wagons would be just painted blue or yellow. No, he painted  tigers and lions and elephants on the wagons. They, for a while, had a pet  tiger cub, and she told me, the daughter, that they had to get rid of him  because he got big enough to   his claws had grown out, and he tore a big  hole in his father   s leather jacket. That was the end of the pet, but they just  gave it back to the circus. (Laughs) Nobody gives away a cat that   s more  than that.  Anyway, I was around circus people that did things like that. Then I  belonged to a church that had a living Christmas nativity scene every year,  and the circus people provided the camels for that and some of the other  animals. We just had this magnificent scene every year, just like you would  expect on a Christmas card. We thought we were really in a special place,  getting to be there where all that was going on.  Nykolaiszyn You transitioned to Stillwater, Oklahoma, in the eighth grade. How was that  transition for you?  R. Waldrop It was kind of hard because I was used to   first of all, you know, I glowed  in my father   s reputation. People would come up to me in Hugo and say,     Are you really Murl Rogers    daughter?    That was just really fun. My father  not only was the chamber of commerce secretary, but he also did a farm  show on the radio. All the farmers knew him. I came here, and I was  anonymous. (Laughs) Nobody cared  First of all, that sounds funny for a  kid. I needed to be myself anyway, not that, and the circus is gone. Then, the  school was larger, and it was difficult at first, feeling at home because of  that.  Nykolaiszyn What school did you attend when you came to Stillwater?  R. Waldrop I attended Stillwater Junior High, which the building is no longer that. Now  they have a middle school and a junior high, but when I was there it was the  sixth and seventh grade. The seventh and eighth grade was Stillwater Junior  High. If you want to find it today, the building still exists, but it   s inside the  Stillwater Library. They built the library around the Stillwater junior high.  Stillwater Public Library   s area where they have their meeting rooms and  the two-story part of it was my junior high. That   s where it was.  Then, you   d probably be interested to know where I went to high school.  Well, what is now the community center, it says on it Stillwater Junior High.  That happened later. I was the last graduating class of that building in  Stillwater High School, and we were called Stillwater High School. The  next year, the students moved into the new area, which is across from  Boomer Road, and they called it C. E. Donart High School at that time. I  went to Stillwater High School. It was an old building with wooden floors  that they rubbed oil into that smelled kind of like, you know, that, the way  that smells. (Laughs) I really enjoyed my high school time with my friends,  yes.  Nykolaiszyn When you were in high school, we know your dad put you to work right  away when you first moved. Did you have any other jobs as you progressed  through high school years?  R. Waldrop No, they didn   t expect me really to work. That was one summer that I did  that. The rest of the time, I was just busy being a teenager. My favorite thing  to do was drama, so I was in plays. I was busy being various characters in  plays and things. That   s what I did.  Nykolaiszyn When it came time to talk about college, what were your thoughts?  R. Waldrop Well, I didn   t have any choice. You know, I was just glad I could go to  college. My father told me that I could go anywhere I wanted to go to  school, but if I wanted to eat, I   d go to Oklahoma State University. He was  going to pay for it. I decided that that was okay with me, and I liked OSU,  anyway. My family often took me to basketball games, occasional football  games, and I just loved the university, anyway. It wasn   t a problem. He did  that, and then he did another thing. In some ways, my father reminded me of  Archie Bunker  All in the Family . He had his dominating ways. He told me  that I could only major in home economics because my mother had never  used her degree for anything (she raised five children and stayed home) and  that I would just graduate and become a housewife anyway. It would be a  waste for me to do anything but to learn how to use my housekeeping skills  and things.  I majored in home economics and what I was more interested in than that  was   well, I thought of some things, but I knew I couldn   t do it. I thought  it   d be kind of fun to major in horticulture and do greenhouses someday, that  kind of thing. I thought of that and various other things, but I knew that I  couldn   t. I thought if I was going to have some kind of a career, it probably  would have to be as a teacher and I   d have to work my way around through  home economics. I had a home ec advisor who said,    You know what would  be really neat for you to do? Why don   t you have a triple major?    She pulled  out this little sheet of paper, and on it she had that you wouldn   t have to live  in the home management house, which was one of the requirements for most  people, but it took longer to finish if you did that. She said,    We   ll not  include that if you major in general home economics, and preschool  education, and family relations and child development.    I agreed to do that  with the idea, also, I   m getting my elementary teaching certificate. I took all  of that on, and I started college. I didn   t say this, but I started it the summer I  graduated from high school because   .  Nykolaiszyn In what year?  R. Waldrop That would   ve been 1960.  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  R. Waldrop The reason I did that is    why not?   . You know, I had the summer off. It was  either go get a job or go to college, so I went to college and took English. I  may have taken something else, but I know I took English. That   s how I  ended up with a triple major. I had so many hours by the time I graduated. I  graduated three and a half years, though, and that was because I went year-round.  Every summer, I went back and took more classes. If I had it to do  again, I would not have a triple major. Having been a teacher, I have learned  that it   s nice to work on your master   s and some of those hours could   ve  been on the other side of the degree. I could   ve picked up hours, and still it  wouldn   t have to go for the regular degree.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about some memorable classes or professors you remember.  R. Waldrop I had a favorite professor, and that was Josephine   now I   m going to say  her name wrong. I want to say Loman, but that may be a famous person. Her  name was Josephine  Hoffer , and she was my professor when I was  between my junior and senior year in the summertime. My high school  friend, who was also a home ec major that was a really good friend of mine,  took the class together. It was mainly graduate students. She expected so  much of us, and we worked our heads off. We learned so much as a result of  it that I learned more from her than anybody. She demanded of us the same  thing she demanded of the graduate students. It was a child development  teacher. We had to do lots of research at the library, so we practically lived  in it all summer. I can   t even remember what the things were, but that was  my favorite one. We nominated her as the teacher of the year for the college,  and she won. (Laughs) Judy, my friend, was really good at writing, so she  helped write up a lot of stuff. I was there with her. We rewarded her as the  teacher of the year. Professor, I guess it would be professor.  Nykolaiszyn What building would you have most of your classes in?  R. Waldrop Most of my classes were in the home ec building after I got through, past the  freshman year where I was going all over the place. The building is the one  that   it   s located where they now have, what they   re now calling   what   re  they calling it today? I just was there. Life   is it called Life? It   s not called  Life Science. They don   t call it home ec anymore.  J. Waldrop Life Science.  R. Waldrop I spent a lot of time in the preschool lab.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me about that.  R. Waldrop I loved the things that I learned in the preschool lab. I enjoyed the children,  and I got a job. I had a little job, and my job was sitting with a table full of  three-year-olds. I think four of them. I think there probably were four  because it was a little short table. I sat at one end, and they had a spot at the  other end for a student to sit in and have lunch with us. I had lunch with the  preschool children. My job was to see that they tried all the food that was on  their plate and that they behaved while they were sitting there and ate their  lunches, or as much as you could get them to do it. They were a lot of fun.  I had a really embarrassing experience there, and that was one day when this  overweight student came and sat at the other end. That was fine. I had no  problem with that, but there was this little   you know, three-year-olds will  say what they think. She turned to her and said,    You   re fat.    Well, this poor  student didn   t know how to handle that, so she looked down and just started  eating. I couldn   t think of what to say. The little girl thought she hadn   t  heard her, so she said it louder. I told her that that wasn   t polite, but for  years I tried to figure out what I could   ve done to help that girl from feeling  embarrassed. Right now I   m overweight, and if a little kid said,    You   re  fat,    I   d say,    You   re right.    (Laughs) That would   ve been the best answer  for the student to have had is,    You   re absolutely right. I like to eat.    That  would   ve ended the problem, but she was embarrassed and wouldn   t say  anything.  I kind of failed that one, but I enjoyed the children a lot. There was a little  boy. Let me give you an example of what   there were a lot of fun things.  There was a little boy, and he was younger than most of the others in the  room. Why he was in the same room with everybody else, I   m not   maybe  he just barely made the cut. At that time, knock-knock jokes were going  around. Some of the kids really kind of got it, and he heard everybody  saying,    Knock-knock. Who   s there?    They   d say something funny, and  everybody   d laugh. He came up to the teachers, he   d come up to them and  say,    Knock-knock,    and they   d say,    Who   s there?    He   d say,    John.     They   d say,    John who?    and he   d say,    John Smith.    That wasn   t his name,  but like that was his name. Then he   d just laugh and laugh and laugh.  (Laughs) We just thought he was so cute trying to do knock-knock jokes,  but he didn   t really get the idea.  Nykolaiszyn Where did you live during your college years?  R. Waldrop Most of the time, I lived at home. That was because it didn   t cost anything,  but I also was a member of Kappa Delta sorority. I had lunch with them  every day. I could have lunch with them. I went to all their meetings and all  their parties, and for one quarter I got to live in the house. Now, if I   d been  more ambitious and gotten a job, I probably could   ve lived more in the  house, but I liked my situation the way it was. The one quarter that I lived in  the house, the first weekend that I was there I went out on a date with my  future husband. He got me back about two minutes past curfew, and I was  grounded for the next weekend. If I did that at my house, my mother said,     Don   t do that again     (Laughs) Mother was a lot more lenient than the  house mothers that they had at that time. The house mother was wonderful,  but they were strict back then.  Nykolaiszyn How would you get from your parents    house to campus?  R. Waldrop I usually rode with my father. We just had one car. He let me out on  campus, and I stayed there all day. Then I rode home in the evening, or I  rode home with my boyfriend. (Laughs) A lot of transportation was  available to me from my boyfriend.  Nykolaiszyn I   m assuming that your boyfriend is sitting next to you right now.  R. Waldrop He is. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  R. Waldrop The others didn   t ever take me back and forth places.  Nykolaiszyn Why don   t you tell me how you met your husband?  R. Waldrop Okay, that was the reason I said that I would do this because I think it   s a  fun story. When I was a freshman, I was a sorority pledge. We had a pledge  meeting in the fall near the first of the   I think it must have been the end of  September, somewhere in there, when this pledge meeting took place. The  person who was the social chairman for the pledges told us that the social  event for the month was going to be a hayride, the whole sorority were  going to go on a hayride, and that the members had told her that the pledges  were going to be responsible for the entertainment. They suggested finding  some group that sang because it was a hayride and you   d be in wagons. If  we found some kind of a singing group, that   d be really good to go with this.  She said,    Don   t worry. I have good news. I am dating a member of a  quartet, and they   re called the Four Phis. They   re pretty good, and the best  thing is they   re cheap. We can get them for not much money, and they   re  really neat boys. I like all of them. I don   t think that   s going to be a problem,  but I think that the quartet would have a lot more fun if they had dates.  Would some of you like to volunteer to be dates for the quartet?    I just  thought that sounded like fun, so I volunteered, and they gave me Jerry.  They told me his name was Jerry Waldrop, and I   d never heard the word  Waldrop before. I wrote it down and practiced it all day long before he  came, and he came and picked me up at home the night of the hayride. The  first thing he did after we left was he suggested we go out for a Coke so that  we could get acquainted. We probably went to Sonic. We went to a drive-in  somewhere, and we just had the best time talking to each other.  Then he told me that he needed to go practice a little bit.    Would that be  okay?    We went to the dorm where my sorority was housed at that time.  They were in the process of building a brand new house. It was nearly done,  but it wasn   t quite completed. They couldn   t move in, so they were housed  in one of the dorms. The quartet was going to practice in the living room or  the living area of the dorm. He said,    Would it be okay if  you  just went  and sat down and listened to it while  we  practice?    He went over, and they  started practicing these folk songs. I found out he was the lead singer, and he  had this beautiful voice. I just, oh, that was it. I was smitten by him from  then on. (Laughs) He had on jeans, and he put his hands in his back pockets  and sang his little head off. (Laughs) I just thought,    My goodness, can he  sing      Then we were on the hayride, and of course they put the whole quartet on  one wagon. They had several, but since I was with the quartet, I got to be  one of the ones with the entertaining. They had guitars and banjos and  everything, and it was just so much fun. I had a great time. Then he asked  me out again and again, and I dated him for three, well, for two years. Then  he graduated because he was older than I was, and I thought he was really a  man of the world. (Laughs) He graduated and went to work as a teacher  because he was a music major, and he would come back sometimes on  weekends to see me. Three and a half years after I first met him, I married  him, and I married him the weekend after I graduated in January. One  weekend, I graduated. The next weekend, I got married.  Nykolaiszyn Wow.  R. Waldrop That   s how I met him, and he   s been singing ever since. (Laughs) It   s been  music all my life since then. That   s kind of different, I think.  Nykolaiszyn Tell me a little bit about graduation day.  R. Waldrop Graduation day was not really until the spring. I officially graduated   I said  that wrong, didn   t I? I graduated but didn   t have a ceremony. Okay. In order  to do the ceremony, you had to come back in the spring. By then, I was  married to him and living in Kansas. I took the train as close to Stillwater as  I could get. He couldn   t come. There was some reason he couldn   t. Probably  he was still teaching school. I came on the train by myself, and my parents  met me. Maybe it was Perry. I can   t remember for sure where they had the  train, but the train doesn   t even run where it was then, now. They picked me  up and took me home, so I got to see my family, and they saw me graduate.  Mother said,    I paid for this. I expect to see you walk across the stage,    and  I did. Afterwards, we went out for lunch with some friends, or dinner,  whatever it was, and that was it. It wasn   t any big, spectacular thing for me,  although I was really happy to do it, but I left my husband behind.  Nykolaiszyn Where was the ceremony held?  R. Waldrop It was held in the field house. No, it was the stadium. It was outside.  Nykolaiszyn Okay.  R. Waldrop Wrong name. There were so many, just huge numbers of people, so there  wasn   t anything intimate about it because there was so many. Everybody  graduated. Whether you were in the college of engineering or home  economics, we were all in the same graduation. I can   t even imagine. I can   t  remember how long it must   ve taken for all of us to go across the stage. I  think they did one at a time, one school after another. We were all there. My  parents were in the stadium, watching.  Nykolaiszyn After graduation the first time, before the ceremony, you moved to Kansas.  Kind of tell me how life progressed.  R. Waldrop Oh, gosh, life with him was wonderful. Life in Kansas was terrible. Nothing  against the state of Kansas, but he was teaching in this little town near the  border of Colorado. It was the Plains. The people there were nice, but he had  been part of a bunch of bachelors. He didn   t know any couples at all. When  I married him, he moved me into this apartment which was the nicest one he  could find and it was above the Gamble   s store. We had this one-bedroom  apartment with a kitchen that was so small that when you opened the oven  door it hit the wall on the other side. You couldn   t open it completely. It was  that narrow. That didn   t bother me so much, but the fact that I didn   t know  anybody. He   d go away to   since it was the middle of the year, I couldn   t  get a job at that time because it was January and I had a teaching degree.  There were no openings for teachers, and I didn   t know how to get a job  anywhere else. I stayed home, and I spent the whole day figuring out what I  was going to have for dinner. I got out all my new cookbooks and read  through them and figured all this out. We did invite people to dinner, but it  was always his bachelor friends because that   s the only people we had to  invite. They   d eat and leave, so it was a lonely time. Then we had another  problem. The farmers had their land and soil banks which, in this case, was  a real problem because the wind would blow and we were having dust  storms. When they talk about the Dust Bowl, when the dust storms came, I  couldn   t see anything but dirt out the windows. It would seep in under my  windowsills. I can tell you the stories that they have in the Panhandle of the  Dust Bowl days. It would go all over my floor and everything. Every time it  did, I had to mop the floors and start all over again. Even though you put  stuff to try to stop it, it came in anyway.  You couldn   t go anywhere or do anything because of the dirt, and that was  horrible. I really, really had a hard time with that. For the rest of the year, I  was fighting dust, and no friends except for him. I watched a lot of  television because it didn   t take that long to fix the house up. I would go  out   there was a grocery store across the street, so the highlight of my day  was buying food for dinner that night. That was kind of where I was until  school was out. Then we did something that probably my parents wouldn   t  have thought was real bright. He knew that this was not a good situation, so  he resigned without a job. At the end of the year, he had no job because he   d  resigned. We thought we   d go somewhere else, so we thought what you do,  you resign instead of looking for a job first and then resigning. (Laughs)  I told my parents that he had resigned, and they said,    You can stay with us  this summer because we   re going on a trip around the world. If you will  come to Stillwater and spend the summer with us and take care of your little  brothers,    (I had four)    then Jerry could go take some master   s classes at  OSU.    We planned to do that for the summer, but before that, before it was  time to do that when school was out, before we were heading there, we went  to Colorado looking for jobs. We picked Colorado because it was pretty.  That was our way of thinking back then.    Where would be a good place to  go? Well, Colorado   s pretty. Let   s go there.    Off we went to Denver and  applied for jobs. The first place that we went was one of the school districts  that OSU had said was just fantastic, which was called Jefferson County  Schools.  We applied there, and he had wonderful references from his   the principal  had given him just great references. They said,    We really want to hire you,  but we have already over-hired. We really can   t do it, but we   ll put you on  the list.    They didn   t even interview me at that place, but the next place that  we interviewed was called Littleton, which was the southern suburb of  Denver, Littleton Schools. I bought a new dress to go interview, and they  liked me because I knew the new math, things other than base ten. That was  the new thing to work with: other bases than ten. I knew about it, so they  liked me a lot because I could do all that. They loved him, and they said the  same thing.    We would love to hire you, but we   ve over-hired, and we don   t  have any positions.     At that point, we gave up and went back to Stillwater and didn   t know what  in the world we were going to do. My parents took off for Europe. I was  there with my little brothers when the phone rang, and it was Littleton  Schools saying,    We   d like to hire you.    We were so relieved. They hired us  both. They sent us contracts, and we signed them. Two weeks later,  Jefferson County offered them to us, but we already had them. It all worked  out, and we had the summer in Stillwater with my brothers. It was a good  time for us. We enjoyed being back on campus and around the campus. My  brothers love him. I got a little jealous. One of my brothers kept taking him  out to play tennis all the time, and I was back at the house while he was out  running around with my brothers. Then it was time to go to the Denver  Metro area. We moved there, the two of us with our cat. we had a little  Siamese kitten.  The three of us arrived in the Denver Metro area, and we found an  apartment to move into that was a basement apartment. The real estate agent  that was showing it to us said,    You probably won   t like this,    but it was  double the size of the one we had before, the rent was cheap, and it was  furnished. We didn   t really have any furniture. The other place had been  furnished, in Kansas. We thought we were in heaven. We hadn   t been there  a day when Jerry came downstairs where we lived. He said,    You won   t  believe who I just met. There   s another couple that have just moved in that  just graduated from OSU. She   s going to teach elementary school. He has a  degree in science, and he   s going to be a food inspector. They   re just the  neatest people.    That was Jim and Jeannie Chandler, and they became our  best friends immediately. I had a job teaching third grade, and she did, too,  in different schools. We had everything in common. I went from no friends  to some of the greatest friends we ever had. That was the way we started  out, and then we just had a wonderful time as young married people.  Nykolaiszyn You were in     R. Waldrop Probably more than you wanted to know. (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn You were in Colorado for quite some time, and now we   re in Stillwater.  How did you get back to Oklahoma?  R. Waldrop Over the years, we loved being in Denver. We did all the mountain things,  different kinds of things, and enjoyed the mountains, and had been up and  down those mountains all different ways, doing all different kinds of things,  but now we   re getting older. We had four couples that were really, really  good friends when it got time for us to retire. Three of them were moving  away, so we weren   t going to have them anymore. The other one was  moving into a real exclusive retirement community that had millions of  things for them to do, and we figured that they weren   t going to have much  time to spend with us, even though they were good friends. We decided to  consider going somewhere else. We looked around the United States, we  really did, at different places that we might go, but we finally decided that  the best place to go would be Stillwater, back home, not just because of my  parents.  My father had died. I didn   t realize that my mother really needed someone  near her more than I thought because she did such a good job acting like  everything was fine. We really moved here because of the university, the  fact that we like Oklahoma, and then the fact that I have a lot of relatives  that live here. The other thing is that the cost of living was less, and to buy a  house here, it seemed like they were giving them away compared to  Colorado. My son lived here, and he had gone back to college and was  working on an engineering degree. He started telling us what houses cost,  and we thought,    My goodness     Then the sports teams and everything are  here and all the other things that you have at the university, like the dramas.  In fact, I   m going to a play this Friday night. There   s just always things to  do.  We decided that we would move back here, and we started looking on the  internet for houses. That   s a really interesting thing. We had a computer  upstairs, and he came downstairs and said,    There   s not anything there.  We   re probably making a big mistake. There   s not going to be anything.    I  don   t know why he didn   t see it; he had the site there. I went upstairs and  looked at the houses on this site that he had, which was   I can   t think of the  name of the real estate company, but he had it on there. They had this house  on it that had 2,700 square feet, and an outbuilding, and a greenhouse, and  all of these things. It cost the same as our two-bedroom   I mean, not  bedroom. We were living in a condo, in a garden home, the patio home. It  was the same, a 1,300-square-feet place, and this house was the same  amount. I thought,    There must be something wrong with it.    To make a  long story short, I sent my son over to look because it was empty. He said,     You wouldn   t believe this house.    It   s this one I   m sitting in. We ended up  buying the house before we ever left and before his school year was up.  (Laughs) We bought the house, and then we came here.  When I came here, I didn   t know if I   d have any friends. I didn   t know what  would happen, except that I had a son going to school here and a grandson  in   well, two grandchildren that lived here. We went to this ballgame to  watch my little grandson play tee-ball, I think. My daughter-in-law was  sitting, she was sitting behind me with a friend. Sherry, my daughter-in-law,  told the friend that we had just moved back and these were her in-laws. She  said,    She needs to join Newcomers.    I turned around and said,    What   s  Newcomers?    Well, I had belonged to Newcomers. I belonged to  Newcomers in Denver when I had been there for years because it just had a  lot of fun things to do, and one of my friends talked me into doing it. I knew  kind of what it was like, and I said,    They have Newcomers here?    She said,     Yes, and my mother is the one that founded it.    I said,    Well, how do you  get acquainted   how do you get connected with it?    She said,    I   ll give you  my mother   s phone number.     I joined Newcomers, and then ended up with piles of friends immediately  from that. Then through the church, I had another bunch of friends. My  mother told me something that turned out to be one of the neatest things for  me. That was that in the church, which was the Christian church, on  Wednesday night they had family fun night. They played all these different  games, and they also had choir practice. You could do Bible study, but you  could play games. A bunch of them played Mahjong. Mother said,    The  one   s that play Mahjong, a bunch of them have just become really good  friends, and they do lots of things together,    so I went to Mahjong. I made  some friends there that I do everything with. I   ve gone to Fort Worth with  them, you know, just for a shopping trip. I have never lived anywhere that  was as friendly as this place is, with as many activities to do if you are  retired. This is the perfect place to live if you   re retired.  Nykolaiszyn Is there a place on campus that   s special to you, looking back?  R. Waldrop Well, the place that   s not so much with my husband, well, in a way with  him, except that most of it   s different, the Student Union because the  Student Union was where we went all the time. To do things back then, they  had a lot of places for you to actually have fun in the Student Union when I  was in college. The fourth floor, they danced. They had an area where they  played music all the time, and you could dance. They had Cokes and  sandwiches during the day, or burgers, and we would sit in booths and play  games. I played Spoons, which was a silly card game with plastic spoons.  You have to grab spoons, and they   d break and be flying all through the air  and everything. It was really fun. The Student Union had all these lounges,  and we   d go in there and study part of the time. They were so beautiful. The  ballroom, been to so many things in the ballroom over the years, from  dances to going in the latter years to the madrigal dinners there that they still  do. That   s always been a special place to us. My father   s office was in the  Student Union, so I always hung around there. Yeah, that   s the place.  Nykolaiszyn Talking a little bit more about your father, what was your impression of the  Alumni Association through his activities?  R. Waldrop I thought that he   first of all, it was really important to him. In fact, it was  the thing that I was   I resented it a lot of the times because he would go  back at night, and he spent more time at the alumni building than he did at  home. We were kind of second to the Alumni Association, but I was very  proud of the things that he was doing. One of the things that I found really  amazing, and I   m sure my mother told you about, were the tours that they  took. My parents back then would plan the world tours and the different  kinds of tours themselves and go to places they   d like to go. Then they  would invite the other people to go with them. They took people on just  wonderful trips, and that was the thing that I really liked. Then, another  thing they did that I really thought was a good thing that he did was the fact  that he did these banquets for the seniors in high school. He built up the  university as a result of that. The enrollment increased as he was doing these  banquets all over. I think he really did make a difference at that time.  Another thing was   I was trying to   just a minute. I have to stop and think  because when you   re my age, your mind goes away. What was it? It was  really good. (Laughs) Well, he did something that was hard on our family,  but it made me really appreciate the way I think people ought to act when  they have positions of responsibility where they are public servants. That  wasn   t what I was going to say. Mother doesn   t remember this, but I do. The  board that he had would offer him raises, and he would not take the whole  amount because he didn   t think it was good for the Alumni Association.  When I hear of charity groups that are milking the public, I think of my  father and how giving he was, that he would never let our family take  advantage of the university in a way that he thought was unfair.  Nykolaiszyn Do you remember any interactions he would have with university  presidents?  R. Waldrop Oh, yeah, he knew everybody. (Laughs) He always knew the presidents of  the university. They came into his office to visit him all the time, as well as  the vice president. He had coffee with all the different ones. The thing that  was so much fun for me was one day I was waiting in his outer office to see  him, maybe to go home, and one of my high school classmates that I wasn   t  real close to, a boy, was sitting there waiting to see him about something. He  was now in college. He heard my dad talking to the governor, and he said,     Is that really the governor?    I said,    Yeah.    That reminds me of the other  thing that he did. He lobbied for the university a lot, so he knew all the  senators and people, and he knew the governors.  It was sometimes really frustrating to him when people were not  encouraging him and were not offering to give more money to the  university. He was their number-one fan for both the football team and for  getting funds for the university. I   m sure my mother must   ve told you this,  but he really is responsible for the Highway 51 going out to the turnpike, the  way that it looks now. It was not like that. We had a person running for  governor, and don   t ask me which one. I lived in Colorado. (Laughs) The  candidate for governor came to the OSU campus, and my father asked him  in front of the entire crowd if he was elected if he would get a new highway  for Stillwater from out on the turnpike going   we   re stretching this out.  J. Waldrop Cimarron. Cimarron Turnpike.  R. Waldrop The Cimarron, to the Cimarron Turnpike into Stillwater. He said,     Absolutely,    and as soon as he became governor, we got the road. I  consider that one of his major accomplishments because he made that  promise in front of everybody.  Nykolaiszyn Can you just talk a little bit about your dad   s passion for Oklahoma State?  R. Waldrop Well, you couldn   t have more passion for Oklahoma State than my father. I  used to say that he was the biggest liar that ever existed because every year  he   d get up and say,    This is the year we   re going to win all the ballgames,     (Laughs) no matter what our record had been. I was like,    Liar, liar, pants on  fire.    (Laughter) He was the most enthusiastic fan, and he just gave his  whole life to the university. He really believed in it, and he loved it. He went  to all the games. My parents went to basketball, football, baseball, and a  variety of the other things, but they had season tickets. My mother still goes  to football and basketball. She just gave up the baseball because she   s  ninety-six and trying to get out in the cold weather because most of them are  in the cold weather. She   s finally decided that isn   t good for her. The basic  thing is that she is legally blind and she goes to the games. She goes because  she wants to be with the crowd. She takes her radio and listens to it on the  radio so she knows what   s happening. She wants to be with the fans. He was  every bit as enthusiastic a fan as she was.  Nykolaiszyn She was quite the woman behind the man.  R. Waldrop She was. He would call her up to get her advice on things part of the time,  too. He was very good at writing and in English, but if he didn   t know how  to spell a word, he   d call and ask my mother, even the spelling. My mother  actually wrote some of the films that they used, that they promoted OSU  with. She wrote the script, and then he had them produced. They took them  around places, about OSU.  Nykolaiszyn What were his feelings on retirement?  R. Waldrop You know, I wasn   t here at the time, but I think his body was giving him  trouble. I don   t think he really wanted to retire, but she knows better than I  do because I was in Colorado.  Nykolaiszyn Are there any Oklahoma State memories that just, (I think meeting your  husband was very pivotal for you) memories that just really stand out, and I  know that   s one of them. Anything that we   ve missed, any memories that  just, you think     R. Waldrop This sounds trivial, but the Kappa Deltas were the first ones to ever have a  luau in the Student Union in the ballroom. That was a big party that they  had. Because they were the first ones, the Hotel and Restaurant College  decided to, well, they were going to do it, and they were going to try  everything out. When we had a luau there, they made this unbelievable feast  for us, including a pig with an apple in its mouth, and just unbelievable  Hawaiian dishes for us. We had a friend that was his fraternity brother that  had this   another one that had a beautiful, beautiful voice. He played the  bongo and sang, and it was just unbelievable. It was so much fun, and they  had made a volcano out of chicken wire and crepe paper. They used dry ice,  and it erupted every thirty minutes or so. (Laughs) That was really fun. We  just had a   that was a great party.  Nykolaiszyn What about Homecoming?  R. Waldrop Homecoming was different back then, and it was a lot of fun. Today, we  have the most amazing house decorations in the world, but back then they  had not only house decorations, which were nice, but they had floats that  were just huge that were done by   most of the sororities and fraternities did  the floats. They were just gorgeous, and we looked forward to the parade  because it had all these wonderful floats in it. It   s hard to describe it, but it  was really, really beautiful. They would have a theme just like they do now.  This was not a think of a beautiful float, but it was so funny. The big song  one year was    Green Door,    and it was about not being invited inside to the  speakeasy or something. We were playing a team that had a cougar, and the  cougar kept knocking and they wouldn   t let him in. (Laughs) Imagine all  these people dancing and having fun on the other side, and he   s over there  knocking. That was one of their floats that was just so funny. Then, I was  there when the song    the railroad goes through the middle of the house        In  the Middle Of the House  was popular. The house decorations, they had  trains everywhere going through the sorority and fraternity houses. It was  funny. I   ve never forgotten that.  I loved Homecoming. Homecoming was a lot of fun. However, I have a  story about that that is pretty funny. My husband invited me to the party to  decorate the float, float-decorating party for the Phi Delta Thetas. This was  when I was a freshman. Well, maybe it was when I was a sophomore  because   I don   t know. It must   ve been when I was a freshman. I thought  we were going to decorate the float. I got there; nobody   s decorating the  float. They had this big chicken wire thing on wheels. Nobody   s doing  anything. They   re playing all this music, they   ve got a band, and people are  dancing around the float. I asked him,    Well, when do we start working on  the float?    He said,    Well, we don   t start working on the float until the girls  go home. We   re just having a party.    (Laughs) That was kind of  disappointing. I kind of wanted to work on the float.  Nykolaiszyn Any excuse for a party.  R. Waldrop Any excuse for a party  (Laughter) I found out that it worked that way.  Nykolaiszyn As you look back now, how did attending Oklahoma State impact your life?  R. Waldrop Because of what I majored in and everything, all those home ec things, they  actually came in handy. I used every one of them. I taught elementary  school. I taught preschool at one point. In the public schools, I taught  preschool. I did home daycare for a while. I used the different things, the  home ec that I learned, but also the family relations and child development  helped me about as much as anything because when it came time to have  children and raise them myself, I used all of the things I learned from them  about the way I guided my children. I have been so glad that I learned the  things that I did from that.  Also, I can tell you one more thing that I did with that. When I was     must   ve been the end of my sophomore year because he was still around. I  talked him into taking marriage class with me. They had a marriage class in  the home ec building, in the family relations and child development courses.  It was two hours. He took it with me, and we learned a lot of things that  have helped us to be married all these years, especially one thing, and that is  to never argue with each other where you attack each other   s personality or  things about them that they can   t do anything about. You don   t talk about  their body features, or you don   t say that you hate their mother. (Laughs) I  think it   s really been good, the things I   ve learned, to help me with my  marriage.  Nykolaiszyn Just two more questions.  R. Waldrop Okay. I hope I   m saying something that... (Laughs)  Nykolaiszyn Oh, you   re doing great.  R. Waldrop I should tell you   is it on?  Nykolaiszyn Yes.  R. Waldrop Another thing about Oklahoma State University, I can   t say that all of them  went there, but two of my three children went to OSU. The first one to go  actually was my daughter, who was the youngest. The Student Union is  really special to her because she worked her way through college at the  Student Union. She did it because of a suggestion I made to her. She was a  good student, and she got all of her college courses done early in high  school. I said,    Why don   t you go take cosmetology? You could use it to go  through school. I know a girl that did that from my high school.    She did,  and she worked in the Student Union beauty shop the whole time she was in  college. It really paid for all of her fees. She worked at Silver Clippers for  Carla Peaden, who   s still there. We always go to Carla because Carla put my  daughter through school.  Then my son went to school in Colorado and flunked out because he wasn   t  trying to   he wasn   t settled down enough to go to school yet. Eventually  got married to a girl from OSU and decided to go back to school when he  was working in a factory in Bristow, Oklahoma. He was working at  Kwikset, which is a part of Black and Decker. He called me one day on the  phone and said,    Mother, I   m going to go back to school.    I thought,     Maybe, maybe not,    because he had a history of quitting. I tried not to  sound unenthusiastic. He said that Kwikset would pay for his classes after  he took them. There weren   t any strings attached other than that. He started  going to the OSU classes in Tulsa and started making really good grades,  even got a scholarship, and eventually transferred to here and got a degree in  engineering. Now he works for American Airlines as an engineer. That was  one of the delightful things, was him coming back here and getting that  degree. Of course, Monica has hers, too. She   s living back in Denver, too.  Nykolaiszyn And you have one more child?  R. Waldrop I have one more child. I shouldn   t leave him out. That is Mark, and Mark  decided that he was going to school in California. Off to California he went,  but he never finished his degree. He keeps working on it. He   s in his forties,  and he   s still working on it. Now he lives in the state of Washington, and  he   s selling new cars. He   s a car salesman.  Nykolaiszyn How many grandbabies?  R. Waldrop I have   I try to keep up with them. I was saying seven, but there   s another  one that   s on the way, so that will make eight. I count both grandchildren  and great-grandchildren. We have a new great-grandchild that   s due in  January.  Nykolaiszyn Great.  R. Waldrop My son that lived here in Stillwater (now he lives in Sapulpa and works in  Tulsa for American Airlines) has two children that are his birth children.  The lady he married had a daughter who is now married and has two  children of her own. We count them, too, in the list. They   re great children.  Nykolaiszyn Something we find when we go out and talk to people, alumni are very  passionate about OSU. What do you think it is about Oklahoma State that  sparks such loyalty in students and alumni?  R. Waldrop Well, first of all, the classes were good, all right? (Laughs) It   s hard for me  to know because I lived in a world of nothing but the Alumni Association,  you know, to the extreme. The thing I didn   t like about it, which wasn   t  what you asked, was that if we lost the ballgames then it was like somebody  died at my house, which I think is carrying it to the extreme. It   s that the  people here are really friendly people and nice people. Some of the nicest  people I know are the ones in Stillwater. They have a great university. The  buildings are beautiful, and the classes are good, and the Student Union is  unbelievable. It just won another award as the outstanding one, and it was  that way back when I was there. It was fairly new, and it was winning  awards back then as being outstanding. When we go to other campuses, we  like to go in the student union and there   s these little punky things they call  the student union. (Laughs) I feel sorry for them.  Nykolaiszyn How do you hope people remember your parents?  R. Waldrop I wish that they would remember the things that my father accomplished  because he gave his whole life to it. The way that I have described my  mother to a lot of people, it sounds funny. She was such a wonderful public  speaker, and when she was younger, she did so many community things,  too. You know, when you get old, people forget that. She was the person  that did the book reviews for all the clubs in town. She has an unbelievable  mind. Back when she was younger, it was even more that way. I did not  inherit all of her intelligence. It   s not that I   m dumb, but she   s just brilliant.  She still teaches Sunday school, and she will quote poems she learned in the  fourth grade. She hasn   t forgotten any of that. She can do verse after verse  after verse. It   s just amazing, the brilliance that she had. I just want them to  remember her as a person that gave to the community along with him.  Nykolaiszyn Looking back on your career in education, and your family, and your OSU  connections, how would you like to be remembered?  R. Waldrop I really hadn   t thought about it much. In fact, I   ve thought about what would  you put on my obituary because it just   I was always wanting to support my  husband. I would quit and start over and do all these different things, so I  don   t have any great thing that I   ve accomplished. I just want to be  remembered as a good wife and mother. That used to be enough, and now  they expect women to have all these career goals, but I just like being  somebody that helped to support my husband, make him successful. I know  that   s not popular, but I enjoy doing it. I helped him with his programs. See,  he was a music teacher, so we were always putting on programs. I even  wrote a bunch for him. That   s not what was really important. It was just  being there for him, enjoying each other. The thing that I want to have  accomplished more than anything is for my children to be successful, and  happy, and good Christians. That   s what   s important to me.  Nykolaiszyn Well, is there anything else you   d like to add before we close on out?  R. Waldrop Not really. I can   t think of anything.  Nykolaiszyn Ruthann, thank you very much for your time today. We really appreciate it.  R. Waldrop You   re welcome.  -------  -------
