 Wilson  Houston  Today is December 5, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program, at the Oklahoma State  University Library. Today I am in Stillwater, Oklahoma, at the home of  Winfrey Houston, who I will be talking with for the Stillwater History  Series of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project. So thank you  for joining me today.  You   re welcome.  To start out, would you tell me when and where you were born?  I was born on June 1, 1926, in Stillwater. The address was 902 South  Husband Street.  Does that home still exist?  It exists, but the house has been moved. Groom   s Furniture Company is  on that location now, but it   s an old Victorian house with a porch around  two sides of. It   s on the south side of Ninth Street, somewhere around  McFarland or McDonald.  Okay. So you were born in that house.  In that house, yes, yes.  Did you have any siblings?  No. My father was a World War I veteran, and he had been injured in  the war in France and spent two years in a hospital in France. When he  got out of the hospital in about 1920, he came   he was from Texas,  originally. Around Denton, Texas, North Texas. He came to Stillwater to  5  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  go to college. He met my mother, and her name was Lillian Holbrook,  H-O-L-B-R-O-O-K. She lived with her parents, Dr. C. R. Holbrook and  wife was Nancy. Nancy Frances Holbrook.  So was she going to college, or how old was your mom?  No, no. Mother was working downtown. She had been to college. She  didn   t graduate, but she had been to college, but she was working  downtown.  So they just met in Stillwater?  She was working in a jewelry store, and he came in to buy a gift for his  sister, and they got acquainted, yes.  What was he studying at Oklahoma A M?  Before the vet medicine school, they had a course in veterinary  medicine, and he was taking that.  Did he become a veterinarian?  No, he did not. No, he was killed in a car accident in 1927. They were  married in 1921. I was born in 1926, and he was killed in a car accident  in 1927.  Wow. Did he graduate Oklahoma A M?  No, no. He was in the insurance business.  So did your mother continue working in the jewelry store after   ?  For a short time, but then in 1929, she went to work at the courthouse,  and she worked there for about forty-five years. She worked eight years  in the court clerk   s office, and then I think thirty-five years in the county  clerk   s office. That would be forty-three years at the courthouse, yes.  Did she ever remarry?  Did she remarry? No, she did not. No.  Well, what was growing up in Stillwater like in the    20s and    30s?  Well, I didn   t have anything to compare it with at that time. (Laughs)  My grandfather had a big house. He built this big Victorian house over  on Husband Street, and my mother lived there with her parents and  6  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  helped take care of my grandfather, who was up in his nineties at that  point. Then when she married, her husband and she both lived there in  the house with my grandparents until after my grandfather died. And I  think he died in like 1922 or something like that. Then the city paved  both streets, both Husband Street and Tenth Street. This house was on a  corner and occupied about a quarter of a block, and she had paving taxes  assessed against both sides of the property. This was about the time the  Depression hit in 1929, and she couldn   t pay the paving taxes. So she  had to sell that big house and bought a small house down in the  southeast part of Stillwater, on Fern Street, on a dirt street. And that   s  where I grew up, 1414 South Fern.  So where did you go to elementary school?  Lincoln.  How many elementary schools were there in town at that time?  Well, there was Lincoln. That was on Twelfth and     Is that what   s Lincoln Academy now?  Yes. Okay, there was Lincoln. There was Jefferson, which is where the  school district office is now, on Main Street. There was Eugene Fields,  which is where the Consumer   s IGA store is now. And then the newest  school was called Norwood, N-O-R-W-O-O-D, and it was on the corner  of Duck and   you know where the Masonic Lodge is? Well, that was  Norwood school.  Okay, so Duck and Miller?  Yes, yes, that   s right.  So did you start to school in kindergarten?  There wasn   t any public school kindergarten, but the Catholic school  had a kindergarten. I went to there for a short period of time, but I didn   t  go the full year. That was before public schools had kindergarten.  So you started to Lincoln in first grade?  I started Lincoln and I was there until about half way through the sixth  grade. Lincoln School, there was this two-story building, which was the  old building built in about 1895. And then there was, out on the west  side in a separate building, it   s now been joined together, but there was a  one-story building that was built probably in the early-   30s, and it was  7  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  called the New Building. Back during the Depression, I guess the school  didn   t have much money to maintain the buildings, and the roof leaked.  There was lathe and plaster walls and ceiling, and one day during class a  big chunk of plaster about so big fell from the ceiling and hit the teacher  on the head, broke her neck, and she couldn   t work anymore after that.  Wow. And she was teaching class when that happened?  She was teaching class when that hit.  Was that in your class?  No, it wasn   t in my class.  Goodness.  But they moved the sixth grade, then. We moved to what now would  be   well, it   s where the Community Center is. It was originally the  junior high school.  And what grade did the junior high normally start with?  Well, at that time, the grade schools were one through sixth. Junior high  had the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth. They had four grades. The  south high, which is where the library is now, had the eleventh and  twelfth. That was the configuration when I went. It   s changed from time  to time.  Was there a north high school?  No.  If that south high school was called South High School, it was just the  name? (Laughter)  Well, South High, North High because from year to year, sometimes the  junior high would be down south, the high school would be up north,  and they flip-flopped it back and forth. So they called it North High and  South High, yes.  So in elementary school, would you walk to school?  Yes, oh, yes. There wasn   t any bus system, unless you lived out in the  country. There was no bus system in town.  Do you know when the bus system started?  8  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  In town? Well, I don   t know when it was. I   m going to guess probably  after World War II, probably, in town. Because the schools were located  within walking distance of the neighborhoods, but of course, as the town  got larger that distance got shorter, the walking distance. (Laughs) It  didn   t used to be a problem for a first grader to walk five or six blocks to  elementary schools. Nowadays, parents wouldn   t allow their first  graders to do that.  I remember the first day I went to Lincoln school. Mother worked, she  was a widow. She worked, and my grandmother lived with us, so I  walked to school. The first day I went to school there was a second or  third grader that kind of took me under his wing and showed me where  to go and kind of looked out for me. So I had an advocate with me.  (Laughter)  That   s helpful.  Yes, it was very helpful.  Would you eat lunch at school?  No, no. Come home for lunch. Yes, there wasn   t any school lunch  program. The kids that came from the country would bring a sack lunch.  And then what about recess? Was there a playground?  Well, at recess it was just fifteen minutes of run and play. I think there  was a teacher out on the school grounds to keep kids from hurting each  other but I don   t remember anything being organized about it. There was  some playground equipment. They had some swings and teeter-totters  and slides and a few things like that. Later on, as kids started breaking  their arms, they started taking those away from the school, from the  playground.  Would you walk to the Main Street area ever?  My mother worked at the courthouse, and there was some point   and I  don   t remember when this was. I probably was maybe in the third or  fourth grade, something like that. But it seemed like there was a time  when I would walk from Lincoln School to the courthouse, which was  six or eight blocks, after school. School would get out at three o   clock or  three-thirty, and I would walk. The library was across the street from the  courthouse, then. See, you know where that building is just north, across  Sixth Street? That was the original public library. Well, maybe not the  original one, but it was built in the late-   30s. I   d go into the library and  9  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  spend from there until about five o   clock. Then I   d go across the street  and ride home with her.  What kind of car did she have? Do you remember?  Yes, there   s a picture. I   ve got a scrapbook here someplace with a  picture of it. After my father was killed she had to go to work and got a  job at the courthouse. I had an uncle that was a county commissioner,  and he helped her buy a new car. It was a 1929 Chevrolet, Landau sedan,  kind of a deluxe Chevrolet. She had that from 1929 until about 1940, I  think.  So she got some good use out of it.  Yes. That was a great old car.  Well, was there a lot going on on Main Street then? Were there a lot of  stores?  Well, everything was on Main Street. All the grocery stores. Well, let   s  see. There were some neighborhood grocery stores. Yes, because I grew  up down on Fern Street, and there were, within walking distance of my  house, which that would be within a block and a half or two blocks in  any direction, there was about three or four little neighborhood grocery  stores where they   d have bread, milk, a few canned goods, and  lunchmeat, things like that.  And those were family-owned?  Yes, yes, yes. They were small. Downtown, there was Humpty Dumpty,  Piggly Wiggly. (Laughter) You remember those? And then Cooksey   s,  Glenn Douglass had Cooksey   s, which was at the corner of Ninth and  Main. It was a big grocery store. Then I had an aunt and uncle that put in  a grocery store in about 1940, at the corner of Ninth and Lewis, the  southwest corner of Ninth and Lewis. It was an old fashion farmer   s-type  grocery store. Everything we got was in bulk. Not canned goods,  but cookies came in forty-pound boxes, and candy came in big bulk  boxes. They had a butcher   s shop. It was really a butcher   s shop. It  wasn   t a meat market. It was a butcher   s shop with a full-size butcher  block. A lot of customers followed a butcher around. If a butcher would  move from one grocery store to another, a lot of ladies would usually  follow the butcher. That was a good part of the grocery business, was  having a good butcher shop.  What was your aunt and uncle   s grocery store called?  10  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  The People   s Grocery Store.  How long did it stay open?  Four or five years.  How did people carry their groceries out? Did they have paper sacks or  did they bring a basket?  You know, I   m trying to remember. It seems like there was some kind of  basket. Yes, they didn   t have shopping carts. They had baskets, wire  baskets with a handle to fold it up and they   d carry that around the store.  That was before Sylvan Goldman invented the shopping cart.  That was a pretty good invention.  It really was. (Laughs) That upped the grocery tab right away, where  you bought not just what you could carry, but what you could push. You  could push a lot more than you could carry.  Yes. Well, as a child, would you go to the grocery store and purchase  candy?  At the neighborhood stores. Yes, yes. Yes, you   d go to a neighborhood  store with a nickel, and you could fill up a pretty good-sized sack for a  nickel.  What kind of candy was it?  Oh, stick candy, peppermint candy, and hard candies. Candy bars were  more expensive, but hard candies were usually   you could get penny  candy. There was a whole bunch of it. They   d have big jars of penny  candy where you could get a stick of candy, handful of jelly beans or  something like that.  Well, what are some things you did for entertainment as a child?  Well, I made a lot of stuff. I was an only child and Mother was a  working mom, so I had a lot of alone time, and I built model airplanes  and model cars. And then as I got older, my models got bigger. (Laughs)  They had what was called a soap box derby, where they used to have  races downhill with cars that boys made, and I built two or three of  those. I built one that was pretty fancy. I   ve got a picture of it  somewhere. The only problem was we didn   t have any good hills in my  neighborhood. (Laughs) You had to have a pretty good friend to push  you.  11  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  So you would ride in the car?  Yes, yes, yes. But I built one that looked like an Indianapolis racecar. I  built it in with kind of bulk heads, like this, around for the hood and the  back and then had, sort of, the cockpit in there. (Gestures) Then I  covered it with screen wire. Mother replaced a backdoor, which was a  screen door, and I took the screen off that door and covered it with that.  Then around the back porch we had canvas curtains, and she replaced  those canvas curtains, so I used the canvas and covered the screen wire  with the canvas and then painted it. It looked like it might be made out  of metal. But that was a pretty neat looking little car. I traded somewhere  for a steering wheel. Most of the cars we made, you just had ropes to  turn it with, but somehow I acquired a front axle that turned and had a  steering wheel and put that on it. I don   t know whatever happened to  that car.  That   s neat. Were you in Boy Scouts?  Yes, yes, I was in the Boy Scouts there. At the National Guard Armory,  down on Ninth and Lowry, with Troop 22. The county attorney, Curtis  Williams, was the scout master. When he would run for office, our Boy  Scout troop would go out and campaign for him. We   d hand out  handbills and cards. (Laughter) He was a politician, and there was a  young guy that came to college from Guthrie, his name was Ray Matoy.  He was an Eagle Scout, and so Curtis recruited him to be his assistant  scout master. Well, to do that, Ray got a room at the National Guard  Armory where he could live, and he was the scout master down there.  And he was great. He later became a scout executive and had a career as  a scout executive. And he was really good.  And he was your den leader for a number of years?  No, he was the assistant scout master.  Oh, okay, for all the scouts?  Yes. Cub scouts had dens. Boy Scouts had troops. But, yes, Boy Scouts  was a good program. I enjoyed that.  How many years were you in it?  I was in it almost two years, until I went to work. When I started  working I had conflicts with scouts, so     Where did you start working?  12  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  When I was fourteen, at the grocery store.  For your aunt and uncle?  Yes, I worked there. I   d go there after school. I   d work there from three-thirty  until six-thirty, and then on Saturdays from like seven in the  morning until nine at night. I did that until I was sixteen, from when I  was fourteen to when I was sixteen. When I was sixteen, I went to work  for the movie theater.  Which one?  I started out at the Campus, which was selling popcorn. Campus is  where     The Hideaway?  Yes, where the Hideaway is now, yes. It was fairly new then, the  Campus was built in about 1938. It was about a 400-seat theater. Then  downtown   well, the Griffith chain and Claude Leachman was the  manager, and he was part owner of the new Griffith chain. He had the  Campus Theater, that was the newest one, and then downtown had the  Aggie Theater, which is where Teubner   s building is now. And the  Mecca. The Mecca is about where Louie   s is. The Aggie was the nicest  theater in town, and it ran the first-run, most popular movies. It had a  little candy shop in it. Then the Mecca, it showed cowboy movies and  serials. Before television, these serials that you   d go on Saturday  morning and you   d see an installment, and then you   d have to go back  the next Saturday to find out if the hero survived some death threatening  event. (Laughter)  How much did it cost?  Well, the Aggie, the highest priced one, was thirty-five cents for adults  and ten cents for children. And I think the Mecca was maybe twenty-five  cents or something. And then across the street, on the east side across  from the Mecca, was an independent theater called the Camera. They got  kind of the leftovers when it came to bookings because the Griffith  chain, they booked up the most popular movies and the independents  had to take second-run movies and things that the chains didn   t book up  ahead of them.  And then what kind of films was the Campus Theater showing?  At the Campus theater? Well, let   s see. They had a grading system. I   m  13  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  trying to think   it   s A, B, and C. Maybe it was A, B, and C. But the  Aggie had the top of the line, and the Campus had kind of the next best,  and the Mecca had the cowboy movies, and more the children-oriented  movies.  Do you remember the first picture show you ever saw?  No, but I remember the Mecca theater, and I must   ve been maybe six  years old. They had a big sign out in front that it was closed for   I don   t  remember how they said it, but they were going to install talkies. They  were going to have movies with sound. Until then, the movies were  silent. Now, I don   t remember ever seeing a silent movie, but they had  piano players that would play music to go with whatever was taking  place. One of my mentors at OSU, his name was John Monk, and he was  a lawyer for the Board of Regents back when I was a young lawyer, and  he had me doing a lot of work that he didn   t have time to do. But when  he was young, he played the piano at a movie theater, and he was just  like you   d see in the movie sometimes. I can   t remember this guy that  would   he   d sit there, and he   d have a cigarette in his mouth. He was  playing the piano, and he   d be talking to somebody all at the same time.  (Laughter) John could do that. He could play the piano and talk to you. I  never could understand how he could do that.  It would just be a local person that was playing the piano up front in the  theater?  Oh, yes. Yes. Well, it   s a paid job. Yes, it   s a skilled job. You had to be  a pretty good piano player to do that.  Yes.  You didn   t use music. You had to be able to play by ear and improvise.  So do you remember how much popcorn cost, that you were selling?  It seems like ten cents. It seems like you could get a big bag for ten  cents. And they wouldn   t allow it in all movie theaters because they  didn   t want to get their upholstery greasy. So you couldn   t take popcorn  into the Aggie Theater, but the Campus you could and the Mecca. But  you couldn   t take popcorn in. They had packaged candy at the Aggie  Theater. But Claude Leachman, that was part owner and manager of the  theaters here, was a fastidious person. I mean, fastidious. I don   t know  whether this was just a rumor or not, but I think it might   ve been true  that he went to the barber shop every day to get a haircut.  Wow. (Laughter)  14  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  So his hair always stayed the same. (Laughs) And back during the  Depression, when movie tickets were thirty-five cents, he had a maroon  Lincoln Zephyr. The Zephyr was the biggest Lincoln that was made at  that time. A big, big Lincoln. The movie business was very, very  profitable.  Could people smoke in the theaters?  Oh, no. Oh, no. No. No smoking in the theaters.  And were there beverages?  No, no. Didn   t want to get your upholstery dirty. But, you know, you go  into the theater now, and your feet stick to the floor. That just   ugh   (Laughter) That   s so different than what I was used to. But now people  go in and take these big cokes. I don   t know what that does to your  bladder, if you drink a coke like that, regularly, but golly   Yes. What about the drugstores downtown? Were there quite a few?  No, there weren   t. I remember three drugstores. There was one, Central  Drugstore. Central was there, I believe. The oldest one was the Tiger  Drugstore, and it was along there about where Louie   s is. It might   ve  been one door north of Louie   s. An old gentleman, his name was L. W.  Bras, B-R-A-S, owned it, and he was a big game hunter. This was back  in maybe the    20s that he went on a safari to Africa, and he brought back  trophies, like lions and tigers and bears, oh my  And he had those  trophies lining the wall     Of his drugstore? (Laughs)  Of his drugstore, over the fountain. I remember that. (Laughter)  Wow   If you ever went in there, you always remembered it.  I bet. So would you go get a soda at the drugstore?  Yes, more likely a coke. You could get a coke for a nickel, and a soda  was probably a dime or fifteen cents. But, yes. Then there was another  place. I can   t remember what   s there now. B C, I guess, is what   s there  now, on Ninth and Husband. But there was a place called Midwest  Creamery, and it was an ice plant. There used to be two or three plants in  town that made ice. This was before refrigerators were really obtainable.  15  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  It seems like it was the mid-   30s before the average person could afford  a refrigerator. You   d have an ice box. An ice man would come down the  street and you   d have this card with colors, like this. (Gestures) You   d  put that card in the window and if it was turned a certain color, up, why,  it meant you wanted twenty-five pounds, or a different color, fifty  pounds or seventy-five pounds or a hundred pounds. And the ice man  wouldn   t have to make two trips. He could drive down the street and see  what you wanted and take it off the back of his truck and bring it in and  put it in your ice box. The first ones I remember, it wasn   t a truck, it was  a horse-drawn wagon, when I lived down on Fern Street. The iceman, he  had a horse-drawn wagon. And the horse knew just where to go and  when to stop, made his job pretty easy.  So if people weren   t home, would the ice man just come in your house?  Yes, yes. And milk, the same way. Milk man. Milk was delivered. I  don   t remember it being sold in grocery stores when I was a kid.  And cream?  I don   t remember cream. But a quart of milk wasn   t homogenized, so the  cream would float to the top, and these milk bottles would stay kind of  like this. (Gestures) And the top part, about this much up here would be  cream and then the rest below would be milk. (Gestures)  So did you have electricity early on?  Oh, yes. I don   t ever remember not having electricity. Yes, electricity.  The city had its own electrical plant here. It used to be down north of the  Mill, across   I have a hard time remembering what   s there now. I  remember what used to be there, but it   s on the north side of Sixth  Street. There was a park up there on the north side. There   s two creeks  that come down, West Boomer and East Boomer, and they come  together at Sixth Street, and then they go under the bridge at Sixth  Street, and then they go on southeast, down into Couch Park. Then in  Couch Park, kind of at the south end of Couch Park   well, it   s south of  Couch Park, Boomer Creek down to Stillwater Creek comes in this way  and they join together. (Gestures) And then from there on, it   s the  Stillwater Creek that goes on to the Cimarron River, empties into the  Cimarron River, over by Ripley. You ever been to Ripley Bluffs?  No.  That   s an interesting place. That was a favorite place to go in high  school in the spring if you wanted to play hooky and go somewhere, go  to Ripley Bluffs. There   s a high bluff on the south side of the river. I  16  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  don   t know how tall, it seemed like it was really tall, maybe sixty feet or  so, seventy. Just an interesting place to go.  So would you jump off into the river or just hang out there?  No, no, no. The river wasn   t deep enough for that, but it was just an  interesting place to go.  Do people still go there? Do you know?  I don   t know. I doubt it. I doubt it. I don   t know what high school kids  do today. (Laughter) I don   t know, but that probably wouldn   t be very  entertaining for them.  So did many people have cars in high school?  No.  How would you get out to Ripley Bluffs?  Well, there were very, very few cars. Mother had a car and when I got to  high school it was an old car and it wasn   t always very dependable, so  she kind of turned the car over to me with the understanding that I would  be wherever she said at the time she said. Then I could have the car.  Other than that, she didn   t need it at the courthouse where she worked.  So that was a pretty good arrangement for me. I had access to the car,  but I had to get her to work at eight in the morning and bring her home  at noon for lunch and take her back and pick her up at five. And then in  between that, why, I could kind of go and do things, but I sure had to be  on time for her. There were a few guys that had cars. At one point, I  think I paid like fifteen dollars for a 25 percent interest in a Model-A  Ford, which was kind of a strip-down. It didn   t have much of a body on  it, but it had an engine and it would run.  And that was in high school?  Yes, yes. This was during World War II, when everything was rationed,  tires and gasoline, and new cars were not available at all. So all the cars  were old. They didn   t make any civilian cars for about six years, from  about 1940 until about 1946. All cars that were made in America went to  the military. So the ones that were left were old and had lots of miles.  Well, back to the Depression. Did you know that you were in a  Depression?  Oh, yes, sure. Yes, I thought we were pretty well off because Mother  17  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  had a job. And, like I say, I lived down on Fern Street, which was a dirt  street, in a little two-bedroom house with Mother, Grandmother, and I.  Yes, I was very much aware of the Depression because she, I think, in  1936, as a deputy court clerk, she was making like ninety dollars a  month. And some taxpayers became concerned about how high the taxes  were, so they got the excise board to reduce taxes, and so they cut the  salaries. And her salary was cut from ninety dollars a month to sixty  dollars a month.  Wow   So every nickel counted. But very grateful that she had a job because the  family that lived across the street, they had two or three boys. And I  think that there was a father over there, and he didn   t have a steady job. I  think he worked maybe WPA  Works Progress Administration  and  those kinds of jobs, a few days at a time. On Mondays when the mother  did the laundry, the boys would have to stay home because they only  had one pair of overalls. When she washed their overalls they   d have to  stay home.  Were you aware of many WPA projects in Stillwater?  There were some sidewalks in Stillwater. There weren   t any major WPA  projects. Well, I guess the National Guard Armory was a WPA project,  the National Guard Armory. I remember when that was built because  that was in the neighborhood where I was growing up, and it was a big  building for that era. I watched that on a daily basis. I don   t remember.  There was always something going up on the campus, even during the  Depression. There was always some construction going up on the  campus. Stillwater was unusual for the Depression days because there  were always things going on on campus. The jobs on the campus were  more stable than other jobs.  Do you remember any banks that went out?  Let   s see, the First National  now Banc First  was always around. There  was only two banks when I was growing up, the First National and the  Stillwater National, and they were both sound banks. The third bank  didn   t come to Stillwater until after the war. The other two were good,  sound banks. The First National, the banker there was a good friend of  our family, and he helped my mother get through the Depression. And  then when I came back to Stillwater as a lawyer, why, I became the  bank   s lawyer and always had a good relationship with that bank.  Downtown, let   s see, there were three or four grocery stores. Clothing  stores, Katz was a big one. Katz was an institution. (Laughter)  18  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Did you ever go to a high school dance in Katz?  At Katz, oh yes. Yes. Somewhere I   ve got a whole box full of dance  programs. This was a tradition back when I was in high school. We had  clubs in high school, social clubs, and we would compete with each  other to see who could put on the fanciest dances. (Laughter) We had  program dances. Did you ever go to a program dance?  I don   t think so. Is it like a theme?  Well, these were little booklets, little fancy booklets, and they were  printed up specially for this one occasion. There would be like three  dances and then an intermission, and then three other dances. And what  the boys would do   I think the boys did this   would be to take a date,  and then they would trade around and trade dances with other boys and  their dates. So there   d be a mix. You wouldn   t just be stuck with the  same person for the whole evening.  Did they sign off on this in the book?  The girls? I think the boys did it, but they had to make peace with the  girls on how it was done, you know. (Laughter) It was kind of a delicate  balance, and it seemed like it was on kind of a seniority basis. It seemed  like the sophomores always got the low end of the dating pool.  (Laughter) End up with fat girl that sweated or something like that.  (Laughter) As you rose in the caste system, as you moved up the scale,  why, you got to command a little more respect, had a little more to say  about who you would go with.  Did people dress up pretty fancy?  Yes, we dressed up. They were formal. We had formal dances. Girls  wore long dresses, and boys wore suits and ties. Oh, yes. Yes, it was a  dress-up affair. I remember getting, I guess, my first dress up suit when I  was in the eighth grade, and it came from Katz. I still remember what it  looked like. (Laughs)  So where were the dances held? Upstairs?  Well, Katz Hall was one, upstairs, second floor over Katz Department  Store.  Would they clear out the merchandise?  No, it was upstairs. It was a dance hall. I mean, there wasn   t anything  else up there. It was just an open space dance hall up there. There was  19  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  also one up over the Wooden Nickel, upstairs there. Have you ever been  there, over the Wooden Nickel?  No, I   ve been in Peck   s Lodge, that   s next to that.  Upstairs?  Yes.  Okay. Well, that   s a part of it, I think. It   s a big open space? It was a  dance hall, Peck   s Lodge. Yes, Peck   s Lodge, that was one. It seems like  you could rent those dance halls for like five dollars a night or  something like that.  Wow, sounds like a good deal.  Oh, and the other one was Hoke Hall, which is in my building. The third  floor of my building was a dance hall. The third floor of that is where  the credit bureau is, in my building. But it   s got a hard wood floor. It   s a  big space up there, about 3600 square feet. It was just a big open dance  hall. Mr. Hoke was telling me that back during his lifetime that he used  to rent it out for five dollars a night. There was this one group that he  was renting it to back in the    20s that he wasn   t sure what group it was,  but come to find out it was the Ku Klux Klan.  Oh, my goodness. (Laughter)  They weren   t very strong in Stillwater. They were strong over in  Cushing and Yale, but I don   t think they had a chapter in Stillwater.  So did he continue renting to them?  No, no, no. Not when he found that out  (Laughter) But there was an  old-time lawyer, name was Walter Matthews, and he was   oh, when I  first came back here as a young lawyer in my twenties, he was about my  age. But Walter was a frontier lawyer and kind of an outspoken ole    boy.  Back during the heyday of the Ku Klux Klan, he said something against  them, and it aggravated them. What they would do to people, they   d  come in with their white sheets on and pick you up at your house and  take you out and tar and feather you. Put hot tar on you, and then tear  open a pillow and shake the feathers on you. Well, that   d take you a  while to get loose from all of that. But he was a gutsy ole    boy.  (Laughter)  Speaking of the Ku Klux Klan and such things, do you remember many  segregation issues in Stillwater?  20  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Well, yes, I do. I remember that Stillwater was a totally segregated  community when I grew up. The schools were segregated. Everything  else was segregated. The movie theaters, they had a balcony in the  Mecca Theater, and I think maybe the Aggie, where blacks could go to  the movie, but they had to sit up in the balcony. I mean, there was total  segregation. And law school at OU was segregated when I went to law  school. Do you remember the name Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher?  I do.  She was in my law class at OU, and that case went to the United States  Supreme Court. The professor, a law professor that taught constitutional  law, represented OU in the Supreme Court in Washington. And she was  admitted. She was admitted to law school. They admitted her to begin  with    The old Monnet Hall, the original law school, was on the North  Oval at OU, on the east side of the North Oval. It had the big owls in the  gables of the building, big tall owls, stone owls. I   m trying to think.  There was only, I guess, three classrooms in the law school, but they  were huge. They would seat like 150 students, and they were in tiers,  like this, like this, and the professor down here. (Gestures) And it was  stair stepped up, like that. They put Ada Lois kind of up in the corner,  and put a rope around the area like you see in a movie theater, where  they want to separate something off, and she sat in that for a while.  Wow. Did you ever speak with her?  I don   t remember ever having any conversation.  Was she able to participate in discussions in the class?  I don   t recall that she did, no. I recall that she was pretty smart, a very  nice-looking black woman and was very smart. But I don   t remember. I  think she probably tried to keep a low profile because the faculty there,  it was such a transitional period, and no one quite knew what to do or  say. Everyone was afraid they were going to make a mistake, and I think  people were just very cautious about saying or doing anything. But the  segregation was a very real factor. There was a guy that was my age, his  name was Willie Lawson. Lawson was a big family, black family here in  Stillwater. But Willie was my age and although we went to separate high  schools, somehow we were acquainted with each other. I ran onto Willie  when I was in the army somewhere and visited with him. And the army  was segregated, too. When I was in the army it was segregated   really  segregated.  So did you have any interaction, generally, with the kids at C. E.  21  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Donart?  Well, that school had not been built yet. The school here where the  Community Center is, that was a junior high school. That was the  seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth grades. And then where the public  library is   not the new building, but the two-story building   we called  that South High, but when I attended it was the eleventh and twelfth  grades. And then there was a shop building down there, a little separate  building back in those days. That   s, I think, the eighth grade boys took a  year of shop and girls took home-ec.  Where was the black school?  Where was it? It was on Twelfth Street, about three or four blocks west  of the library, on Twelfth Street, on the south side, on the south side of  Twelfth Street. There was a big brick building there that was, I guess a  gymnasium. But that was Washington High School. I   m trying to think.  The principal of that black school, I can   t remember his name, but he  was an outstanding principal. He got along, he ran a good school, and he  was hired by the Stillwater School District to run the black school, and  he did a good job of it. I can   t remember his name. I remember they had  a basketball coach, who was   they had a good basketball team, and I  can   t remember what his name was. But they were having a real good  year, and he was being interviewed about how he had such a successful  year. They asked him how he was able to do that and he   d said he   d go  up to A M and watch Mr. Iba and his team play. Then he   d take some  of those plays and come back and bring them back and improve on  them. (Laughter)  Did you go to many sporting events at the college when you were a kid?  No, not many. No. I was busy. Like I say, I started working when I was  fourteen, and I had a year round job after school and Saturdays. Then  when I got to be sixteen I went to work at the movie theater. My junior  year in high school I worked sixty hours a week, besides going to high  school.  Wow.  And I   ve got grade cards to prove it. (Laughs)  That was at the movie theater and at the grocery store?  No, just the movie theater. When I left the grocery store I went to work  at the movie theater.  22  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  How late was the theater open?  Well, the last movie would start at nine in the evening, end ten-thirty. So  go to work, usually, at one-thirty in the afternoon and have my classes     when I was a junior I had all my classes in the morning. So I   d go home  and eat lunch, then go to work at one-thirty and work from one-thirty  until, I think, about four-thirty, then go home for supper, and go back to  work at six and work until the movie was out, which would be like ten-thirty.  See, that was seven days a week, except on Saturday. On  Saturday I   d go to work at nine in the morning at the Mecca and work at  the Mecca from nine until noon, then go back at one-thirty and work at  the Aggie until nine-thirty, and then go to the Mecca for what was called  the preview. That was the movie that started at nine-thirty at night and  was over about eleven or eleven-thirty. And it would be a movie that  would show the next day at the Aggie Theater.  So you worked at three theaters in town.  Yes, yes, seven days a week. And I remember I was sixteen, and I had  worked about two months, seven days and nights a week, never had a  day or night off, and I got to hearing about these guys that had a night  off. (Laughter) Well, I went in to see the assistant manager, and I  thought I   d be funny, which was a mistake. I said,    Do you think you  could get along without me for one night?    He said,    Winfrey, we got  along without you for thirty years.    He said,    We can do it again if we  need to.    (Laughter) I think it was after that that I decided,    I think I  want to be self-employed.    I want to have a little more to say about my  life. (Laughs)  Would you ever eat out at a restaurant?  You mean when I was living at home?  Yes.  It was very seldom. There was a place that Mother used to take me once  in a while on Sundays. And I   m trying to remember. It seems like it was  on Seventh Street, maybe across the street from my building. But it was  kind of an elegant place, and they had an orchestra that played at noon  on Sundays, for lunch on Sundays. I can   t remember the name of the  place but it was a pretty upscale restaurant.  We don   t have anything like that now. (Laughs)  Not now, not now, no. And also, back, this was after World War II,  where The Hideaway is, there used to be  a place  called Miles Student  23  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Store. There was Campus Theater on the corner, and it was about a fifty  foot frontage. And then the rest of it there was Miles Student Store. It  was a bookstore, and it had a soda fountain. And on Sunday afternoons,  about two o   clock, there were two dance bands on the campus. They  were like fifteen-piece orchestras. It wasn   t just a little combo, but they  were fifteen-piece orchestras. And you could hire them to play a three-hour  dance for fifty-five dollars. In high school, our high school clubs,  we used to get our money together and when we   d have a dance, we   d  have programs, and we   d have an orchestra, maybe a fifteen-piece  orchestra.  Fancy   Kids don   t know what they   re missing nowadays. It was pretty elegant.  Did your family grow a garden?  Well, my grandmother loved the country and she always wanted a  garden, yes. It started out to be a pretty big garden, and my mother  didn   t like to work in the garden, and I didn   t either, but my  grandmother would. (Laughs) We   d have to make a garden to please her.  Over the years, though, as my grandmother got older, the garden shrunk  in size. I ended up with a little one out here behind my carport that   s  about twice the size of this coffee table. What it last was was an  asparagus patch, which is pretty nice because you plant asparagus and  it   ll grow for a couple of years. Fresh asparagus is great.  Yes. Would your grandma do a lot of the cooking?  Yes, yes. She lived to be ninety-four, yes, she did until her eyesight got  bad. I know one time she was cooking, I guess, lunch for Mother, and  Mother got home. She said,    Lily, I cooked this cabbage and it just  doesn   t do right. I must   ve done something wrong. It just doesn   t look  like it ought to.    And Mother looked at it, and she   d cooked a head of  lettuce. It wasn   t cabbage  (Laughter) She had boiled a head of lettuce.  (Laughter)  That was a sign.  She was right, it didn   t work  But my grandmother was born in 1853.  She was born in North Carolina. My grandfather was born in 1830,  thirty years before the Civil War. And he was a doctor. His first wife  died, and when he married my grandmother, she was seventeen and he  was forty. And they had six children, my mother was the youngest. He  died before I was born.  24  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Did they meet before they came to Stillwater?  Oh, yes. They met in North Carolina. As a matter of fact, they were  cousins. Her maiden name was Holbrook, and her married name was  Holbrook. People used to ask her about that. They were distant cousins.  She said,    Well, he lived on the other side of the mountain.    (Laughter)  There   s a picture of her hanging on the wall back here, great, great, kind  lady.  Do you know if he was involved in the Civil War?  He was not, no. He was a doctor, and he was not in the military, no.  Do you know why they came to Stillwater?  Well, there   s two or three stories about that, and I   ve never quite known  which one to believe. They were from North Carolina, and this was a  part of the westward movement. North Carolina, I guess, was getting  kind of crowded, so people from North Carolina moved to Kentucky.  Then when Kentucky started getting crowded, they moved to Oklahoma  Territory. When they came to Oklahoma Territory, this was two years  after the Land Run. The Land Run was in 1889, and they came in 1891.  They had all their children, except my mother. My mother was born in  Oklahoma Territory. But the three older brothers and my grandfather  came from Kentucky out to Oklahoma Territory on the railroad, on the  train to   I guess probably to Perry. And then at Perry, they bought a  team of horses and a wagon, and they rode on to where they knew some  land was available. They went to this homestead on Wild Horse Creek.  Do you know how the homestead law worked? In 1889, this was the first  big land run in Oklahoma where they had the race. They started up here  north of Stillwater and ran south and staked claims for 160 acres. Well,  if you successfully staked a claim, got there first and were able to defend  it   it usually took two people, one with a gun on the claim and the other  one going to the courthouse to file the paperwork. But he staked a claim  on this homestead down south of Perkins. Grandfather and the three  sons, they rode the train and then horse and wagon down to where the  land was and, I think first of all, they built some kind of a dugout type of  a house. And they lived there for maybe a year or so. Then they built a  two-story frame house, a pretty nice house for that day and time. Then  in   I guess this would   ve been in about 1893   my grandmother always  called it a cyclone. We called it a tornado, but the tornado blew their  house away. They were in the cellar. I told you about taking the family  to the cellar.  Will you tell that again? It wasn   t on tape.  25  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Oh, yes. Okay, my grandfather and grandmother had moved to  Oklahoma Territory from Kentucky. And this would   ve been   the Land  Run was in 1889, and they came out here, I think, two years later, 1891.  They built a two-story frame house on their homestead. My grandmother  called it a cyclone. I guess today we   d call it a tornado, but my  grandmother, they had six children, they were all at home, and my  grandfather. My grandmother was a little lady. She was probably barely  five feet tall and hardly weighed a hundred pounds. My grandfather was  a tall fellow, and he had a broken leg, and his leg was in a splint. They  had   it was either five or six small children, and my grandmother was  pregnant with my mother. They saw this storm coming up, so they had  built this cellar, and they all went down to the cellar. After the storm  passed over, they opened the door and came out, and their house was  gone. It had just totally blown it away. They didn   t even find pieces of it.  And she, being this little woman who was pregnant, had to get everyone  in the cellar.  Yes, she got everybody in the cellar. (Laughs) When they came out and  the house was gone, my grandfather would not build another house on  that location. He thought that it was, I think, bad luck or something. So  they came to Stillwater, and he bought some land on the corner of Tenth  and Husband, on the west side of Husband and the north side of Tenth.  There was about a quarter of a block in there that he bought and built a  large Victorian house in there with a porch around two sides of it, and  that   s where they lived.  I was born in that house on June 1, 1926. They lived there until my  father was killed in a car accident in 1927. The city paved streets on both  sides of this property, on both sides of the corner, and the paving taxes  that were leveed, Mother couldn   t pay the paving taxes, so she had to  sell that nice big house. She bought a little small house on a dirt street in  the southeast part of town, 1414 South Fern, and that   s where I grew up.  The house on Husband Street was moved, and I don   t remember when  this was, maybe back in the    70s, but it   s currently   I think I know  where it is. It   s on the south side of Ninth Street, west Ninth Street, out  somewhere around McFarland or McDonald, out in there somewhere.  Well, how lucky for them to build a cellar.  Yes.  I wonder if most people that homesteaded did that, if that was common?  Yes, because   well, cellars were valuable. That was their refrigerator.  26  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  True.  They did a lot of canned goods, and they dried a lot of fruits and  vegetables, and the cellar was a place where they stored their food  goods. And it also was a place to get out of the storm. I guess they all  had seen storms before. I know when I was growing up down on Fern  Street, we didn   t have a cellar or a basement. Every time a black cloud  would come up, my mother and my grandmother would drag me across  the street into a neighbor   s cellar that had a dirt floor and spider webs  and stuff. I was scared to go down there. (Laughter)  But after living through that, especially, they probably didn   t want to  take any chances.  Any time the clouds got dark, they were getting underground.  And I guess people probably didn   t have insurance back then, so they  just     Oh, no. If it was gone, it was just too bad.  And your grandfather was a doctor at that time?  Yes.  Did he have his own practice in Stillwater when they moved here?  Yes, yes. It was mainly in Perkins. Well, see, he was in his sixties when  my mother was born. I said my grandmother was born in 1853. My  grandfather was born in 1830, Dr. C. R. (Campbell Rice) Holbrook, born  in 1830. He used to tell people if they   d shake hands with him, he   d say,     That hand shook the hand of Abraham Lincoln.    He   d met Lincoln   (Laughs)  Really? Wow  Where did he meet Lincoln?  I don   t know. I don   t know.  Wow. And you didn   t get to meet your grandfather?  No, he died before I was born.  So you didn   t get to shake that hand.  No, I didn   t. He died in about 1922, and he was up in his nineties. But  27  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  I   ve got a picture of him back here on the wall. He was a very  distinguished-looking fellow with a beard, had on a beaver hat. (Laughs)  He looks like a distinguished citizen.  Do you want to take a break? (Laughter)  You want to go look at some pictures?  Yes, let   s do that.  ------- End of December 5, 2011 interview -------  Today is December 6, 2011, and this is part two with Winfrey Houston.  So today we   ll start out talking about the 1930s and the Dust Bowl days  and what it was like in Stillwater.  I   m trying to think about my earliest recollection. The house I was born  in was on Husband Street, at Tenth and Husband. The house has been  moved. It   s out on Ninth Street now. But during the Depression, they  paved the streets on both sides. I told you that, didn   t I? She wasn   t able  to pay the paving taxes, so she had to sell the big house and bought a  little house on a dirt street, down at 1414 South Fern. That   s my first  recollection. I don   t remember ever living in the house on Husband  Street. I was three years old when we moved from there. But on Fern  Street, I remember that because that   s where I grew up. We sold that  house while I was in the army in 1945, I believe it was, and bought a  house up on Elm Street.  I remember the summer of 1936 was so hot, had several days of 100-  degree weather. She bought kind of a little window evaporative cooler.  They just started making those here, and it was a wooden box that fit on  the outside of a window. On the outside, it had chicken wire, two layers  of chicken wire about three inches apart. And in between that chicken  wire was excelsior. Do you know what excelsior is?  No.  It   s kind of wood shavings, little curly-q, long curly-q wood shavings  that they used to pack stuff in. So it was readily available. You   d fill that  space in there with these wood shavings. And then across the top, there  was a pipe, a three-quarter inch pipe with holes drilled in it. You   d put a  garden hose up to that and turn it on real slow and let the water trickle  down through that excelsior. And then on the inside of it, you   d set an  electric fan that would suck air from the outside through that excelsior  and then into the house. As the hot air when it was a hundred degrees  and it was very dry that it would cause evaporation when it passed  28  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  through that wire. You know, when water evaporates, it takes away heat,  and it would lower the temperature and blow a little cool air into the  house. If you sat right in front of it, it would cool you off a little bit.  Then we moved our beds outside. We slept outside at night. It was too  hot to sleep in the house.  Were there mosquitoes?  I don   t remember. I think it was too hot for mosquitoes, too. (Laughter) I  don   t remember mosquitoes.  So was that in the front yard, where your beds were?  No, we slept in the backyard.  Okay. (Laughs)  In the backyard, yes. My grandmother had a big garden in the backyard.  There used to be a man that would come around in the spring time with a  horse and a plow, and she always wanted to make a big garden and have  him plow the backyard. We would make a big garden back there.  Do you remember some meals she would prepare, some particular  dishes?  I   m trying to think. I can remember a lot of stuff I didn   t like. On  Sunday nights, it seemed like she   d make mush and milk. Mush is, you  make it out of cornmeal and water, and you   d cook it. It would be kind  of like a breakfast cereal. You put milk over it.  And you had that on Sunday evenings?  Yes, yes. And then if there was anything left over, the next day they   d  make little patty cakes out of it and fry them. If you put syrup on them,  they were pretty good. (Laughter)  Would you have a special Sunday dinner for lunch?  Yes, it seemed like we would, and I can   t remember. Later on, I  remember, this is maybe when I was in high school, we used to have a  ham or something like that on Sunday.  Did you grow up going to church on Sundays?  Yes. Yes, I went to the First Baptist Church. Yes, we   d always go to  church.  29  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Where was that located?  Well, it   s across the street, south from the courthouse.  Okay, so it   s still there.  It   s still there, isn   t it? Yes. The church that was there when I was was a  two-story church. It wasn   t the tall one.  Did you experience any dust?  Yes, we did have dust, but not like they had out west. There wasn   t  much you could do about it. Barbara said that they used to hang wet  sheets. Her mother would take a bed sheet, soak it in water, and then  hang it in front of the doorway so it would sort of filter the dust out  when they   d open the doors.  But you didn   t have to do that in Stillwater.  No, no. (Laughs) I   m trying to think what else.  Did she remember Black Sunday?  Black Sunday?  April 14th.  What year was that?  1935.  Well, yes, I would   ve been eight years old. I   d have probably  remembered that, yes. I do kind of have a recollection of a day. I don   t  remember whether it was Sunday or not where it was dark during the  day time, dark around noon. It was the dust storm, when the dust was so  heavy. There   s a book called The Worst Hard Time. Have you seen that?  Yes, Timothy Egan is the author.  Yes. I think that   s pretty authentic.  Yes. And Barbara lived out in Woodward?  Yes.  30  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  So it was really blowing out there.  Oh, it was really bad out there, yes.  Well, tell me about the grasshoppers.  Oh, that summer, the hot summer, I guess dust didn   t bother them. But  there was a plague of grasshoppers. I mean, they got to be like that.  (Gestures) Big, big, grasshoppers.  Like two inches long?  Yes, it seemed like it. My mother had a big ole    yellow tomcat, and that  hot, hot summer my buddy and I would catch these grasshoppers, and  we built a little campfire in the backyard and had a big coffee can. And  we   d put those grasshoppers in that coffee can and roast them. And the  cat loved them. The cat ate those grasshoppers. And I guess there  must   ve been a lot of protein in it because Mother couldn   t understand  why our cat was getting so fat that hot summer. (Laughs)  Would they make a noise as they were roasting?  I don   t remember. (Laughter)  So they were just everywhere?  Oh, yes. They would just come into a yard or someplace and just strip it  of everything that was green. They   d eat everything, just down to the  earth.  A gardener   s worst nightmare.  Yes. They   d eat everything that was green, strip the leaves off the trees.  Wow. You said your mother   s parents lived in Stillwater. Where did your  father   s parents live?  In Texas, North Texas, I think around Denton. His parents lived around  Denton, but I think they moved to the Oklahoma panhandle before my  parents were married. And I think my mother only met his parents  maybe a time or two. They were gone before I was born, but he had a  couple of sisters that lived down around Denton. One time when I was  about five years old, my mother took us on a trip, and we went down to  visit his sisters. And I told you, he was killed in a car accident when I  was about eighteen months old. He had been a combat veteran in World  War I.  31  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  So did you hear any stories passed down the grapevine from his time in  World War I?  I don   t know that he talked a whole lot to Mother about that, but I   ve got  the book back here, the Third Division book. Did I show you that?  I don   t think I saw the Third Division book.  It   s a history of the Third Infantry Division. He was cited for gallantry in  action, and his citation is in that book. Based on that, he was awarded a  silver star, back posthumously.  And you have that?  Yes, I have that. There was a letter in his trunk from the War  Department. It wasn   t called the Defense Department back in those days.  It was called the War Department. It was written to him and said that for  his action at Ch  teau-Thierry or Meuse-Argonne or wherever it was, that  he had been cited for gallantry and was entitled to a medal. And that  letter, Mother had more pressing business than to worry about a medal.  She was trying to survive the Depression with us. But I saw that letter. It  was in his trunk, and Mother didn   t open his trunk. All of his clothes and  his army uniform was in that trunk, and the clothes he had on when he  was in the fatal car accident, stuff she didn   t want to look at. After she   d  been gone about ten years, the trunk was at my aunt   s house in her  garage. And after she   d been gone about ten years, I thought,    Well, it   s  time I look in that trunk.    So I brought the trunk up here, and I   ve got it  back here in this room. His World War I uniform is in there and his  baseball uniform. He was a charter member of the American Legion  Post here in Stillwater in about 1920. They had a baseball team, and they  played. It wasn   t their kids that played baseball, they played baseball.  The uniform looks like the New York Yankees. It   s sort of light gray,  wool, pin-striped.  And so is that related to the American Legion Baseball League that   s     Yes. Well, later, I guess it was after World War II that they started  American Legion Baseball for boys. I think the Legionnaires got too old  to play, so they paid for the leagues for the boys. There used to be an  organization that I belonged to when I was a boy called Sons of the  American Legion. This was for sons of World War I veterans, and I  belonged to that when I was a boy. Then World War II came along. We  had our own war.  Well, in high school, I know you were busy working, but did you ever  32  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  attend any sporting events?  Not very much. I was too busy to go out for sports, but I was into  politics. (Laughs) I was class president.  Really?  Two years, my junior year and then also my senior year.  What all did that involve?  Well, nothing like today. There were functions. We used to have an  assembly on Friday mornings during junior and senior years of high  school. We would have a program Friday mornings, self-entertainment-type  programs, and I was involved in those. Then at the prom, we   d have  a dinner before the prom, and I presided at that.  Where would the dinner be held?  There weren   t many places back in those days. It was before the Student  Union was built, and there wasn   t any    The American Legion Hall  downtown, it   s still there. There was a place there for dinners. When I  was in high school, they had a bowling alley, the American Legion, and  it was open to the public, on the ground floor, and they had a pool hall  on the second floor. The American Legion owned the building. I think  they may still own the building, and those were revenue activities. Then  they   d have dinners, and I think they still do. It   s been a few years since  I   ve been to a dinner, but it seems like on Thursday night, maybe the  first Thursday of the month or the last Thursday of the month, they have  a dinner at the American Legion Hall. Of course, now they   ve got very  few   well, there aren   t any World War I veterans anymore, and there   s  still a few World War II. Then there   s Korea and Vietnam.  So sometimes your prom dinner might be held in the American Legion  Hall?  Yes.  And then would the dance be in one of the dance halls, like Katz Hall or  something?  There was a dance hall   there were two dance halls I can remember.  One was on the second floor of Katz, what   s now Brooklyn   s. There was  a dance hall up in Katz Hall. Well, there was also a dance hall in the  building I own, the third floor there was a dance hall.  33  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  And that   s on Seventh Street?  Seventh and Husband, yes. Then there was also one up on Campus  Corner. They called it Fiscus, F-I-S-C-U-S, Fiscus Hall. They call it  Peck   s Lodge. Pat Dorr, you know Pat Dorr? Pat Dorr has kind of a  museum up there. (Laughs) Have you ever been up there to see it?  I haven   t been through that part.  You ought to do that. That   s interesting. He   s got a lot of stuff. I guess  Pat   s still around. I haven   t seen him for a while.  I think so. So as class president, did you give a speech at graduation?  Let   s see. There was two phases to graduation. There was a  commencement, and then there was a baccalaureate. The  commencement was, I think, when you actually graduated, walked  across the stage and got your diploma. I may have made some kind of  response or something. I don   t really remember. And then the  baccalaureate was kind of a religious kind of a church service that was  held, it seemed like on Sunday night. But the commencement was held  at the   we called it the College Auditorium. It   s where the Seretean  Center is. They enlarged the building and made it into the Seretean  Center, but it was called the College Auditorium. And it was built World  War I or thereabouts, back kind of behind the fire station.  Well, did you always know that you wanted to attend Oklahoma A M?  Well, it was doable. It may not have been my first choice, had I had one.  I really didn   t have a choice. I mean, my mother couldn   t afford to send  me away to college, but it was really easy to go to college here.  Anybody that lives in Stillwater that wants to go to college, it   s pretty  easy to do it. The tuition was very low back in those days. The first  summer, between high school and the army, I went to summer school. I  took nine hours in summer school, and it seems like that tuition was  something like three dollars an hour. I took college algebra,  trigonometry, and physics. (Laughs)  Goodness. (Laughs)  That was heavy duty stuff. (Laughs)  I bet. Were you working also?  Yes, I was trying to think what job I had that summer. I had been  working at the movie theater, but I quit the movie theater. My mother  34  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  wanted me to have a little free time before I went to the army, so I went  to work at the lumberyard driving a lumber truck during the day.  Is that Hoke Lumber?  Yes.  So you   d just deliver lumber to people   s homes or wherever they needed  it?  Well, to construction jobs. And back in the 1940s, there wasn   t a whole  lot of lumber to deliver because most building materials were going to  the military, to military projects, and there wasn   t a lot of stuff available  for civilians to use.  What year did you graduate high school?  1944. I graduated in May, and D-Day was June 6, 1944. That   s the day  the Allied forces invaded Europe.  So at what point did you join the army?  I joined in December of 1943. Of course, the draft was on then for  eighteen   I guess from eighteen to thirty, it seemed like. They   d draft  anybody eighteen to thirty that wasn   t married or at least didn   t have  children. But when you   re seventeen and a half, between seventeen and  a half and eighteen, there was a window of opportunity that if you  volunteered, you could choose your branch of service, and that   s what I  did. But you had to have parental consent, written consent, and that was  a hard sell with my mother. But she did. I think she realized that would  be in my best interest, so she did sign it. That was in December of 1943.  Three of us, Gerald Bradshaw, who   s still my friend, lives here, and a  third friend of ours, Charles Bartholomew. The three of us, Gerald   s  father took us to Oklahoma City to enlist. It seems like it was in  December of    43, and we spent two days down there doing the  paperwork and taking the physical exams, with the understanding that  you wouldn   t be called to service until after graduation from high  school. So I volunteered in December of    43 and got out of high school  in May of    44 and got my call for duty for November of    44. I went to  Fort Chaffee for induction into the army in 1944. That was a process that  took about a week. You get all your shots, get your hair cut, get your  uniforms.  From there, I went to Biloxi, Mississippi, to Keesler Field, Biloxi,  Mississippi, for basic training. You learned how to march and military  35  discipline. It lasted, it seemed like, about three months. During that basic  training, they gave you all these kind of various aptitude tests about what  your job might be in the army. I wanted to be on an air crew, and I  qualified as a flight engineer. So after basic training I went to  engineering school on B-24 Bombers, which was kind of the second  generation of World War II bombers. The B-17 was called the Flying  Fortress, and it was the first bomber that was used in World War II. And  then the second generation was the B-24, and that was called the  Liberator. They were faster and could fly higher altitudes. Then I just  finished my training with that.  The normal, of course, would have been then to have been assigned to a  crew and gone to gunnery school, final training and then go overseas.  But about the time I had finished my engineering school with B-24   s, the  war in Europe was over, in May of 1945. I learned that after the invasion  on June the sixth of    44, it took less than a year for the Allied forces to  go across France and Germany, and Hitler surrendered. Well, he didn   t  surrender. He committed suicide.  Then, I went to Seattle to train for the invasion of Japan. The thought  was that we   d have to invade Japan, and they expected a million  casualties if we invaded Japan. The B-24s and the B-17s were not   they  didn   t have the range to fly the distances in the Pacific, so the B-29 was  under development. They built B-29s at Wichita and at Seattle. I went to  factory school on B-29s at Seattle, which I think lasted about six weeks.  Then I thought we   d probably get assigned to an air crew and go invade  Japan, but then that bright sunny day in August, I think it was August  the sixth, we dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The Japanese,  they didn   t believe it, so the next day we dropped one on Nagasaki, and  they believed that one and surrendered. So all of a sudden the war was  over. Just like that. We thought it was going to go on forever, but it  stopped about as quickly as it started when they bombed Pearl Harbor.  So then, I don   t know how many military forces there were on active  duty at that time, but I expect there was probably a couple million  scattered all over the world. That was really before computers were  available, and it always amazed me how they were able to shuffle all  these people around and get them to the places they wanted them to be,  and did a pretty good job of it. So I spent extra time in Seattle while, I  think, the government was trying to figure out what to do with us all. I  had interesting times up there. The training was over. There really  wasn   t much for us to do, so we   d do KP one day. In a day, you   d get up  about three-thirty in the morning and go to work, and you   d get off  about nine o   clock at night. That was a day. But then the next day you   d  have off to recuperate from that. Then on our days off, we could go  work. We could go do civilian work and get paid for it. There was such a  36  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  labor shortage, you could go down to the waterfront and just about any  factory down there you could walk in and they   d put you to work and  pay you a   I   m trying to think what it was. It looked like a lot of money.  I don   t think it was a dollar an hour. It must   ve been less than that, but I  had some interesting jobs.  One job, I worked in a factory where they reconditioned oil barrels, big  fifty-five-gallon oil drums. They   d have you wheel those around. They   d  go into the factory where they   d sandblast them and then paint them,  then wheel them back out and load them onto boxcars. Then the best job  I had, I worked at a saw mill on the river where the loggers would float  these logs down the river, and then they   d hook a cable onto them. I ran  a wench pulling a lever to pull these logs up out of the river into the saw  mill where they sawed them into boards and made crates and things out  of it. Let   s see, I did the barrel factory and the saw mill. It seemed like  there was another job that wasn   t very good   oh, yes. It was a cable  factory where they made steel cables. That was the worst one. They took  steel wire, and they were rolled up into coils about like this. (Gestures)  And they weighed seventy pounds, I think. They were really hard to get  a hold of and lift them and carry them around. Then they   d put them on  these machines and braid them into steel cable. Interesting to see. I   d  never been around a factory before. It was kind of interesting to see how  they made stuff like that.  So you   d just show up one day, on your day off, at one of these  factories?  Yes, yes.  And would you keep going back to that same factory for a while?  Yes, yes, unless you found a better deal someplace else. (Laughs) They  didn   t have to hire you, and you didn   t have to report to work if you  didn   t want to.  And where were you sleeping at that time?  Well, in the barracks. There were barracks there. In Seattle, there was an  air field. It seemed like it was right in the middle of town. I mean, those  airplanes, when they   d come in and land, those big bombers, they   d kind  of go down an aisle. There   d be big buildings on both sides, and they   d  land there. But it was right sort of at the edge of the downtown area.  Well, that   s where the Boeing factory was. I went back to Seattle in  1976, on a trip, went out there and it looked the same way it had twenty-five  years earlier.  37  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  How many people do you think were in your situation in Seattle?  The same military situation? We lived in kind of tarpaper huts along the  runway at that air base. I don   t know, maybe a couple hundred. Not just  a huge number. That was good duty. That was great duty. There were  lots of social activities. (Laughter) A lot of girls moved to Seattle to do  defense work, and there was lots of girls around. (Laughs) And people  were really nice to you if you were in uniform. It was a good time.  Did you stay in touch with any other guys that you met there?  Well, there was a couple of guys, and I have since lost touch with them.  But one of them moved to California, and he came back. He was from  Oklahoma City, originally, and we were in basic training together, and  then we were also overseas together. After the war was over, he came to  Stillwater and he lived at our house with me for one semester or two  while going to college. Then he moved to California. I had a friend from  New Orleans, his name was Steve Enright. We were together in basic  training and also in that engineering training, and we were together in  Seattle. Then after Seattle I went to Tampa, Florida. I was stationed in  Tampa, Florida for two or three months. That was just when the war was  winding down. My buddy, Steve Enright, after Seattle, he went to  Arizona. And I think my buddy, Gerald Bradshaw, went to Arizona.  Then Steve went to Italy, and I went to Germany and Bradshaw went to  Germany. So different parts. I think he was in Frankfurt and I was down  in a smaller town, G  ppingen, Germany. You   ve spent time in Germany,  didn   t you?  I did.  Did you ever hear G  ppingen?  I don   t remember that. But it   s in Bavaria?   No, it   s in Baden-W  rttemberg, right next to Stuttgart, between  Stuttgart and Munich.   So what did you do in Germany?  Tried to stay warm. (Laughter)  What time of year was it when you went over?  Winter  (Laughs)  Oh, goodness.  38  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  I was trying to think. I came from Florida. I went to Virginia, Newport  News, which is the shipping out place by Norfolk. I went and it was  wintertime. The Atlantic in the winter is cold.  I bet. How long were you on a ship?  I think about a week. I told you about that ship, going over. I was on a  ship called   I think it was the SS America. It was the last luxury liner  that we built. There were two ships. One was the SS United States, and  the other was the SS America. They used to build, it seemed like, sister  ships. They   d build two ships kind of alike so that they could use them  sort of interchangeably. But I don   t know how many passengers it was  built to hold. I think several hundred. Going overseas, there was over  6,000 of us on that ship.  Wow   They did everything in shifts. I think I told you, I was in this state room  that was built for two people, and I think there were seventeen of us in  that state room. (Laughter) Bunks were five-high.  So where did you land, or where did it dock?  Le Havre, France. It was all bombed out. You know, the war had been  over about six months, I guess, when I got there, and it was all bombed  out. I remember getting off the ship and getting into trucks and riding in  the back of trucks to the railroad station. Got off the trucks and headed  for this train, a passenger train, and we started to get on it. The sergeant  over there said,    No, no. Come over here.    (Laughter) We weren   t going  to ride in the passenger train, we were going to ride in the boxcars. They  were called forty and eights. Forty, et, eight. Et is French for and. But  the boxcars were built to haul either forty men or eight horses. It was a  boxcar and the floorboard had big cracks in the floor. (Laughs) It was  cold.  We had the clothes we had on, and then we did have sleeping bags that  were combat-style sleeping bags where you get in them, and it had a  zipper on the inside. What you   d do, you   d take your boots off, but  you   d put them in the bottom of your sleeping bag, so they didn   t freeze.  And then there was a zipper on the inside and you   d take the zipper and  pull the zipper up right here. (Gestures) And the only thing that would  be out would be your face. Your hands and arms and feet and everything  would be inside that sleeping bag. It had kind of like an army wool  blanket-type lining and then a heavy water-proof duck material on the  outside. I wouldn   t say you were warm, but you didn   t freeze.  39  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Along the way it took us, we were on a ship about a week and then we  were on the train about a week also. In one place where we stopped they  had what they called transit mess halls every so often along the railroad.  There   d be a mess hall, tents, and they   d have a hot meal. And you   d  stop and had your own mess gear, canteens, fold out plate deals, and get  one hot meal a day. Then you   d get back on the train and go some more.  At one railroad station there were some big bales, stacks of straw lying  around, so we threw a bunch of those on our boxcar and opened them up  and made kind of little straw nests where you could kind of nestle down  in the straw and it would kind of keep you warm. But it was cold. I  didn   t even have a head cold. I came through that, a week on an open  train like that, I didn   t even have a head cold. (Laughs) I was nineteen  years old and in pretty good health.  So then you arrived in G  ppingen     Well, let   s see. You never go anyplace directly in the army. No one ever  knows why you get routed that way. But from Le Havre, we rode that  train for a week, and we ended up, it was a former German Luftwaffe  (that   s their air force, Luftwaffe, air force base) in a little town down in  Bavaria called F  rstenfeldbruck, F-U-R-S-T-E-N-F-E-L-D-B-R-U-C-K,  F  rstenfeldbruck. You know how Germans do their words, they just  keep adding syllables.  They just stick it all together.  You   ll have a whole, like a paragraph, and it   ll be one word. (Laughter)  Yes. Well, you were at F  rstenfeldbruck.  Yes, F  rstenfeldbruck. It had been a German air force base. Hitler, when  he built facilities for the military, he built them to last 1,000 years. These  were brick barracks, two-story, brick barracks, and had ceramic tile  showers. We were looking forward to some hot water to take a nice  warm shower when we got there. That first winter, there was a very  extreme shortage of coal. So the guys that were stationed at this base,  American soldiers that were stationed there, they took the faucets off the  shower, off the hot water shower. They saved the hot water for  themselves.  Wow. So were showers miserable then?  Well, you didn   t want to take a cold shower in a cold building. (Laughs)  I don   t remember. I may not have had a shower that whole winter. I  don   t remember. But I don   t remember ever being warm enough to take  40  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  off my clothes. (Laughs) But I think, finally, when we got to this little  air base, then they did get some coal. That was one of the first things  they did, was to bring in coal and sugar   coal to stay warm and sugar to  make beer. (Laughter) The breweries in Germany were the first things  that were put back into operation. (Laughter)  So what was your task?  Oh, our jobs? Well, I   d been trained to be a flight engineer on a four-engine  bomber, a big bomber. When we got to this little air field, it had a  grass runway. Do you know what a Piper Cub is?  Is it a little airplane?  Yes. It   s a little single-engine, fabric-covered airplane, and it would haul  two people, do about, maybe, ninety miles an hour. I   ve got it in my  scrapbook here, if I could lay my hands on it, to show you some pictures  of it. But they were used as spotter planes for the field artillery, and they  were flying all of them into this little air base. I think we ended up with  nine hundred of them in this little air base that first winter. They were  staked down outside, and we winterized them, drained the gasoline out,  drained the oil out and put in some preservative materials. Then in the  spring, we got them back into running condition, and we sold them to  some of the Allied powers. You could buy one for three hundred dollars.  They   d bring pilots in to fly them out. Someone on each crew had to go  up with the pilot the first time they were flown, to kind of keep you  interested in your work.  Yes  (Laughter)  But these pilots they flew in, I think they were fighter pilots. And these  little Piper Cubs, they   d take off and land at sixty, eighty, ninety miles  an hour. They were used to these P-51s, P-47s that landed at like 150  miles an hour. They were really hot airplanes. They   d fly like three  hundred miles an hour, and these things would fly like at sixty or eighty.  They had a hard time remembering that they didn   t need to have 150  miles an hour air speed to land these planes. They   d try to land them too  fast. (Laughs) That was exciting when you went up with them.  So where were they from? What countries?  Well, they were American pilots. They were American pilots, yes.  If they bought them, where would they take the planes?  Oh, other countries, France or    I   m trying to think. France bought  41  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  some of them, and I don   t know whether the Brits bought any or not. Of  course, Italy was a part of the Axis Powers. Italy was in the war on the  side of the Germans, so it wasn   t Italy. Let   s see. I don   t know who else  besides France was buying them.  So how was life in Germany? Did you interact with Germans in the  community where you were?  Well, initially, they had a non-fraternization rule that the Germans were  the enemy and we weren   t supposed to fraternize with them.  Particularly, German girls. But this little air base was next to what was  called a displaced persons Lager, a displaced persons camp. I think there  may have been maybe like 1500 or so families   women, girls,  children   that lived there. During the war, Hitler had taken people from  everywhere and put them to work in factories and places. They were  working building roads, slave labor. And then all of a sudden, when the  war was over, there are all these people that were scattered over Europe.  And some of the younger ones didn   t even know where they came from.  They didn   t even know what their country was. It took about five years  to sort these people out. They were called displaced persons. And there  was a displaced persons camp there, next to the air field where I was.  The American government took care of them, gave them blankets and  places to live and food, tried to get them through the winters until they  could start sorting them out and getting them back to their home  countries.  I remember one situation where there were some people that were from  Eastern Europe that during the time that these people had been prisoners  of war, the Russians had taken over their countries. And they didn   t  want to go back. They did not want to go back to their countries because  they would be under the Russians. The Russians were scary people back  in those days, and everyone thought for several years that we were going  to have World War III with the Russians. I never did really believe that  myself, but a lot of people did. But getting those people back home was  a big chore. I mentioned this photograph album. I can either go right to it  or I can   t find it at all.  Might as well try.  Pause  Where we left off, we were talking about your  time in Germany, in G  ppingen. How long were you in Germany?  Ten months. I got there in November of    45 and left in July of    46.  And earlier, we looked at some photos and you got to take a trip around  Switzerland?  Yes, yes.  42  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Was that the main pleasure trip that you had?  Well, that was the biggest one. That was a week. That was a week   s  furlough to Switzerland. I was there Easter Sunday, 1946, which  would   ve been April.  In Switzerland.  I remember I thought,    Well, I   d like to go to church on Easter Sunday,  so I wonder where they   ll speak English.    So I found the Church of  England, and they spoke a form of English. (Laughter)  Was it a lot different church service than you were used to?  Oh, sure. Yes. Of course, I always grew up in the Baptist church, and the  Church of England is more like the Episcopalian Church.  Well, when did you find out that you were going back to the United  States?  Started out, at the end of the war, they had a point system. Eighty-five  points and you got to come home. But I was too young to come under  that. The point system, it was pretty well discontinued. You know, the  guys that had been there, I think you got a point for each month that you  were there, and five points for each battle, and ever so many missions  flown, you   d get so many points. It seems like if you got eighty-five  points you got to come home. During the war, on bomber crews, if you  survived thirty-five missions, you got to come home. About one-third of  the crews didn   t make it though. About a third of them got shot down.  About every time a hundred planes went up there   d be 350 guys go  down. There was extra hazardous pay to people that were in   air crews  got extra hazardous duty, and submarine crews. They got extra pay for  some of those jobs.  So you didn   t get eighty-five points, though? Were you just there for a     Oh, no. I wasn   t under the point system because by the time I got  overseas the war was over. So I don   t remember. I think at the end of the  war, there were so many people everywhere, military people, that it took  quite a while just to get them all sorted out. Find out where they were,  and get them catalogued, and see who   d been over there the longest, and  start rotating them back. So by the time I came home, I was in, I guess,  about the first group of occupation troops. I think usually, you   d spend  about a year   s time in occupation. But I came back after about ten  months.  43  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  So to come back home, did you go to Le Havre and get on a boat again,  or a ship?  Let   s see. Le Havre to Germany    I was down in Bavaria, and I rode a  train up to the North Sea. There   s a big German     Bremen?  Bremen, yes, Bremen. I think I shipped out of Bremen.  Okay. And where did you land in the United States?  Well, I sailed past the Statue of Liberty. I remember that.  What was it like seeing that Statue of Liberty?  Oh, it was wonderful. I mean, once we got into the harbor it was in the  morning, and it was real foggy. And about the time we got into the  harbor, the fog lifted and the sun shined and there was the Statue of  Liberty, just waiting for us. (Laughs)  Were you on a big ship? Or a ship as big as the one you went over on?  No. It wasn   t as big, and it was an old, old ship. It was a ship that we  captured from the Germans after World War I. So it was fifty years old  or more. It was an old, old ship. The bunks were down below deck. You  go down there and the only air that got in was through the port holes. I  went down there one afternoon to take a nap, and I woke up about four  hours later. I mean, the oxygen was just   got all breathed up. (Laughter)  So seeing that Statue of Liberty meant, for one, that you could get off the  ship before too long     Yes, right. That was a very warm feeling.  And just being back on U.S. soil     Yes. And from Camp Kilmer   spent a few days at Camp Kilmer,  New  Jersey . I remember they gave us a steak dinner. We were there a few  days, and then I went from there to San Antonio to     How did you get to San Antonio? Some people went by train     Let   s see. Well, I was traveling by myself    I have a recollection of  being on the train and maybe going through Pittsburg at night, I think,  44  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  on a train. I think I went on a train from New Jersey to San Antonio.  Then at San Antonio, I think they gave us some money and said,     You   re on your own,    to get back to Stillwater. (Laughter)  Do you know how much money they gave you?  No, no. But I think there were people that had private cars. They   d load  up a group of soldiers and take them. I think there was about three or  four of us that rode in a car back to Oklahoma from San Antonio.  And your mom was still in Stillwater?  Yes, yes.  Had you been corresponding with her?  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. And she kept every letter that I ever wrote her. And  somewhere there   s a box that   s got all those letters in it.  Wow.  Yes, yes. I can   t remember where that box of letters is.  Do you remember arriving home in Stillwater?  Well, I got back, it was in July, and I wanted to start college in  September. So I had made arrangements to get pre-enrolled. My mother,  during the time I was in the army, had sold the house she owned down in  the southeast part of town and bought one up on Elm Street, about three  blocks east of Eskimo Joes. I had been home on furlough, and I guess it  was 1945, and helped her move. So I moved in, I moved back home, and  it was very convenient. It was only about three blocks to the campus.  And my mother and my grandmother were still alive then. My  grandmother died when I was twenty-two. So she died a couple of years  after I got back from the army. I enrolled in college, and I think I took  like twelve hours the first semester. A man, his name was R.O. Fox, who  had been the manager of Hoke Lumber Company when I was between  high school and the army and I drove a truck for them. When I got back  from the army, R.O. had opened his own lumber yard, down on Sixth  and Lowry Street. And he wanted me to come back to work for him,  driving a lumber truck. So I arranged my classes, so I had classes, I  think, two days a week or three days a week. Anyway, I was able to  work two or three days a week for him, driving a lumber truck. I did that  my first year, and then I think I went to summer school.  Then the second year, I was on a combined degree program. If you took  45  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  ninety hours in college and followed a prescribed curriculum, when you  finished your first year in law school, they would send back your grades  for your first two semesters. They would count those as electives on  your undergraduate degree, so I did that. And I also got credit for some  of the tech schools I went to in the army. I got college credit for some of  the tech schools I went to. I came back and I joined a fraternity. I didn   t  live in the fraternity house, but I participated in some of the social  activities.  What fraternity was that?  Kappa Sigma. I had a lot of my buddies and friends who were in that  fraternity. I started law school in the fall of 1948. I think in the summer  of 1948, my cousin, Bill Church, was organizing a party down in a local  honky-tonk called the Rock Castle Inn. (Laughs) It was down on the  corner of Perkins Road and about Third Street, and it was a honky-tonk.  I had a blind date, and my cousin arranged a party down there, and it  was with Barbara. She was here in summer school, so I got acquainted  with her and spent quite a bit of time with her until summer school was  over. And then when summer school was over, I visited her out at  Woodward where she lived, visited and stayed at her parents    home.  Then in that fall, she went back to Stevens College for girls, in  Columbia, Missouri. So I went to law school at Norman in 1948.  Who set up that blind date?  My cousin, Bill Church. He was best man, then, in our wedding. Yes,  he   s in the picture. We saw some pictures of him that we were looking at  this morning. Bill was about a year older than I. He was a year ahead of  me in high school. He died six or seven years ago. After the war, he  went to work for a clothing store in Shreveport, Louisiana. He worked  there a couple of years and then he moved to New Orleans. He was a  manager of a clothing store down there in New Orleans and loved New  Orleans. Barbara and I went to visit him two or three times.  Well, when you came back to Oklahoma A M, was the atmosphere  different? I know you just attended summer school before, but were  there a lot more vets on campus?  Well, yes, there was a lot more of everything. Right after the war,  college was just packed with people, just packed. People were lined up  for everything. It was hard to get in classes, and you got classes  scheduled six days a week and they held them at night. Things were  very, very busy. Most of the classes were large. Some of the courses I  took, though, were pretty small. I needed two years of foreign language,  and I hadn   t taken any foreign language in high school, so I took Latin in  46  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  college, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I had the best  teacher I ever had, my Latin teacher. I think there was only twelve of us  in class, and he made it real interesting.  Do you remember his name?  Yes, M. A. Griffin, G-R-I-F-F-I-N. He was a classic language professor.  He taught Latin and Greek and German.  Do you remember some of the buildings your classes were in?  Well, I had two or three classes in Old Central. Let   s see, the Arts and  Sciences Building, I guess they called it Arts and Science back then, I  had classes there. And I had a class or two in the Business Building. I  wanted to take some business classes there. It seems like I had a class at  Gardiner Hall.  Did you know that you wanted to go to law school?  I had thought about it. My mother worked at the courthouse, and I   d  spent a lot of time at the courthouse when I was a little boy. And I guess  while I was in the army I decided that   s what I wanted to do. So when I  came back, I had already decided that. So I didn   t have to worry about  that decision, I   d already made it.  What did you end up majoring in, in your bachelor   s degree?  History and political science.  Did you have any influential professors besides your Latin professor?  I had a teacher in political science that had his doctorate from Johns  Hopkins, and he was sharp. He used to stroll through the class with his  key chain, twirling his Phi Beta Kappa key, proudly. (Laughter) His first  name was Foster, which is a strange first name. Foster  Dowell, I think .  But he was good. Then I had an economics professor that was really  good. I   m having a hard time remembering his name, too. But I enjoyed  economics. I had never taken any course like that before, and I really  took to it. I took some extra economics courses as electives just because  I was interested in it. History and political science and economics were,  I guess, probably my favorite courses in college.  And did you live at home the whole time you were at Oklahoma A M?  Yes, I did. Yes, yes.  47  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Were you involved in any social organizations or academic  organizations on campus?  I was, of course, in Kappa Sigma fraternity. And then there was a pre-law  fraternity, and I can   t remember the name of it, but I belonged to  that. That was about it because I was only two years into this, see. I did  three years in two. So I was pretty busy, and then I worked, too. I was  pretty busy.  Did you make it to any sporting events while you were going to college?  Oh, a few. I think I went to maybe a few football games, but I don   t  remember having tickets to everything like they do nowadays. I may  have gone to some wrestling matches. I always enjoyed wrestling  matches. Stillwater has been a big wrestling school. OSU has had great  wrestling teams back in the days of Ed Gallagher and John Smith. The  wrestling coach in high school, when I was in high school, his name was  Ross Flood. He was in the 1936 Olympics in Munich as a wrestler, and  he won a medal that, I think, was presented to him by Hitler. We also  had a couple of track stars that were at that Olympics. One, Hitler gave a  tree to  Frank Lewis, I believe,  but it was planted in the front yard of  the Sigma Chi property.  Was the tree just like a medal or an award?  Well, it was a special tree, some kind of a special tree. Yes, it was kind  of an award. Yes, yes. And I guess getting it home from Germany and  getting it planted and getting it to grow, that was quite an  accomplishment in itself. There was another Olympic person, his last  name was Efaw, E-F-A-W, and his first name was Forest, Efaw. He was  a marathon runner in marathon races like twenty-four miles. I think it  takes about four hours to run twenty-four miles. That   s six miles an  hour, which is pretty fast because four miles an hour is marching fast. I  mean, marching at a steady clip. So six miles an hour is a pretty good  clip.  So these guys that were in the Olympics, they were in your high school  or your fraternity?  No, they were just from Stillwater, just from Stillwater.  Okay. So they were older than you.  Yes, older. Forest Efaw was older. He had a brother, Paul Efaw, that was  in my high school class. He was a runner, too, but Forest was in the  Olympics. And after the war, during a football game, halftime, Forest  48  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  ran a marathon against the college relay team. It was like twenty-four  miles, and they had four runners. They ran six miles, and then they   d get  a fresh runner. So he ran against all four of them, and they beat him, but  not by much. So he must   ve had lungs that went clear to his knees.  (Laughs)  Do you remember anything about Coach Iba?  Yes, everybody knew who he was. And I don   t remember when he came  back here, mid to late-   30s, I guess. He lived over on   well, when I had  a newspaper route, he was one of my customers on the newspaper route.  He had a son named Moe Iba that played basketball and later coached.  But Hank Iba, he was a man of real distinction. And his wife, I don   t  remember her name, but she was an outstanding lady golfer.  Did you ever golf?  No. No, I never thought I had time. It takes a long time to golf.  Yes. In the fraternity, did you participate in Homecoming?  Yes, I helped build something. A float or something, and I helped move  it down Main Street at the Homecoming parade, which was quite a  chore. And I can   t remember what the float looked like, but I remember  it took several nights of sticking crepe paper through chicken wire to  make it all come together. (Laughter)  Were there a lot of dances?  Yes, yes. There were. There were formal dances, and each fraternity  would have kind of a special dance during the year, sometimes. I think  the Sigma Nu had some kind of a cowboy-type dance, and the Kappa  Sigs had a Mardi Gras dance. I think in that photograph album in there,  that picture of myself and my date that had on the kilts, that was for a  Mardi Gras dance.  That was neat. (Laughs)  Yes.  Where would you hang out on campus? The Student Union wasn   t built  yet.  No, it was built in the early-   50s.  So where would students hang out?  49  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Well, there was a place there where the Hideaway is. There was a big  store there called Mile   s Student Store. There was a campus theater there  on the corner and then Mile   s Student Store. Mile   s Student Store was a  big store and it had a fountain and booths, and it carried schoolbooks  and supplies. It was a hang out. Then on Sunday afternoons, there were  two campus dance orchestras, each one of them about a fifteen-piece  dance orchestra, and they   d play a concert in there on Sunday  afternoons.  In Mile   s Student Store?  Yes. I mean, they played good music. The clarinet player in one of the  bands was really good. He later became a two-star general in the air  force. And before that, during the war, he was a fighter pilot. He became  an ace. I think he had to shoot down five German planes, I think he shot  down like ten. He became an ace and stayed in the air force and became  a general.  Did you ever go to the Y-Hut?  I have been to the Y-Hut. Yes, I have been there. As a matter of fact, I  think maybe I may have met Barbara there the first time I had a date  with her after the Rock Castle. I think that summer we used to meet at  the Y-Hut on the campus when she was in summer school.  Where did she live when she was in summer school?  Murray Hall.  What about Theta Pond?  Well, we used to always go to Theta Pond. Yes, that was always a good  spot and a place that was easy to walk. I didn   t have a car   not a very  dependable car anyway. Mother and I pooled our money and bought an  old car, but it wasn   t very dependable. She finally traded it off and got  one that was more dependable. But I didn   t have a car in college or law  school.  What about Crystal Plunge?  Yes, I used to go. That was a place from the time I was a boy, we used to  go to Crystal Plunge.  And what was it?  50  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  It was a swimming pool, a privately owned swimming pool with bath  houses, and it had a dance pavilion. In the summertime, they   d have  music and dances and swimming parties. It was a very popular place.  When desegregation came along, the owners of the swimming pool, they  just didn   t know how to deal with that, so they closed it down.  Wow. Was there a pool in town for black children to swim in?  No, but one thing I remember about the swimming pool, I was probably  about ten or eleven years old. From the swimming pool, where I lived, I  could kind of ride my bicycle there. It wasn   t all that far. What you did,  you went in the bath house   there was one for boys and one for girls.  You   d go in and they had nails hanging around the walls. You take your  clothes off and hang them on the wall. Of course, it was sort of a  pavilion type of a building where it was open to the air. With the water  and the cover and all, the wasps, they congregated in that bath house.  They had nests around. One time I came in there after getting out of the  pool and took my shirt off my nail and put it on, and there was about a  dozen wasps inside my shirt. I had that shirt on and those wasps were in  there   ugh  I got stung about a dozen times. (Laughs) I got so much  venom that it made me sick. I went to bed and the doctor gave me  something to clear up the venom, but then it made me sick. So it was a  pretty bad experience. They had poison ivy down there, too. I got that  also.  At Crystal Plunge?  Yes. (Laughs)  Did they serve food or did people bring their own?  Well, they served pop and candy bars and maybe ice cream bars, but  they didn   t serve sandwiches or anything like that.  You mentioning the wasp sting reminds me of something you mentioned  earlier, when your foot got cut on some glass, how did you mom treat  that? It was before antibiotics.  She had a big crock that they used to make pickles in, and it was about  so big around, so tall. (Gestures) She   d fill that up with water as hot as I  could stand it, put Lysol in the water, and I   d soak my foot in that, and  she   d keep adding hot water to it. I would take my foot out, and my foot  would be all shriveled up from being in the water so long. But somehow  or other, that helped to kind of draw the poison out.  So it worked?  51  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Yes, it worked. That was before sulfa drugs or antibiotics. Sulfa drugs, I  guess, was developed for the military. And it was a wonderful,  wonderful medication.  Were you familiar with Frank Eaton?  I knew Frank. I knew him. His daughter lived across the street from me  when I was growing up. His granddaughter   and I can   t remember her  name   was in my grade at Lincoln School. But, yes, Frank Eaton was a  blacksmith at Perkins when I first remembered him. My maternal  relatives settled in and around Perkins. Frank had a blacksmith shop  there. He was an unusual fellow. I tell a story on him that, you know, he  had one eye that was kind of crossed, and he claimed to be this  marksman. He had these big long, six-shooter pistols. There was some  class on the campus that had invited him up to talk to them. This was  after the Student Union was built. They wanted him to demonstrate his  fast draw, and he did, and he pulled the trigger and shot a hole in the  floor up at the Student Union. (Laughter)  So did you talk to him much or ever?  Well, when I was a boy he was an old man. He wore a braid, like  Indians. He wore his hair in a braid. I really wouldn   t have had much to  talk to him about, I guess. I wouldn   t have had much to say that  would   ve interested him, I   m sure. (Laughter) But he was friends with  my uncles. We used to take work to his blacksmith shop, and he   d go  barefooted in his blacksmith shop. A hot coal would pop out on the  ground, he could step on it. His feet were so calloused that   tough feet.  (Laughs)  Was it after you were in college that he became the mascot, he became  Pistol Pete?  Yes, yes. That was after the war. They kind of adopted him at the  college and he became the forever famous Pistol Pete. (Laughter)  Did you go to your college graduation? Was there a big ceremony?  I   m trying to think. You mean, routinely?  Yes, the commencement ceremony. From Oklahoma A M. Where was it  held?  Well, when I graduated, I did. But I think I went through maybe in the  summertime. I have been to some graduation ceremonies there for other  52  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  people.  Do you remember anything about your ceremony?  Well, I kind of get my high school and my college one mixed up because  my high school commencement was in what is now the Seretean Center.  They didn   t have an auditorium in the high school that was big enough  to handle it. Then when I got my degree from college, that would   ve  been in 1949, I think it was in Gallagher Hall, I believe.  And what year was it that you met Barbara?  It was in the summer of 1948.  And then when did you get married?  In November of 1950.  And you started to OU in the fall of    48?  Yes.  So was she going to school in Missouri while you were at OU?  Well, the first year I was at OU was her second year at Missouri. And  my second year at OU, she came back to Stillwater. She was here. She  went to college here my second year in law school. I   d come home on  weekends and see her when she was going to college, yes.  So did she graduate from A M?  No, she didn   t graduate. We got married before she graduated. When I  got out of law school in August of 1950, we got married in November of  1950.  So where did you get married?  At Woodward. First Presbyterian Church in Woodward, November 26,  1950.  And then where did you two live?  The first two years we lived in Enid. I had a job at a law firm in Enid, at  the Broadway Tower building in Enid. We started out living in a little  rent house, and then later on I had the GI Bill and we bought a new little  GI house in a new addition, out on the southwest edge of town   two  53  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  bedrooms, one bath, single-car garage. The house had 800 square feet.  (Laughs)  And Enid is where you were photographed at the Easter Parade.  Yes, that   s right. We were there.  Made the paper.  Yes.  Did you go on a honeymoon?  Yes, three days. (Laughter) Lake Murray. Lake Murray Lodge. I think I  had three days off for a honeymoon.  Did you have any children while you were living in Enid?  I have to be kind of careful about this. Yes, Ann was born in Enid.  David was born in Stillwater about a month after we had moved back to  Stillwater. Well, I say back. Barbara and I had not previously lived  together, as a married couple, in Stillwater. She   d lived here as a student.  Of course, I   d grown up here. But we moved to Stillwater and first lived  in a rent house over on Lincoln Street and lived in that for, I don   t know,  a year or so, and bought the lot. I guess we lived in it maybe longer than  that, maybe a couple of years. But we bought this lot, and then we built a  small house on the lot with the idea that it was going to be added on to.  We had a big enough lot. The house ended where the telephone is on the  west. And it ended here, just     Where the carpet is?  The kitchen was the front wall. Yes, the kitchen on the other side of the  door was the front of the house. So when we added on to the house, we  added about ten or twelve feet to the front and then over, and then we  added   the garage had been on the other side of the telephone, the  single-car garage, and we enclosed that as a part of the house and then  extended it on back, here, and then added the carport. (Gestures)  So you   ve done quite a bit of renovation.  Yes. Yes, we did. We did, but it worked out real well because we didn   t  have all of the money coming. You know, we didn   t have to get all of  the money together at one time. We did it kind of gradually, as we got  the money together.  54  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  So when did you purchase the lot?  Well, let   s see. We built the house in 1955. We moved here    Let   s see.  We moved back to Stillwater at the end of 1952. So I   d say we bought  the lot probably in 1954. We had it maybe about a year before we built.  The house next door was there and then the house over here. We were  the third house in this area.  And were there any trees?  No. No, the tree out in the front yard, I planted that and all the trees  around the backyard. No, there weren   t any trees on the hill, here. The  only trees were over at the park, down by the creek. Those old native  trees were there. The rest of the trees were all planted. After we first  moved in it was just bare ground. Barbara and I, we sodded it. I think we  sodded it ourselves. I don   t remember where we got the sod. Then we  didn   t have any shrubs or anything. We had a neighbor back on Fifth  Street that was doing a PhD project with castor beans. (Laughs) So he  came with all these castor bean seeds. You ever see castor beans grow?  Yes.  And we had about three varieties of castor beans. We had one variety  that grew about this tall, like this, and had big kind of reddish leaved,  red-veined leaves, looked big as tobacco leaves. (Gestures) I literally  had some that grew tall and some in between. We had some that grew  like six feet tall, and we planted castor beans around the front of the  house. They grew about a foot a week. (Laughter) That first summer,  people would come to see us from out of town and they said,    We can   t  find your house. We looked over on that street, but we didn   t see any  new houses. We were looking for a house that didn   t have anything  growing around it, but we didn   t find anything.    What they saw was  castor beans. (Laughter)  And then the next year, I had a client that was into building houses, and  he had a wholesale account at the nursery. There was a big nursery in  Eastern Oklahoma. I   ve forgotten the name of the town over there. It  was a huge, huge nursery. But I bought a truckload of nursery stuff, trees  and shrubs there, and they delivered them, planted all those. So we had  stuff growing pretty quick. It was about the first ten years we spent  growing all these things the next ten years we spent cutting down a lot of  it. Across the back, we had I think eight poplar trees. They grow fast,  and they must   ve grown twenty, twenty-five feet tall and made kind of a  hedge across the back. Yes, kind of an interesting place.  Well, I think we better stop for today.  55  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Okay. All right.  But I want to thank you for talking to me so far.  Well, thank you for doing this. I appreciate it.  ------- End of December 6, 2011 interview -------  Today is December 13, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am here  with Winfrey Houston. This is part three of our interview with Winfrey  for the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History Project. Thanks for talking  with me again. Today, let   s start out with around the time you got  married. What do you remember about that time period?  Well, quite a bit. (Laughter) I only did it once, so I    (Laughs) But I  finished law school. I think my classes were over in August, the end of  August 1950. Then I took the bar exam in September of 1950. In August  of 1950, Barbara and I became engaged, and her parents had an  engagement party for us in Woodward in August. Then our wedding  date was   I   m not sure when we set the wedding date, but it was  November 26, 1950. So I got engaged, finished law school, took the bar  exam. And then in October of 1950, I went to work for a law firm in  Enid, and then in November got married. So we lived in Enid the first  two years of our married lives. I worked for the law firm of Wilson and  Wilson in Enid. It was a family law firm that the father had started back  in 1910. And when I worked for them, there were three brothers. Their  offices were in the Broadway Tower in Enid. I did all the stuff that all  young lawyers do. That is, the stuff that the old lawyers don   t want to  do, don   t have time to do. (Laughter)  We got married, and we lived in a little rent house for about three  months. Then we bought a GI house. I was under the GI bill, and we  bought a house, a brand new house in Enid. It had eight hundred square  feet, two bedrooms, one bath, and we lived there the rest of the time we  were in Enid. Then we had the opportunity to come back to Stillwater.  Robert L. Hert, who was married to my first cousin, one of my first  cousins, was in the process of being appointed as a judge. Judge Henry  W. Hoel, H-O-E-L, had served for, I think, twenty-two years as district  judge, and he was ready to retire. He wanted to go back to the law  practice, so he retired from the bench and Robert L. Hert was appointed  district judge. Bob was in the legislature. He had been in the legislature  for about fifteen years, so he had a very busy law practice on Eighth  Street, where the parking lot of Bank First is. He owned the building  back there, furniture and library and everything, so when he was ready  to make that appointment to be judge, he asked if I   d like to come back  56  Wilson  to Stillwater, and I said,    Yes, we would.     So I moved back there to practice law there in that location until the  bank needed the space for their parking lot. During that time frame, I  think it was about 1957, Clee Fitzgerald, who was in law practice with  Preston Moore, wanted to make a change. So he moved in with me and  we were together for twenty-two years. The last fifteen years, Don  Worthington was with us also, who later became district judge and is  now retired.  I became interested in   well, I attended bar meetings. The Oklahoma  Bar Association is structured sort of on a pattern that   s similar to the  American Bar Association. At the time I was a lawyer, first became a  lawyer, I think there was about 4,000 or 5,000 lawyers in Oklahoma. I  think there   s at least twice that many now. I think there is probably  about 12,000 or 13,000. The Bar Association was established by the  Oklahoma Supreme Court, and its purpose is to oversee or specify the  training for lawyers and to be responsible for the discipline of lawyers,  following the ethical standards. So I became interested in bar association  work, the county bar, and I was president in the county bar, I think, in  1956. The state bar had meetings alternating between Oklahoma City  and Tulsa, and I started going to those and became interested in that.  And then in 1969, I was elected president of the Oklahoma State Bar  Association. There was a House of Delegates. Each county elected  delegates based on lawyer population, and then the House of Delegates  elected the officers. I guess there was like 140 delegates when I was  there, probably   I don   t know. I don   t know what it is   probably about  the same number. And then I sat   there was a three-year term you  served president-elect, and then president, and then immediate past  president. So there was a three-year term in there.  At that time, also, the officers of the bar, the state bar, served in the  House of Delegates of the American Bar Association. So I served three  years in the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association. Their  headquarters are in Chicago. They have a building on the campus of the  University of Chicago. They meet annually. They have an annual  meeting in the summer and a mid-year meeting in the winter. They  sponsor changes   well, they sponsor improvement to the administration  of the justice system. They can sponsor legislation both at the state and  national level, if it   s for the improvement of justice. It   s interesting. It  was interesting work. I had the opportunity to meet a lot of people, make  a lot of friends, a lot of contacts.  So as president of the state bar association did you have more say in the  legislation, or did you just oversee everything?  57  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Well, of course, there was a board of governors, and it seems like there  was maybe twenty-one on the board of governors. A part of the board of  governors   I think about two-thirds of them   were elected by the Bar  Association, and then the other third was elected by the Oklahoma  Supreme Court. The Bar Association was actually supervised by the  Oklahoma Supreme Court, not the legislature, but the Supreme Court.  They had regular monthly meetings of the board, and then membership  meetings would be up twice a year, an annual meeting and then a winter  meeting. And at those meetings, again, studies were made of various  laws   whether they were working or not, or whether they needed  improving, disciplining of lawyers that violated ethical conduct or  standards, called the Cannons of Professional Ethics.  Back in those days, our staff was pretty limited. The Oklahoma Bar  Association had a pretty small staff. We started out, when I first became  a lawyer, they had offices downtown that they rented. And then later on,  we, through voluntary contributions, raised money and built the bar  center, which is located in the Capitol complex in Oklahoma City. It   s  just south of the Capitol.  On Lincoln?  Yes, on Lincoln Boulevard. You know where it is?  Yes.  Yes, it   s a beautiful, white marble building, and then it   s been added on  to. But yes, that was all built with voluntary funds.  That   s neat. Do you remember any particular legislation the Bar  Association was behind while you were involved?  Well, the hot, hot issue back in those days was cameras in the  courtroom. The media wanted to film, photograph and film, court  proceedings. The Bar Association resisted that because it would change  the whole dynamic of the court proceeding if it was going to be on  television. The thing about it, if television would show the whole thing  in primetime, that would be one thing. But they   d pick and choose bits  and pieces, and that wouldn   t be representative of what was really going  on. That would be some producer   s idea of what was going on, and it  wouldn   t necessarily convey an accurate representation, so we resisted  that   successfully, too. They still, I don   t think, photograph or film  court proceedings. That   s one of the fundamental things we   d feel like to  get a more of a fair trial if that   s not done.  Was your involvement in the various bar associations all volunteer?  58  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Oh, sure. Yes, volunteer. You mean without pay?  Yes. (Laughs)  Yes. (Laughter) There were certain times when I   d get reimbursed for  actual out-of-pocket travel expenses. If I was representing the Bar at  some official function, I could file a claim and be reimbursed for travel  and lodging and meals. And my wife usually went along, too, because  there were a lot of activities for women, but I don   t think I got  reimbursed for her. I think just for the officer.  Were there women in the Bar Association, female members?  There were a few. There were a few, but not like today. When I was in  law school at OU, the enrollment was about what it is now   or maybe  even higher. I think when I started it was like six hundred. I think the  enrollment there now is five hundred-and-something. But my first class I  attended down there, out of about six hundred, I think there was two  women.  And was one of those Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher?  Yes. And the other one was a young woman who was married to a law  student from Muskogee. Yes, pretty small number back then. And I  don   t know when it was or what in particular attracted women to the  profession, but it may have been one of the early opportunities for  women to enter the professional world. Of course, there were some  doctors, but probably it was easier to become a lawyer than it would to  become a doctor, a little shorter educational demand. So it caught on  pretty quickly. Now, I think there   s probably as many, if not maybe  more, women in law school than there are men.  We talked earlier about you being at law school the same time that the  Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher case was going through. Were there many  African American lawyers in the Bar Association that were educated in  other places, in other states and came back?  Well, not many. There was one or two that I remember, and then there  was one, John Green, was an early day black lawyer from Oklahoma  City. He was a friend of mine that I think was in the district attorney   s  office. Let   s see. There was another black lawyer from it seems like     well, there was one or two from Oklahoma City and one or two from  Tulsa that I knew. I can   t remember their names. But when I was Bar  president I used to travel around, the bar associations would invite the  officers to attend their meetings and speak at some of their functions. So  59  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  Wilson  Houston  I did that during the years that I served and got acquainted with a lot of  people that way.  Did you have a particular focus? Did your practice have a particular  focus in Stillwater? What kind of law did you practice?  We call it general civil. So civil is everything other than criminal. I  never did do much criminal work, very little. But civil practice, civil and  probate. There wasn   t much administrative law opportunities in  Stillwater, so didn   t do much of that. Like, oh, did a little bit like  workers    compensation, a little bit of that early on. That all became kind  of specialized.  So have you seen all of that change very much over the years with the
