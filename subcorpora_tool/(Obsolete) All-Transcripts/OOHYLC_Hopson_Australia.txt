 Finchum Today is October 20, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and today we   re in  Tulsa, Oklahoma, to speak with Australia Hopson. This is part of our  Oklahoma 100 Year Life project. Thank you for having us today. Let   s  start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Hopson Well, I was born as part one person and part another person, like black,  white, and Indian. I   m all three of those.  Finchum Okay.  Hopson I   m not ashamed of either one. It   s something that couldn   t be helped. It  was God   s will, and it must be done. I liked my grandma who was  Indian. We lived on a farm. Mother and Father would get up and go to  the farm. Grandma would stay home and cook me this good ol    white  gravy and biscuits, and I loved to stay home with her. I was the baby of  the family. It was just three of us that lived, one my older sister, ten  years older than me, and my other sister, seven years, no, three years  older than me. I was in between, kind of spoiled, but they was nice to  me. I had some good days, and I had some bad days. If I couldn   t do  nothing, I get my old sticky horse and,    Get up, get up, get up     Boy, I  had as much fun with that stick as you would on a real pony. Finally,  we got us a pony. Got a pony. They   d let me ride him. They   d let me  hook up, harness up the other mule and horses to do the work.  Bishop When were you born?  Hopson Where?  Bishop When?  5  Hopson I was born June 16, 1914.  Bishop Where?  Hopson In a little, tipi like, inside   no house, just like a tent or something that  you were born in. We didn   t have   Grandma style.  Bishop Where was this?  Hopson Muskogee, in the country, out in the rural. Finally, my daddy was a  religious person, and, you know, God sometimes answered prayers. We  got us a house, and we started living like normal people. We were living  like normal people, but not in a house that you could sweep. We had to  sweep the yard. You couldn   t sweep the floor. If you didn   t know who  came to visit, you   d just sweep it over. No one would ever know if you  don   t want to tell them.  Finchum Your parents were farmers?  Hopson Oh, yeah.  Finchum Or your grandparents were farmers?  Hopson My parents. My daddy was born in slavery. He was never a slave. His  mother, you know, you had to do what they say. You had children by  then. My uncle came one day through this college, and there was a  pretty Indian girl there. He snatched her up on his horse and ran away  with her. That   s the way he had all his children. I think I   m the worst  looking one now. (Laughs) So that   s the way we lived. Here in 1907,  we came to statehood. She couldn   t tell that she was kidnapped. He told  her he   d kill her. They wasn   t going to kill her, you know, but they just  scared her. She never did tell us how she got to be our granny. We  couldn   t call her grandmother. We   d have to say,    Nanny, Nanny.    She  could never tell nobody those was her grandchildren.  One day, my father and his brother-in-law, his wife, they saw each other  in town, and she say,    I   m going to come to visit you tomorrow. Can I  visit?       Sure, come on over.    He come. Behold, there is the man he was  invited to see was his sister. He didn   t know they had gotten apart, you  know. After they found each other, they started claiming each other.  That   s how we started our immediate family life.  My mother and father, they lived until   my mother passed away in    30,  and my daddy passed away in about    32. Then I was raised by my older  sister that was just ten years older than me. I did good. I was in school. I  was fifth grade, fifth or sixth grade in Muskogee. Papa hooked up the  6  horse and wagon, (we didn   t have no buggy) and went to this high  school on Saturday. Believe it or not, I won the contest. A big old piece  of silver, the one that nobody at my school had ever won.  Finchum What was it for?  Hopson Speaking. They said,    Don   t be afraid. If you want to get and say  something, look the person in the eye and then kinda drop down, and  you forget they   re there. You just be talking. You don   t know who it is.  It might be Mary, John, or anybody.    But I won this prize.  Then, I come to Tulsa, Oklahoma. My parents had brought me, and I  was good in sports. You know, you don   t hardly go to a new school and  be the best in that. Believe it or not, I had about half a month, and I took  the lead in mostly everything. Believe it or not, my grandchildren are  doing the same thing. Like I had Tyler playing sports and, boy, he just  teaches himself. He just getting out and just running and running. They  say,    Who is teaching him?    I say,    He   s teaching hisself. He believes  in hisself.    He probably wouldn   t be as good as he is until he got up and  tried. Don   t think the world owe him something. I   m happy.  Finchum What sports did you do?  Hopson Oh, I   baseball. At my school, Carver Junior High, I was the best girl  player there, and they never found me no time that I was at the bat.  They were all proud of it, and I tried to carry myself. They didn   t owe  me nothing, and I appreciated them being friends to me.  Finchum Did you say Carver?  Hopson Carver Junior High School. That   s my favorite school in this city.  Bishop What year did you move to Tulsa, again?  Hopson Twenty-nine. You know, used to, you celebrated the old year to the new  year, get firecrackers. I was just at Carver because in Tulsa they didn   t  shoot them firecracker at home, but now we had a show out of it you  know, on the Fourth of the July.  Finchum Your parents had come from what state?  Hopson Well, I can   t remember really where they came from. They didn   t know  each other until they     Finchum Got here.  7  Hopson     Oklahoma, yes.  Yvonne Hatcher Your father was from Arkansas, wasn   t he?  Hopson Oh, he was in Arkansas. Yeah, he was Arkansas. My mother, I don   t  know. I can   t remember where she was, but they met after they came  to     Finchum Oklahoma.  Hopson Yeah. We   d go down there, and they in Arkansas. They were going to  make us see where my daddy and my grandmother lived.  One day I came home from school in the rural, and there was some  people at our house. I said,    Mama, who is that?       Shut up, girl. That   s  your grandpa.    (Laughs) He was Caucasian. My grandma, and he had  his two daughters with him, a man and daughter lived with him. We had  another uncle. That   s how we met them. They had the horse and buggy.  We didn   t have no car then. I think we got those old Fords later. When I  was in the sixth grade, and I could saddle up a horse, hook up a wagon  as good as my dad could. He said,    Don   t do that.    He   d go somewhere,  and I   d slip and hook up his horses and team. We didn   t have a brother,  and they wished for one, and so I did the work of a brother.  Finchum Well, did you have to help them farm?  Hopson Well, when I left from there, by one year I was old enough to do it. My  auntie, my mother   s sister, she was the baby of the family. She was a  Moses, and she was jealous because my mama was born and made  another family. She wasn   t the baby anymore, so she took our grandma,  our grandma home with her to live. We didn   t get to see her, so I was  unhappy because she was just like my grandmother because I had had  her taking care of me for all the years, all the years. I never liked her  anymore. She took my Nanny.  Finchum Well, did you have some chores that you had to do as a youngster?  Hopson Well, I didn   t have to do them, but I was a child, was eager to do it  because, see, my middle sister, I would just cry when my mother  adopted her. She was good to me. She loved me, and that was the one in  the middle. She would cook and do all   they didn   t make her do it,  now. She would just   they   d tell me,    Go do it,    and I   d start crying.     Come on, come on,    she   d do my work. Wouldn   t have to wash  dishes. That   s the reason I don   t know nothing now. (Laughs) Nothing.  Finchum Well, how did you get your name Australia?  8  Hopson Well, my mother and a friend of the teacher, somebody had to go to  school and get her on a horse and buggy every day. We   d bring her and  then carry her home. She was ill, and my mother volunteered to help the  assistant teacher teach. They were looking in the geography book, and  they thought it was exciting. They first said,    Asia. No, let   s see.  Australia,    and that   s what they named me: Australia.  Finchum It   s pretty.  Hopson Oh, well, thank you. Everybody tell me that, and I felt real funny at  first, named after a country. (Laughs) I had to take it, but I enjoyed it  after I got it.  Finchum Well, when did you get married?  Hopson When I was eighteen. Papa and Mama, they didn   t want me to get  married, so I sneaked off one night. We were going out, we said, and  went over to his house. Had the preacher there and everything and got  married. Then, you couldn   t go to school if you were married, and I had  to finish my school later on, but I did finish twelfth grade and part-time  college when it was downtown. I don   t know whether   no, you weren   t  here. Then after I got married, I took cosmetology. I did pass state  board in that until I started having trouble with my hands and limbs, but  we made a good living.  Finchum You had a beauty shop?  Hopson Yeah, I was a beautician.  Finchum Wow. Styles have changed a little bit?  Hopson Oh, yeah, very much so. (Laughs) I couldn   t do a little   then after then,  I took nursing. I liked that because I like people. People that was sick, I  tried to help them, and I did. Most of my patients liked me, so I had two  things that I could do. When you   re doing cosmetology, sometimes you  had hard dyes and things, and my husband would say,    No, you   ll be  sued. You can   t do that.    I have arthritis in my hands.  Bishop Did your beauty shop have a name?  Hopson Tiny.  Bishop Tiny.  9  Hopson I wouldn   t go with Australia. It   s too long to say. It   s Tiny   s. I did that  until, oh, a long time I recall.  Finchum Where was the shop?  Hopson Down on Deep Greenwood where all the people were. (Laughs) I  enjoyed down there, and they enjoyed me.  Finchum Would you have had it during the Depression?  Hopson Oh, yes, that was our living because, see, you know what cotton did.  No, you don   t. You   re not old enough.  Finchum No, tell us. You can tell us.  Hopson Oh, the boll weevils came and ate up all the cotton. We had to do what  we could do to make a living out of it. Mama would grow a garden and  take them to town, get rid of them. We   d live like that, but the worst  thing, my auntie took my Nanny away from me.  Finchum When you did the nursing, was it at a hospital?  Hopson Oh, yeah, I retired from Saint Francis. Fourteen or fifteen years I  worked there on the bone floor.  Finchum Bones?  Hopson You know, sometimes I forget.  Bishop Orthopedics?  Hopson Orthopedics, that got it. (Laughs) We did that, back surgeries and  different things. They wanted me to do people that came in, and I didn   t  want to do that, emergency room. I   d rather do orthopedic, and I did.  Finchum Emergency rooms are pretty tough.  Hopson Yeah, oh yeah. I could handle it. I did on a small hospital, Muskogee in  the rural. It was just I   d rather have a certain floor, because I didn   t  know what was coming in. I didn   t want to do people and half-do them,  and if I couldn   t do it, I didn   t want to try. Life   s nothing to play with.  You should know what you   re doing.  Finchum You moved from Muskogee to Tulsa in the    29, 1929?  Hopson Yes.  10  Finchum That was after all the race riots and stuff, wasn   t it?  Hopson Oh, yeah, we would get a letter every other day letting us know (I had a  first cousin lived there) what was going on. The minister that married  my husband and me, he was in the race riot. W. G. Skelly boarded him  and his family in houses. They weren   t bothered because they had  family to take care of you. Then after I went to Saint Francis and I  retired, I said,    Well, I   m too young to just sit down. I   m going to do  something else.    I did this orthopedics, not orthopedics. She was a  psychiatrist, and her husband was a lawyer, for nine years after I retired.  This year, the baby girl got married, and she had Australia to come.  They told her,    Mary, you got company.       Who is it?    She hadn   t seen  Australia. She looked up, and she saw me, and she just busted out  crying. She said,    This is the happiest day of my life.    She had finished  college now, and then her Australia came to see her get married.  (Laughs) I had some pretty good days.  Finchum Sounds like you worked a lot, too.  Hopson Oh, I do. Isabella, see, my mother-in-law, she lived with us. This parish  changed, and she took care of the children. That   s the reason I didn   t  leave my children unattended. She took care of my family. When she  took care of my family, that   s the reason we could live as well as we did  because older people, they couldn   t do nothing. She could take care of  the children, and do you know she wouldn   t let nobody else have them.  (Laughs) I mean, we all lived together.    No, you don   t need them. I can  handle them.    She loved to fish, but she gave up part-time of her fishing  to take care of her grandchildren.  Finchum How many children did you have?  Hopson Oh, I had  nine  children. They all didn   t live because my mother was a  diabetic and sometimes when you are pregnant, you lose out. You don   t  carry a child full term, so she did carry some. That   s what we did.  Finchum You had  nine ?  Hopson  Nine .  Finchum Yourself?  Hopson Oh, yeah. Then go right on back, she   d take care of the children.    I   m  tired of you having these young   uns,    she   d say. She went on and had  the kids. She would take care of those kids. I was proud, but I couldn   t  11  tell them what to do. We did agree on the right thing of making them  mind.  Finchum Well, how did you meet your husband?  Hopson At a grocery store. When we came, we lived on Latimer Place and went  right around the corner there. Believe it or not, he was a butcher there.  My husband was seven years older than me.  He wouldn   t let me go with none of the younger boys. One day, a boy  in my class came home with me, and he carried my books. My daddy  say,    What are you doing with those books? Are those her books?        Yeah.       Well, give them to her and let her carry them herself. You   re  not supposed to   Is that what you go to school for, to learn to carry  ladies    books?    I was so embarrassed, but the boy never came back.  (Laughs) He might   ve been a good chance.    No.    My daddy was a very  religious man.  Finchum Went to church every Sunday?  Hopson Oh, Lord, yes. He belonged to the Methodist church. The head man  there is like the deacon in the Baptist church, and that   s the way we  were. We had a good time, all the community, yes.  Finchum What were some of the things you would do for fun?  Hopson Where, in the country?  Finchum Yes.  Hopson Oh, I   d get me these old   you know how you put a hole   take a stick,  put a can on it, each one. Then you   d tommy walk. Oh boy, that   s the  way I   d get around. Lots of the time we   d jump rope. He wouldn   t let us  play dominoes and cards, but we could play anything else, anything but  dominoes and cards and dice. That wasn   t allowed in the house.  Checkers, that was our game. We could play checkers. What   s the  difference, I don   t know. (Laughs)  Finchum I don   t know, either.  Hopson We   d just sit down there and play checkers. We couldn   t play cards or  dominoes. We had ball. We   d play,    Over, Annie. Here she comes      Throw the ball over the house. (Laughs) That was the other game that  we played a lot. We   d always find a game. The way we would visit   he  had six brothers and sisters, and the way they would visit one another  on Sunday, everybody would cook a basket of food, carry it to this  12  person   s house. They   d spread it, and that   s the way we   d have our  dinner on Sunday. Next Sunday, its John   s time, and we did that. Got  along quite well.  Finchum What kind of food would be in the basket?  Hopson Oh, boy, now you talk about cooking, country folk can sure cook. They  know how. They taught me how to do it. You know where I did work,  at Admiral State Bank. I was the one that had the key, went in the  house. I went in the bank, and then made my order. I went to the store  myself and bought it. I had to pull twenty-five at eleven o   clock. That   s  after I moved to town and I had my children. We could cook, honest to  goodness. I   ve forgotten how to cook everything. I can   t cook nothing.  Finchum Not even cornbread?  Hopson When I worked for the school, the city, I made the best cornbread. Had  that ol    yellow meal. That   s what they   d give you. Boy, I could sure  cook that cornbread.  Finchum In between nursing and the beauty shop, you worked as a cook in the  school system?  Hopson Oh, yeah. I could work some. Then you got to have those babies. When  you have those babies, they don   t save that job for you. Too many  people want it. I got to look for me another job. I got to be friends and  good with everybody so I can be able to get another job. They say,     Well, what did you do, get fired?       No, I did not. I just went and found  another one.    I was lucky. I can   t see why people can   t find nothing to  do. It might not be as much as another person gets, but it   s something to  keep you eating, your family.  Finchum What was your husband doing while you were     Hopson He was a butcher.  Finchum Oh, he stayed a butcher?  Hopson Yes, he never did   . He was a butcher.  Hatcher They both used to work two and three jobs at one time. My father on  Sundays, he went hunting. He   d kill forty to fifty rabbits. We   d have to  come back and clean them. When he   d come back, we   d have to clean  them and sell them.  Hopson Oh, yeah.  13  Hatcher This is the way we survived, and plus, you know, she would work the  beauty shop and the hospital, worked more in the hospital.  Finchum They did the rabbits here in Tulsa or when you were in the country?  Hatcher No, here in Tulsa.  Finchum Really?  Hatcher In Tulsa, he would go out and   .  Hopson We were a poor family, but all the rich people would call us. They were  our people. They were his customers because he was a good scuffler,  we   d say. They respected him.  Finchum Forty rabbits in one day is pretty good.  Hatcher Forty or fifty. It was forty or fifty. We had to clean them every Sunday.  He   d get back Sunday night, and we   d have to clean them every Sunday  night. We were experts, though. We could skin a rabbit and think  nothing about it.  Bishop Did you have to clean those rabbits?  Hopson No, I didn   t clean them.  Hatcher She wouldn   t do it.  Hopson No. Now, I had them kids   that   s what I did not do. No, they did.  Bishop That was your line in the sand.  Hopson Yes, Lord.  Finchum Well, would you cook them?  Hopson Oh, yeah, if somebody didn   t buy them all before. They   d take them.  We had one doctor, he was a good physician. Sometimes he   d take  twelve at a time, of our rabbits. That   s true.  Finchum Well, there had to be enough country around here to     Hopson It was. They   d go way into Kansas. One day he came out there, and he  said,    Tiny,    (they called me Tiny)    Tiny, Tiny, come out here. What  do you see?    I said,    I don   t see nothing.    My oldest daughter, the one  14  on this side, she was always the head lady,    Oh, Daddy, we got a  coyote.    And that thing, every time it   d make a move   . He   d drive  way to Kansas to come back with the car just packed up full. He   d take  three or four men with him, and they   d kill them. He   d have twenty-four  shells in a box, and he   d bring back twenty-three rabbits.  Finchum Pretty good shot, then.  Hopson Oh, yeah, he was. Really was. We didn   t know nothing but to do  something to make a living. My mother planted a garden. That   s the  reason I don   t like vegetables too much now, but I eat them because I  know they good for you. We had to eat them vegetables or else go  hungry.  Finchum She did some canning?  Hopson Oh, Lord, we   d have a hundred and something. My mother would can  for the wintertime. We   d go across town to some store, and my daddy  would make the preparations for us to eat there during the winter. Soon  as we   d get something that we could sell to make money, we   d carry  and pay him. We always paid him in the springtime. That   s how we  paid him. They had clothes, too, and they used to have this flour in  these sacks and make these kids    dresses out of them. Mama never  would let us wear a flour dress. She   d sell them vegetables and get the  money, get the material, and she   d make them. She   d even make my  coats.  Finchum Wow.  Hopson Yes.  Finchum No flour sack dresses.  Hopson No flour sack dresses, no ma   am.  Finchum There was a mercantile in Muskogee?  Hopson Oh, yes. Oh, Lord, yes. We didn   t have accounts in that store like we do  at these, like you got a big ol    grocery store that sell meal flour and  everything in. Out in the country, that   s the way they made their living.  They got their money. They didn   t hardly have nothing to pay for it in  the wintertime. They   d put it on the books, and then in the spring when  the cotton   and that   s the reason they say the boll weevils ran us away  from the country because you got nothing. The boll weevils eat up all  the cotton. You wouldn   t have nothing to pick. I doubt if my children  saw any cotton or not. It   s    first white then red three days then dead.     15  That was the bloom and with a great big flower boll. You   d pick that  cotton. Never could pick a hundred pounds to save my life. Everybody  could but me, a hundred pounds.  Finchum You just weren   t quick enough     Hopson Yeah.  Finchum    or just didn   t like it, either?  Hopson Oh, I just couldn   t do it. Sometimes I   d cheat.    You better not bring no  more cotton in there looking like that with all them sticks and things in  there.    Cheat and trying to make out like I could get more. I just  couldn   t pick a hundred pounds. I was a city girl, and they moved me to  the city. (Laughs) I did all that good stuff. My first job after I got out to  the city   bus fare, I think, was five cents or three for a quarter. That   s  how we went to work. We wouldn   t make but a dollar a day. Glad to get  that job, a dollar a day. People say,    I can   t get nothing to do.    They  don   t try. If you cook real good and everything, well, probably you   ll  get more than a dollar. My mother was mean, but I wasn   t so mean.  Was too little on that stuff because I just couldn   t do it. They hadn   t  taught me to do nothing. My sister would do it for me so I wouldn   t  have to do it. If I had to do all of it, I   d be the best person in the world. I  wasn   t mean to her. I loved her.  Finchum Could she do a hundred pounds?  Hopson Oh, Lord, yes, she could.  Finchum She could.  Hopson Some of them, other people, could pick two hundred pounds. They   d  pack that down in a cotton sack and pull a sack of cotton, over fifty  pounds. I think that   s the reason my neck hurting now. (Laughs) I  injured the bone. I never pulled that much because I couldn   t, and I  wasn   t cheating, either. Just couldn   t do it.  Bishop You moved to Tulsa in 1929?  Hopson That   s it. You got it.  Bishop That was really the beginning of the Great Depression. What were the  Depression days like in Tulsa?  Hopson Oh, after we came here? Not before? It was harder, and we come to  there, anyplace that we could get them. We   d stand on the line, my  16  daddy would, with a bucket. In that bucket was soup. That   s sometimes  what we had to eat. I don   t like beef right now because they   d kill a cow  and then pass that beef out to you, and you   d take it home and cook it.  When we got to Tulsa, we   d find little jobs, not cutting a yard because  we cut our own yards. Lord, when it got so you cut yards, you was  making money then. We had a pretty good time. It was hard, and I  wonder is times going to be like they used to be. I hope not, and being  my age, I don   t know what a hundred-year-old person finds to do.  (Laughs) I sure wouldn   t.  Finchum Did your husband have to go to war?  Hopson He couldn   t go because, oh, my husband, he wasn   t well enough, but he  was well enough to get all them babies, though. No, he didn   t have to  go to war. I had one son to go. No, he didn   t go to war. He went to  service, but he never did have to go to war. No, my husband didn   t have  to go. We   d have been off better. We   d been left. Then he might not  have lived, and it wasn   t worth it. You love your country, but if you   ve  got to go   both of my boys was in college when war time, and they had  to get out of school and sign and go to war. One went, and the other,  just before it was time for him to get signed out, well, they stopped  making people go, age-wise like that. That   s the only thing that kept  him at home.  Finchum What war was that?  Hopson After it was kind of ending, and they wasn   t forcing you to sign. If you  signed, you signed on your own.  Finchum Okay, he wasn   t drafted.  Hopson That   s it, drafted.  Bishop Vietnam? Was it the Vietnam War?  Hatcher He was in Langston. He was in school down in Langston, and he got  drafted.  Finchum We   re trying to figure out which war. Was it the Vietnam War     Hopson Yes. Yeah, that was back then. I remember when they had the   Tulsa  was under fire, you know. Some of them didn   t have any place to keep  their workers, and they couldn   t keep them. Oh, we have trial and  tribulation. I wonder if there   s anything else coming. (Laughs) I don   t  know what.  17  Finchum I   m trying to understand your heritage. You said your parents were  black, or one was Indian, no, your grandparents.  Hopson Okay, my daddy, he was a slave.  Finchum Your daddy, okay.  Hopson Okay? His mother was a jet-black woman. They had four children: two  girls and two boys. My mother   s mother, her mother was the Indian.  Finchum Okay, your mother   s mother.  Hopson Yes.  Finchum Your grandmother.  Hopson My grandmother. They had a lumberyard, and my daddy was twelve  years old. He had to carry the lumber to yards, so he had the horse and  buggy and went up there. The man would say,    Hey there, boy, you  stop.       Okay.       Where you going?    He was kind of like, looked foreign  like me. He   d say,    I   m going to carry this lumber to the yard.       Who  you going to carry it for?       I   m going to carry it for the man that own  the house. It   s his plantation.    He went on, and he said,    Well, ain   t  nobody on it but you. How you going to count it up?       I   m going to  count it up.    My daddy set down there and counted it up something for  him.    Hey, boy, how are you learning to do that stuff?       I just saw other  people doing it.    He couldn   t tell the truth.    I just saw other people  doing it, and I tried it myself, and I did it.    He said,    You   re lying to  me, boy. I   m going to make you come down off that wagon. I   m going  to make you pay for this lying to me.     Papa hit his team, and people standing down there.    If you don   t get out  of the way, my team   s coming through     He made it back home to his  daddy, and his daddy put him in a wagon and brought him to his brother  in Oklahoma. That   s how he got to Oklahoma. The man ran and caught  my grandfather. He threw lots of cover over this top so Papa wouldn   t  be seen.    Hey, where you going?       I   m going to the market.       What  you going to the market for?       I   m going to sell these pigs, so I can get  me some money to feed my family.    He says,    Feed your family? I  don   t believe there   s no pigs in there. Take that cover off of there and  let me see them pigs.    He said,    Okay.    POP. POP. (Gestures making  horses run) And they went on. They made it to Oklahoma, though.  Yeah, but if they hadn   t, there wouldn   t have been no Papa now.  (Laughs) Yes, sir. I said times is just so changed     Finchum It has.  18  Hopson    so changed. One God, one Lord, one baptism. I don   t know whether  that changed it, or it was just time for it to change. I don   t know what   s  going to happen. Not for us to decide. It   s God   s will.  Bishop What   s the one thing in your lifetime that you   ve seen, the greatest  change that you   ve seen?  Hopson In my life?  Bishop In your lifetime.  Hopson In my lifetime. Let me think. I   ll have to think on that to see. When we  could chop cotton, I wasn   t old enough, but Mama would get me a row  and help me on mine. There would be three of us with three dollars a  day. Mama would give me part of that dollar and let me spend it like I  wanted. Get a dollar a day, and then they kept on, and kept on, and kept  on until we would progress doing something. Go pick up potatoes.  We   d never planted no Irish potatoes. They   d plow those Irish potatoes  up. Now, I can pick them up and put them in a basket. Every time I   d  get a basket of potatoes, I   d get a dime or fifteen cents. God would open  up a way for us to get a little something. Mama would give me a nickel  or dime. That   s the way we   d get our money.  Finchum How would you spend yours?  Hopson On anything that I can. I   d go to town on Saturday if they   d take me.  You think I   m lying. I   d have my fifteen cents. I   d get a nickel   s worth  of crackers, and a dime   s worth of bologna, and, boy, I   d eat good  because I had meat. (Laughs) That   s the way we did it.  Finchum Not candy.  Hopson No, we didn   t want no candy, but we   d eat anything. If we   d buy  apples, a man would come by sometimes with a wagon and have those  apples just getting specks on them. They   re not good to sell, but we   d  go out there and spend a quarter and get about four or five of them. Cut  that black spot out of there, and cut it, and make us a apple pie or  something like that. We   d always fix a way to get it, I   m telling you. I  hope it never comes to that for my kids because they don   t have sense  enough to know. They think life is built on and fed with a silver spoon.  They don   t know what life is and how we had it, how we had it.  Bishop Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  19  Hopson No, Lord, no. I never did. I said,    You know that old lady down there,  so and so   .    I look at people now, and they say that to me. (Laughs)  Some of my grandchildren is respectable for me, but sometimes, you  know, they used to didn   t. A lady told me one day, she say,    Mama, I  tell you, I   m going to get old, but don   t whoop me.    Some of them kids  would whoop their parents. No, any child whoop me and I   m going go  in there with this like that. I   ll get them. They wouldn   t. Oh, Lord, I  hope it doesn   t come to that. I really do. I don   t think it will.  Finchum I don   t think it will, either.  Hopson I don   t either. They might lie to you, but they ain   t going to whoop you.  They ain   t going to whoop you.  Finchum Did any of your other relatives live to be a hundred?  Hopson No. Oh, yes, my daddy   s brother, he got to be  108 .  Finchum Well, there you go. You   ve got a few more to go.  Hopson Well, I don   t know. Sometime I wonder will I halfway go his way after  I pass a hundred. Yeah, he did. He sure was good-looking, honest. He  went to service, my daddy   s brother.  Finchum World War I?  Hopson The first World War. My son, he went to service in the last war. I   m  sure there   s some more of my relatives, but I didn   t know them. Can   t  get around much on a wagon.  Finchum What do you think your secret is to living that long?  Hopson Well, I don   t know. Sometimes I wonder. I don   t drink. I don   t know  what else, but I don   t know it   s worth it. It   s not because I   m so good,  but it   s just because I can   t stand it. I really can   t stand it. My daddy  didn   t drink. My mother didn   t drink. Some members of my family do.  Now, my children thought, most of them thought it was fun to have  good fun and take a highball like that. I don   t know whether that gives  them short life or what.  Finchum Did you smoke?  Hopson No, I tried, but I couldn   t do it. Oh, I tried, and I ain   t going to lie and  say I didn   t. I didn   t let my parents see me do it. I just couldn   t do it. I  tried to smoke when I got married. My husband said,    I don   t want  nobody   s smoke blowing at me.    But he smoked. If I kept on trying to  20  learn how, he wouldn   t have stayed with me. I knew no other way to  live. (Laughs) I got to stop or live. Oh, Lord, that   s funny. I just  couldn   t do it.  Finchum How long were you married?  Hopson Twenty-five years.  Finchum Twenty-five.  Hopson Almost twenty-five, about two or three months when he passed away in     60. I   ve been a widow ever since    60.  Finchum Since    60, that   s a long time.  Hopson That sure is. Well, and my mother-in-law passed after him on about  eight months or so, like that. I wouldn   t have known what to do because  I wouldn   t have had nobody to help me. After I had opened my shop  and I did good in it. Well, I did all right.  Finchum So you opened your shop after your husband passed away?  Hopson No, no, no, no, I did that before. After my parents went. I would sneak  and do a little something for you. I   d even cheat sometime for the hair,  and he didn   t know I was working at the shop. I bet you couldn   t guess  how much   I was making fifteen cents a head to wash and press and  curl the hair, fifteen dollars, fifteen dollars. That was a lot of money.  Finchum That was.  Hopson Yes.  Finchum To press?  Hopson Yeah.  Finchum I   m not sure what   how would you press?  Hopson Oh, we would have irons, heat them with irons, just like you ironed  clothes.  Finchum To make it smoother?  Hopson Yes.  Finchum Stretch it out?  21  Hopson Yeah, that   s how we would. Then they had a substance that you put on  your hair, and it   d make it just as straight. You had to know how to do it  because if you put too much on there, it would take it out. That   s why  you go to school to learn these little techniques. Your hair would be just  as straight as one, two, three. Wash it and press it.  Finchum How many years did you have the shop?  Hopson About four. More than that because seven or eight years   no, that   s  when I stopped working. I had the shop about four years.  Hatcher First, she had a shop in the house. You had a shop in the house at first,  right? Then you moved down to 1010 North Greenwood.  Hopson Well, sneak them in so Daddy wouldn   t know it. You   re not honest all  the time because you   ve got to eat. (Laughs)    All right, come on. Do  it.    Then, too, we go to the casino and play. Well, we had a game that  we would play. We   d write a number down.    Australia, Miss Tiny, you  want a book?       Yes ma   am.    I   d get me a book. I   d get me a book.    It   s  your time to shake the other numbers out.       Okay.    My husband, on  Saturday night, he had to take these groceries and deliver them to the  people   s house. He trusted me. He didn   t believe. He wouldn   t let  anybody tell him that I was writing them numbers. He   d say,    No.     They   d come down,    Okay, we   d better hurry up and get through  because my husband will be here, and he ain   t going to be   .       All  right.    We   d take that can and shake them numbers up. Whatever those  people write down, if they write it down, they win however much he   d  win. That   s what we won. Now they can go up to the casino and,     We   ve got to put the money in and pull the lid.    I said,    Times sure  change.    I guess these Indians have got more nerve than we got, they  tried it out and started. I can   t remember whether they got caught when  they first started it on us. No, we did. If we   d write those numbers, I  really don   t. Come to think of it, I don   t know whether they got caught  or not.  Finchum I don   t know either.  Hopson But they got a good job. I don   t see no harm in it, just a recreation and  something to do. (Laughs)  Bishop Well, what   s a typical day like for you? At a hundred, what is a typical  day like for you? What time do you get up? What do you do?  22  Hopson It   s just about the same every morning. My last job for fifteen years, I  had to be on the floor, dressed, at seven o   clock. Every morning, I wake  up at five so I can get my shower. If I have to go to the center that day,  well, I get dressed and go on to the center. I might lay there and not get  up, but I won   t sleep tonight after that good because that   s the time for  fifteen or so years that I got up, and I wasn   t lazy, either.  Bishop You talked about, is that the senior center or the community center?  Hopson No, that   s Saint Francis. Now I wake up about that time of day. I don   t  go every day, but I lay awake. Look like your eyes is awake because  I   ve got to go to chop cotton at seven, and I get off at six. When they  made those eight hours for us to live, to use through the day, I was so  glad because sometimes we   d have to do twelve hours and not get paid  for them if there wasn   t nobody there to relieve you.  Bishop What time do you usually go to bed?  Hopson Just whenever I get sleepy. I don   t have no certain time. My daddy  taught us that nine o   clock was time   we didn   t stay up at our house  after nine o   clock. That was our time to go to bed. I see, now, people do  it. I wish I could do it. I can   t go to bed that early. I guess I   ve had so  many jobs with different hours, that   s why. I sure could get up and be  on the job before seven o   clock, because you had to be on the floor.  Bishop Do you have any hobbies today? Do you read? Do you sew?  Hopson Oh, I used to read. That was my mind, that was my book, but I don   t see  real well.  Bishop What types of books did you enjoy reading?  Hopson Any kind you show. I didn   t pick them. Oh, I loved to read. Then when  we   d take these little short courses in   I liked anatomy. Oh, I just loved  to read.  Bishop Did you have a favorite book?  Hopson Well, I couldn   t remember now. What was this   yeah, I did have. What  was this? I can   t think of the name. I tell you, sometimes I can   t  remember. I didn   t read Gone with the Wind. I saw it on movie. What is  this? I can   t remember really   which one it was. I sure would. I liked to  read.  Finchum You saw Gone with the Wind at the movie theater?  23  Hopson Oh, yeah.  Finchum Here in Tulsa?  Hopson Yes. Mostly forgotten, you know, but I saw it. I used to go to the  movies whenever I had spare time. My jobs, I couldn   t go a lot, but  when it came on movies, oh, that was great because I   d be home, and  I   d watch it.  Bishop Well, I want to know if you have a philosophy of life or a motto you live  by?  Hopson Somebody that I like, to do something that I like, or something to do. I  don   t quite get you. What does he mean?  Bishop Do you have a motto in life that you live by or a philosophy?  Hopson A model that I live by? I don   t know nobody. Really, I don   t. I don   t do  it because I want to do that. I do something because I want to try that.  That   s the way I live.    I think I   ll do so and so and so and so. I think I  do so and so,    not,    I don   t want to go.    I had to beat her into doing it.  My daddy wouldn   t let me dance, and I just loved to dance. My  husband, when I married him, he wouldn   t let me go to dances. I   d wait  until he   d go to sleep in his time and slip out there. Me and my sister  had the best time. We had to get us a quarter though. It had to be a  quarter.  Bishop Where would you go dancing?  Hopson Oh, they had these little dances. He wouldn   t think his daughter would  go, no. That   s when you don   t trust kids because you ain   t going to  stand over them all the time unless they get caught, and then you   ll  know. Seeing is believing. If right now I could go, and I have all my  children, a beautiful beautician, I would open one. I could sit there and  take in the money, and they could do the work. Now, I would do that. I  don   t know whether they would like that or not. They probably  wouldn   t like it. They stood over me and watched me do it.  Bishop Is that on your bucket list?  Hopson Yeah, I guess so.  Finchum You were living in Tulsa during the Civil Rights Movement and all of  that. Do you have anything to say about that, during the Civil Rights  period in the    60s?  24  Hopson Oh, you know one thing. I   m a funny person. My mind is my own. I use  the way I feel. I   m not with that because it   s not right. The best man  win. That   s what I say. I pray to God that when it comes it   ll be for the  right things. It doesn   t have to be my thing. My thing might not be right.  My little eleven-year-old grandson, he says,    Do you read the Bible?        Yes, I read the Bible.    He said,    I   ve read the Bible all the way  through, two or three times. I don   t believe a thing the Bible say. I  believe some of the things in there, but if all the things in there was like  that, it wouldn   t be no world. It   d be a jam session.    (Laughs)  I think the best man win. That   s what I believe, and if you   re right,  sometimes God will go fix for it you. Sometimes if you   re wrong, he  won   t do nothing for you. I don   t know. I work hard for myself. That   s  all I try. I just do for myself. I try to work out, and I try to be good to  everybody, so if I need them again, I   ll knock on the door, and they   ll  open it and let me in. That fair enough?  Finchum That   s fair enough.  Hopson My kids wouldn   t get married. Her daddy can hire anybody he wanted  to come after his Australia, but, boy, she just so happy she started  crying, and happy and hugging and kissing me and,    My Australia   s  here.    You know that made me feel good, and then everybody loved  her. They loved her because Australia was good to her. That was it.  Bishop Well, when history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Hopson When what?  Bishop How do you want to be remembered? How do you want others to  remember you?  Hopson Oh.    I wonder what she did.    I don   t know myself. I leaned on the  Lord. I don   t know. He guided me. I go to bed at night asking him to  guide me, help me over the pass, lead me around the bad places so I  won   t touch them and hurt myself. I   d say,    Help me build myself  because, God, I know you   re going to make me pay for the bad things  that I done, but just open my heart and let me in where I can be  recognized that somebody tried to live part of the right life, if not all of  it.    That   s all I can say. I can   t make Him, but I sure wish he would.  Then I   d say,    Let me see if there   s something that I   ve overlooked.     I   m trying to search.    Search me, Lord,    I say, but I   ve looked so many  places, I haven   t got the answer yet. I don   t know what   s going to  happen. I got a long time to think. I don   t know what   s going to happen.  I sure don   t. I just don   t know.  25  Finchum I don   t think any of us do, so     Hopson Some,    Good things happened to her,    I said,    Do they mean me?    Yes,  sir.  Finchum Well, is there anything else you want to add before we close?  Hopson Well, I appreciate y   all coming today, and I hope this will open my eyes  if I   m not doing the right thing. Let me try to do the right thing and just  put a little thing down there in front of me, and I   ll open up a little  pathway so I can crawl. Sometimes we got to crawl. They say Jordan,  and I hope so because I have accomplished quite a bit to be an old lady.  I don   t want riches and all because I wouldn   t know what to do with it. I  want just enough to fix me so I can be able to hold out until the end. My  grandmother was eighty-eight years of age when she passed away. I   ve  outlived her, what, eight years? I was eighty-eight   oh, by twenty-some  years. She had a good time with that eighty-eight, and my auntie didn   t  take it away from her. That   s it.  Finchum Well, thank you for sharing your stories with us today. It   s great.  Hopson It   s a lot that   s happened that I can   t remember. As it come to me, I try  to give them true facts. If my daddy had let me go ahead on and sign my  right way through, well, I probably wouldn   t know some of the things  that I could do, and then maybe I didn   t need to do them. I   m satisfied.  That   s all I can say, is I   m satisfied.  Finchum You   re satisfied. Well, I   m satisfied, too. Thank you.  ------  -------
