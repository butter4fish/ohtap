Speaker 2: I kind of go back to some of the stuff that my mother and father used to talk about.  And one that sticks with me is if there's a will, there's a way.  And that's kind of has been my guiding light.  You know, it kind of starts the process, if you got the will.  Then there's a way to get it done.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, indeed.
Story_ID: 99838
Speaker 1: Now, we'll get into your family history.  Please tell me about your mother; her name, first of all?
Speaker 2: Thelma McBride.
Speaker 1: Would you spell her name, please?
Speaker 2: T-H-E-L-M-A, Thelma McBride.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mom was born in little town outside of Savannah called Pier Point or Pin Point; something like that, Georgia.  We would never be quite sure of the name, but it was close to Savannah.  And, you know, her mother and father, of course, eventually moved away, but--you know, that's another whole story, but that's where she was born.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year she was born?
Speaker 2: 1919.  1919.  March 12th, 1919.
Speaker 1: And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Savannah and South Carolina; that whole coastal area over there.  Primarily, South Carolina, Savannah; around in there.
Speaker 1: So would you say that your family has a Gullah background--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, not so much Gullah, but what we call Geechee.  Yeah, that coastal area between Savannah and parts of South Carolina, the accent is very much akin to Caribbean, you know.  Eat a lot of rice, you know, a lot of seafood, do a lot of fishing and things like that.
Speaker 1: What do you know about your mother's background; her growing up, her experiences?
Speaker 2: You know, not a whole lot.  Some of the things that she used to tell us because she used to kind of sit us around and tell us stories being brought up in the country and having to struggle, you know, with her father.  I think her father was some kind of--I want to say logger or something like that.  It seemed like he did some work like that.  And seem like they also lived on several places, different--I want to call them plantations or whatever in the early days.  And she talked about moving from one to another, and working on those places, you know.  She always tells us stories--somewhere they lived at--the father had to sit out when they were out in the yard playing with his shotgun, and I don't remember what that was for, but seemed like he would be watching over them with his shotgun on his lap or something to that effect.  But--so they were brought up somewhere around in the coastal Georgia, South Carolina area, primarily.  Her mother and father--actually, her mom and her dad had pretty much, like, half Indian or something.  Had a lot of Indian in him, and so did her mother.  So -- and I'm not sure how they got together.
Speaker 1: I see.  And Is your mother still living?
Speaker 2: No, my mother is deceased.
Story_ID: 99839
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: He's deceased.
Speaker 1: And his name, please?
Speaker 2: Edward McBride.  He was from Dawson, Georgia, which is south Georgia and he had moved to Savannah [Georgia] as a young man, met my mom [Thelma McBride], and they got married.  But his hometown is Dawson, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Will you spell his name for us, please?
Speaker 2: E-D-W-A-R-D, Edward McBride, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did they meet?  Do you know around when?  Around the year?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I do know that they were married for about thirty years; somewhere around that, but I'm not sure when they met, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know very much about his background as a boy growing up in Dawson, Georgia; his stories that he used to tell you?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  Not a lot.  His mother was Mary McBride, his father was Cecil (ph.) McBride.  And, of course, as a young man growing up in Dawson, Georgia, he did the normal, I guess, kind of work, you know, in the fields.  His mom was a very hard driven lady.  Really, what I call the leader of the family type, you know.  And she was a person who worked in the fields, she believed in saving her money, they had a nice little house.  I remember when I was a kid and going there, I used to always think that gram mom had it going on, you know.  But she did it old fashioned way.  I mean, she used to do the washing for people and picked the cotton, and that sort of thing.  But even with that kind of a means of earning a living, she did pretty good.
Speaker 1: This is your gram mom, Mary?
Speaker 2: My grandma, yeah.  Grandma Mary.
Speaker 1: And can you describe her life?  What do you remember most about her and what she instilled in you?
Speaker 2: You know, grandma Mary was the one person in the family whenever there was any kind of difficulty that you couldn't solve, you always call grandma Mary.  Somebody having a problem, mom in the hospital, dad having some issues with something; whenever we couldn't take care of it, it was always call grandma Mary, and she would come on the next bus, you know.  And she would come, you know, with the money down in here, and handkerchief, and all that stuff, but a real take charge person.  And I think seeing her do that over the years, instill some values, some things in me.  In fact, I know that I became the grandma Mary of the family, you know, later in the life.  But I always admired the fact that she was such a take charge person, and that she was no nonsense, you know, and that was something that stuck with me.
Story_ID: 99840
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in Savannah [Georgia] in the 1940s, late 40s, early 1950s?
Speaker 2: We were, you know, we lived in a place called the sugar refinery and so it was a mill town.  A mill, it was a local mill, and you had the housing that was owned by the refinery and the workers lived in the housing, company housing.  Not all of the workers, just some of the workers.  The neighborhood was a neighborhood of thirty-seven houses, and the reason I know there's thirty-seven, because it started from one to thirty-seven, and we were--our house was number was 237.  They started from 200 to 237.  And you lived right next to the factory.  Then you had--you had a black side on one side of the track and a white on another side of the track.  And you got to stay with your friends for a long time.  We moved there at age four.  I was about four years old.  And you got to grow up with a group of people, and you play with the same group of people every day.  So what it did was, it created a bond--almost like we were all brothers and that we were all kin.  So when we went to school, you couldn't fight without fighting the other one.  So we had this kind of bond that we had in school and as a result of, of, it was a result of just that growing up period where, you know, there wasn't that much turnover in terms of people going and coming.  But I would say that it was a happy time, you know.  I can remember being very happy as a child, because we had a lot of room to roam, a lot of games to play and whatever season it was, we played according to the season, and you had a lot of friends.  And you can run back and forth to each other's homes.  There was no, what we call, quarters.  You had a little store in the corner, you know.  And it was out in the country, in effect.  And so I, I was pretty happy, you know, as a child.  And I remember just enjoying my childhood, you know.
Story_ID: 99841
Speaker 1: And what did your father [Edward McBride] do at the sugar refinery?
Speaker 2: He was just a laborer.  When I say, "just a laborer," that was kind of--there was some lessons there too, because I remember him coming home and talking about the, you know, the difficulties of the job.  And expressed some frustrations about not being able to move up and stuff like that.  But he was a laborer.  They had something called the bull gang that he worked in, and I think that essentially was that they moved things in and did a little odd jobs around the place, you know.
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Thelma McBride] work at all outside the home?
Speaker 2: My mom, she did off and on.  You know, she did a lot of domestic work.  Again, you know, as a child that was an observation that I made.  I could remember her having to carry the load, you know, of the family for different reasons and coming home with the grocery, you know, on a Saturday afternoon, making $15 a week.  As a matter of fact, it was $12.  You know, earning $12 a week and then she got up to $15 a week, going to work every day, you know.  And working in someone else's home and then coming home and trying to feed us, you know.  And as a child that, that's something always stuck with me and it sort of motivated me to want to do some things early on, but--and then I think she did work at the local mill for a short period of time.  But, again, my mom was the person who was--between my mom and my dad, was the real responsible one, you know.  She was the person that really kind of kept the family together.  She was there all the time.  She tried to do the best she could, you know, to give you as good a living that she could give you.
Speaker 1: Mm hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 99842
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: There were eight of us total.  Two sisters and six--and five other brothers that was brought up in that household, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Starting my oldest was Earl, and the next to him was Willie, then my sister Rosalie, Bernice; I was the fifth child, and then my brother, Garfield; my brother, Eddie; my brother, Richard, yeah.
Speaker 1: And are your brothers and sisters, for the most part, still living?
Speaker 2: The two older ones are deceased; Earl and Willie are deceased.  The rest of them are still living--oh, Richard is deceased.  The baby is deceased, yeah.  So there are five of us left.
Speaker 1: And where are your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: My two sisters are in Savannah [Georgia] and one brother; my brother, Eddie, lives in Savannah.  My brother, Garfield, works here with me in this business.  As a matter of fact, I moved him from Detroit [Michigan] in 1981 when I had him in products, and he's been with me ever since.  So we kind of grew up together and, you know, we were separated for years and so when I got the opportunity to bring him back down here, it was something that I did and so he's still works with me, yeah.
Story_ID: 99843
Speaker 1: You mentioned something a few minutes ago is intriguing.  You said that you used to play games according to the season.  Could you tell me a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if it's wintertime, you're going to play football; springtime, you're going to play baseball and somewhere in between, you play basketball.  That's what I'm talking about.  Also, we created games in our neighborhood.  We would, we would improvise, and we had a game we called striking out where you would be up against the steps, and they had wooden houses set off the ground and you had to use brick steps, and we would create a game based on the ability to hit the ball.  It was everything designed around trying to be better at what you were doing.  And so when we couldn't get to the ball diamond, for instance, we would in a shade, you know, practice, you know.  We, we, we developed this team called the Sugar Refinery Braves as a young boy.  I mean, thirteen, fourteen years old.  We were very good, and I think we won the championship or something like that.  It was sandlot baseball at the time, but we organized ourselves.  We were considered the country boys, but we had a lot of time to practice.  And there wasn't a whole a lot of stuff that you can get into out there anyway.  It's not like they had a bunch of stores around or a bunch of stuff that you can go do.  You really didn't.  There was one little store in the corner, you know, and you had the ball field and stuff like, and you had a playground and so when it was too hot, we would, you know, just improvise.  But, yeah, we played whatever season there was, we were doing it, you know.  We even organized relay races and all kinds of races up and down the street, and so we were very competitive, you know, among ourselves.  But surprisingly, we did very little fighting among ourselves.  We didn't fight each other, you know.  We got along, you know.  Occasionally, you would have something, but for the most part, we got along.
Story_ID: 99844
Speaker 1: Now, during the time that you were growing up in the late 40s [1940s], 50s [1950s], time of the Jim Crow South segregation, you mentioned that on the one side of the sugar refinery community were blacks, on the other side of the track were whites.  Were there ever any altercations--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: -- any tensions?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things do you recall --
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: --about that period?
Speaker 2: You know, we, you know, as we, as we were growing up we knew of kids on other sides of the track that was about our age, you know.  And, you know, occasionally there would be something that would happen.  We also occasionally got together and actually played ball, you know.  But in terms of the altercations, I could remember, and I'm not sure, what, what, what caused it, but I remember we used to go for these walks during the summer and there was a long drive coming down into the sugar refinery, I guess, it was maybe a quarter of a mile long.  And out to the highway was, you know, Highway 17 and for whatever reason as kids, we used to together as a group and walk out to Highway 17.  That was something we did, just a walk, you know.  And you remember--by that time, I guess, the little white kids were driving, because we were all about thirteen, fourteen, fourteen; somewhere around there.  And I could remember them driving their cars and then throwing nails out of the cars on us.  And of course, you know, we would yell obscenities and stuff like that.  They would yell some back, for no reason.  But for me, it was, it was, it was an act that was unforgivable, you know.  And I could remember getting with my brother, Garfield--and these same kids used to come into the neighborhoods to deliver the paper, and I knew that.  So, you know, and there was this train track between us, and so--and it would come in the afternoon and that train would be switching back and forth, and there was a fence and then you had the track.  And so one day, we caught them in--right there where that train track was where they couldn't go forward, and they couldn't come back to us and they were on their little motor bike and we had a bucket of rocks.  And so we just tried--we pelted them with the rocks, you know, and of course we were trying to, you know, knock their heads off, so to speak.  But I think of all of the kids in my neighborhood, I think my brother and I was the only one that took some action against them, and that didn't turn out to be good because as a result of that, you know, you live in company housing.  So the word got back that my father [Edward McBride], they called him chick (ph.), chick children who had attacked these white boys.  Now, they don't know why we attacked these white boys, but we attacked these white boys, and we were told that because we attacked these white boys, we did this terrible thing that we had to be moved.  So they threw us out.  They wanted to throw us out of the quarters, and someone, and I don't remember who, before it was time for us to move, which was a terrible thing, reversed it.  Someone in the hierarchy of the sugar refinery; some official, somehow they got to the bottom of it and realized what happened.  They threw the nails on us first, and we were getting them back.  And so I went from what was a sad period to a very happy period, because we were given a reprieve.  But, of course, my father warned me that we shouldn't do things like that.  But I think that coming up as a kid, you know, even though it was segregated south, I didn't have fear of what was going to happen to me.  My, my father kind of taught us that you didn't pick at anyone, but if anyone messed with you, you had a right to do something back to them.  And that's the way he lived his life, you know, and so we were--we were just fulfilling that, you know.  Because we didn't start the fight, but it wasn't something that we could run away from because it happened to be white kids, you see.  So I didn't have that fear growing up, and I think a lot of it comes from my father, because he didn't have that fear, you know, he wasn't afraid of anyone.  He wasn't even, he wasn't the person that was out there leading the charges as far as integration was concerned, but certainly he didn't back away from any fights, you know.
Story_ID: 99845
Speaker 1: And he [Edward McBride] had lots of occasions that he got into different things, you know, on the job and, you know, things like that.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Can you recall one incident that may have occurred?
Speaker 1: Well, he--his foreman, you know, they didn't get along because the foreman would take the workers to his place to work for nothing.  My father wouldn't, wouldn't do that, you know, and he just wasn't going to go work for you for, as he would say, "drink of liquor," you know, and so the two of them didn't really get along.  So there was always friction, you know, between them.  And he is strange, because my father was known as a real worker.  The one who really would do the work to get the job done, but he was a very proud person.  And I think that while he had some other kinds of faults, one of the things that I took from that as a child, and that's why I said I grew up not being afraid, because I never was concerned about anyone harming us, because I always felt that my father would protect us, you see.  So as a result of that altercation with his foreman, eventually, he did lose his job as a result of it.  And, of course, it created quite a bit difficulty for us after he lost the job at late in the forties or something like that.  In his forties and unable to find another one.  And that was considered, you know, a really a good job at the time.  But it was all based on the fact that they didn't get along because he would just not be used, you know.  And I remember one other occasion when we were quite young.  We did a lot of planting.  We didn't have a farm, you had a garden, so to speak.  And my father had a, had a horse, you know.  To, to plow with, and he would not loan his horse to this white guy for free.  You know, he wouldn't let him have his horse, and we had a barn and he kept the horse in, and he was really what I called a family man at the time.  And we used to work in the garden, work in the field, and that sort of stuff, and plant all kinds of stuff and harvest it.  And as a result of not loaning his mule to this white man, he--we always believed the white man poisoned the mule.  We found the mule dead.  So, so, so, so, the white guy poisoned the mule.  We knew that.  The mule just, you know, the mule died and they suspected that was he who did it.  But it changed my father.  It changed him, because he went from being this person who was this family man who's around the house, who was doing all these things -- and there was another area called the garden road where they really did drink liquor, and they did sell it in the houses to go into the garden road.  So he went from this person who was there with us to a person who was in the street.  And I always attributed to that frustration as a result of him killing his mule early on.  And so I always felt that he turned to that because he wasn't like that, you know.  And, I don't know, I guess you can say to survive the system at the time.
Story_ID: 99846
Speaker 1: After your family left the sugar refinery community, where did you go, where did you live?
Speaker 2: Tough times.  Tough times.  Because eventually, I don't know what happened, but we were forced to move eventually.  We were, as kids, considered aggressive and, and considered bad kids because we would retaliate, like I said.  And we moved to another part of Savannah [Georgia].  We went from having indoor plumbing to outdoor plumbing.  The house that we moved in, to didn't have, you know, bath facilities and things like that.  So that was a whole shock for us.  By that time, I would say about fifteen, about fifteen years old and father [Edward McBride] lost his job.  And he lost--by the way, he lost his job and I remember the night that that happened.  He was, he was, there was having this feud on the job, he came home late one night, and we were living in this house, like I said, without outdoor, indoor plumbing and stuff, and I remember sitting up in the bed, because he drove from the yard and the police drove up behind him.  And the police said to him, "show me your license?"  And he said, "what for?"  And the guy said, "show me your license?"  And he said, "tell me what you want to see my license for?  What did I do?"  And the policemen just insisted on him giving him the license.  So, he said, "man, listen, I'm at home.  I didn't do anything.  I'm going in my home house."  He came on in the house.  Of course, he woke up everybody.  And the cop kind of backed out of the yard with his spot light on the house, called for backup and treated as if it was a major crime.  My father got tired of this, this constant calling him out, you know, on the speaker on, you know, "McBride come out."  Like he was a criminal.  So at that point in time, he really was going to hurt this cop.  Like, I said, my father was not afraid.  And he took his knife -- and he had his knife in his pocket, and he was eating this piece of this chicken.  He was walking towards this cop, and we were all afraid.  Because we were standing back, we were watching this scene.  The cop got a gun, he got this shotgun down like this, and he was walking towards him with the chicken, and all he wanted to do is get his hands on him, and we knew that, you know.  And so before he can get to the cop, the rest of them came, and all of them--by the time the rest of them came, and then this one became emboldened with his shotgun and shot down on the ground and, of course, they arrested him and handcuffed him and found a knife in the pocket that kind of thing.  And the report back to the job was this incident, and of course because of this incident, they wanted to move him from whatever he was--he, he actually quit the job.  He just said, "give me my time."  And so that's, that's kind of what happened, and so we--he ended up losing that job and then from that point on, just kind of working at different, different jobs.  But eventually--he found a decent job.
Story_ID: 99137
Speaker 1: You were telling me about the incident with your father [Edward McBride], and his confrontation with the police.  Can you just conclude that then before we go on.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  He--like, I said, he was--my father was not an educated person, but he was a very proud person, and as a result of that confrontation, when all that got back to the job, they were going to remove him, put him some other group or something that he didn't like.  We always suspected that the foreman kind of set him up, that the cop was sitting there waiting and for whatever reason.  They never did tell him what they were going to arrest him for, but they charged him with resisting arrest.  We don't know resisting what arrest.  But anyway, he eventually got out of the, you know, the trouble so to speak and being a proud person with nowhere to go, he quit the job.  And as a result of quitting that job, then, of course, he had to start all over at the age of, probably, fifty--somewhere forty-five, fifty years old with no education.  And, of course, the only jobs available was, you know, mediocre kind of things that he can do.  Eventually, he did get a job as a longshoreman, you know, later in life.  But by that time, I had finished high school.  You know, I think the three years from age, maybe, fifteen to eighteen was probably the roughest for us as a family because, at least, when we lived in the sugar refinery, you know, he had a good job, everything was taken care of and that sort of thing.  But after we left the sugar refinery, we saw pretty hard times.  But, again, you know, those periods kind of served to furthermore me, you know, in terms of wanting to do something in life.  Didn't know what, but wanting to do something and wanting to lead the family out of that, you know.  And I remember the night of the, the night of the arrest, I could remember my brother, Garfield, who was a lot like my father and he was considered more hotheaded, wanting to charge the policeman.  And I remember my standing back thinking, "one of these days, one of these days."  You know, things are going to be better than this, you know.  While I wouldn't charge the policeman, my, my thought was, my thought was there in terms of better times, you know, and that's kind of the way I, I chose to deal with it.  So doing all those--during those years, my mind was always on, "I'm going to do better than this."  You know, "And we're going to have a better life."  You know, and so that kind of helped to mold it and guide me, I would like to think, throughout life, you know.
Story_ID: 99138
Speaker 1: And your education, in terms of school, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to Woodville Elementary School who later became Tompkins High School; one school for twelve years.  Woodville turned into Tompkins, of course.  And so I did my elementary school at Woodsville and my--and the rest of it at Tompkins.  There were two high schools in Savannah [Georgia], black high schools, at the time.  I did not go--I went to a segregated high school, of course.  And you either went to Tompkins or you went to Beach.  Later, they created another high school called Sol C. Johnson.  I've always marveled at the fact that we had to pass all these white schools to get to this black one, and to later in life for them to talk about neighborhood schools and not bussing kids when they bus me to the segregated one, you see.  But, yeah, and those school years, I think, what I remember about those school years early on; first, second and third grade.  First, second grade, we had two sessions, by the way.  We had the double sessions; we either went in the morning or you went in the evening.  Well, for the first two years of life, of school life, I was in the morning.  And the morning was considered good, because you got out of school at 12 o'clock.  You had the rest of the day to play, you know.  And third grade, they put me in the afternoon.  Well, my friends were in the morning.  Well, I didn't really like that.  And I think it, it--I changed somewhat because I became more rebellious and, and, okay.  I got through the third grade, and I figured for sure you can't do it to me again in the fourth grade.  There should be some kind of rotation here, you know.  And so they did the same thing.  They put me the in the afternoon in the fourth grade, and my good friend was in the morning; and I felt discriminated against.  I felt that all of us that had suffered through that before shouldn't do that this following year.  They should rotate, you know.  Plus, I felt that the, the kids whose mothers and fathers was involved with the PTA, they managed to be in the morning.  Whereas, my mother [Thelma McBride] and father [Edward McBride] were not involved with the school, so I was in the afternoon.  So I felt some discrimination there.  But I also remember early in school, second grade, for instance, where the entrepreneur in me started to come out.  I learned that I knew to work, so therefore if I finish my paper, I'll charge somebody else a nickel to do theirs.  And so I would charge, thinking lesser kids--slower kids, "I'll do your paper for a nickel."  You know, so I had me a little side hustle.  You know, I kind of do mine and theirs.  But when I got to third grade, because of the rebellion, I kind of flip flopped because I became disgruntled kid.  And I don't think people understood what was happening with me at the time.  And so I was purposely being put out of school, so I could go home, you know.  And, like I said, I, you know, really gotten into trouble in the third and the fourth grade.  And those years, as a matter of fact, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, even to a certain extent sixth grade, before they put me back in the morning.  I got all the way to sixth grade, you know.  I was in the afternoon all those years, and I was rebelling all those years, and I missed a lot because I was constantly being kicked out of school, you know.  And I didn't get back on track, until I got to, maybe, seventh grade.  There were some things that happened made me decide to straighten up, you know, and to try to get it together, you know.

Speaker 1: There's always something in life that seem to motivate you, you know.  And for me, there were a couple of things.
Speaker 2: What were those things?
Speaker 1: Well, one was, when I was very young, like I said, when we lived in the sugar refiner, I was a momma's boy, and I always tried to take care of my mom [Thelma McBride] and she seemed like she always worked so hard, and neither my mom nor my father [Edward McBride] was educated, you know.  And I wanted to, as a young age, make life better for them, and that was driving me, you know.  And I remember we were coming from downtown, you know.  Back then, you have all the kids in the back seat, and mom and dad up front, and you're coming from shopping or whatever.  And I had made a promise to my mom that I was going to build her a house, and I told her that in confidence, you know, "I'm going to build you a house one day."  And, like I said, I used to stay in the house with her a lot, you know, just combing her hair and whatever was going on, watching her cook, or whatever.  And then coming from downtown, she told my father.  And I was in the back seat and I heard her say, "Cornell said, he's going to build us a house one day."  And my father, "Oh, yeah."  And she said, "Yes.  And he's saving his money," and true enough, I had me a can and I started saving me--my pennies, 'cause I'm going to build them a house.  I'm going, I'm going--we're going to get out of, you know.  We're going to do better than this.  And I just remember her saying that to him.  Well, anyway, that was kind of always in the back of my mind, even as I grew up, and those years that I kind of got off track, where I was rebelling, I remember an incident in my neighborhood, where I considered one of the leaders among the group, you know.  If you play ball, I'm going to be the first, or second, or third person picked.  You know, that kind of thing.  Or I'm going to pick the team, or whatever.  And there was this little guy who had a lot of mouth, and was considered to be very bright, and I think they might have--they went to Catholic School, we went to public school.  And we would be teasing, and one day he found my weak spot, and he said to me, he used to word, "nigger."  He said, "nigger."  You know, how we call each other, and he said, "You're so dumb, that you can't even spell dictionary."  And he was telling the truth.  I could not spell dictionary, and I was in about sixth grade, you know.  And as a result of that, I had to back down, you know.  I had to back down from that confrontation, and I had to do it in a way that no one knew that I couldn't spell dictionary.  So I had to pretend I understood, and kind of, you know, smooth it out and that kind of stuff and still maintain my, my self esteem in, in that confrontation.  But, first chance I got, I went and found a dictionary and learned how to spell dictionary.  Okay.  That was the first thing I did, and as a result of that, I deliberately days later came back and picked that argument with him again, because I knew--he would ask me again, and I had to, I had to respond in the front--in front of everyone else.  And so when he did, I was able to spell dictionary, but I also made another promise to myself; that I would change my ways, that I was going to pay attention to my books, that I had made this promise and how I'm going to accomplish this if I don't really start doing something.  So, as a result, of him telling me that, I mean, I really taught myself to--I could hardly read at the time--to read, to write, to whatever, because I would--I just literally taught myself how to, how to spell and, and start paying attention.  And by the time I got to seventh grade, I went into seventh grade on fire.  Really trying to get it together, and that was the beginning of my whole high school thing where of turning myself around.  But the guiding light for me has always been trying to do something, to build this house for my mom and dad, and trying to uplift the family.
Story_ID: 99140
Speaker 1: Along the way, especially in high school, were there teachers that you recall who influenced you, who spurred you along, provided role models?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, we had a couple of coaches that did that for me; Coach Turner, Coach Speed (ph.).  Coach Speed taught, I think, health or something like that, and he was kind of a no nonsense guy, and I always admired him, you know, and he, he had the ability to relate to us as kids, but he was always known as a, as a good tough teacher, you know.  And, of course, Coach Turner was the football coach, you know, everyone sort of looked up to.  And then in agriculture, there was a Mr. Blunt.  He was the agriculture teacher.  Mr. Blunt, was again, a no nonsense kind of person, really concerned with trying to help you along, trying to, you know, guide you in every way that he could.  He was in charge of the debating teams and all of that sort of stuff, and he was always taking--I was not on the debating team, but taking kids around to these different debates and that sort of stuff.  I remember wanting to be a, a farmer, you know.  And so I went into agriculture.  As a matter of fact, I think I got kicked out of shop.  I think I got kicked out of shop for something.  Anyway, I went to agriculture.  And I was going to build me a chicken brooder, and that's when I encountered Mr. Blunt, because he was known as a tough guy.  But I found that he wasn't just tough, that he was a fair guy.  And under his guidance, and I think again I made some adjustments in terms of my own education, and it took me all year, but I finally built this chicken brooder, but back then I wanted to be a chicken farmer.  That was one of the first ambitions I remember having, beyond wanting to be a sports figure.  Of course, I thought I was going to be great baseball player before that.  But I wanted to be this farmer and Mr. Blunt--I was able to really kind of get into a little bit of more and to learn a whole lot about raising chickens and chicken farms and that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 99141
Speaker 1: And so you at that time had the aspiration of becoming a chicken farmer?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you recall where that vision of yourself originated?
Speaker 2: You know, I think, I think, it goes back--it went to the first and second grade.  I think it went back to those Dick and Jane stories where it seemed like it was such fun to go out and gather these eggs, but in agriculture, of course, I learned a little bit more about it from the standpoint of how did they did it, and, you know--and I was fascinated as to how they did it.  You know, and I was fascinated as to how they did--you know, they manipulate the lighting so that the chicken could lay twice as many eggs in less time, and all that sort of stuff.  And the large chicken farms that was around, you know, for some reason, I just thought that that was the thing that I wanted to do, was be this big farmer if I couldn't be a professional ball player, then maybe I can just be a farmer, you know.  But in the end, it was about being an entrepreneur, you know, because one of the things that I said as a result of watching my father [Edward McBride] go through his frustration on the job was, I use to use the term, "I didn't want to work for anybody.  I want to work for myself."  I didn't know the term entrepreneur, but as a small child I came up with this thought of I want to work for myself.  I want to be self-employed, you see.  And so this was a means of my doing that.  So everything I did in life after that, those early years, was always designed for me to work for me, you know.  And so I, I think the chicken farm thing was just a result of that, you know.  I saw it as a way of working for myself.
Story_ID: 99142
Speaker 1: In high school, you also played ball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played a little bit of football.  I was too small to do much with that.  Besides, my father [Edward McBride] used to--he didn't see much benefit in us staying around school playing ball, because they--he said they didn't pay him for us to work, I mean, and they were making money on us and so why didn't give the parents some money or something--and so, he might be ahead of his time in that, but (laughter), but there's a lot of truth there.  But anyway, so when I--until I got to about junior high school, I think I was a junior before he let me stay and actually, you know, the entire season.  And I wasn't, wasn't very large.  I was 150 pounds trying to play tight end or something, you know.  So I wasn't big, and there was a lot of big guys around.  So I wasn't very good, but my sport was baseball.  I thought I was going to be the greatest baseball place, and I thought I was emulating Satchel Paige and that sort thing.  And he says, you know, do a lot of what Satchel Paige did; using a cigarette pack as a plate to, you know, with the catcher and all that kind of stuff.  And so that's kind of what I did as a child.  I wanted to be like Satchel Paige.  So baseball was more my sport.  I played more baseball in high school than football.
Story_ID: 99143
Speaker 1: You talked about a couple of influential teachers.  Were there any other people in the community, aside from your parents and your grandmother, who played that role, as well?  Did you, for instance, attend church and were there people in that venue?
Speaker 2: We didn't really go--I went to Sunday school, yes.  There's two things.  I want to speak of them separately.  I'm going to come back to the church part.  But the other influence in me was my uncle, my Uncle Johnnie Will (ph.), was--he, he was a business person.  And he had a dry cleaners.  As a matter of fact, he had several dry cleaners and my Uncle Johnnie would always had a pocket full of money, you know.  And he had, you know, he had a couple--he had three boys.  And so whenever we went to visit them, and you know, you--back then, you went to your cousin's house a lot.  You know, it was like you spend the night over there and that sort of stuff.  And I would go with him on the truck, you know, to deliver the clothing.  And the neighborhood back then, you would deliver the clothing from the, from the truck, you know, the dry cleaning, and if the person didn't have the money, you would take the ticket off and bring it back to him, and he would put it on their charge.  So I always admired him, because he was running his own business, you know, and he had a lot of money, you know, and he had independence, and that's why--and I kind of liked that, too.  I learned later in life that I had another uncle prior to him who had done the same thing in the family.  He was an Uncle Will who had this wood yard, and ice company, and that sort of thing.  And so back in the family, there were entrepreneurs back in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s [1930s], including my Uncle Johnnie Will in the '50s [1950s] and stuff like that.  So I was influenced by him.
Story_ID: 99144
Speaker 1: Um, Sunday school, I mean, church rather, we didn't really go to church as--after my father [Edward McBride] sort of changed, turned out or whatever where he spent more time on Garden Road than he did at home, but my mom [Thelma McBride] was always home teaching us what she could, and, and, one of the things she taught us, and it's something I still do today, that is to pray every night.  And you had to get on your knees, you know, every night.  And so she would do that every night, and she would gather us around if it was a winter night and tell us stories.  And so church wasn't something we did as a family, but we lived the principles of church, you know, as a family.  And they taught those things, you know, while--so we didn't go to church.  But as I got a little bit older, I say, probably around ten or so--twelve whatever, there was a local guy named--we used to call--his name was Mr. Russell (ph.).  We used to call him Sonny boy (ph.), and he, he was the local vegetable person, very well.  And so he took it upon himself to pick up the neighborhood kids to take us to Sunday school at his church, and we would also go to Sunday school with him and then he would, he would pick us up and bring us back, you know.  And I learned so much in Sunday school, and, and whenever he came into the neighborhood on that truck, I would get on the truck to ride with him and so I learned a lot of, I would say, I learned about church from him, from Mr. Russell.  And because of the way he was, he was the type of person who seemed to be living it, rather than talking it, you know, and I always admired that in him, and so I think I got most of my church learning and understanding from Mr. Russell in the vegetable truck.
Speaker 2: And what was the name of the church that you attended?
Speaker 1: I think it was Clifton Baptist Church, I think.  It was Clifton Baptist Church, you know, that we attended, I believe.  There were two; one was Fair Long (ph.) and one was Clifton.  I think it was Clifton Baptist Church.  In fact, I went back to that church here a couple of years ago to visit.  The church still the same, folks still the same, and it was really a church of few, not a few, but quite of few families that had been going there for years, and it's probably been there a hundred years, you know.  Small church.  And they're still there, you know.  But--and Mr. Russell was still there, and Mr. Russell, he was not an ordinary Sunday school teacher, you know.  I mean, he really got deep into the Bible and--in Sunday school, you know.  And like I said, when you saw him out in the street, he was living it, as well.  He was all about helping you to, to be a better person, you know.  And, and even if I was tempted to go the other way, I would think about Mr. Russell, and think about Sundays school and think about, you know, what he would think, you know.  And so, he, he, had quite an influence on me, yeah.
Story_ID: 99145
Speaker 1: The end of your high school years, what year did you graduate from high school, first of all?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1961.  By the time I graduated from high school, it was--the thought was what am I going to do now, you know.  Because college wasn't in the cards.  I thought about going into the service, and then, of course, everyone was migrating was going north to New York.  And, ultimately, I opted for going north, you know.  But I can remember graduating from high school to be very sad, because I realized that this chapter of my life was coming to an end and I still had these promises building this house in the back of my mind and I still thought I could be a great baseball player, but now I had to--I was going--things were changing and, and I didn't want to--in my neighborhood, we had the big tree where folks set up--the folks set up, the folks who weren't in school would be under the big tree, and we played cards under there and when you come out of school, some of the ones who have come before you who weren't working would be under that tree.  Well, one of the things that I didn't want to happen and I made a, a promise to myself that I didn't want September to come.  I graduated in June and find me under the big tree.  That was my goal in life, that I wanted to get away from Savannah [Georgia] before September of 1961, and I did.  I got away, I left August 21st, 1961 on a Greyhound bus headed for New York, and I had accomplished the goal of not being under the big tree.  And I also felt that I would get stuck under the big tree.  You know, that a lot of the people there were there weren't going anywhere.  I saw that, I knew that, I understood that, you know.  And there were no jobs, you know, to speak of.  And not having--not, you know, going onto college or anything, what was left, you know.  And so I managed to get away.  And got to New York, and, of course, that was a whole different experience at age eighteen, you know.  Arriving in New York City (laughs).
Story_ID: 99146
Speaker 1: Were you going specifically for something?
Speaker 2: I was going to, to, you know--because I thought the streets were paved with gold and because I thought I was going to have a better life, and I thought I was going to get me a job, and I was going to prosper, and I was going to make all this money, you know.  I was going to do well.  After all, I had a high school diploma, you know, and so I thought that that would be my ticket, you know.  And still I had dreams of hopes of, of being a professional ball player and I thought up there maybe someone would discover me.  They just didn't discover me down south here, and so I had a lot of thoughts about, you know, going to New York to better myself, you know and so that's what New York meant to me.  You know, of course, I had relatives in New York.  My mom [Thelma McBride]'s mother and father whom I didn't grow up with, because they were in New York and I think I saw them infrequently, you know.  And so I got a chance to see them and to know that side of the family because all of them left the South in like the forties '40s [1940s] or something, and so we knew of them, but we didn't really know of them.  Occasionally, someone would come, you know, down south, you know, and we never did go, you know, up there.  So, I thought that everyone up north all my family was doing extremely well, because after all, they lived in New York, you know, and the streets are paved in gold, you know.  And you hear all these stories of how well folks are doing.  Well, to my surprise, I got up there and found they were doing worse than we were doing down south (laughter).  I was so disappointed, you know.  And they really didn't have room for me, you know.  They really didn't.  But I didn't know that, but I had written to them to say I'm coming and I assumed they knew I was coming.  They thought I was joking, you know.  And so when I showed up, I was a total surprise.  You know, a grandson coming up, and they already had a house full of kids from their children, you know.  And so I did have to improvise, and fortunately for me that I went up with two other guys; one of which had a sister that lived there and she was going to take him in.  Well, I felt so confident about my relatives that I was taking a friend even with me to stay with them, so--me and him going to stay with y'all, you know.  (laughter).  And so anyway, when it didn't work out with my relatives, my friend, Lawrence (ph.), he had a sister named Katy (ph.).  She took all three of us in and I will always be thankful for--to Katy, because Katy did not only took us in, but she was a mother to us.  She really was kind there to help you along the way, to make adjustments to living in New York, advising you.  She was older, but not that much older. I mean, we were nineteen; Katy, maybe, thirty.  You know.  And so--and she was married and everything.  And had a couple of kids and that sort of thing.  But Katy, for $8 a week; they washed our clothes and fed us, and the house was just--I spent about a year with Katy.  The house was just a barrel of fun.  It was really great being there.  I mean, it was always lively, you know, and the household.  And Katy had her ritual.  Katy didn't drink until the weekend.  Katy didn't go out unless over the weekend, you know.  And she had some girlfriends and she was, you know, living, the, the good life, you know.  And really that year was really a good time.  Really was a good time and I, I enjoyed that.
Speaker 1: Where did you work during that time?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, when I first went out looking for a job in New York, my friends tell me and kind of remember, we went down to the Empire State Building, and I was talking to my friend a couple of years ago.  We were in Savannah [Georgia].  I hadn't seen him in years.  One of the guys went up with me and he said, I will never forget going to the Empire State Building with you and looking for a job, and the man asked us what kind of job were we looking for, and you said to the man, you're looking for an executive job.  (laughter).  And so he said--we kind of laughed about it that, that even back then that I was looking for this job that was up here and I was ambitious.  And I just felt that I wanted more than I had--then I qualified for, but I was ambitious.
Story_ID: 99147
Speaker 1: And let's get back to your job in New York and your desire to have an executive position; could you tell me more about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, like I said, I told the guy at the Empire State Building, I wanted to have an executive position, and he said, you know, asked about background.  And, of course, I let him know I had a high school diploma, you know, and of course, that wasn't enough, so that's always been a joke among my friends.  But I was ambitious living in New York.  And my friend, one of the guys, his name was Lawrence (ph.); Lawrence, because of my ambition and because I would go looking for a job in a suit, thought I was a fool.  In fact, he nicknamed me fool, and so around the house, I became known as fool, you know.  This boy don't have any sense whatsoever.  No one saw it as ambition, they saw it as odd, crazy, that I would go downtown looking for a job in a suit, you know.  And so I, you know, I just thought I could do anything.  I had a lot of confidence, you know.  Eventually, I found a job in a pharmaceutical company.  Now, here's the irony, I ended up as a pharmacist, but I found a job in a pharmaceutical company.  And in New York, at the time, and I imagine they can still do it, you can buy a job.  You paid your $20, that's what it was, you go to this agency, and they would send you out on a job.  And so they sent me to this pharmaceutical company.  And as a matter of fact, before I got there, I was walking down the street with that same suit on in New York, somewhere in Manhattan [New York City, New York].  And I was going through this side street, and I didn't have any money except money to get back home, and I was passing this guy building dollies, and I went in there to ask him about work.  And the guy looked at me and, and we talked a little bit.  He hired me for one week to help him make dollies, and I did that and made enough money to go buy this job.  And--but he hired me based on my walking in there with my suit on and talking to him.  So, anyway, I got the job.  I go out for the interview, and I'm in this office, and the people give me a test.  Now, you had blacks and, and Hispanics working in this factory, primarily.  It was, it was a generic pharmaceutical company; we made basically, vitamins and stuff like that.  And all of the blacks worked in what we call formulation, mixing the stuff, and then you had a German guy in charge of the tablet room and the capsule, that sort of thing--the machines actually made that.  And there was another Hispanic guy in there; they were hiring me for a position in there, not to work on the machines, but to fill the hoppers, okay.  And they hired a white guy at the same time to teach him how to work on the machines and how to adjust it for the different tablets and stuff.  So when they gave me this test, I was in there and I was--and then it was math, a lot of math.  And I was trying to complete this test, trying to pass this test, and somewhere in the room there were a couple secretaries, and I heard them snickering because I'm looking at this like, "What the dickens?"  You know, I'm just out of high school, but I, I haven't seen this stuff.  And them snickering motivated me.  It said to me they think I can't pass this test.  And I remember sitting down and not remembering the form--you know, formulas for distance and all that kind of stuff, figuring out how to pass that test and passed the test.  And the guy, when he got the results, he was shocked that I passed the test and he put me in the tablet room. He gave me a job making tablets, but my job was only to fill the hoppers.  Well, as life would have it, the, the white guy, young guy, same--about age same as me, making a few more dollars than I was making, he quit.  You know, he quit, and after he quit, I not only had to fill the hoppers, but I learned to do his job too, so before long, I was running the place.  I could come in on Saturdays, run all of the machines, clean them, do everything, you know.  And so I learned how to adjust the machines, did all the stuff that they didn't think I could do within a year.  And after a year, I concluded that I wasn't making enough progress towards my life's dreams; after all, I was nineteen.  I turned nineteen, I'm an old man.  So then I decided you know what?  I ain't making it here, so I'm leaving New York.  And when I announced this in the household, the--my friend Lawrence, I, I was confirmed that I was a fool, that I didn't have no sense, that there was a war getting ready to go on because Vietnam--not Vietnam, Vietnam was going on, the Cuban missile crisis was the big issue.  And in face of the Cuban missile crisis and Vietnam, I concluded I ain't making no progress, I can go in the military, I can get me an education, you know, I got things to do, you know.  I joined the service.
Story_ID: 99148
Speaker 1: Before we get into your service experience, what was the name of that company, that pharmaceutical company you were working at?
Speaker 2: Davidson Edwards Pharmaceutical Company up in the Bronx [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: And you worked there from--
Speaker 2: I worked there actually, about a year, a little more than a year from--let's see, from maybe September through Oc--November of the following year.  Yeah, I worked a little more than a year there.  But like I said, after a year, I wasn't making enough progress. One other thing that happened, again, I was ambitious, okay.  They hired--they had this guy who was a black guy who was in charge of the manufacturing, a pharmacist, his name was Bernie (ph.).  And so Bernie and I--and I used to--and I went--by the way, I took the occasion when in New York to go back to high school to try to better myself, so I started going to the local high school at night taking courses.  I took typing.  I learned to type, and I took some math, and stuff like that.  So I would be sitting on the job studying, you know, and the rest of the guys would be sitting around talking, and carrying on, and, and Bernie always admired the fact that I always had me some books.  I'm trying to do something here, do some homework or something, so he would tease with me.  Bernie was the type of guy that related to us very well, and he--we would tease.  And so one day, Bernie and I teasing, and I said to Bernie, "Bernie,"--I think he was thirty-five and I was about nineteen.  I said, "By the time I'm your age, Bernie, thirty-five, I'm gonna be making twice as much money as you," you know.  And he just laughed.  We just laughed, you know, and laughed it off.  I think I got there.  I don't know what Bernie--where Bernie is or what he's doing.  Of course, you know, we--I went on a different direction, but I remember saying that to Bernie because again, I was ambitious, real ambitious.  Didn't know what, but I was ambitious.
Story_ID: 99149
Speaker 1: So around 1962, the era, the period, the Cuban missile crisis, Vietnam War, you enlisted?
Speaker 2: I enlisted in the [U.S.] Air Force.  I joined the Air Force the day the President [John F. Kennedy], I think, announced the blockade on Cuba.  I was headed to Lackland Air Force Base.  And again, in the household, my friends--I was confirmed as a complete fool because why would I leave New York?  You know, we was having a great time, making a little bit of money, working, and all that sort of stuff, but inside of me, I wasn't being fulfilled on the dream, the life dream that I had.  And I still had in the back of my mind of building my mom [Thelma McBride] this house.  You know, I made this promise, you know, and I'm gonna get them--build them this house. I really--my mind really never left down-home, in terms of what was behind me, you know?  And I had early on, wanted to be an example of what could happen if we went on and got education.  For instance, one of the reason I, I--well, I was the first one to finish high school, by the way, in the family.  And my father [Edward McBride] really wasn't big on education, you know.  He didn't see the family, at the time, he just thought you, you get a job and you go to work and that was it.  And I remember when I was a senior in high school, and we were struggling living in this little house and stuff, and he came through there one day, half drunk, and he said to me, you know, "Boy, what grade are you in?  You know, I need to take you with me to the pug wood."  He was cutting pug wood, at the time, and he was just trying to make more money.  And I said to him, "pug wood?"  This was like March, you know, I'm getting ready to graduate in June.  And I said, you know, "I'm in school."  He said, "What grade are you in?"  And I said, "twelfth."  And he was surprised I was in twelfth grade.  I was small, you know.  And so--and I said--he was--and he was mad because he wanted to take me out of school with him to cut pug wood, and I said to him, "Listen, in a few more months, I'm not gonna be here anyway.  I'm leaving."  And he got mad.  He got angry and he said, "Well, the door's open, why don't you just leave now?"  You know, but, but he, he bought me a suit.  He bought me a suit to graduate, yeah.   But--so I was, I was ambitious, you know.  I was real--I had thought of, of being successful, didn't know what, just didn't know what, you know.
Speaker 1: And were you an inspiration at all, for any of your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The rationale was that if I finish high school, the rest of them would see that, and they would finish too, and they did.  All of them finished after me, you know.  Once I did it, everybody else came behind me finished high school, you know.  And then I moved on and I started encouraging--there was one other brother, to go onto college, and because he was involved in integrating the schools in Savannah [Georgia] after me, my brother, Eddie.  And Eddie went to Groves High School and, you know, back then, they take one out of the black school, one or two and put them over here, he was one of those kids.  So, anyway, I encouraged him, I told him that I was the first to finish high school, that he should be the first to finish college.  And by that time, I was in the military, and he came back home because he left, and eventually, ended up at Savannah State [University, Savannah, Georgia] and he was the first one to finish college in the family at Savannah State.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: --And I later finished Fort Valley [State College, now Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia]--well, I didn't finish Fort, I finished Mercer [University, Atlanta, Georgia].

Speaker 1: Back to the military.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where were you stationed and what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Lackland [Air Force Base] for basic training, and to my surprise, everybody was running around getting ready for war, and I said to myself, "I didn't join for this.  You know, I don't want to fight, you know."  So, anyway, fortunately for me, when, when I went through my interview, the person interviewing me said to me, "Well, what do you want to do in life?"  My scores were highest in administrative, you know; mechanical, I'm nothing, and there was another area, I forgot what it was.  But, anyway, one of them was administration and that was where my scores were highest.  And I said, "Well, I want to be a coach."  And, you know, so I ended up as a coa--as, as a p--physical training instructor.  So my assignment was to lead basic training, go back to New York, of which I thought that going in military from New York they'd send me south.  I was trying to get south, you know.  So they sent me back to New York.  I ended up stationed at Plattsburgh, New York, Plattsburgh Air Force Base in New York as a physical training instructor.  And so, again, that kind of--it helped me now because what I got into early on is eating right, exercising, and all of those things, taking care of the body, and even today, you know, that stays with me because I still go to the gym, I still eat right, you know, and I've been able to be relatively healthy.
Story_ID: 99151
Speaker 1: When did you meet your wife [Harriet McBride]?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: High school.  We got, we got together in high school.  I was a, a senior, and she was a freshman, actually, and so we got together in high school.  We had our first--when I was left home--I was leaving home, she gets pregnant, so we had our first child out of wedlock.  And so I was in service by the time my first child was born--no, I was in New York, I hadn't gone to service yet, and then I went to the military service at the end of '62 [1962]; Sheila was born in May 13th of '62, and I went to service in November.  And then the following year, we got married, the following July 1st of '63 [1963], and I brought them to New York, yeah.  Well, they came to New York.  We--she--we got married in New York, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what were those early days of, of marriage, physical ed instructor in the military, father?  What was that period like for your family?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, first of all, I, you know, I, I would've married her--I wanted to marry her, but I didn't want to get married right then, and--but there was something about the struggle that she was going through in Savannah [Georgia].  Her family wasn't well off, she was living with her mom and that sort of stuff, and I felt that I had a sense of responsibility here, and so I had to do this thing early, you know.  And so I was kind of warned by my superiors not to get married at age nineteen, that I shouldn't be doing this, you know.  And I was driven by the fact that I had a child, and a person that I love, and that somehow I didn't feel that they were getting the best of care, and that if she was to struggle, we were gonna struggle together, you know.  And so I brought them to New York, you know.  And I had a few dollars saved, not, not, not a lot, but enough to bring them to, up to New York.  And so we came and I learned all about married life, you know, but it, it brought out some things, again, in me, in terms of growing because I--we, we learned that I couldn't live--we couldn't live off of the [U.S.] Air Force salary, you know, it's just impossible, you know, for us to live, and we had a little two-bedroom, two--not bedroom, two-room apartment.  The rent was $75, I think our total earnings monthly with her allotment was $175 a month, you know.  And so making it--making ends meet from payday to payday, we got paid on the 1st and 15th, or something like that, was, was always a struggle getting to that next pay period.  And so I had to make some adjustments there too, in order to take care of the family.  And we went through our struggles, you know, in, in New York.  But again, I, I think what it did for me, it just, it just made me dig down deeper each, each step along the way to see what can I do, and that has been my guiding light is always, "What can I do?"  You know, to, to correct this, to make this better.  You know, I go back to self because I'm a believer that we have more control over what we--our destiny than anybody else can never do, you know, and so that's kind of what I did.  I kind of thought, you know, "What can I do to make things better?"  Even though it was a struggle, you know.  And eventually, every obstacle, every hurdle that was put in front of me, I was able to overcome it, you know.
Story_ID: 99152
Speaker 1: Um, Some of kind of what, what I did was we had, we had a real problem getting a house later on in Plattsburgh [New York] because there was discrimination that we didn't think would happen in New York, you know.  And I remember going to look for a house, for an apartment, rather, and the people would, would, would tell you that the place was rented.  They would--didn't want to rent to you, but we didn't know they were discriminating.  We had no idea.  After all, this was New York.  That's not happening here, you know.  And they would be so nice, they would say, "Oh, I'm so sorry, but we rented it yesterday."  And we, we were watching the newspapers because we went down to wanted ad--I mean, not wanted, but the, but the listing--apartment listing section, and, and, and we would see the same place in there a week later.  We said, "Well, didn't they tell us they--."  We actually thought that there was something wrong with the way we were dressed as to why they weren't renting us these places, so we even changed our dress.  Got my little suit that my father had--put my suit on and went out looking for--so the people still would not rent us a place.  So by that time, I got kind of mad when I realized what was going on 'cause yeah, I wrote letters.  New York State had a Human Rights Commission back then and you could write to them and complain, and so when I did, complained about discrimination, they sent someone up to New York, of course, to interview me and the local paper picked it up.  So the next thing I know, I'm on the front page of the local paper, you know, with my daughter in my hand, talking about discrimination.  You had people on the base, of course, they're shocked, and upset, they think--folks think I'm making this up, you know.  And so one of the things that they did in my, in my squadron, in, in my--that they, they, they sent a, a white--my superior, he was, he was a white sergeant with me and asked him to go to the place first to see if they would rent to--no, me to go first, see if they--and then when they turned me down, they sent him to verify I was telling the truth, you know.  And so I would go and they would turn me down, and he would go and they would be ready to rent to him, and so he had to come back and report that I was telling the truth.  And so--and this took about a year, I guess, for all of this stuff to unfold, and there were more than one article written.  And after the article was written, of course, you had those people on the base who, who set out to get me, you know.  And they tried to prove--show that I was some kind of troublemaker, and they tried to label me with that, which is a, which was another whole story that, that I had to kind of contend with because now I got the pressure from my superior, not the one that they sent, but someone else, who wanted to court-martial me, you know, for stubbing my toe, least little things, so to speak.  Anyway, so to make a long story short, what I figured out right away was that the military did not like any kind of publicity and so I went and joined a local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And so I ended up with them as my allies, and whenever they would get me for something, whatever, I mean, and they tried several things, the President of the local NAACP, a lady named Jackie Archer (ph.), which was a person who was very instrumental in my life, and her husband, Lloyd, she had a direct line to the base commander and she could call the base commander and then they would back off me, you see?  So, anyway, after I wrote this letter and I started getting all this pressure from the base and kept complaining, because I never did let, let up, they eventually, gave me a house on the base.  And so as an Airman, 2nd Class, I was one of the--I, I think I might've been the first Airman, 2nd Class that they moved onto base.  So they, so they gave me--to shut me up, because I wouldn't shut up, you know, they, they gave me base housing.  And that was unheard of as an airman moving onto base because normally, to get on the base, you got to be a sergeant with more than five years in the military and all that stuff, and I was an airman with less than four yea--less than two years.  So I ended up on the base and that's how I got a house.
Story_ID: 99153
Speaker 1: How long were you actually in the military?
Speaker 2: Almost five years.  I spent almost five years in the military.  And I must admit that when I first got there, you know, it's some adjusting, I really wanted to leave.  You know, I thought if I just went and tell--told them that, you know, "Listen, I, I don't like this, you know, I want to leave now."  It was cold.  Plattsburgh [Air Force Base, Plattsburgh, New York] was extremely cold, you know, and I was from the south and all this stuff, and I said, "Well, maybe I should just quit now, you know."  And they said, "You can't just quit, you know.  If you leave, we're gonna give you a dishonorable discharge."  So I said, "Okay, then I'll stay."  You know, so I ended up staying, and, and I really got into Plattsburgh and learned to like it and started trying to better myself there.  And again, what did I do?  I went to school.  I started taking courses again, you know, and preparing for when I was going to get out of the service, you know.  So I took a number of courses and tried to get on the footing of, of getting this education.
Story_ID: 99154
Speaker 1: Speaking of school again, if we could fast forward to Fort Valley State College [now Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia].  When did you enroll there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, again, going back to Plattsburgh [Air Force Base, Plattsburgh, New York], when I started preparing--well, a couple things was happening:  One, is that by that time, I realized that I wasn't going to be the general.  They were not gonna promote me to general.  I wasn't gonna make a life in the military, so I better turn to what's here, you know.  And I had made sort of a decision, when I left New York playing baseball, that baseball may not be it, and matter of fact, a similar event that happened there was I was playing baseball and I was struggling, and, and I remember this guy hitting a homerun off me; I was the pitcher.  And I remember deciding to myself that I wanted to be successful in life, but maybe it wasn't baseball, and so I went from baseball to military to get the education.  Well, in service, I, I concluded that being here, I'm not getting much unless I go outside and do this on my own.  So I started taking courses and I went to--I took an English course, and one of the things I must admit is I've never been much of a writer, you know.  That wasn't my strength.  I discovered later that my strength was really more in the biological sciences and stuff like that, and business and things, but I wasn't a writer.  And so the first five papers that I tried to write taking this college course at Plattsburgh State [College, also State University of New York at Plattsburgh], I got all failing grades, five in a row. The instructor--I go to the instructor to find out what could I do.  The instructor looked at me, he said, "Son, college isn't for everybody."  And I said to myself, "What the hey.  He don't understand my background.  I just had a poor background, that's all that's wrong with me."  And I'm good in these other areas, you know, so I had enough sense to know that I was good in other areas, you know, and so I didn't let that deter me, you know.  I kept right on going.  As it turned out, I got a D out of the course.  The only D I ever got in college came from that course.  I never got a D after that.  I graduated with honors from every, from everywhere I've went for after that, you know.  But no, I got to Fort Valley because I, I--this high school teacher, Mr. Blunt (ph.), was down there at the time, and I reasoned that in going back home to go to school, I had to figure out where to go to school, least cost of living, and that sort of stuff.  Didn't want to be in Savannah [Georgia], because I felt that there would be interference from the family and all of the stuff going on there.  I looked at staying in New York State and I concluded the cost was gonna be too much.  You know, I even investigated going to a school in New York in order to pursue this thing with this chicken farm, got all kind of materials from them, and I ended up deciding on Fort Valley State based on the fact that my ex-high school instructor was there, and that it was down in the middle of Georgia, the cost of living would be lower, and, and I worked--I talked to--I had talked with him about a year out, and I prepared myself for the--to take the SAT exam and stuff like that and studied and was able to make a decent score on that for me, at the time.  And, and I--then I left New York and went straight to--actually, we moved to Savannah until school started in September that year.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--let's see, I start--'67 [1967],  '67 [1967], yeah.  Because I was supposed to get out of the service in 1966, in like November, but I extended for nine months because I could make another stripe, and also because it would take me into the next year and I would be able to save a little bit more money.  And, by the way, by the time I had done that, I had already created a janitorial service business in the military, and I saved--we saved money, paid off all our bills.  We--you know, we were prospering by then, you know.  We had two cars, we had a colored television and stuff like that.  So we were doing pretty good, you know, with my part-time job because I was making more money with my, with my business on the side than I was making in the military.  But we were doing extremely well, so we saved for us, at the time, about $3,000, and we were debt free.  So I headed off to college with $3,000 in my pocket and debt free.  And I went down to Fort Valley and I bought me a trailer, and with the help of Mr. Blunt (ph.) in terms of getting settled, got it placed and everything, and, and that September, I went to school full-time as a, a freshman, you know.  And, of course, I was getting the GI Bill by then, and that helped out.
Story_ID: 99155
Speaker 1: Was your family with you at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, family was right there with me, you know.  And so we--I went full-time, and I had figured out that we had enough money, with the GI Bill, to pinch off of a little savings every month, and you know, supplement, you know, the, the, the, the GI Bill, and then I had a little part-time job, and so the wife [Harriet McBride] didn't work.  She had no job.  And so I was able to support the family with my part-time job, my GI Bill, the little bit of savings, and every summer, we'd go off to work.  I went to Detroit [Michigan] in the summer of '68 [1968], '69 [1969] and worked at Ford [Motor Company], and fortunately for us, we were able to get jobs, you know, and--up there.  My brother, Garfield who's here with me, was living in Detroit at the time, so we'd go stay with him and work.  And then I would come back to Fort Valley [Georgia] and go to school again.  And so we were able to, you know, save a little bit of money and, and keep right on going.  Our roughest year, actually, was 1970; yeah, that was going between--by that time, I was getting ready to go to pharmacy school, and--from that June to September because Detroit didn't have any jobs for us.  And so we went there and we ended up having to come back home; she ended up going back to Savannah [Georgia].  And my friend in New York, from the days of living there, the, the Archers.  He had a, a tool and die company, and he always said, you know, "Cornell, if you can't find something, come here and I'll give you a job."  And so I ended up going to New York and working with him that summer, so that's how we made it through, but that was the roughest year.
Story_ID: 99156
Speaker 1: We're back at Fort Valley [State College, now Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Mm-hum.
Speaker 1: You're in school there, what is your major?
Speaker 2: I started out wanting to major in animal science, actually, poultry science.  I still had in mind of being an chicken farmer, and then after a little while, I changed; I switched to animal science, and I thought about livestock, other livestock then.  And then I decided well, maybe I should major--be a veterinarian, and so I started pursuing that.  Seemed like the more I went in school, the higher I went the, the, the more I wanted to do more than just be a farmer, you know.  I started pursuing veterinary medicine, and then somewhere along the line, somebody came to Fort Valley from Mercer University School of Pharmacy, to tell us all about pharmacy school, and I think I was a junior, at the time.  And I concluded that I had struggled with the family these years, and that the route that I was gonna, I was gonna get a degree in animal science and then go to vet school.  So I had an eight-year program I was gonna pursue, and I concluded that if I go now, that I could spend another three years in pharmacy and become a pharmacist and cut off two years of getting to where I could earn a living.  So that was my reasons for going to pharmacy school.  It was, it was, it was purely, a shortcut to getting to where I could support the family.  And besides, the GI Bill was gonna run out, and so I felt a little leery about struggling for those extra years, just, you know, without the GI Bill.  And so that's one of the reasons why I ended up in, in pharmacy school.
Story_ID: 99157
Speaker 1: While you were still at Fort Valley [State College, now Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia], you met someone who would become important in your life and career; could you tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I met--actually, I met Therman McKenzie, and another guy by the name of Johnnie Early (ph.).  We were all in agriculture together, you know.  Actually, Johnnie was in school to be a biologist, or something, and Thurman was gonna be an agronomist, and I was gonna be animal science, but we were taking classes together.  And so when they came to--Mercer [University, Atlanta, Georgia] came to Fort Valley to, to talk about pharmacy, we all went to that lecture, and I concluded I was gonna go to pharmacy school and they did too.  And so after our junior year, you know, I came on up to Atlanta to go to school, only to find out that they didn't come, you know.  And so September, I, I entered pharmacy school in September of 1970, and they stayed down in Fort Valley.  Well, I went back down to Fort Valley with one of the professors from Mercer and recruited them to come up to Mercer, and they came in January of 1971.  And so then you had the three of us, Therman McKenzie, who I met when we were in agriculture; John Early, and myself.  So we all finished Mercer School of Pharmacy in the top 10, by the way, at Mercer.  And then we were going to start this company called M&M Products--MEM Products; McBride, Early, McKenzie, or whatever.  And Johnnie decided along the way that he wanted to go to graduate school, so he decided to go and get his Ph.D. in pharmacology at Purdue [University, West Lafayette, Indiana], and so he got accepted.  He went off to Purdue, and Thurman and myself started M&M Products Company.
Speaker 1: And what year is this?
Speaker 2: That was 1973.  And, of course, the way that happened was Therman actually had the idea.  He was making--using this product for his afro, where he had simply mixed glycerin and water together, and it was--had some negatives because it would beat up on your hair and stuff.  And when he introduced it to me, and I used it, I saw this negative; I wanted to solve this negative.  So I went to one of my instructors and started talking to him about what I needed to do, and he advised me to use a surfactant, and do some other things.  And so I like tinkering, so I started messing around with the formulation and actually made it better.  So we were able to make this thing better, that--and we started giving it away in the hospital; by then, we were all working at Grady Hospital.  And as a result of giving it away, people encouraged us to put it on the market.  And we had people coming back-and-forth who wanted, you know, more samples.  And my rationale at the time or reasoning was if you give someone something that they don't like, they may take it, but they won't come back and ask you again; if you give someone something that they really like, they're gonna come back and ask you for some more, and that's what happened.  And so that was like our market research, you know.  And because people were coming back, and they weren't just asking, they were insistent upon getting some more, and we would make it up because we were using the ingredients from the hospital.  You know, we weren't paying for any ingr--any of the ingredients, you know.  So we saw that as, as an opportunity to put this product on the market.   Well, Therman, at the time, had concluded or decided that he was gonna go to dental school.  I had been married for eleven years by then, five years of military service, six years of college, and I was ready to go to work.  And so I convinced Therman that he and I should go into business together, and that, you know, he shouldn't go to dental school.  So he forego--he decided not to go to dental school, and, and went into business with me and we created M&M Products Company.  Of course, like I said, Sta-Sof-Fro was the, was the first product.  And we had to learn all about what do you do to put this product on the market?  We, we knew nothing about putting the product on the market.  And, you know, there was some initial trials and tribulations, you know, to, to go with that, but once we got focused on the fact that people liked this stuff, and we had something that was unique, you know, then we just wanted to get it out there and put it in people's hands.
Story_ID: 99158
Speaker 1: Who helped you along the way, in terms of the, perhaps the marketing, your sales people; what were those early days like?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a couple people.  One, was a guy named Roscoe White (ph.).  Roscoe was the local distributor selling these products into stores.  We were, by then, working at Revco Drugs, and he was the--he advised us.  And there was another guy, I don't remember his name, and he gave us a phrase that I still use today, and we were talking to him, and he was a distributor.  We were talking to him about, you know, what to do, and how we was gonna sell it all over the place, and the guy said to us, "Listen, make Atlanta [Georgia] your local United States of America."  And he said, "If you can do it here, then you can do it other places, but if you can't do it here, you cannot do it other places.  You don't have to worry about traveling, just go out here and do all you can do in Atlanta."  And we used that as our model.  We took him to heart with that, you know, and we just saturated Atlanta; all of the barbershops, any little corner store we could find, you know.  And sure enough, as the product became popular here, we then had the model to roll it into other cities, and then we would go to Birmingham [Alabama], Savannah [Georgia], Macon [Georgia], Augusta [Georgia], and other places around.  But we took that advice to heart and we really did utilize that.  Plus, we had in school, you know, in pharmacy school prior to graduating, like I said, we had the instructors that kind of helped us a little bit in telling us about getting the bottle printed, and they used the term silk-screening.  I remember I didn't know what that meant.  What are you talking about, silk-screening?  And then they tried to explain to us what that meant.  And they ended up, ended up sending us to a local company that we later bought, as a matter of fact, called Nash Silk-screening Company. And this was a little old lady there running this company, and we went over to her, and she sat us down and gave us a lesson on what's involved in silk-screening.  Well, we managed to put together $500, actually, and we actually made our first batch of product; for $500, we made 1,000 bottles.  Well, we didn't know how to price it.  We really didn't know how to price it, but somewhere along the line, we figured out that we had 50¢ in this stuff, that we had to charge five times as much, you know, in order to make any money because we figured out the--and we worked with this Mr. White, by the way, talking about what it's gonna cost him, because we couldn't sell it to him for $2.50, the, the retail was $2.50, so we had to sell it to him for something less.  So we ended up charging $2.50 for the product, selling it to him for about $12 to $13 a dozen, and him selling it to the store, who then sold it to the ultimate consumer.  And so we learned a, a real lesson, in terms of pricing.  It turns out later on, in talking to other people, my friend in New York, how do you price things?  And he--there's a, there was an old rule of thumb that you use anywhere from five to seven times your cost, you know.  And we didn't know that, we just came up with the five, you know, and we ended up pricing it at that price.  And at the time, that was considered a high price for a product of its source, its nature, but in order to justify it, we called it an oil sheen and an easy comb.  At the time, there were two products out that you had to buy for your afro, the oil sheen and the easy comb, but we said this is two in one, okay.  So you don't need none of this other stuff, you just need this one product, so we justified our $2.50.
Speaker 1: And at the time your product came on the market, there was primarily, the Afro Sheen, that was out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was Afro Sheen out, primarily.  A few of the locals--James Brown had a product line out, believe it or not, and there was another one called Magnificent and some other stuff, but nobody had what we had.  And they seemed like they didn't understand our formulation.  And even though the Johnson Products was a lot bigger than us, they didn't understand what we had done, and nor did they think it would go anywhere.  And all of a sudden, we had this ground swell that was happening, you know, first here in Atlanta, and then in the southeast area, next thing you know, it was all over the country, you know.  But it was based on the performance of the product.  The product was just a superior formulation compared to the rest of the products that was out there.
Story_ID: 99159
Speaker 1: So what was the time frame here?  How long had the company [M&M Products Company] been in business, how long was it before you actually saw a profit?
Speaker 2: Well, I--you know, we first had to make a decision about, you know, who was going to leave the drugstore and who was gonna stay, and somehow, we concluded that I should leave the drugstore.  Now I was married, wife and couple kids at the time, and he [Therman McKenzie] was not married, or he was, he just got married, I think, so anyway, but I concluded I should leave because I thought that I was more experienced than he.  After all, I had traveled a little more than him; I had been to New York, you know, he hadn't left the South hardly.  So anyway, I concluded I should leave the drugstore, so I left the drugstore and worked full-time starting in 1974.  And after being out there for just a few months, the sales increased so much, until he had to leave.  So I left in May of '74 [1974] from the drugstore, about August, sales was going so good till he had to leave.  And so we went to the back and we tried to get a loan, at a local bank, C&S at the time said to us, "Listen, we can give you guys a loan, but we want you to go take these courses, these business courses.  And so we took a course at Southeast institute--Institute [Athens, Georgia] over there, can't remember the instructor's name, but that course really was a kind of foundation for us in, in, in business, but they did loan us the $5,000.  We borrowed the $5,000 from C&S Bank, and that sort of, sort of launched us, to help us get going with it, at the time, but that was 1973--no, '74 [1974].  Things just took off.  You know, we did--well, I think the first year we did $100,000, in '74 [1974]; by '75 [1975], we were probably doing about $300,000, $400,000, you know; and by '76 [1976], we were over a million, you know.  And, and we--things were going so fast, and, and, of course, we were putting a lot back into the company, advertising the products, and we only made Sta-Sof-Fro.  Then we decided well, maybe we should make a shampoo and some other stuff to go with this stuff, you know, because people were asking us for more stuff at the time.  Anyway, I guess probably about four years later, we were probably somewhere around $3 or $4 million and climbing.  So in terms of profitability, probably by--we were really concerned with the company supporting our salaries; after all, we were pharmacists, you know, and we had to first cover that, you know.  Once we did that, we didn't really deal with profits, if it was profitable, but I would dare say that around the third year, we were profitable.  We were making a lot of money because then we were able to go beyond our salaries, in terms of our own earnings.
Speaker 1: Where were you located at that time?
Speaker 2: We--my first plant was in my basement, you know.  When I left the project--you know, that's another whole story there, but we lived in the project when I finally came up to Atlanta [Georgia] to go to pharmacy school, and that's a story by itself, but we lived in the project, okay.  And when I first went to, to, to get this house in the project, they didn't have any vacancies, they said, and so I waited two weeks.  I went back to them again, and I said, "I come back to get the house."  And the lady said, "Mr. McBride, you know, didn't we tell you we don't have no vacancies?"  And I insisted upon seeing her boss, and when I saw the boss, the boss said to me, "Listen, why are you insistent upon getting a house?"  And I told him our story.  I said I'm a veteran, I'm in school, and by the time--my wife and kids were still at Fort Valley [Georgia] and I explained to her I needed to get them up here.  Then I told a little lie that I was about to flunk out, and so that kind of helped, and so she decided to override the system and to give me a house in the projects, so that's how we got to the project.  And we stayed in the project about three years, and so when I left the project, we--my first house, I bought it with the clear purpose and intention of putting the company in the basement.  And so by then, I was a pharmacist, and we moved over in Southeast Atlanta and we had a little basement there and started manufacturing the products there, and, and delivering it right out of the basement.  And we only stayed there about a year, and we grew right out of that basement, and we found a little building on Browns Mill Road, about 3,000 square feet, and we stayed there a couple years, and we grew out of that, you know.  And we had to find--we kept having to find larger facilities, you know, to, to house the company.  But we were full-blown, I guess, by 1975, '76 [1976], we were really going, yeah.
Story_ID: 99160
Speaker 1: When you started this company, did it feel right for you?  Did it feel like something that you had perhaps in some point in your life, dreamed of doing? I remember you said that when you were young, you used to comb your mother [Thelma McBride]'s hair.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Was the thought ever in your mind about doing something--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in terms of--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --products of this nature?
Speaker 2: No.  It never, it never occurred to me about making a product or doing anything remotely connected to what we ended up doing, you know, it's just that it, it happened.  I was a person who would take advantage of opportunities, you know, and I clearly saw this as an opportunity.  I thought that the product was good.  I was scared that someone would copy us, and, and, and choke off--cut off the growth.  And as I went around to the different shows, that was always a concern of mine because I was the person that was out there, not my partner, I was the guy because I was out first.  And I remember the companies that was in the shows, they had to (unclear) it.  We weren't in the show, I was walking around at the show, you know, trying to, to get distributors to carry our products and stuff, and so I got to know a lot of people.  And they would--some of the guys that were large enough, Pro-Line, and all those guys, they would take a sample of my product, and I knew what they wanted to do, but they kind of underestimated what the product would do, and they overlooked it.  And every year, I was hoping that they would just give us another year, give us another year, give us another year, and that happened to where we got to where we could support the brand and we really made it a brand.  And by the time they copied us, we were so strong and so it didn't make a whole lot of difference because we were the dominate brand in the market, you know, and so that's why we followed it with all of that, that advertising.  But those early years, that was my greatest concern, really. And then later on, the concern was how do you build this organization, just not only do this, but to support you beyond this, to expand now, to bring in other products, to, to create the, the next generation of stuff to come down the road.  And so my, my, my concern changed to that, you know, from, from the early years, how to keep the growth going, you know.
Speaker 1: And how did you do that?
Speaker 2: Well, I tried to do it by creating a brand called Soft and Free, and Soft and Free was primarily, a female brand, but by the time we got to Soft and Free, you know, things were happening between my partner [Therman McKenzie] and myself, to where his idea was different than mine.  His whole life and ideas and, and thought were locked up in Sta-Sof-Fro; mine was in trying to broaden this company, you know, so that we can keep growing.  And, of course, as you grow in any business, you kind of--you can grow together or you can grow separate, and we started growing in separate direction.  His concern was a little different than mine.  And so we weren't able to really put the kind of resources behind Soft and Free that it needed to have.  He saw Soft and Free as my brand, and Sta Sof Fro as his brand, rather than being the brand of both of us.  And so I always felt that Soft and Free didn't really get off the ground because we had to share the resources so much, you know.  And we needed to have been--we should've been shifting the resources because Sta-Sof-Fro reached a point where we started to decline, and we needed Soft and Free to pick that up, you know, and taking the resources and shifting them, is what I was trying to do.  Well, he saw that as taking away from Sta-Sof-Fro, and so we just--our, our, our views started to, to, to go into a separation direction.
Speaker 1: And around what time was this?  What year, would you say?
Speaker 2: This was--had to be mid-'80s [1980s] by then, we're talking mid-80s.  And the curl market was in full bloom; the afro market had declined, you know.  We needed to be more of a diversified company, you know, and so we went through that period of, of the '80s of, of, of, you know, an international company having a facility in Africa, selling products down in South Africa, and the Caribbean, you know, just kind of out there all over the place, you know.  But as the market started to change and the curl came in early '80s and you had that whole thing, we really didn't, didn't get the, the complete ride, you know, in--of that market.  We--our sales and, and--was anchored much more into the afro era.  We, we've got some of the curl market, but we didn't capitalize on it as much as we should have with the Soft and Free brand, which was really positioned early on as a broad brand, but introduced only with the curl products first, but it became known more as, as a curl brand because that's what you introduced it under.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 99161
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You mentioned your international growth in Africa. When was that launched and what was that like?
Speaker 1: We went to Africa in 1979, first trip to Africa, and, of course, going to the motherland, that was exciting.  We thought we was gonna go and conquer Africa.  We didn't know what to expect.  We had our briefcase and three-piece suits on, and we were ready for Africa, only to get there and to be totally shocked, you know, when we got there, but it was, it was an experience. And we, we had met this Nigerian businessman by the name of Aldu Fawawi (ph.), and he invited us to come to Africa.  And so we went, and we, we tried to set up a manufacturing facility with him making the products, and we did somewhat, but that was really not, not very successful.  We didn't put a lot of money into the plant, per se, but just trying to do that whole business thing in Africa from here, and you know, where our focus was much more domestic and we didn't have any experience in international business, per se.  But--so we weren't very successful.  We didn't lose money, per se, but--except a lot of time, you know, back-and-forth.  But we also learned that even though Nigeria had these millions of people, that you had a very small percentage that could afford the product, you know.  And that way, in terms of growing, we, we saw Africa early on as the continent that would launch us and without knowing about the marketing side of things, it didn't turn out to be that way.  So even though we, we sold product in, in West Africa, mainly Nigeria, and we sold the most product, believe it or not, in Southern Africa, which is a whole another thing that happened later on.  We ended up selling more products down in Southern African than, than West Africa.
Speaker 2: And when did that aspect of the business unfold?
Speaker 1: About mid-'80s [1980s].  By then we were up in, in the mid-'80s.  We, we actually got into a little trouble down there because this was doing apartheid.  And we put together an organization down there of blacks and whites, a company called Vivid, and where there was this, this partnership.  And we were shipping products into one of the--what do you call them?  The countries that South Africa used that where the blacks were, and--
Speaker 2: The homelands.
Speaker 1: The homelands, one of the homelands.  And we were shipping in there and disguising, of course, the products were being shipped into South Africa, and so the Atlanta Journal sent a reporter down there, and he was there for some other reason, and he ran into one of our people.  And he wrote a story about one of the people we were dealing with, or doing business with prior to, and this guy was a distributor who had owed us a lot of money, was very disgruntled because we had to change the relationship simply because we weren't getting paid by him.  And the guy told him that we had taken the distributorship away from him and given it to a white guy.  When the reporter wrote the story and sent it back up here to the paper, the Journal Constitution put an inflammatory headline on it.  They said just with that, that we took the distributorship away from a black distributor and gave it to a white, and that launched a national--potential national boycott against us headed up by Jose and everybody else.  And so we had, with this company, a $9 million contract at the time, and was well on our way to fulfilling that, and of course, we had to leave South Africa.  We had to call this big press conference and Coretta [Scott King], and a whole bunch of other folks, Andy [Andrew Young, HM], down at the state capitol and announced that we were leaving South Africa.  Of course, that hurt us, as a business, and meanwhile, you had Revlon, (unclear), you had all these other companies there that none of the leaders seem to be concerned about.  But the one thing that really got me about that whole thing was how, when we got into this trouble, how many people that I respected, was really trying to shake us down for--under the threat of boycott, you know, and that was disappointing; that was disappointing.
Story_ID: 99162
Speaker 1: How long did that period last, the, the threat of boycott?  The controversy?
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was about a year.  It was about a year and the solution to it was to leave and they don't know their effect of--on, on, on our company because we had estimated that we were going to do 25 percent of our sales in that venture, and taking that out in midyear and trying to make that adjustment just helped the spiral to go right on down for us as a company, you know, just, just speeded that whole process up.  But again, I don't want to call names, but some of the leaders that--so-called leaders, I, I lost respect, including some clergy people.  And they were just there at the trough, you know, trying to shake us down.  If you give me $5,000; if you give me this; if you give me that, you know.  And so it wasn't really about, you know, so much a boycott as to what they could get, and I think that will always be with me, you know, in terms of how they handled that.  Again, what I tried to tell them was that, you know, we had put together an integrated group of people in South Africa during apartheid.  The black folks were benefitting from this, and yet, they only focused on the fact that we were doing business in South Africa.  And the irony of that whole thing was, we had sponsored the kickoff against the apartheid with Arthur Ashe, and cosponsored that in New York, that tennis tournament he kicked off; we were one of the cosponsors.  We gave them $25,000 to kick that whole thing off, you know.  So here we were trying to do business, you know, and here these other people were, you know, just trying to, trying to shake us down.  And so to me, it had nothing to do with the apartheid.  We were not, in any way, advancing the apartheid.  We were doing business there, of course, but we made sure that we were involving black people in the whole business venture.  That was one of the requirements that we had, that's why we created that organization in the first place.
Story_ID: 99163
Speaker 1: Mr. McBride, we're back.  If we could talk a bit--if you could talk a bit about the, the high point in the company's, the M&M Products Company's existence when your status was at the, at the time top of the industry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Sta-Sof-Fro became the number one black product in the country; as a matter of fact, it remained number one for about ten years.  And we, as a company, the high point was we had over 420 employees, we did over $50 million in, in business, and this is back there in 1980s dollars.  I think that for us, as a company, we felt that we couldn't go nowhere but up, you know, and we started preparing for more and more, more sales.  As an organization, again, we had some transitions to do.  We needed to make, you know, away from afro into a much more broader kind of markets and things like that.  It is important to try to keep the, the partnership, you know, focused on, on diversifying the company.  During those years, those were indeed happy times because I think we were number eleven in Black Enterprise's list of largest businesses.  A lot of good things happening, you know, for us as, as a company.
Story_ID: 99164
Speaker 1: And then, of course, shortly after that, we started to, you know, have some, some, some difficulty.  We had two major fires I mentioned.  We had two major fires in the, in the, in the plant probably a year or two apart.
Speaker 2: When was that?
Speaker 1: Again, we're talking around '85 [1985], '86 [1986].  We had one and then we--within two years, we had two major fires at M&M Products Company; did quite a bit of damage that took us out--not took us out of business, but stopped our manufacturing operation, and, and we had to, had to make some adjustments, you know.  But, but during those, those years, there was a feeling at M&M that, that you could do no wrong, you know; that everything was at your disposal, you know, and they were really tremendously happy times for us.  I think as a company, it had to be around our tenth year, I remember our tenth anniversary, and it seemed like after that tenth year that had to be around 1984, you know, after that tenth anniversary, then it seemed like the trouble started.  It just started to, to really, really come down, as a company.  And, of course, what it did for me, personally, was that, you know, you're used to being very successful, and all of a sudden, you got--you started feeling ashamed that you were not succeeding the way you once succeeded, and so dealing with the adversities of business was, was quite an experience, you know.  You just didn't feel like being congratulated, you didn't feel like you, you, you felt like you were a failure, you know, because now you're losing money.  And learning to deal with that kind of adversity in business is a, is a--especially the first time, it's, it's, it's major, in terms of your own psyche, you know, and how you handle this adversity, you know.  I tried best I could to deal with it.  I think that at some point during that whole process, if I wasn't a stronger, a different person, I could've become an alcoholic, you know.  I remember having to have some wine at night to, to go to sleep, you know.  And I remember having to have more than one glass after a while.  And I remember from the pressure from the banks--because on the one hand, you were making all this money, everybody love you; now you're losing money, the banks turned just opposite.  They just want you to go, okay.  No matter how much they love you before, they want you to take your business and leave, but they can't just throw you out the door because they got some involved.  You know, as a layperson would look at it, "Well, you know, you can't lose no money here because what we owe you is small in comparison to what this company's worth."  Well, the banks don't look at it like that, you know.  They look at it based on well, this amount of money, we may not get this because we're not concerned about brands, or anything like that, we just concerned about planting equipment, what we can sell, you know.  And so you had the pressure from the banks to get this turned around.  You told this--this whole experience is totally new to you, and so for the first time, you, you're really facing a sort of depression, you know, a stress that come upon you, in terms of, of trying to, trying to get things turned around and trying to make this adjustment in business.  And so like I said, for me, personally, I dealt with it, as most people do, you start drinking more, you know.  And I remember saying to a guy one day that, you know, "Boy, I can't get to sleep at night unless I have me some wine."  And the guy said to me, "That's the first step to becoming an alcoholic," you know.  And that--then so I took that to heart, you know.  And I said you know, he's--I mean, I'm drinking a lot of wine at night, and I'm waking up 3 o'clock in the morning and I still can't sleep.  So I decided to stop drinking, and I actually stopped drinking for like six months, at the time, because I felt that I was making--you know, finding every excuse to have a drink.  You know, "It's raining outside, oh, I need a drink.  It's cold, I need a drink.  You know, I'm on an airplane, I need a drink.  I'm at a cocktail party, I need a drink," you know.  And so I found that I needed to get control of myself and my life and so I stopped and I was able to, to not drink for six months, and then I got it to where I could have it or not have it again.  But at one point, based on all that pressure that we were going through in the mid-'80s [1980s], you know, it was pretty regular, you know.  I don't drink today, I finally quit altogether, and I think it's the greatest thing I've ever done.  You know, I don't drink nothing now. But, yeah, I mean, we went from that high period of the, of the '80s to having to try to survive, you know, as a company losing money instead of making money.  Dealing with the banks who don't see you as this young upcoming entrepreneur, you know, successful and all that stuff, who now sees you in a whole different light.  And the way the financial system worked is that the worse you do in business, the more we gonna charge you, the higher the rates.  So now, you go from being successful getting good rates to being marginal to where you can't get good rates, so you're penalized for not doing well, you see.  It seemed like the system should work just the opposite, but no, that's the way the system worked.  And so having to deal with that was quite an experience, and of course, that kind of did some things for me, in terms of where I'm at now, and, and, and the type of business that we have now.
Story_ID: 99165
Speaker 1: Did they ever find out how those fires were started?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, one of them was a malfunction of a piece of equipment that we had that malfunctioned and blew up, you know.  And it blew the gas line and all that other stuff that was right on top of it, you know.  And the second one was--you know, back then we, we had taken a warehouse space and converted it to manufacturing.  Well, you've got different people adding different things at different times, all kinds of electrical lines and things like that.  It's impossible to have continuity in that kind of environment.  Each person is supposed to be qualified, and there was--in the second fire, there was electrical malfunctioning as well that caused that fire.  But again, I always attribute it to the fact that we had to take a warehouse.  It wasn't built for manufacturing, and convert it to manufacturing, you know, and you had a lot of piecemeal kind of situations taking place with electrical and gas and everything else.  So I think that's really, really what, what caused those fires.
Speaker 1: By the end of the 1980s, M&M Products [Company] was, was really winding down.  When did the company cease and when did you start your current company?
Speaker 2: M&M--we sold M&M in February of 1990, finally, after going through two or three years of, of negotiations, considering the sale of it and, and on and on and on.  And really, to me, it was kind of a shock because I really wasn't ready to leave the business.  You know, I enjoyed the business.  I knew we had made some mistakes, and I understood how we got to where we had gotten, and I wanted to stay and I tried to buy the company myself and I was unable to do that.  And so finally, I ended up--we ended up selling it to Johnson Products.  And I chose Johnson Products, because I was trying to sell it to another black company and hoped that we could get together and make this thing even, you know, bigger than it was that the two companies could come together.  I knew George E. Johnson [HM] personally, and, and I had made a promise to him that if I sell it to anybody, I would sell it to them.  And so I ended up selling to them, and I, and I was supposed to go to work for them too; and again, the vision and the thought was to unite two black companies.  Well, to my surprise, once you're not an owner, you have no more say so.  So I worked over there for two days, and I quit because I didn't like what I saw.  It wasn't like I thought it was going to be, and I decided, okay, it's back to being an entrepreneur, what you know how to do and what you enjoy.
Story_ID: 99166
Speaker 1: And so I set out to create another company, and fortunately for me, when I sold the company, my saving grace was we negotiated out this non-compete.  In other words, I didn't have a non-compete.
Speaker 2: What does that mean?
Speaker 1: That means that I could come right back into the business.  Normally, when you sell something, you got a five-year period or some period that you can't go in that business no more.  Well, you know, we--I was wise enough at the time, to not let them put that in because even though I was going to work with Johnson, I didn't know how that was going to work out, and so I said to myself I needed to have this cushion.  And, and also, I felt confident that I could do this again, you know.  And so I wanted that opportunity.  In fact, I was advised of that.  There was some people that I was working with at the time, because we were back-and-forth about selling them this company, and they said to me, "Well, you know what, Mr. McBride, I think you could do this all over again, if you had to."  And so I said, "Yeah."  And so they said, "Well," and that's how we arrived at this not having a non-compete. And so we sold it to them in February of 1990, I went to work for them for all of two days, quit, came back to Atlanta [Georgia].  We were out in California somewhere at a meeting with them, and started, you know, working on, on this company, of putting it together.  So I hired me a team of people to help me test products, and I used--I had a beauty supply business at the time.  We had ten stores and I used one of those stores as the headquarters for testing of the products for what became Design Essentials and Wave by Design, and we spent all of 1990 developing formulas, adjusting formulas and all that stuff, and I was able to launch it in 1991.
Story_ID: 99167
Speaker 1: Now, you launched the company [Design Essentials] at a time that many other black hair care products were experiencing problems and being gobbled up by large, predominantly white companies, and, and even Johnson [Products Company] eventually were bought by a white company; how did you essentially survive that, that difficult period in the history of black hair care?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, yeah, I, I had this unique kind of perspective of the industry where I understood everything that had happened in the industry.  You know, I understood and I saw where--I knew the opportunities, you know.  And so when I started this company, I decided I wanted to go in the professional market, directly into the salons, and to deal with those salons.  And my initial thought was because in selling M&M, I must say that we didn't walk away with so much money that we could retire, you know.  We had maybe three years' worth of earnings at our standard of living or income level, and so I had to try to create another source of, of income, and I felt that it was the quickest way of creating that income, even if I had to store it in my ware--in my garage and get out on the street, that I could actually peddle and make as much money as I did before working--running M&M.  And so, so my initial thought was okay, it costs a lot of money to try to get into the retail channels and I didn't want to go through that, and I didn't have the, the money to do that.  And so I took all of the money that I had, including my retirement, and invested it in this company, and to create a channel of distribution that would be only in the salons.  I also reasoned that it would take time, five years or more, to build the kind of network I needed to build, and--but I had to do it myself.  And so I had to get out there in the street and, and to build these distributors one at a time, all over the southeast, you know.  But I also reasoned that as we became more successful with it, that we had a--the type of system that we were building that was in, in effect, a distribution system for our products, and that we would then be able to compete with the larger companies who did not have a distribution system.  Let me just say this, over the years in this industry what happened was, when the Koreans came in and took up and bought up all of the beauty supply stores, they also took out what's called a distribution system direct to salons because they don't go to salons; you had the, the black companies before them who did go to salons.  And so when they bought up the beauty suppliers, the hair stylists got to come to them, there's nobody going directly to the hair stylists.  So what I see--sought to establish was that channel of distribution to the salons with my products only.  And I knew that it would take time to build that, and so what I did was, I, at the time, owned a beauty su--ten beauty supply stores, I had a liquor store in, in the family, you know.  The family was--we weren't making money in these other businesses, so we sold them all off, and I made us concentrate on one thing.  We would concentrate on this one thing called McBride Research Laboratories, this new entity.  My son had just graduated from college a few years earlier and so he was back working with me, and so by 1992, we sold off all that stuff and started focusing on nothing but Design Essentials.  But I saw the opportunity in having your own distribution system out there.  Besides, (unclear) Products had come before me and they had done it, but I thought that what they had done could be amended a little bit, and that he didn't have a complete system as efficient as it should be, and as self-perpetuating as it could be, and plus, I wanted to give opportunities to people to work for themselves, you know.  And I felt that if you get people working for themselves, you'll get a better person, you know.  That all the people who couldn't do that would fall by the wayside, and each year, you would end up with a better person, you know, and a better group of people.  And that is exactly what has happened with us, and that's why we were able to, to survive and compete, it's because what we created with McBride Research is a distribution system that's really akin to a franchise or franchisee relationship.  So you got independent people out there working for themselves, it's just that they only distribute design with the support from us, you know, with us working together, but they are a business unit.  Plus, we are financing those units so that they didn't have to put out a franchise fee, but they have to put their sweat equity in, you know.  And with the two of us working together, they make more than they ever made before so we've got people who, who can claim a six-figure income, you know, selling design, and that's all they sell, you know.  And so we've been able to create these independent business units out there distributing Design Essentials, and that now is, is one of the strong points in this industry because it's, it's thirteen years and no one else have what we have, in terms of that kind of distribution system.
Story_ID: 99168
Speaker 1: And you're about to launch a new product. Can you talk a little bit about, about that, what it is?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we'll--we are moving more into color, you know, and we've got a new line that's coming out the--what we call a demi-permanent color line.  Well, color is the type of thing that requires a lot of education; because we have a field presence, not only with distributors, but with technicians all across the country because education is what you need to do in the professional market so we conduct seminars all over the country.  The infrastructure that we have, the business model that we have, allows us to do that at a very cheap rate compared to the big companies because one, is the technician work for us part-time; two, the distributors got to share the cost, you know, and he's got to do the work to, to get the people there.  So you've got a system in place to where these independent business units can function as a business and we can joint venture with them to do things, to share the cost, that allow us to do more education than if you own all of it yourself and having to pay for it yourself, you see?  Plus, you're getting a, a kind of efficiency because you got self-employed people as opposed to just people that you're paying a salary to.  People on salary just simply don't work as hard as people who are self-employed, you know.  And so each one of these independent business unit franchisees, we call them, they're--we, we work with them to improve and--their business, to improve themselves.  We give them--we have courses that they can take in business, we motivate them, we do two sales meetings a year, we have award program for them.  We have all of what you need to do to promote that person--and to incent that person, rather, to do well in business, as well as a complete support system back here.  So this business model is different than what anyone else have, you know, and so as a result, we've been able to see the growth starting in 1991 just continue to go up and up and up.  And we're doing it because we're controlling everything from the manufacturing all the way down to the actual distribution of the products, and we're doing it without owning a manufacturing facility.
Speaker 1: Huh.  Who does your manufacturing?
Speaker 2: We outsource it.
Speaker 1: Oh.  The way of the world.
Speaker 2: Outsource.  So the business model that we have is different, you know.  The business model is taking advantage of technology today.  You know, our people order online.  We don't have a bunch of folks sitting around taking their orders, so we've taught them how to do that. So we've taken a group of people and we've up--increased their skill levels to do more things themselves so that we can keep costs down, you see.  Our facility here is a facility where we've got maybe twenty folks, twenty, twenty-five people, something like that around here; haven't had a new employee in over two years, but we have an in-house network, you know.  We use computers, you know, to do almost everything to increase productivity and things like that.  We have a happy group of people; they, they like what they do, you know.  Everyone get along around here.  We don't have any internal dissension taking place, you know.  Just a happy environment to be in because it's a relaxed environment and because we're doing well, we don't have the pressures of bank loans and things to worry about.  We did get a bank loan back in 1996, but I'm very happy to say that we're about to pay that off, and we haven't had one since because we've generated within all of the capital, all the cash needed to grow the business, and so it goes back to the business model.
Story_ID: 99169
Speaker 1: And where do you outsource the manufacturing?  Is it in this country or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, here.  It's here.  We've got several places in Chicago [Illinois], and one place here, another business, another person that, I believe when I moved down here, relocated to Georgia in 1981.  And he just passed away, his wife is now running the business, but he's got a contract packaging division or a company and they make a lot of our stuff.  You know, we gave them the business and we've helped them to create a business and they are doing well, you know, and we're one of their biggest customers, you know.  And so in addition to our people out there across the country, we've got that kind of relationship, as well as with some of our other suppliers, good relationship.  But the thing I'm, I'm proud of with this business, as I said early on, was that I'm fulfilling something that I've always wanted to do and that is to create something that not just you are benefitting, but the people who involved, and it's not limited; it's only limited by what you do, you see?  And so that's what I really like about this system because when we have our sales meetings and when we, we get together for any reason--first of all, they know they can call me, you know, anytime, you know, my cell, at home, whatever.  But when we get together, you see a bunch of happy people and they're happy because they're earning a good living.  And so the role that I'm trying to play is how do you keep teaching people to keep moving on, to not become satisfied because you have achieved a certain level?  But with comfort, with ease, how do you keep improving yourself?  Because that's what life is, you know, it's continuous improvement, being able to make the adjustments.  You know, being able to, you know, step to the next level.  I mean, there are things that's gonna happen in life that we have no control over, but we have control over a lot of stuff that we can do before those things happen that may cushion that.  And so one of the things that I try to do as a person is try to always improve myself, you know, find ways that I can, you know.  And over the years, I've learned a lot.  I've learned how to become a better listener, you know, and I've learned how to work through other people more, you know.  And so at this point in life, in fact, my reading has picked up more.  I think I, I read more now than I ever did in my life, you know, and I always have a book somewhere reading about something, you know.  So again, the role that I'm trying to play with the group of people that I'm working with is, is to show them that yes, there is a better life, that you can do better, but as you do better, you got to do better, you know, so that's kind of--
Story_ID: 99170
Speaker 1: This is, in many ways, a family business; you have a brother working with you and your son.
Speaker 2: My son, my--I have two sons and a daughter working with me, my wife [Harriet McBride] works here, I have a couple nieces here, I have a couple nephews here--no, it's about three nephews, a couple nieces, you know, my children, and they all get along, you know, and I have to stress that.  Just like we get along with, with me and, and, and my, my children that work here.  And the reason we get along is because that's something that you had to, you have to, you have to establish in the beginning.  There is a respect back-and-forth, you know, but there is also a knowledge that when we talk, it's not about me protecting a position, it's about what's right for this business, and if I keep an open mind to that, as we discuss it, then we will arrive at a right decision.  You know, they know that they can challenge me without me be feeling threatened, you see.  They know that I can question them without them feeling threatened.  They can talk to me, I can talk to them.
Story_ID: 99171
Speaker 1: You promised your mother [Thelma McBride] to build her a house when you were small; did she live to see your success?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.
Speaker 1: And were you able to fulfill that promise?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.  I built her the house in 1981.  We still have the house.  I--that, for me, was one of the happiest moments of my life was to, to build and furnish this house, have her pick out the materials and appliances and all that stuff and to go through that whole process.  And my mom and dad [Edward McBride] enjoyed that for quite a few years.  My dad passed in '88 [1988], and he was retired by then and they, they fished and they had a little boat, and, and they could go out, you know, and just enjoy life.  So I always like to think that in, in their retirement years that they had some years together where they didn't have to worry about money, you know, how they were going to make it or anything like that.  And one of the things that we did, both Therman [McKenzie] and myself, is that we sent our parents a check every week, not every month, every week they got a check, you know.  And so they had a little money, you know, and they could go out and enjoy.  They had a little boat and they could, you know, just enjoy life.  And so for me, accomplishing that was, was, was just a major accomplishment, in terms of being able to build that house, you know.  But they built--I built them the house and it turned out I, I was down there once, and they had not been used to having central air and the air conditioning went out and the person complaining was my father, you know.  And so, of course, I had to get this air fixed, but, you know, but they got used to--the comfort, you know, and I was happy that they, they--the latter part of their life they lived very well.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 99172
Speaker 1: Is there anything you'd like to add before we end?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we, we've talked about a lot of things.  And like I said, there's a lot more, you know, in-depth stuff that we could've gotten into with respect to different aspect of, of, of my life, and hopefully, in my autobiography that we gonna put together, that I'll be able to cover some of that.  But, but basically, I think that what I've tried to do and what I still try to do is I like the notion of, of giving back, helping others, you know.  I'm not so caught up in just my own success, I'm concerned, and I've tried to, to start with the family, the success of all of them and to advise them, you know.  And so in, in this business, and, and in my life, I'm, I'm always about how do I help somebody else to accomplish their dream, their success as well.
Speaker 1: Thank you so much, Mr. McBride, for your time and for your insight and sharing your experiences.
Speaker 2: Thank you.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: It's wonderful.
Story_ID: 99173
Speaker 1: Mr. McBride, I have a few final questions.  First, you have talked about the importance of giving back to the community.  So what are your concerns with the African-American community and how have you attempted to meet the issues and concerns that are in the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I talk about giving back, I talk about, you know, trying to do things that uplift a community in every way.  I try to do it with, with my presence here, being available to be able to talk to young people.  I've tried to do it with this business and being able to take people who have skills, may not have all of what they need right off the bat, and to show them how they can be successful, and that's why I think that this, this company fulfills a lot of, of what I'm about, you know.  Satisfied me in, in a way that just, just ordinarily, earning a living or doing well would not do, because I feel that we, we are helping people.  And, and what I'm hoping to do is, is, is to always, you know, strive to uplift, and in the future what I hope for is to see the community, more of us adopt that; those of us who are successful.  You know, I'd like to see us stay in, in the community, you know.  I'd like to see us, you know, be accessible to, to young kids coming up, you know, and being involved.  I know that the neighborhood that I live in right now, that some years ago, we, we had a choice, myself and another neighbor, Gregory Baranco, that we could've moved from the community or we could start a new one right here, and we chose to start Sandstone Shores.  And as a result of starting Sandstone Shores, now you have other, you know, communities or other developments in that area of that price range and of that quality that's right here in the community.  And so it really spurned a whole development in South Decatur [Georgia] with the, the price homes that we were able to, to put there.  And so we were involved with trying to make sure now that the community we live in isn't overrun with a whole bunch of commercial development, you know, and I've been able to pass that on.  It surprised me, my son has taken up that, that charge and, and he's leading that, you know, now, making sure that we just stop the big shopping center from coming right down the corner from us, but being totally involved, you know, in a community.  And it extends all the way down to being politically involved, you know, to knowing what the issues are.  You know, I wish that, you know, we would read more, you know.  That we would be more critical when we watched the news, so we'd know what's going on and we can, we can vote accordingly.  I wish that not only that we register to vote, but we go out and vote, you know.  I'd like to see us vote at the same percentage as the general population, you know.  And so a lot of my concerns have to do with bettering ourselves as people, you know, and I want to try to do whatever I can to help that, whatever small way.
Story_ID: 99174
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you a long time from now, after you're gone?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I think that I want people to say that, you know, regardless to what I was able to accomplish, that I remained a common person, you know, that you could talk to him, you know; that success didn't go to my head, you know.  That it wasn't about the material side, it was about people; you know, it was about, bottom line, human being.  When we live here, we don't take nothing with us.  We come here like that, we leave like that.  And if it was possible to take it with you, all them kings and queens of these past years that used to put the stuff in the casket, they would be--they would have theirs.  And so I see a separation between what you accomplish materially, and what you accomplish as a, as a person, as an individual, you know.  So I want to be an inspiration to people to be a better person.  We had talked, we touched on church earlier; I see churches every day, every day that you get up in the morning and go out and start interacting with people, is church, you know, it's how you deal with people, you know.  And so while I can't claim that I'm in the church every week, but I'm in the church every day, you know.  And so that's kind of the way I, I try to live it.
Speaker 1: And beyond that, what message do you want your children, your grandchildren, the world, to know from your life?
Speaker 2: I think that, that, that it's possible to do anything that you want to do, if you, if you stick to it, you know.  If you truly are focused and, and have that guiding light that, that keeps you on that track, you know, and that the thing that you're trying to accomplish got to be genuine stuff, it can't always be about self; it's got to go beyond you, you know.  And I think that when that happens, when you talk about doing something for the good of all, then I think there's a deep motivation inside that helps to drive you, even in the most difficult times, you know.  And I, and I, and I'm happy that I see a lot of that in my kids, you know, the unselfishness, you know.  I remember talking to my daughter about giving her a raise and she was concerned about if she get a raise, was I gonna give her, her cousin a raise.  You know, wait a minute here, I'm talking about you, you know.  But, you know, I, I think that with them, I see a lot of what I've tried to accomplish in my son and stuff, being involved.  With them, never wearing on their shoulder anything that they have been able to accomplish and just being a common everyday person, you know.  Again, that's my theme, you know, that's kind of what I want to be remembered as, just Cornell, you know.
Story_ID: 99175
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: History is important because we learn so much from history.  You know, history to me is, is the building block, you know.  Knowing what happened before allows us to do a better job in the future to prevent what we didn't like and always stay abreast of, of, of what did happen in the past, but only to use it as a reference point; not necessarily to drag it along in the--as, as a chain around our neck to keep us from moving forward, but only as a reference point so that we don't repeat some of that, you know.  As a matter of fact, over the years I've become somewhat of a, of a, of a historian in, in the sense of being involved and inquisitive about different aspects of world events, and I've gone back and read all about World War II and, and [Adolf] Hitler and Nazi Germany and [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt and, and all the rest of them, and, and I find it fascinating, even going back to the Depressions of, of, of '29 [1929] and stuff like that.  Of course, black history as well, just, just being involved, that's something I'm reading now involve, you know, reading about the history of black people, you know.  And also, having lived, I'm now sixty years-old.  Having lived, there was a history that happened, and I now know that even though they say slavery ended in 1864, that it did not end in 1864, that we still had remnants of slavery that ran right up to the '60s [1960s] and the '70s [1970s], you know.  And so they ended different aspects of slavery, but not slavery because we, we were not free, we were, we were still enslaved.  When we could not vote, we were enslaved.  We could not go into places to eat and to, and to rest or whatever, we were enslaved.  Where we could not work, where we--where our talent took us, we were enslaved, you know.  And so slavery, to me, took on different forms, as well as some of the lessons that they tried to--for example, to, to--back in slavery, they changed their ways.  I mean, back in slavery, if a slave got out of hand, they would maybe kill that person in front of the other slaves in the most brutal way.  In modern life, if a black man did something, they, they, they did the same thing in the court system, you know, in the most brutal way.  As long as he did it to--if he did it to another black, not a whole lot happened to him; if he did it to a white, then the book got thrown at him.  And so the lessons of don't mess with--don't do this or don't cross this line continued on.  And so history's important, you know, for us to know and to recognize and understand that. But again, not to use it to keep us down, but to propel us forward.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Story_ID: 99176
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be to the world?
Speaker 2: Again, I think my legacy--I want my legacy to be just, just trying to help people, you know, trying to do good at every turn, you know.  I think that from--on the business side, I want to try to show, you know, people that business is not all that difficult as people make it out to be, but that you have to have some discipline, you know.  And, and you got to be willing to sacrifice, and that, you know, the handling of the, of the funds of business is one of the key reasons why people don't succeed in business is because when we get money in our hands, something else happen to us; sometime the sense of responsibility go out the window, you know, and that should be the beginning of it.  So what I want to try to do with the rest of my life is try to teach people how--whatever business you in, you can be successful in that business, that everything depends on you.  And so from a legacy standpoint, that's the way I see myself, is trying to teach people how to take what they have and doing all that they can with that, and be as successful as they want to be, not just as a businessperson, but as a person, because I happen to believe that it kind of go hand in hand, you know.  You'd be surprised, you know, what people will do or, or what your action may cause a person to do if you are the type of person who is--does not get along with people and, and who is just perceived as a bad person, that that follows you too, you know.  But if you proceed as a good person doing good deeds, that that follows as well.  So I, I think that we, we, we, we, we have an impression or, or that we create an impression of others that we don't realize that it's important to us being successful period, because we never know when we gonna need some help, you know.  And so, again, my legacy, I think, I just want it to be about how do I help somebody else to fulfill their dream, you know, what can I do to help with that?
Speaker 1: Thank you.
