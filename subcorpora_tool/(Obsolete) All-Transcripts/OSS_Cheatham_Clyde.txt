 Neurohr. I   m a librarian at Oklahoma State  University. We are at the OSU ConocoPhillips Alumni Center. Today is  October 21, 2006, and we   re going to be interviewing an alumnus of  OSU, Mr. Clyde Cheatham, for the project O-STATE Stories, an oral  history project of the OSU Library. Mr. Cheatham, when were you a  student at OSU?  I started here in 1938 and went through    42.  And what activities were you involved in when you were a student here?  Well, there was a pep organization called the Ruf Nex, and it didn   t last  through the war. I don   t know what happened. Most of them got killed, I  guess   I mean the leaders. And I belonged to the Alpha Gamma Rho  fraternity. I was a member of Blue Key fraternity. I was on the livestock  judging team and went to the international livestock show in Chicago. I  was on the meat judging team at Fort Worth. Other than that, I worked.  Where did you work when you were a student?  Well, I worked at the meat lab and I worked at a little caf   called  Comanche Caf   across from the fire station. I think it   s closed. It doesn   t  go by that name anymore.  And it sounds like you were busy with several things in the livestock  judging. Did you all have to qualify for the international show? Was that  an honor that your group earned?  Well, there were eighty-some of us in what they called junior judging at  that time. I think   how many went? See the coach is there and then the  rest are team members.  Mr. Cheatham is showing a picture of the team   5  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Oh, and where are you in this picture?  I think I   m right down here.  Okay. So this is your team?  Yes, ma   am.  Well, that   s nice. A nice picture there. So what do you remember about  that trip to Chicago?  I remember how cold it got. (Laughter) In Kansas City, we had to be  pulled up a hill by a bulldozer because there was so much ice. But that   s  in November and you expect cold weather then, there.  And Alpha Gamma Rho is an excellent fraternity from what I   ve been  hearing today. Do you keep in touch with some of your fraternity  brothers     Oh yeah.     or have you been able to keep in touch with them?  Yes. Yes, I do.  Could you tell me a little bit about your experience in AGR  Alpha  Gamma Rho ? Did you live at the fraternity house?  I lived there one semester, and that was all. I had to work and make my  way through school.  Where did you live the rest of your time here?  Well, I lived down on Ramsey. There were fourteen of us lived there in  an old lady   s house.  So it was a boarding house?  No, just rooms.  Just rooms?  Yeah. Seven dollars a month. And then, one year I lived at a place they  called the Frat Shop. I don   t know whether it still exists or not. It was  across the street from the Chi Omega house.  6  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Well, how was it that you ended up coming to Oklahoma State  University? What made you decide to come to OSU?  Well, the banker in my little hometown was a graduate of OSU or  Oklahoma A M at that time, and he   d loan any kid from there money  for fees so I took him up.  What was your major when you were here?  Well, I was in animal science and double major in agriculture education.  And what did you go on to career-wise with that degree, the degrees that  you have?  Well, I spent five years after I got out of college in the Navy. Then I  came back and taught vocational agriculture for nineteen years and then  I went into the grain elevator business.  Well, this weekend is Homecoming weekend. Is this an event that you  come to every year?  I try to, yes.  Do you go to the football games?  Do I?  Do you go to the football game when you come?  Yes.  So you   ve been coming for a number of years. How is Homecoming  different now than when you were a student?  There are more people now but otherwise, not a lot of difference. I had a  small picture and I couldn   t find it. I don   t know where I put it but in the  parade this friend of mine had a horse. See they taught horses in animal  husbandry, and that was a big part of the parade, those type things. But  of course you   ll see that today. (Laughs)  Were there some campus traditions that were going on that you  remember when you were here?  Well, one of the main things is we had a little rivalry with the University  of Oklahoma and what we called,    guarding the campus.    And the  University of Tulsa had a good football team in those years, and we had  7  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  a little rival with them.  So what was that about,    guarding the campus?    Did students     Well, they   d try to paint, especially Old Central. That was the building  they kind of cherished here.  So would students stay out all night to guard Old Central?  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. One time by the old AGR house near Theta Pond   it  was about two o   clock in the morning and a car didn   t stop. One of the  guys threw a two by four through his windshield and that caused quite a  stir, you know? We had to meet with Dean McElroy, Dean of Men, and  he acted like he was tough as nails. But I think he was glad we shattered  the windshield. He had about as much love for OU  University of  Oklahoma  as I do. (Laughter)  What were the buildings like here on campus? Where did students go  and hang out? Where were the classes held?  Well, Swim   s was one of the main places along with Aggie Drug. When  I was in school, they had social hour and all the sororities would sponsor  an hour dance around dinnertime   and the dormitories like Murray Hall  and North Murray. Willard Hall was built while I was in school here and  the year I started was the year Cordell Hall opened. There was always  something to do.  How did students dress back then when they went to classes?  Oh, if I really dressed up, I wore striped overalls. What year were jeans  invented?  I think they were invented in California for the miners, so maybe the  1800   s, early 1900   s.  When did they really start wearing jeans? See, that was after I was in  school. The guys who had a little bit of money wore slacks. About fifty  percent of us wore overalls.  Did you have a car when you were in school?  There was one car at our fraternity house.  So that was unusual then, for anybody to have a car? (Laughter)  There weren   t many cars.  8  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  How often did you go home when you were in school?  I went home maybe once a semester. When I worked at the Comanche  Caf  , the owner there had a contract with the Athletic Department to  feed the basketball team. And the basketball team would play in the all-college  tournament in Oklahoma City. So we stayed and worked there.  And of course there weren   t very many eating places.  When you think about the classes that you took here at OSU, is there a  favorite class or a favorite professor that comes to mind?  Oh   one that was good, Bruce Taylor. He was a good professor.  What did you like about him?  Well, he was honest and he was very sincere, very straightforward and  very intelligent. Of course, there were others. There were some I didn   t  care much about.  Do you remember when the name of the university changed from OAMC  to     Well, it was in the    50s. I didn   t take any part in that. I thought it was  really fair that they do it that way. See, this was pretty much an  agricultural school in the beginning and always had a good engineering,  good business school. And I think it   s kind of unfair now the way the  Board of Regents are selected because there are other good schools  within this university. Give you an idea of the thinking in those times     the majority of the legislators were from the rural area. The president of  the state board of agriculture was automatically a member of the Board  of Regents. When they built Gallagher Hall, they called it,    The 4-H and  FFA Convention Center,    and that got the rural vote. The only vote that  opposed was the president of the state board of agriculture, Joe Scott.  His daughter, during the interim, married an All-Missouri Valley  basketball player that played here   but it was   I thought it was kind of  unusual that he wouldn   t vote for an arena like that.  Well, what was Theta Pond like when you were a student here? Was it     About like it is now.  Just about like it is now?  Probably as cold as it was when I was thrown in there.  You were thrown in Theta Pond?  9  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Oh yeah. That was kind of a tradition with a lot of fraternities.  Was it for the freshmen that were   experienced that?  Pledges.  The pledges? And what was the mascot when you were here? Did we  have Pistol Pete as a mascot?  Not then. Not when I was in school. I don   t know when he started. I  knew the old Pistol Pete.  Did you meet Mr. Eaton, Frank Eaton?  Yes.  What do you remember about him?  Oh, he was a rugged old individual. Shoot that pistol.  Did he?  Oh yeah.  On campus?  Well, I don   t know about on campus. One time in Guthrie, Eaton was  invited over by some of his friends and I remember I was there that  night. Dr. Ringrose, one of the old doctors there in Guthrie, had a little  party for individuals, and there was a salesman   clothing salesman who  sold men   s clothing. I asked him,    Can you shoot that?    And about that  time a mouse ran out the door, and he just blew him up.  He did?  He was good. You know, he trained because his daddy was murdered  when he was fourteen years old. One of the best pistol people taught him  and he followed those people for three or four years when he was a kid.  You know, he was historical.  He was a colorful character?  Oh yes.  Did he come on campus for different things that you remember?  10  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Well, yeah. Parades, events and things like that.  So did everyone feel a fondness for him?  As far as I know.  And so before he became the mascot, what was the mascot?  I don   t know.  Was it the Tigers when you were here? I had heard   the Tigers.  See this school got its colors and part of its early tradition from  Princeton, so that   s probably right.  Do you remember seeing the college administrators much out on  campus, the president of the college?  Not really. Dr. Bennett was in so many different things. He was more or  less a world leader and got things done.  He did. And there was a lot of growth on the campus when you were  here, then you mentioned some of the buildings that were new, so I   m  sure that there were many more students coming and     Yeah, of course, just across the street was the Dairy Barn and they  turned part of that old Dairy Barn into office space. It   s changed.  What was Old Central used for?  I went to class there.  You had classes there? And you said it was a very highly revered  building     Yes.     that you all protected it and   so were your classes large or small?  Oh, twenty-five, thirty. That   s where I had most all of my vocational  agriculture classes.  Did you have any other family members that came to Oklahoma State  University?  Let   s see, I had Charlie, Jack, Bill and Harold   I had four brothers  11  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  and     How about any of your kids?  Yes, my son and two daughters.  And do you have grandchildren that have come to OSU also?  I have two grandsons in school here now.  So it   s a very strong family connection?  Pretty much, yes. You don   t see much red in our family.  What do you think it is about OSU that everyone feels so strong about it  that they come back for Homecoming and have family members who  come here? Why do you think that is? What is special about Oklahoma  State University?  Well, it was just   they taught us when we were freshmen at orientation,  you say,    Howdy.    You spoke to everyone and had a feeling for  everybody.  Do you think it   s still that way here?  Well, pretty much. I see them greet each other around here on campus  now. It   s pretty much the same.  Have you given your grandsons any advice about coming to school here  or being a college student?  Well, my youngest grandson was born in Tulsa but he lived all of his life  up to now in Ohio, and I encouraged him to come here because the  tuition would be   well, if your relatives, I don   t know how far down,  are graduates, you pay the same tuition. And him being in Ohio, you  know, I didn   t get to see those kids much. His mother brought him down  here. She wanted to verify the tuition costs   which was great. He   s been  a great joy to Molly and I. And then my other grandson that   s in school  here now, his dad and mother both went to school here. And my only  granddaughter, she graduated here and her husband graduated here. All  OSU people.  What would you tell future students of OSU or people that are thinking  about where they want to come? What advice would you have for them?  Well, I just think it   s a good school, good friendly atmosphere. Some  12  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  outstanding people graduated from this school.  Okay, do you have anything else you want to share with us today?  You didn   t ask me about my biggest disappointment.  What was your biggest disappointment?  They fired a baseball coach that had been here twenty-six years. He  recruited Pete Incaviglia, Robin Ventura, Dougie DeCino. Most of the  real high-class players, he recruited. When he started here, the Tom  Holliday group started. Tom Holliday would go to California and recruit  with a twenty-five dollar a day expense account, and they fired him and  paid the incoming coach twice as much money as they were paying him.  That   s my biggest disappointment.  What kind of pictures did you bring today in your album? We might  want to look at those just a minute. Tell me about this picture.  Well, that   s the steer that the college had that was grand champion.  Hold it up so the camera can see it.  Does that have it right, at the international livestock show? The fella  there, was what they call the herdsman   beef cattle. He was noted as  one of the best in the business.  What do you have to do to get cattle ready to show?  Well, groom them about like women groom their hair   use the same  ingredients. (Laughter)  So, does it take quite awhile?  Yes. It   s quite a chore.  Do the cattle seem to like it?  Oh, yeah. (Laughter) Very seldom do you ever see an animal really  make a resistance when he knows he   s gonna get washed and groomed.  Do you have any other pictures in there that we might want to hear  about?  Oh, I don   t know. I didn   t find a picture of the meat judging team. These  fellas here, I think, well, half of these guys are still living.  13  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Neurohr  Cheatham  Who are the people in this picture?  Well, that was my first wife. She went to school here.  And was this a picture of you then?  Yes.  Is that when you were a college student you think? Yeah?  Yes.  Okay.  Let   s see. Where   s the picture when I was in the Navy?  I think it was back a couple of pages. Yeah. We     Nothing of much significance there, I don   t think.  Back   keep going back that way. Right there.  We were probably the first class to graduate here that everybody had a  job before they got out of school   Navy, Army, Air Force, Marines. If  you were healthy, you had a job.  Well, is there anything else that you want to tell us about today?  No.  We thank you very much for coming today.  Sure, thank you.  -------  -------
