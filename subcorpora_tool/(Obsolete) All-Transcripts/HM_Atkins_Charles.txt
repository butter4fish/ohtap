Story_ID: 665430
Speaker 1: So we'll start with what we call People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, I believe that really well done macaroni and cheese is a great food. And I think some really great peach pie with a lot of, with a crust that has a lot of butter and the, and it has to use fresh peaches with a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg.
Speaker 1: Sounds delicious.
Speaker 2: And some Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream on top.
Speaker 1: Sold.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: That's, I guess I like fall, I guess fall and, fall and spring apart from allergies.
Speaker 1: Great.
Speaker 2: You know fall or spring, yeah.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I like, I like a lot of Caribbean beaches, so different, different beaches; Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Angola. And then I also like Aspen [Colorado]. Aspen is a great spot. The air is just crisp and it's, it is cool.

Story_ID: 665431
Speaker 1: Now I'd like to talk about your family.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Let's start with your father.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me his name, when and where he was born? Tell me about him and his family please.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. Well my, my father was a great, great man. His name was also Charles Nathaniel Atkins [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.], and I was supposed to be Charles Nathaniel Atkins, Jr., but my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] and dad did not ever want me to be called Junior and so they, and so, and so they correctly added a second. But he was a great man. He was born in the British West Indies, Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago], on October 11, 1911. He came to the U.S. through Ellis Island [New York, New York] and grew up in Harlem [New York, New York]. So he came here in the late 1920s at the whole time of Marcus Garvey, and so he was part of the Harlem world. And, and he, he talks about how the Urban League [National Urban League] found him a summer job that, you know, enabled him to save enough money to attend college [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], and so the, the Urban League he, he was a summer camp counselor at one of the African American camps and I don't know if it was at Camp Atwater [North Brookfield, Massachusetts], but it was one of the East Coast African American camps, and so that was how he was able to, to basically finance college. And to say how much of a small world it is, I've been here in New York [New York] for--since, since 1985. I've known [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor, who's editor of Essence magazine, for maybe twenty-five years, and just, just a few years ago, she asked me, she said, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles N. Atkins], are you related to a Charles Atkins who was from Trinidad and was a doctor in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]?" And I said, "Yes, that was my father." And she said, "Well Charles, my uncle, Uncle Arnold [Arnold Weekes, Jr.], was your father's best friend in Harlem, and he would always talk about Charles Atkins and also Ma Atkins [Gertrude Atkins]," and Ma Atkins was my, my, my father's mother who was a seamstress, and, but she was loved by everybody in that particular neighborhood, and, and her uncle Arnold was, you know, he was like another son to my grandmother. And so it's just--really is just a small, small world that Susan Taylor's uncle was my father's best friend growing up.
Story_ID: 665432
Speaker 1: Question.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: In--did your father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] tell you any stories about living in Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago]?
Speaker 2: He would say that he was from the West African ethnic group. He pronounced it Yoruba, for Yoruba.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he talked a little bit about, about picking fruit and how sweet the, the, the fruit was. He talked about his strict education, and it was more of a British education. And, and he was, but he talked about how once he left he did not really want to go back. But he did talk about one particular area of Trinidad and, and it was called Maraval, which is right outside of, which is right outside of Port of Spain [Trinidad and Tobago], and I just made my first trip to Trinidad last year and went to that area, and so I could see where, where Ma Atkins [Atkins' paternal grandmother, Gertrude Atkins] lived. I could see where my, my, my dad lived, but he really saw himself as, as a New Yorker.
Speaker 1: At what age did he move?
Speaker 2: I believe he was around eighteen or nineteen.
Speaker 1: Oh, so he really grew up in Trinidad.
Speaker 2: Well, yes, but, yes, right.
Speaker 1: So making that conscious choice of claiming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, yes.
Speaker 1: --New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he was old enough to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --understand what that choice meant.
Speaker 2: He, he just came over on a ship. It was cold, he didn't have a coat, and--
Speaker 1: Did he come by himself?
Speaker 2: I believe, yes, except that I think there was one other, one other cousin who, who was on that ship, Oxley family [ph.], but his, his, his mom was already here--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and so he was raised by his, by his grandmother a little bit in, in Trinidad.
Speaker 1: So then did, because this is a common story in the West Indies--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so the parents or parent would come first--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and then send for the children after a certain point.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's what happened for him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how many siblings are in his family?
Speaker 2: He had one sister, yes.
Speaker 1: And was she already there, or did she come?
Speaker 2: I think that she came later. I'm not quite sure when she came, Aunt Gladys, Aunt Gladys [Gladys Atkins Starks] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So he, he, he came, and this is during the Marcus Garvey era.
Speaker 2: Late 1920s, yeah.
Speaker 1: So Harlem [New York, New York] was on fire.
Speaker 2: Yes it was, yes it was.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about Garvey and?
Speaker 2: Well he talked about a little bit later with basically dances and the zoot suits and the long chains, and so, you know, basically 1930s, 1940s, you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did he live, do you know?
Speaker 2: He lived I think at 113th Street. I saw an older address of around 156th Street. In fact I have his high school yearbook from, from DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York]. He was in the class of 1933 and, and it was all white. And so he was one of the few black students in high school here.
Speaker 1: In the '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Unusual.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What did his father do?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know a lot about his, his, his dad. His, his father's name was St. John Atkins [ph.] and he had died and I think that he had died before he, he died before my father came over.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: And so, and so I don't know much about him.
Speaker 1: And at, so he lived with his mother?
Speaker 2: Here, yes.
Speaker 1: Yes. And what was her work? She was a seamstress?
Speaker 2: Seamstress, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your father's family?
Speaker 2: That is about as far as I can go (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: On my mom's [Hannah Diggs Atkins] side I can go back a little bit further, yes.
Story_ID: 665433
Speaker 1: Your father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.], tell me, he was a doctor (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and a librarian?
Speaker 2: Well no, my, my mother [Hannah Diggs Atkins] was a librarian--
Speaker 1: Oh okay, got it.
Speaker 2: --but, but my father's story is an incredible story. He came through Ellis Island [New York, New York] as I said. He, he was able to go to St. Augustine's College [St. Augustine's University] in Raleigh, North Carolina. He, he was an older student and he met my mother there. My mom was a, she was a high school--she went to college at the age of fifteen, but after, well I guess I'll go through the St. Augustine's--St. Augustine's was a rich--it was [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's college job. He had just received his doctorate from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] in history and his first teaching job was at, was at this small Episcopalian African American liberal arts college. And he was my mother's freshman advisor and lifelong friend. And we'll get to the Oklahoma story, but, but, of course, John Hope Franklin was, was born in one of those black towns in Oklahoma, and so there's a whole story about Oklahoma which, which, which we will get to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my father was, was basically thirty-one years old when he married my mom, who was nineteen on her graduation day, and so here was a dark skinned, dark skinned West Indian foreigner who was a New Yorker, who basically married a light skinned, a light skinned woman from an elite black family in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], and so, of course, my mom's, my mom's parents [Mabel Kennedy Diggs and James T. Diggs, Sr.] were not happy. This older guy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, with her, her, with their little girl, but, you know, it, it has worked out well.
Story_ID: 665434
Speaker 1: My dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] he served in the, in the [U.S.] Army in, basically during World War II [WWII]. He was, he was part of the segregated troops. He was, he was stationed in Seattle [Washington] and he was working in the pharmacy on the base and because he did--and he basically tells me that because he did such a good job, he was kept back while all of the rest of his guys were shipped overseas and fought on the front lines. And so he stayed back and eventually went to medical school on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]. And he did well at Meharry medical school in Nashville [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]. And as, and he did his internship at a black hospital in my mother's hometown, Winston-Salem [North Carolina], it was, it was Katie B. Reynolds hospital [Kate Bitting Reynolds Memorial Hospital]. And while he was an intern he read a, he read a magazine article in an American health journal, about a black man in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] named, and his, his name was W.J. Edwards [Walter J. Edwards]. And W.J. Edwards was one of the early black millionaires who started out as a junk dealer and ended up basically building three whole neighborhoods of wonderful single family bungalows, homes for working class and the middle class African Americans in Oklahoma City during the 1930s and 1940s. And he went to President Truman [President Harry S. Truman] and lobbied to get FHA loans [Federal Housing Administration] for, for African Americans, and the first FHA loans for blacks were for homes in Oklahoma City built by, built by Mr. Edwards. And Mr. Edwards, when his, his wife [Frances Waldrop Edwards] got ill in Oklahoma City, she was not allowed to be treated at any of the white hospitals. And so Mr. Edwards sent, he took her to the Mayo Clinic [Rochester, Minnesota], you know he was rich. And when he came back he said, he said, "Darn, I'm gonna build a hospital." And so he built Edwards hospital [Edwards Memorial Hospital, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and my dad, my dad read about that story, which is online now--had found that same article, which is online now and he saw that article and he said black folks are doing things in Oklahoma City, and so he, so he, so he moved my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] and my older brother [Edmund E. Atkins] to Oklahoma City. He did his, he did his residency at Edwards hospital, which was the first hospital in the South that had an integrated medical staff. And then I was born in Edwards hospital in, on Christmas day in 1952. My mom always says that I was her best Christmas present.
Story_ID: 665435
Speaker 1: I attended Edwards Elementary School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] starting out, and we lived in Edwards Addition [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. And so I have a photographs of our first house in the, in what is now the Edwards historical district [Edwards Community, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. And so that is how we got to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]. And what people don't know about Oklahoma is that the, the name of Oklahoma means land of the red man, and also that there was a migration movement of blacks into Oklahoma in the 1880s, 1890s in order to establish a black state. And so you had fifty black towns in Oklahoma and, and so all of the, [President] Andrew Jackson, of course, forced all of the southeastern tribes into Oklahoma. You have the--and each tribe had a different relationship with the African American. Cherokee, slave Seminoles had black chiefs and, and so I have, I have a Cherokee heritage, as well as African American heritage, as well as Scotch Irish heritage, as well as Trinidadian West African heritage and African American heritage, so I'm a real mix here, but, but all--
Speaker 2: As Trinidadians are also, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. And so my particular story is, it is an American story, it is part of the, of a migration west in terms of seeking opportunities. My father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] didn't know anybody in Oklahoma and, and he, so he was a immigrant from, from Trinidad. He took that long trip and he also brought our young family west. And so it's part of the movement of African Americans to the U.S. and, and also west.
Story_ID: 665436
Speaker 1: Let's bring your mother into the story (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes. Well Hannah Mariah Diggs [Hannah Diggs Atkins] was one of six siblings. The, the Diggs family in, in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], and she was part of the Diggs and also Kennedy clan. Her, her mother was Mabel Kennedy Diggs, and the Kennedy family was a prominent African American family, which included the college president of Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], a college which was Winston-Salem Teachers College then, also St. Augustine's College [St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina]. The first African American bank [Mechanics and Farmers Bank, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] was also founded by one of my mother's uncles [William J. Kennedy, Jr.].
Speaker 1: You know his name?
Speaker 2: Francis Kennedy [Francis Marion Kennedy, Sr.]. He was also college president of both of those schools.
Speaker 1: Same person?
Speaker 2: Yes [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes. And so you have, you have the whole Kennedy side and so some of my cousins were, were, were quite, quite prominent lawyers. Harold Kennedy [Harold Kennedy, Jr.] and his wife, Annie Kennedy [Annie Brown Kennedy]. Annie Kennedy was in the, in the North Carolina legislature [North Carolina General Assembly] and the, and on the board of regents.
Speaker 1: This is his wife?
Speaker 2: Yes. This is Harold Kennedy who is the son [sic. grandson] of Francis Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my mother's cousins and my, my second or third cousins, and so I ended up basically going to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] with, with, with, with one of my cousins, Harvey Kennedy. And so, you know, a great family.
Story_ID: 665437
Speaker 1: About your mother's family, because you, you've described their prominence in the community--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --how far back do they go and do you know when the wealth began in the family?
Speaker 2: Well, well I know that on my, on my, on my mother's father's side, which is the, the Diggs side, I--we must--I've seen a particular photograph of my, my great-great-grandparents and all that I can remember was my grandfather saying that he was happy, he was now happy that his particular parents did not allow him to play with some other kids because they were trying to maintain a focus on education and standards. And so my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] I think is, is a--third generation college educated because her, her, her particular grandfather, which was her father's--her, her father's father, was schooled in Latin and in Greek and, and he became, and his name was Jefferson Davis Diggs and so we have a line of, you know, it's that Scotch Irish, a line of that Jefferson Davis Diggs there.
Speaker 1: That's her grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes. And, and so he was a, quite, quite prominent minister in, in, in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] and there's a school named him [Jefferson Davis Diggs Elementary School; Diggs-Latham Elementary Magnet School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. And he, he started out in the, the A.M.E. Zion church [African Methodist Episcopal Zion] and then he became much more, much more of a spiritualist and, and he really founded, he was one of the early founders of the Holiness church, and so he was, he had a huge church there. But on my grandmother's side, all Episcopalians, and so--
Speaker 1: Very different. Wow (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. And so Episcopalians won out here.
Speaker 1: Those are two completely diverse (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes. But, but my, my, my great-grandfather, Jefferson Davis Diggs, was, he was a man of letters and so he named his son, one of his sons who was my grandfather, James Thackeray Diggs [James T. Diggs, Sr.], after one of the English writers or English poets [William Makepeace Thackeray]. And so my, so my grandfather was a major contractor and a major builder, and in the 1930s he was building gas stations for, for Shell Oil [Shell Oil Company] and for Texaco [Texaco, Inc.] and so he was a well known builder. And he was also college educated at Winston-Salem State--State and Normal School, Winston-Salem State [sic. Slater Industrial and State Normal School; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina], as well as my, as my grandmother [Mabel Kennedy Diggs], and so each one of their children all received graduate education.
Story_ID: 665438
Speaker 1: One of my mother's brothers was an artist. He was also, you know, James Thackeray Diggs [James T. Diggs, Jr.], and he was chair of, of art at Winston-Salem State College [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. And the art gallery there is also named after him [Diggs Gallery]. One of my other uncles, Edward Oscar Diggs [Edward O. Diggs, Sr.], was the first African American to graduate from the, from the University of North Carolina medical school [University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina], and so he was an early doctor. And then the eldest, eldest child, Rachel Diggs, Rachel Diggs Wilkerson, got her Ph.D. from, from Teachers College here at Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], and she was a, a, a, a major professor at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York] here, and she in the 1950s and '60s [1960s] really started the, the SEEK program [Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge], which was a remedial education program for basically City College students.
Speaker 2: And she started that?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, Rachel Wilkerson.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And two of the sisters, basically, Jessie [Jessie Diggs Kearney], who was head of art for the Durham Public Schools, she was an artist. And also Gloria Banks [Gloria Diggs Banks] who just, just turned ninety. She was a schoolteacher in Yonkers [New York], AKAs, AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's very impressive. Oh, all AKAs okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes. And so my, my mom, Hannah Mariah Diggs [Hannah Diggs Atkins], was, she was valedictorian in her high school class [at Atkins High School; Atkins Academic and Technology High School, Winston-Salem, North Carolina]. She, she graduated with honors at St. Aug [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina]. She was a, she was a French teacher. She was a li- a librarian, she attended graduate school at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in the, the 1950s and so she was infused with Great Books and Robert Hutchins [Robert Maynard Hutchins], you know the whole University of Chicago experience was one of--a great experience for her.
Story_ID: 665439
Speaker 1: And so we have here, here is, (displays photograph) here is my--this is in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], in, on November 7th in 1955. This is a particular photograph that was done by an Associated Press for--person. This was upon the, the, upon the particular ruling by the Interstate Commerce Commission that basically train travel in, would, would basically no longer be, be segregated. And so this was in the Santa Fe train station, Oklahoma City [Santa Fe Depot, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], in 1955, and so I'm that young, almost three year old, in my dad's [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] arms and we were a nice looking Negro family, and we were looking up at a sign that said Negro waiting room. And so this is the whole story about how I was born into Jim Crow. As a, as a young child at the ages of four and five I remember participating in sit-in demonstrations in Oklahoma City, which were 1957, 1958. We had the longest continuous sit-in of demonstration in American history, which was, which was basically prior to Greensboro [North Carolina] in 1960. In Oklahoma City, the NAACP Youth Council led by Miss, Miss Clara Luper, all of us marched, and so as a child I marched. And I have vivid memories of white and colored signs. And, and, and so I also attended an outstanding segregated elementary school, Edwards Elementary School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], where I, I got a, a great start and then in 1965, we--our particular family is third or fourth generation Episcopalian, active in the Episcopal church in Oklahoma City. My older brother Edmund [Edmund E. Atkins] who was in that particular photo, was not allowed to attend the Episcopal prep school in Oklahoma City, which is Casady School, which is still absolutely the best school in Oklahoma, Casady School. He was not allowed to attend even though it is an Episcopal school.
Speaker 2: Because he was black?
Speaker 1: Yes. And it was all-white.
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was up until '65 [1965]. In '65 [1965] I was part of four students who integrated Casady School as sixth graders, and it was all students from our church, and which was a black Episcopalian church in Oklahoma City, the wonderful, the wonderful Church of the Redeemer [Episcopal Church of the Redeemer] and so I integrated Casady School, a tremendous education. I studied classical Greek. I studied Latin. I studied French. It was, it was a top notch, you know, more of a New England style prep school with, with chapel every day, uniforms, jackets and ties at chapel and at lunch and I have lifelong friends. It was a tremendously positive experience integrating that.
Story_ID: 665440
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about the moment of integration.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because, because you describe it as positive after you're in the school [Casady School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], I would imagine that not everybody was positive at the point that this group of students from your church [Episcopal Church of the Redeemer, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] is coming.
Speaker 2: You know what? It was, there was only one guy, only one student--you know we were all sixth graders and so I was nervous. It was a change. I had, I took a lot of stomach medicine, but you know what, it was a little stressful, but everybody was, was wonderful. We had, I had basically a party at our house and white kids came, and, in fact, one of my, there were a few Jewish students there, and one of the Jewish students who was my, my, my sixth grade classmate, his name now is, he is the chief of medicine at Sloan Kettering [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York] right here, and he was so kind when my dear Gayle [Atkins' wife, Gayle Perkins Atkins] was there, but Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, but, you know, he was one of the, you know, cool kids and we had a great time, and so I had a very, very positive story.
Story_ID: 665441
Speaker 1: Before we continue with that, I wanna go backwards for a minute.
Speaker 2: That's, that's my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins], I have a lot--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I wanna, I wanna get because we're moving forward from your childhood, so I just wanna ask you, when you, when you were born--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or as far back as you recall--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember, I remember playing in the yard in this little bungalow in Edwards Addition [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. I remember the bunk beds with my older brother [Edmund E. Atkins]. I was on the bottom, he was on top. I remember my, my, my Superman suit. (Gesture) I love Superman. I would fly, you know, with the suit. I remember the black and white TV. I remember watching Liberace and, and the (unclear) shows and all of the, and the local kid shows. I remember the Mickey Mouse group ['The Mickey Mouse Club'], you know, with the ears, you know, Annette Funicello. I mean I was a child of the '50s [1950s], child of the '50s [1950s] who moved into the 1960s. I remember my first airplane flight. I was four or five flying to Winston-Salem [North Carolina] on Eastern Air Lines. I remember, I have a vivid memory of basically playing Chinese checkers and pickup sticks with my [maternal] grandfather [James T. Diggs, Sr.]. I remember my, my, my grandfather, basically teaching me how to, how to clip nails. He said, "Don't make it too round, you know, because, because you'll get ingrown nails." I was four or five. I remember my kindergarten class in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma]. We had rugs and we had naptime and twice, twice during class we would ride around on tricycles. I, I remember all of my elementary school teachers [at Edwards Elementary School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], Mrs. Robinson [ph.] was my kindergarten teacher, Mrs. (Unclear) was my first, my first grade teacher. Mrs. Johnson [ph.] was my second grade teacher. Mrs. Smith [ph.]--third grade I went to a different school [Casady School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], but fourth grade Mrs. Smith, and so I had wonderful memories of a play of--my mom would take me to, to science classes, dance classes, modern dance, ballet, Boy Scouts [Boy Scouts of America], everything that she could do to enrich this young black man. My mom and dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] did. My dad would cook us a breakfast every morning and he would drive us to school. I remember driving to school and passing by everyday an amusement park that I could not go to because it was for whites only. And I still remember white and colored signs.
Story_ID: 665442
Speaker 1: When you think of the house where you grew up and the neighborhood you grew up in, what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember as a little boy?
Speaker 2: Well, there were two houses. Our first house was the little, a little cape in the Edwards Addition [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. I remember a small, a small swing set in the back. I remember getting stung by a wasp and my dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] helping to treat it. I remember, you know, by the age of, of I would say six, we, a group of black doctors and dentists and also school teachers, all of us moved outside of the segregated area of Oklahoma City [Oklahoma], and moved to a rural part of Oklahoma City where there was a white man who sold land to African Americans. And each of us had five acre plots. And so it was a fantastic, fantastic childhood growing up on five acres. And you might know one of my next door neighbors, Judy Byrd [Judith Byrd Blaylock].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, Judy Byrd and the Byrd family grew up, were right next door to us. And so I would play with Judy. I used to drive Judy to school, but it was a group of, it was a group of maybe five or six families that all moved to rural, a rural part of Oklahoma City and had five acres (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear), it was a conscious decision that everybody--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know how this farmer was identified and that, that relationship even occurred?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but, but we all had wonderful ranch houses, big ranch houses and patios, lots of space. Our house was on top of a hill. I used to throw a lot of parties when I was in high school [Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], but--
Speaker 1: And everyone built the houses 'cause you just bought, you bought plots and built your own (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, modular, modular homes, but brick homes, wonderful homes and those homes are still there now. And, and so it was a great childhood. We would ride bikes, I would ride bikes for miles. There were ranches and feed farms all around us, oil wells, of course, Oklahoma. And so I had a great childhood, basically riding bikes, camping out in the backyard. Dr. Biscoe [Byron Biscoe] who was next door, who was a, a dentist, had a big pond and so I would fish and so it was really just a fantastic childhood.
Story_ID: 665443
Speaker 1: Now you're--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You, you mentioned the park where you can't go because it was whites only (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: This contrast of great childhood with all these wonderful things that you're experiencing, but you were also in the Deep South where--
Speaker 2: With Jim Crow, yes.
Speaker 1: With Jim Crow.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there any experiences that you had that may be less benign than just seeing the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes. Well I will say that all of the family did a great job shielding us from a lot of racism. When I was maybe about seven years old, I integrated the YMCA camp [Young Men's Christian Association]. It was a day camp. And so every day when I would be at the bus stop to go to camp, there was another little white boy who would always kick me and call me nigger, and my dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] was from a generation that said, "God curses those who first get mad." And so he, every day when he would drive me to school, he would say the same thing, "God curses those who first get mad." And he said, "If anybody, if anybody calls you a name, it, it, it is their problem, it not your problem, don't fight, don't strike back, keep on with where you're trying to go. Don't, don't get distracted and don't get thrown off course." And so he would reinforce that every single day it was that father, son talk, you know, and so I had the father, son talk every day.
Speaker 1: And how, how many years are between you and the brother [Edmund E. Atkins]?
Speaker 2: Eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you were really, he was already gone (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right. It was like the--three only children.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Eight years between me and my older brother and, and almost seven years between me and my younger sister [Valerie Atkins Alexander].
Speaker 1: Okay. So this--you get the only child experience in a family of three.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And how hard was it for you? I mean yes, you're getting this mantra from your father every day, but somebody calls you that, the kids are in your face--
Speaker 2: It just hurt, it just hurt. And so, so I grew into, I was born into Jim Crow. I was active in the traditional Civil Rights Movement as a young, young child. I integrated camp, integrated Casady School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] and I grew into the Black Power movement, and so when I was in, when I was in say the seventh and eighth grade, I was part of an interracial youth group where it was a white guy, it was a Jewish guy, it was me and another African American student who went around to white, white church youth groups talking about race. And so, we would go into all-white groups and, and it was part of an effort to really help with racial understanding and then I, I grew from that to being part of a, a group of, of black students from four or five high schools. I was one of four student leaders from different high schools. We called our group ICBM, which was Inner City Black Movement [ph.], and we had a lot of walkouts and demonstrations because this was at the start of school integration, so this was 1969, 1970 and 1971, and so we had a lot of, of, in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] they had just started a, basically public high school integration in '69 [1969], '69 [1969], '70 [1970], '71 [1971].
Story_ID: 665444
Speaker 1: So the integration of the schools starts late. Understand, you know, the, the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, the busing--
Speaker 1: --the law is passed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but then it takes a while for it to get to Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: All due deliberate speed, you know, Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], all due deliberate speed, you know, in a lot of places, massive resistance, there was not, there was not that in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] but, you know, it took a while. And so it really came to a head, you know, in the 1970s, just like Boston [Massachusetts], you know, '68 [1968]--excuse me '78 [1978], '79 [1979] in Boston, but we, we had a lot of walkout demonstrations. We had a, there was an assistant principal at Northeast High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. We had so much influence that he came to us asking if he should resign.
Speaker 1: To the students?
Speaker 2: Yes. He came to our leadership group [Inner City Black Movement (ph.)] saying, "I want peace. If I should resign, I will resign." We, we had sit-ins, we had sit-ins at the state capitol [Oklahoma State Capitol, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. We raised the red, black and green flag, the black liberation flag on the state capitol grounds and--there 'til next week, the state legislature [Oklahoma Legislature] passed a law about the flags and, and only certain flags could actually fly on, on public grounds as a result of our raising that particular flag. The night that I slept on the steps of the state capitol, we all, we sat-in and just slept on those steps. It was a cold night, but this was, this was 1971. It was going into my senior year [at Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. I had a track meet, I was a high jumper in high school. And so the, the same night I slept on the steps of the state capitol, I set an indoor record in the high jump at the Jaycee International [Junior Chamber International] indoor meet. I jumped six feet and ten inches, over my height, about six inches over my height, about seven inches over my height in my best, that was my best jump, was when we were basically protesting, so it was great.
Speaker 1: And the protesting and standing up was part of your family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --culture.
Story_ID: 665445
Speaker 1: Tell me about your mother--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as it relates to protests and activism.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes. Well, well my mom started out as a French teacher and a li- a librarian. She, she rose to be head, the chief reference librarian for the State of Oklahoma. She participated in the 1964 World's Fair here in New York [New York World's Fair, New York, New York] as, as part of the Library/U.S.A. exhibit, where they had this whole new thing called a mainframe computer, and so she was doing library cards on computer. And so she was, from her father [James T. Diggs, Sr.], she tells about how her dad would always try to go and vote in North Carolina, and how he was, he was beat up and he was turned away, but he would go, he would go and try to vote every single year. And my mom was one of the, she was a maverick in her particular family. Everybody attended Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem Teachers College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] except her. She went to St. Augustine's [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] and so--
Speaker 1: Why, why did she bring home?
Speaker 2: Well, she just wanted to have a lot more independence, and there was a family association with that school as well, but she wanted to get out of Winston-Salem [North Carolina], away from all of her siblings, and so she always had an independent streak, which was also, also demonstrated when she married this older guy who was a foreigner and was a New Yorker, but she saw a lot of potential, as did he. So when, so she was active. My father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] was an Urban Leaguer. He was the first black on the Oklahoma City Council in 1966. He was appointed, he was active in, he was an inside man, active on the Oklahoma state human rights commission [Oklahoma Human Rights Commission], Urban League [Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City, Inc., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], Opportunities Industrialization Centers [OIC]. He was a close friend of Leon Sullivan and our families are close still. But he was a inside man, Hannah [Atkins' mother, Hannah Diggs Atkins] was a, she was a protester. And so my older brother [Edmund E. Atkins] and me and my mom were all active with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and with, and with Clara Luper. And so my mom and I participated in these early sit-ins in the 1950s.
Story_ID: 665446
Speaker 1: In 1968, my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] was, she was basically, she was planning to get her, her doctorate in government, and, but after the King assassination [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], Dr. Frank Cox [Frank B. Cox], who was active in the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City, Inc., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], he was also basically partner with my father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] in the first black bank in Oklahoma City [Lincoln National Bank, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. Dr. Frank Cox, he was also one of those families in those five acre plots, came to my mom and said, "You should run for office." My dad had been on the city council [Oklahoma City Council]. He was appointed, and he, and he ran and then he lost. That was in 1966. So in '68 [1968] my mom said sure and so she, she ran for an open House seat that had just been redistricted, and out of a field of twelve, she went into a runoff and she won and she served in the Oklahoma House of Representatives for twelve years. She was the first African American woman in the Oklahoma House of Representatives. She, she chaired legislative committees on mental health. She, as a state representative, she participated in the sanitation workers strike and march. She was active for the Equal Rights Amendment. She was a very, very ardent feminist, which came from her mom [Mabel Kennedy Diggs], which did not allow any of her daughters to learn anything that had anything close to a domestic leaning to it. It was all about education so, so my mom didn't know how to cook, she did not know how to iron. None of her sisters did. It was all about education, and so my, my dad actually taught my mom how to cook.
Story_ID: 665447
Speaker 1: From your mother's growing up she was certainly taught to be educated and self sufficient and all that. This is still the '60s [1960s], so how did your dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] feel about her becoming a member of the House of Representatives [Oklahoma House of Representatives]?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was proud, he was proud, he was proud.
Speaker 1: He didn't have any problem with that?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no, he was proud. You know he was a very prominent doctor. He had chaired the Urban League [Urban League of Greater Oklahoma City, Inc., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. He had, he had chaired the OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers], started a bank [Lincoln National Bank, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], he had been on the city council [Oklahoma City Council], you know, it was, it was all good, it was all good, yeah.
Speaker 1: In your social circles--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was it common for the women of the, those families with the five acres--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you know the people who were part of your social network, was it common for the women to have big jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes. We had a lot of teachers. And so, we had a few doctors, but, but we had mainly a lot of teachers. And so Hannah [Atkins' mother, Hannah Diggs Atkins] was a, she was also a trailblazer.
Speaker 1: Well, because back then, the teaching was, teaching and nursing were the areas where the women were welcomed (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean white and black women--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --so going beyond that was a big step.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. There is one other interesting, Hannah was quite involved in the early 1970s in a group and a part of history that needs to be told a lot more, which was the whole Gary movement, the National Black Political Conventions in 1972 and 1974. And so my mom was a, she was a national leader with Dick Hatcher [HistoryMaker Richard Hatcher], who was the, who was the first African American mayor of Gary, Indiana, and also Amiri Baraka, and so my mom--
Speaker 1: Now what was his involvement in--
Speaker 2: Okay, well there was, keep in mind that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In Gary?
Speaker 2: Yes. Keep in mind that in the, in 1968, '69 [1969], '70 [1970], '71 [1971] is the rise of black elected officials nationwide at the, especially at, at the state local level. You had the Gary movement, which was the National Black- National Black Political Convention. You had what was known as the national black agenda, which was an effort to, to, to basically formulate what, what do black people want. And so this, this goes back to the national black political conventions back in the 1800s, where you had, had, had, had major conventions, abolitionist and, and, and also black nationalists, who were, who were really trying to focus on what is our political theory, what do black people need, what course do, what courses, what course should African Americans take in basically addressing America. And so this was a reinstatement of that effort.
Speaker 1: And it's a national conversation right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. And so with, Hannah was national secretary of the National Black Political Assembly, and so you had black elected officials from all over. You had activists, you had an entire range of African Americans' ideologies, and so, you had the, had the, had Pan-African Socialist like Amiri Baraka and Dick Hatcher, and so you had the entire range, so it was a real--trying to build, build a real black coalition.
Story_ID: 665448
Speaker 1: Now as your mother [Hannah Diggs Atkins] is involved in this--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) are you also involved?
Speaker 2: Yes. I was active in high school [Bishop McGuinness Catholic High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], coming out of high school, you know high school activist, coming out of high school, I was accepted at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey], Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], Reed College [Portland, Oregon], Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. I chose Howard and, and--because of the focus, my focus was on black politics. And Howard had--where'd you find that picture? Howard, had an amazing, amazing time back in 1971, and so I was active. I did go to the, to the national black assembly meetings [National Black Political Assembly], basically in Gary [Indiana] and San Diego [California]. I was active in the Congress of Afrikan Peoples [sic. Congress of Afrikan People]. At Howard, I was part of the progressive element of activist student government and so I was, it was me and Mike Espy. Mike Espy and I were like that (gesture). And, and [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti, Don Lee, was one of my best teachers there, [HistoryMaker] Ronald Walters, who was a tremendous influence on me. One thing that Ronald Walters said in my black political theory class that basically has stuck with me since then, he said that there is a major difference between ideology and analysis and, and so that has stuck with me throughout, but, yeah, Howard was just great.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about Howard a little more. You grew up in a black neighborhood [Edwards Addition, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] with great education as you described--
Speaker 2: A white school.
Speaker 1: White school. Howard, I went to Howard too--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean Howard is the United Nations of black people.
Speaker 2: Yes. It was--
Speaker 1: What was it--what experience did you have coming onto the campus meeting these people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was the best--I cried when I left Howard. I cried because I knew that it would never, life would never be this good because I was around so much, Sterling Brown [Sterling A. Brown] was still there. Doctor Theodora Boyd [Theodora Roosevelt Boyd], who was the first African American woman to get her Ph.D. in English from Radcliffe College [Cambridge, Massachusetts], who taught my father [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] at St. Augustine's [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], who remembered my father, taught me in honors, honors humanities and she was tough, she was tough, Dr. Theodora Boyd. Dr. Joyce Cook [Joyce Mitchell Cook], Ronald Walters.
Speaker 1: What did you major in?
Speaker 2: I was a, first of all, honors program, which we had a separate set of honors classes in the first--the first year was all honors students. I was a, I was a poli sci major [political science]. I had basically minors in economics, sociology and math. I was active, and it's basically Mike Espy and I, you know we were Drew Hall guys [Charles R. Drew Hall]. We were campus politicians. Elijah Cummings was there then and Lamont Flanagan. And so we were on the liberal arts student council [College of Arts and Sciences Student Council], we ran as a, Mike Espy and I ran as a ticket.
Story_ID: 665449
Speaker 1: And Mike Espy ran my particular campaign for undergraduate student trustee, and so I served as undergraduate student trustee for, for you know, almost two years.
Speaker 2: And what did that role entail?
Speaker 1: Well, I was a full fledged member of the board of trustees [Howard University Board of Trustees]. I had a full vote. I was involved in the entire range of things. And we had Papa Doc Cheek there, you know, Jim Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] and at the time he--I came there in '71 [1971], in the fall of '71 [1971]. He, he, he had only been there a couple of years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he was a young firebrand, but as I, as, you know, all those years he got, you know, I mean he was Papa Doc (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: He was there when I was there.
Speaker 1: That's right, Papa Doc. But--
Speaker 2: But so did he--historically the students at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] butt heads with the administration on a regular basis (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: There's always a time when something gets shut down and there's some kind of protest.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: In your role, you're a bridge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was a trustee, yes, and so, yes, and so--
Speaker 2: What happened when you were there?
Speaker 1: Well we had, of course, we had a protest, a protest about the tuition increase. And so there was a takeover of the administration building. I was with the students, but I stood up and I made speeches and, you know, I explained why, I explained why there was a tuition increase, and, and so I wanted to add a lot more aid, but, you know, I was there with the students but I did help to, to end that particular sit-in. But, you know, it was us, it was the, there was always a campus political struggle--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --between the accused and the progressive elements, you know, and so we, we always typically won out.
Speaker 2: How did you navigate in this role because you could have easily been considered a traitor?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: It sounds like you became a diplomat.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. I was grounded, I was grounded in, grounded in our students. We had run a strong campaign. I was one of those, I was one of them and so I spoke up, you know, I spoke truth to Howard. It was, Howard was fantastic. It was, it was, it was always global. We always thought, we always thought globally. At the time it was African liberation movements, Mozambique, Angola, Zimbabwe, South Africa, it was a real international focus. And, and I gained a tremendous education there in our, in our, in our, in our poli sci department [Howard University Department of Political Science, Washington, D.C.], intellectually rich with every ideology; classical Marxist, the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] you know kind of economics, Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] you know kind of mainstream government type, classical Marxist, neo-Marxist, Caribbean Socialist, Pan-African Socialist, cultural nationalist. I had a rich, I learned so much. And so when I went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the real start of the critical league of studies movement, I had that at Howard. I had a lot of political theory, a lot of, of critical analysis when I was at Howard, so it was a great education.
Story_ID: 665450
Speaker 1: Did you pledge?
Speaker 2: I did Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] junior year (laughter).
Speaker 1: The best kind of pledging.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I was not a social frat guy. I was part of the progressive elements and so we were not, you know, in that. I did honor societies; Phi Beta Kappa and honors programs.
Speaker 1: Sure. And in the honors program at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], you're supposed to write a thesis. What was your thesis on?
Speaker 2: It was about the black political theory. It was using, it was using the Weiqi, the Chinese, the Chinese game of Go, looking at our basically Mao's [Mao Zedong], looking at, at Mao's military strategy and basically apply that to, to black, black strategy in the U.S. and so looking at the Chinese and the American black politics. So, it was fun. [HistoryMaker] Ronald Walters was a tremendous scholar in the mold of W.E.B. Du Bois, you know. He did Jesse Jackson's campaign [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson]. I mean he was a scholar activist.
Story_ID: 665451
Speaker 1: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school, we forgot something in high school, what was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes. Well our particular student movement, our high school student movement we were very, very active. We also took over the stage at the, the regional meeting of the White House--the White House Conference on Children and, and Youth. It was held in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] at a church, All Souls' church [All Souls' Episcopal Church], which was, which was the top Episcopalian church which also, also harbored, hosted a white flight school. And--
Speaker 2: The church?
Speaker 1: Yes, hosted, hosted a brand new, a brand new private school, a school called Heritage Hall [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which is still around, which is still around now, and so I spent a lot of time protesting against that school and also protesting in front of that church. I would stand there Sundays with, with, with signs saying, "Why are you harboring a white flight school?" And we even went to the, the Episcopal bishop of Oklahoma and said, "Why is this church harboring a white flight school?" And so this White House Conference on Children and Youth was being held at this church. And so, and so basically three of us; a guy named James Johnson, who is the grandson of Mr. Edwards [Walter J. Edwards], who was why we came to Oklahoma City; Edwards school [Edwards Elementary School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], Edwards hospital [Edwards Memorial Hospital, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. He was student leader from, from, from Frederick Douglass High School [Douglass Mid-High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]. I had changed schools at, at, at the top Catholic, the Bishop McGuiness high school [Bishop McGuiness Catholic High School, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and also a guy named Harold Roberts [ph.] who was from Northeast High School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and so the, and so we were, we were three of the, the four student leaders of ICBM [Inner City Black Movement (ph.)]. And so basically three of us took over the, the, the stage right after the governor [Dewey F. Bartlett] spoke, and, and right before Stephen Hess [Stephen H. Hess], who was, who was a White House aide, who was head of the, the Conference on Children and Youth, and so we, we basically took over the stage just as the, the, the governor walked out and we, and we read our particular statement. And so, and we were in the, in the newspapers and on TV, and so, and so those were the types of things that we all did. And so we had hundreds, hundreds of high school students who would walkout of schools and so--
Speaker 2: That you could organize this movement--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes. And so we caught the attention of a guy named Billy Springfield [ph.] who would dress in a dashiki and he had a big Afro and he had an African, you know, African head necklace, and he would come to our strategy sessions and he would listen to our strategies and, you know, he would, he would pipe in every so often. And every so often he would just get mad and he would say, "Why don't we just burn that sucker down? Why don't we just burn it down?" And we said, "Man, you're crazy, you're crazy, you're crazy," you know, but it turned out that he was an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], a community affairs representative, right, but he was a FBI guy and he was a community guy who was working for the FBI and he was there with, with us, a group of high school students, and was trying to, trying to kind of spur us along. And so, and so that just kind of gives you more of a flavor of those times.
Story_ID: 665452
Speaker 1: And I wanna ask you about the Episcopal church because you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --your family went the way of the Episcopal church--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --which typically is pretty quiet--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right? There were a number of black people in the Episcopal church, the church that you attended--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was that a predominately black Episcopal church [Episcopal Church of the Redeemer, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes. It was, it started out as a mission church and so it was, it was an African American parish and, and, so it was, it was great. I mean, you know, it had a--
Speaker 1: Was it political?
Speaker 2: We had, we had, had several African American businessmen there and some doctors. It was not a political church. There was one piece, one interesting story about black churches in Oklahoma, that Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] interviewed at Calvary Baptist Church in Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] when he was coming out of, out of seminary school [Crozer Theological Seminary, Upland, Pennsylvania] and he was looking for a church. He came to Oklahoma City, the top Baptist church was, was Calvary Baptist Church in Oklahoma City and the, the church elders turned down Martin Luther King because he was too young, inexperienced, and so they just (laughter), just basically turned him away. But the active church there was St. John's Baptist church [St. John Missionary Baptist Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], and so there was one really active church that basically led a lot of--
Speaker 1: And so in the Episcopal church--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --this All Souls' church [All Souls' Episcopal Church, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which was a white church I'm assuming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right, yes.
Speaker 1: --was there--
Speaker 2: And Nichols Hills [Oklahoma] was where all of the old guys lived.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay, that's what the neighborhood was.
Speaker 2: It was the best neighborhood, Nichols Hills, which was, Casady School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma] was close to Nichols Hills. You know it was the elite part of Oklahoma City where all of the kind of oil money, white oil money was.
Speaker 1: Was there any relationship between the two Episcopal churches?
Speaker 2: Not really. Our church participated in, in all of the diocese events, and my, and both my, my, my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] and dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] were active at the, the state level and, you know, involved in the, in the international church as well.
Story_ID: 665453
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to, you were talking about leaving Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] to go to Harvard.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Now at what point did you decide that you wanted to be a lawyer? Because you sound like you're going to be an activist government person (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, I was going to be an academic. I was going to be a political scientist or I was going to be basically a, a, a--I was going to be a public policy analyst. And so that was why I took math, that's why I took economics. A wonderful--while I was at Howard I met Don Stewart who was at the Fels Institute for public policy [Fels Institute of Government] at, at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. My, my, my tight friend, James L. Johnson [James Johnson], who is the grandson of Edwards [Walter J. Edwards] went to the University of Pennsylvania and his older brother was at Fels Institute, so I was thinking about either to get a Ph.D. at Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], who had a great, a great political government--or, or, or Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]. But serving on the Howard Board of Trustees [Howard University Board of Trustees], I saw academic politics. I said, I saw, you know, I saw Andrew Billingsley get fired and, and, and--
Speaker 1: And he was a powerful man.
Speaker 2: I saw everything and I said okay, I'm not going to go into academics, I'm going to go to law school. So I applied (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So having that inside glance told you that was not for you.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right. So I think I only applied to maybe two law schools, Harvard Law, oh no, Yale [Yale Law School, New Haven, Connecticut], Harvard and also NYU. I was waitlisted at Yale. I got into Harvard and I was a Root-Tilden scholar [Root-Tilden-Kern Public Interest Scholarship] at, at, at, NYU law school [New York University School of Law, New York, New York], so I could have gotten it, you know it was Root-Tilden program, and it was an extensive interviewing thing like Rhodes scholar. I won a four year ride there, but I chose Harvard, and I'm glad I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because?
Speaker 2: Because it just, I really liked it and, and I have friends, I have cousins there, I have friends from Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] there, I had another Howard classmate, LaFern Fisher [ph.] and I went there. In fact, I just made her apply to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and, and I really liked the scope and the overall depth and the size of it, and it's a great law school. I had a, had a tremendous experience.

Speaker 1: Now when you go to Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] this is in nine--
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 2: That's fall of '75 [1975].
Speaker 1: Who's there? Who's, who's teaching there of note, who are your classmates?
Speaker 2: Ah, it was a great time. In my first year I had Arthur Miller [Arthur R. Miller], Arthur Miller for basically civ pro [civil procedure]. I had Charlie Haar [Charles M. Haar] for basically property. I had Jim Vorenberg [James Vorenberg] for, for criminal law, and Sacks [Albert Sacks] was the dean then. I had Charlie Nesson [Charles Nesson] for evidence. In my class was [HistoryMaker] Charles Ogletree, he was in, he was in a different section but he was a good friend. Also, also Kenny Frazier [HistoryMaker Kenneth C. Frazier] who is the CEO of Merck [Merck and Co., Inc.], was in our class. Great, great folks. Of course, Ken Chenault [Kenneth Chenault] was, was, he was a good friend. Ted Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] was there. Basically, Franklin Raines [Franklin D. Raines] was there. Just a, just a tremendous group. Our, my first year was, it was section three and a well known author named Scott Turow was in our section, and that--the book called 'One L' ['One L: The Turbulent True Story of a First Year at Harvard Law School,' Scott Turow], which is, stands for first year law student, that, that whole book called 'One L,' was about our section. And so everything that happened was, is in that book. There was this really famous Miller incident when Arthur Miller, who is a renowned civil procedure teacher, called, he called--it was a day where, it was doing our particular moot court preparations where we were all doing a lot of moot court work outside of class and so Arthur Miller went, he went, he went basically further in his cases than he, he had ever gone, you know he went to, you know, instead of two or three cases, he went to basically four or five cases and so the guy who was sitting right next to me, Matthew Hobbs [ph.] from Texas A&M [Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas], he was called on and he had to say that he was unprepared. And basically Arthur Miller just ragged him out and so our classmates went up in arms about how Matthew Hobbs was abused. And so Scott Turow and, and John Sexton was also in our class who was, who was the, who was the most recent president of, of NYU [New York University, New York, New York]. And John Sexton, close friend, prince of a guy, older student, but he was in our class too as well. And so it was, it was a whole protest about the, the mistreatment of our students and so it was all in that book. You know it was not a bad thing, but you know, back in the day, 1970s, students were a little sensitive about old style methods and so, but--
Speaker 1: Were there any, where they any black women there then?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. LaFern Fisher [ph.], yeah, yeah, yeah. A lots of, we had it was about half and half.
Story_ID: 665455
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And in terms of just the balance of black to whites--
Speaker 1: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) because it was growing at this point, right?
Speaker 1: Well we had, in fact, it has started going down now, we had more than fifty African Americans in a class. Basically during our time it was either basically fifty or sixty African Americans in each class. And so it was a huge class. And so you had more black students each year at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] than any other school other than Howard [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.] and then also Georgetown, Georgetown Law School [Georgetown University Law School; Georgetown University Law Center, Washington, D.C.], was also a large law school, it had basically thirty, forty blacks in a class, and so we had a tremendous experience there with just a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was running the school then?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: There was someone noteworthy.
Speaker 1: He just died too. He [HistoryMaker Walter J. Leonard] was from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]. He, I'm just drawing a blank on his name. He was, he was recently honored--
Speaker 2: Yes. I don't recall his name either but he was very important in bringing so many African American students.
Speaker 1: Also, also James Vorenberg was, was, was, was, was quite, quite active.
Story_ID: 665456
Speaker 1: Before you graduated, which was in '78 [1978], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Before you graduated there was an international outcry, I think, started by the United States about divestment from South Africa.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was part of that conversation--
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause it had investment there. Tell me what that was like on campus.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was not, it was--that was not so much at the law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was mainly at the, the undergraduate college [Harvard College, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. We wore arm bands for free South Africa for our graduation, but, but you see, you see, I came out of a protest movement and, and I had been through the, the, you know I mean I was part of the black power student movement and so, and, and I been through an integration, and so I didn't have anything to really prove after I got to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], you know. I mean I had fantastic critical legal studies profs there; Duncan Kennedy, Roberto Unger [Roberto Mangabeira Unger], I had for jurisprudence. And it was--I mean I studied dialectics when I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. I mean I, I know (unclear), I know social analysis and so, you know, I didn't feel that I needed to be active while I was in law school because I had done that and, and, and so I focused on my work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and also Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] was my, he was my advisor, he was a tremendous scholar. I did my (unclear) paper with him, just a great guy.
Speaker 1: And, and so I understand totally you were emerged in the black power struggle from a child--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and now you're dealing with your studies, which makes sense. And free South Africa and Mandela [Nelson Mandela] is resonating in everyone's ears.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And so, while you weren't ignoring it, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Well no, no, no, no, of course, of course, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Is, is the political consciousness finding its way in your work?
Speaker 2: Well, it is, it is, it was a part of me and it is a part of me now, especially now (laughter), but, but, you know, I mean it was, we, we had fought for opportunities and, and so I wanted to, to, to basically pay off my student loans and basically take those opportunities.
Story_ID: 665457
Speaker 1: And did you have internships while you were at Harvard Law?
Speaker 2: Yes. I, I was quite, quite lucky to be, even before I started law school, I did basic- I did a summer at the Washington, D.C. office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld [Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP], which was at the time, Robert Strauss [Robert S. Strauss] was, he was the chairman of the national Democratic Party [Democratic National Committee], and so he was a real Texas, you know, he was a protege of LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], and came out of the, the Texas Democratic politics and he was chairman of the Democratic Party. Hannah [Hannah Diggs Atkins], my, my, my mom was, she was a member of the, of the DNC for actually twelve years and so, and so she knew Robert Strauss. The speaker of the house was Carl Albert from Oklahoma and so we had an Oklahoma connection. And so through, through Carl Albert's office, I was introduced to Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld and so I had a summer internship there before I started Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts]. And then in the summer, in the first summer after my first year I interned at Akin Gump, and then in the summer of my second year I did, I did three things. I did, at the time, I did an internship with the Butler Binion law firm [Butler and Binion; Mayor, Day, Caldwell and Keeton LLP] in Houston, Texas. I spent some time, in fact I really spent it two ways. I spent it with, with the Ex-Im Bank [Export-Import Bank of the United States], just for a short while, and then also, at Strauss' special trade office. He was special trade representative by then, so, so I had a great experience. I had a job offer to go--so I could get back to law school, and so after law school I have another famous classmate, quite, quite famous classmate named Adebayo Ogunlesi who was the top high school student in Nigeria, first class honors Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England], Harvard Law Review on grades, which means you have more A pluses than A's, (unclear) Business School [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts], clerked for Thurgood Marshall, Credit Suisse [Credit Suisse Group AG] and then has his own--largest infrastructure fund [Global Infrastructure Partners]. So, after law school I spent three months in Nigeria with, with friends of basically Adebayo Ogunlesi and so I met with his, his father [Theophilus Ogunlesi] who was the, who was known as head of the department of public health in Nigeria [Federal Ministry of Health]. I met his older brother and then I spent three months basically touring around. It was the, it was 1978, oil boom, basically military government stepping aside, so I just saw a lot. So, great experiences, great experience. Law school was fantastic. The thing that I tell students is that the law school is the greatest education you could ever have. It is the actual culmination of all of the social sciences and, and the thing that law school teaches you is that number one, that you can teach, you can teach your- yourself anything that things don't have to be a certain way. Most people thing things have to be a certain way. Things don't have to be a certain way and that words really matter. And if you learn those three things, that's all you need to really know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's good.
Story_ID: 665458
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: The--we're ending Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I, after I get back from my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From Nigeria.
Speaker 2: That's right. I take the, the bar in D.C. [Washington, D.C.], I pass the bar--
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: --the, the first time, it was great. And so I go to work at Akin Gump [Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP] and, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, excuse me, you decide on D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --why?
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: You wanted to be around government?
Speaker 2: I liked Akin Gump, I liked politics, I liked government. And so while I'm at Akin Gump and then--Bob Strauss [Robert S. Strauss] was a early mentor, and while I was at Akin Gump, one day Bob Strauss comes to me and he said, "Charlie [HistoryMaker Charles N. Atkins], what do you know about this guy named Vernon Jordan [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.]?" And I said, "Mr. Strauss, he is fantastic. He is a tremendous civil rights leader, a real, a real fantastic, a real fantastic person." You know he is a national leader, you know, I just couldn't say, you know, enough great things about Vernon Jordan. My, my whole family was an Urban League [National Urban League] family and so, you know, he was Urban League and he had just been shot and, and was just coming out of that.
Speaker 1: What year is this now?
Speaker 2: This is nineteen seventy- this was 1979-ish.
Speaker 1: Right, um-hm. And he was in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes. And so, and so, and so, and so about a week or so after that it's announced that, that Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld has basically brought in, brought in Vernon Jordan as a senior partner, and so I overlapped with him there a little bit, you know, and he, he's been, he has been a dear, dear friend to me basically throughout, but--
Speaker 1: So your, your blessing probably helped (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, of course not, but, well but, you know Strauss, I mean Strauss being Strauss, you know, he asked around (laughter), you know. But, but, I tell you Vernon is just amazing, still is amazing.
Story_ID: 665459
Speaker 1: What did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So--
Speaker 1: --you learn by working at the same firm with him [HistoryMaker Vernon E. Jordan, Jr.], did you interact much while you were there?
Speaker 2: Just a bit, just a bit, but I mean, I learned a lot. There was one particular lawyer named Ed Knight [Edward S. Knight] who really helped me because I didn't know anything. You know coming out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], you don't know how to do a legal memo really, for basically a law firm. And he really, really, he really took time to really help make me, to help to make me a whole lot better, and so I will always be grateful to Ed Knight. And also Joel Jankowsky who headed--who was from Oklahoma, who headed up the legislative, the lobbying practice there. He, he had been an aide to Speaker Carl Albert who was also from Oklahoma and so he came over to Akin Gump [Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP] while I was there, but he, he heard about an opportunity of a spot opening at the White House in 1980 and so, because of Akin Gump and Joel Jankowsky, I was able to spend almost a year at, at, working for a fantastic woman named Anne Wexler in the Jimmy Carter White House. And so I saw Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.], I saw him three or four times a day. I, it was all about, it was the office of, it was the Office of, Office of Public Liaison, where we would reach out to a lot of interest groups, and so I was in charge of, of all of the, the economic policy announcements. I was in charge of all of the environmental announcements and so I handled the foreign affairs groups and basically environmental groups and so it was just a great experience. And I, it was my idea for, for us to, to take in Robert Mugabe, who had just, who is awful now, but at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was good in the beginning.
Speaker 2: Yes. He, he basically had just liberated Zimbabwe, which was Rhodesia, Southern Rhodesia, and so it was my idea to have him brought into the White House and to meet Carter and have a reception. And so it actually happened, and so I was able to bring my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins] and dad [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.] to the White House [Washington, D.C.] for that particular ceremony, and so it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: What was President Carter like? You know people, there's so many stories about him. He gets such a bad rap.
Speaker 2: You know he was a smart man, he was a decent man. I would see him, he would jog around the, the, the, the Rose Garden every day. He was a big jogger. Whenever he would see me he would wave and smile, you know. And, and there was a real group of black White House staffers there; Christopher Edley [Christopher Edley, Jr.], Frank Raines [Franklin D. Raines], let's see, Pauline, Pauline Schneider, Pauline Schneider, Miles Logan [ph.], and so we, I have a picture somewhere of the black Carter staff after we lost, and it was around forty of us. And we all looked around and said, "Will there ever be this many black folks in the, on the White House staff and will, and will the Democrats ever, ever get back in?" You know, and so at the time [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young was a major inspiration because of him being named the UN ambassador [United Nations] really opened eyes about possibilities. And so Jimmy Carter was, he was, he was not a great politician. He believed in doing, in doing what was right, whether it made sense from a political view or not, he wanted to always do what was right, and, and I respect him for that. And he was always nice to, to, to me. He would always smile and wave, and, you know, he's a great man, a great man still, you know, a great man still. (Pause) A little stubborn.
Story_ID: 665460
Speaker 1: Your next job is on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes. I, I was, worked for David Boren, I was his legislative counsel, he was the senior senator from the State of Oklahoma, one of the last, last--I think he is the last Democratic senator, after a long line of fantastic senators, Robert Kerr [Robert S. Kerr], Fred Harris [Fred R. Harris], who, who ran for president, you know, in 1972, and was on the Kerner Commission [National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders], and a real, a real progressive, but Oklahoma just started going far, far right. But I was legislative counsel, I was on the floor of the U.S. Senate the day that the Martin Luther King holiday bill [Martin Luther King Jr. Day] was, was, finally passed, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that '84 [1984]?
Speaker 2: I think it was eighty- I think it was '82 [1982]. It might have been '83 [1983], '83 [1983], '83 [1983], '83 [1983] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think it was '83 [1983], 'cause I walked in that, that march for that, yeah, yeah. (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, '83 [1983], right, right. I was on, we had, our state, our office had so much negative mail on that, a lot of hate mail, but David Boren being the politician that he, he, he, is and was, you know, he said, I'm gonna vote for it, but I have to do this other amendment first, just so I can vote for it, and so he did a particular amendment to, with, with some other holiday, I think it was Columbus Day, yeah, but he just did it because Oklahoma was, was 100 percent against it.
Story_ID: 665461
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now there was another controversy--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) while he was in office. So Clarence Thomas--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --came to the [U.S.] Supreme Court during that time and Senator Boren [David Boren] had voted to confirm Justice Thomas, and, and so after he wrote an article in The New York Times expressing his regret. Were you there during that period?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. I was at Akin Gump [Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP]. Wait a minute, this was '89 [1989], right, this was eighty--
Speaker 1: Eighty [1980], no excuse me, you were there in '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right. I was there in '80 [1980]. I was at, I think I was at, I think that the Clarence Thomas it was '89 [sic. 1991] or later. I was already at Wall Street then.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, but, but you see Anita Hill was from Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, you see she went to, she was at Oklahoma State [Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, Oklahoma] while I was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. I didn't know her but after I got to Akin Gump, there was an African American guy at Akin Gump named Smitty Davis [Smith W. Davis], who was part of the, the Allison Davis [W. Allison Davis], you know, the whole Gordon Davis [HistoryMaker Gordon J. Davis], Allison Davis family, who used to own the Wormley hotel [Wormley's Hotel] in Washington, D.C. Many people don't know was, was, was black owned, but he was, he went Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut] with, with Clarence Thomas. And Ted Wells [HistoryMaker Theodore V. Wells, Jr.] went to Holy Cross [College of the Holy Cross, Worcester, Massachusetts] with Clarence Thomas, and so I went to that birthday party that, that was talked about in that particular hearing where it was that particular party where Anita Hill was there, and I met Anita Hill there. I had heard of Anita Hill because she was at, at Yale Law School, but I was at that, that famous Christmas party, excuse me, birthday party for, for him when he was EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] head (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --and it was all talked about. There was a lot of testimony about something that happened at that particular party. I forgot what happened, but it was a big deal.
Story_ID: 665462
Speaker 1: David Boren was a good man. He was a seatmate of Hannah's [Atkins' mother, Hannah Diggs Atkins] in the Oklahoma Legislature. He was in the, the House of Representatives [Oklahoma House of Representatives], he was one of the youngest governors and he was the close, close friend. I worked for him. He was a good friend of my dad's [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.]. He, he gave a wonderful eulogy at Hannah's funeral, along with the governor and, but we will get to that in our next round.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But from the, from the Boren office, my dear, my dear late wife Gayle [Gayle Perkins Atkins], she was editorial director at, at Channel 4 [WRC-TV] in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. She had, she had, she had a particular session with Ann Lewis who is basically Barney Frank's sister, and Lewis was a major, major Democratic Party activist. And she mentioned to Gayle that there was this woman in [U.S.] Congress from Queens [New York] named, named Geraldine Ferraro who was gonna be chair of the Democratic Party Platform Committee, and so Ann Lewis mentioned to Gayle, "You know what, we're doing staff for the, for the Democratic Party Platform Committee," and she asked Gayle, "Do you know anybody who, who, might be good on that staff?" And Gayle said, "Yeah, my husband" (laughter). And so I became right after I worked, I helped David Boren do the response to the State of the Union, I helped him write that, I moved over to the, to the DNC [Democratic National Committee]. This was '83 [1983]. This was basically February of '83 [1983], and I, it was Susan Estrich who was also, who was a year or two, year or two of me--year or two ahead of me at Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], was the first, the first woman to be president of the Harvard Law Review. She was active in, in, in, in Democratic Party politics. And so it was, it was me and Susan Estrich who headed up the, that, that, that staff for the Democratic Party platform. All throughout '83 [1983] and '84 [1984], so it was Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] campaign, Gary Hart campaign and Walter Mondale campaign and we held maybe ten or fifteen hearings. [HistoryMaker] Richard Arrington who was the, the, the first black mayor of, of Birmingham [Alabama], was the chair of the, was the basically deputy chair and then Geraldine was the chair, so after doing that whole, that whole complex Democratic Party platform with three active Democratic Party--three active presidential campaigns, I'm there in San Francisco [California] at the Democratic, at the, at the San Francisco convention [1984 Democratic National Convention, San Francisco, California], and I'm there in the hotel suite with, with Geraldine. I was there when Walter Mondale called her to join the 1984 ticket, and so I was her first hug. I gave her her first hug and she said, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles N. Atkins] I want you on the campaign plane with me, I want you there with me." And so I became deputy campaign manager, 1984 presidential campaign and it was a great, eighty-four campaign stops in twenty-five states and a great historical experience, even though we lost, lost forty-nine states, it was a great experience.
Story_ID: 665463
Speaker 1: This is my, my, dear, dear pappy, who is my, who is my, who is my, who is my mother's father, James Thackery Diggs [James T. Diggs, Sr.].
Speaker 2: And what year would this be?
Speaker 1: This should be--
Speaker 2: Around?
Speaker 1: I would say this might be early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: He was a fantastic contractor and so this is him, he was also, he was at a major, major Mason and a major Shriner [Shriners International] and he is walking, he is walking down the street in South Carolina, and you see the faces of the, of the, of the onlookers here.
Speaker 1: Now this is probably what year?
Speaker 2: I would say, I would say 1940s.
Speaker 1: And so this is, this is my mother's mother, and, and her name is Mabel Kennedy Diggs, Mama Diggs. And so this would be the 1960s.
Speaker 2: This is me when--I'd say, probably ninth grade, ninth grade, Casady School [Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: And then this is a graduation photo from, from, from medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] of my dad and I believe that this was 1950.
Speaker 2: What is his name, or same name?
Speaker 1: That's right, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Charles Nathaniel Atkins [Charles N. Atkins, Sr.].
Speaker 2: And this is my father's high school yearbook of 1933 at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx, I believe, in New York. And you will see him at the bottom left there, as a high school student.
Speaker 1: And so this is me--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --in my, I think I was, I think this is likely seventh grade or so. I have a little black African necklace around me here and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, this is a cute little boy. This is me. I think that I'm around four or five here, Oklahoma City [Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: And so this is, let's see, I don't know who that is so don't do that. This is me, I think I'm about fourth grade.
Speaker 2: This is the baby Charles [HistoryMaker Charles N. Atkins], not so long after birth.
Speaker 1: This is from that same series?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm even, younger here.
Speaker 1: So these are really small, let's pick from--let's pick one out of that group.
Speaker 2: Okay. Here is one--I'll do two. If you could really do a close up on that. That is my dad and me as a, as a, as a baby with my older brother Edmund [Edmund E. Atkins] in the backyard of our little house at 16th [Street] and, at 16th and Page [Avenue].
Speaker 1: And here is me with my older brother Edmund, right at our little house at 16th and Page.
Speaker 2: And one more, this is me and my mom [Hannah Diggs Atkins]. I am a little older.
Speaker 1: And then that house there. And so this is that house now right there, and it is, is part of the Edwards historic district [Edwards Community, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma].
Speaker 2: And then this is Edwards hospital [Edwards Memorial Hospital, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma], which was the reason why my, my dad actually moved us to Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Right, and so this is me being a Christmas baby. It was a big deal seeing Santa [Santa Claus], and so I should be around, around three here.
Speaker 1: You were always tall.
Speaker 2: Yes. So, and this is the 1965 yearbook at Casady School where I am right at the, at the top left that, that, that spot there and this was when I integrated the, the absolutely best school in the State of Oklahoma, Casady School.
