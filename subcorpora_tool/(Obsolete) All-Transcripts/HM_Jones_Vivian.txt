Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you recall any stories about your--
Speaker 2: My grandmother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh wow, my grandmother she, my grandmother was, she was the first left handed person I ever met (laughter).  I--as a child I never knew a lot about left handed people, but she came to live with us when I was about five or six years old and I think the thing that, that really astounded me about her is she would do everything with her left hand.  I'd be reaching for her right hand, and she'd hand me the left hand and it was just amazing to me.  I, I just had never experienced that before.  And the other thing is that my grandmother was a very religious person.  She was, most of my friend's grandparents they didn't read or write or do any of that.  My grandmother was, was a reader.  She, she could write.  She wrote a lot of letters and different things like that and so I, I think that's where I picked up the real love for reading.
Speaker 1: Okay now you say she was a reader.  Did she read books or nov-?
Speaker 2: She read the Bible--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --front to back.
Speaker 1: Front to back okay.
Speaker 2: And she could, and she could explain it and break it down to you and she was really, really a very intelligent woman.
Speaker 1: Do you recall her reading to you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Bible (laughter).
Speaker 1: The Bible (laughter) okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah lots of times.
Speaker 1: Lots of time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you recall her telling any stories about her parents, her background?  How far back in, on that side of the family can you go or that you may have stories from?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, I believe her mother's name was Harriet [sic. Hennie James], and I don't remember a whole lot of, I know, I'm gonna say this she told a lot of stories.  She and her sister, who was my great aunt, Aunt Nora.
Speaker 1: Nora.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nora Johnson [Elnora James Johnson (ph.)] they, they used to tell us lots of stories, but honestly speaking I cannot remember them now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were lots of stories about different things that happened in their childhood in their young adulthood.
Speaker 1: And where did that childhood or young adulthood take place?  Was it in the same area?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you mentioned that your grandmother came to--
Speaker 2: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: --with, okay so that was in Chicago?
Speaker 2: She came to--
Speaker 1: She came--
Speaker 2: --Chicago from Arkansas.
Speaker 1: From Arkansas.

Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 635929
Speaker 1: Do you know of the roots going back to any other area, maybe if they [Jones' maternal family] came from another area (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --to there, or anything of that nature?
Speaker 2: My granddaughter, they did a gen- genealogy on her in, in one of her classes at school.  They chose one hundred children to do a, one hundred females to do the genealogy, and when they did her, did her genealogy it took us all the way back to West Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we know that we're from somewhere in West Africa--
Speaker 1: West Africa.
Speaker 2: --on the coast, yeah on the Ivory Coast.
Speaker 1: Okay now, so when you ancestors were first brought here do you know where they lived first?  Was Arkansas the first place?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know for sure, but, I, I, I would be willing to bet that it was probably Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And pretty much started there that you know.
Speaker 2: Right.  I only had one unc- great, great uncle that migrated out of Arkansas.  He went to North Carolina I think or somewhere like that because he was a [U.S.] military man.  He was in the, he, whatever it was that they had back then. I can't, I'm trying to think of what they called it.
Speaker 1: Did he fight during the Civil War or another?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did, the cavalry.
Speaker 1: The cavalry.
Speaker 2: Went to the cavalry.
Speaker 1: So, so he fought for which side during the Civil War?
Speaker 2: Actually I think he fought for the rebels [Confederacy].
Speaker 1: Okay, for the South.
Speaker 2: I, I believe he fought for the South.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he was a military man--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you know he went, ended up in North Carolina.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you have relatives there now?

Speaker 2: --I don't.
Story_ID: 635930
Speaker 1: And now what about your, your father's side of the family.  And will you state his name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was German Jones [German Jones, Sr.], spelled G-E-R-M-A-N, J-O-N-E-S, and my father's family was from Jackson, Mississippi, and possibly some other part of Mississippi, but I really don't know where.
Speaker 1: Okay, what is your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: My father's date of birth was November 16th, 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said they, he originated from Jackson, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about his parents?
Speaker 2: My grandmo- well I don't know about his father, a lot about his father.  The only thing I do know is that his father's name was Robert Jones [ph.].  My grandmother remarried when my father was a little boy, and she married Ike Moton.  And so all of my father's brothers were Motons.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the only Jones.
Speaker 1: He was the only Jones, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and so we are more, we're a Jones/Moton family.
Speaker 1: And so you don't know too much about his, his father or--
Speaker 2: Not a lot about his father, but my grandmother, Mary, Mary Moton, she, I spent a lot of time with her.  Every summer we went to Mississippi to visit her and, and Grandpa Ike.  So, and she had a sister named Molly [ph.].  I can't think of Molly's last name, because that would give me my grandmother's maiden name, but I, I can't remember it.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that go back on that side of the family that would go back some generations to slavery or any--?
Speaker 2: Nothing that I, nothing that--the only stories I heard was always about my father of how, how rough he was.  He was--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --no nonsense, don't mess with me kind of fella that walks, they said that he walked hard.  You know when he walked you could hear him like a mile away.  He's, you know he had on big boots all the time and just are rea- real--
Speaker 1: Those are the stories that your grandparents told you about your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a real man's man.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And in growing up in Mississippi?

Speaker 2: Always looking for a way to earn money working.
Story_ID: 635931
Speaker 1: Then at what point did your mother [Annie Henderson Jones] and your father [German Jones, Sr.] connect?
Speaker 2: How do--oh wow I don't know exactly when they met.  I know my mother already had two sons [Charles Porter and Larry Henderson] when she met my father, and they met sometime between 1947, no 1946 and 1947.
Speaker 1: Where?
Speaker 2: I was born in 1948.  They met here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: In Chicago, that's what I wondered.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, they met in Chicago.  But you never heard any stories about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, my dad worked at a glass globe company somewhere where they make glass, did things with glass, and my mother worked at a drugstore on 29th [Street] and Indiana [Avenue] called Dave's, Dave's Drugstore [ph.] or Dave's, Dave's, it might have been just Dave's.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And it also had a lunch counter in there, and I believe that's where they met at the lunch counter.
Speaker 1: They met at the lunch counter.  And your, your mom worked there you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, was she a waitress or do you know?
Speaker 2: She was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you feel like they, they met at some point and you said in the, the late '40s [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay in the mid to late '40s [1940s] that, that they met.  And so your mom was living in Chicago at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your dad was living in Chicago?

Speaker 1: And so they both had migrated here from Mississippi and your mom from--
Speaker 2: Arkansas.
Speaker 1: --from Arkansas.
Story_ID: 635932
Speaker 1: So what are your earliest childhood memories?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory--I've had, I had a pretty rough childhood.  I'm not sure that my parents, I think what, what I really believe now that I'm older and I understand things a lot better than I was as a child, I think they both worked a lot.  They were both always working, and they were, I was always, somebody else was always babysitting me and that's what I remember.  A lot of, well most times the babysitters weren't strangers, they were people in the family.
Speaker 1: That's what I was about to ask, family members maybe.
Speaker 2: Yeah, family members or somebody that my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] felt really close to, so that's my earliest memory is that I didn't spend a whole, whole lot of time with my parents.  They always worked.  By the time they got home, I'd be in the bed.  By the time I got up, they or whatever I'd be, they'd be gone except for the time when I was starting school.  Around the time when I really started school, my mother kind of spent a lot more time you know with me trying to get me in school and doing different things that you needed to do to get a child used to being in school, so.
Speaker 1: Were you born in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother got pregnant with me and when it was time for me to be born she went back home [Sweet Home, Arkansas] to be with her mother [Reola James Henderson].
Speaker 1: She did--
Speaker 2: She didn't want to have the baby here because like I said my father [German Jones, Sr.] worked a lot.  They both did, but I think she, in her mind, she wanted to be somewhere with her mother that could help, help her you know with me.
Speaker 1: So, they, they were married or living in a household together at that time.
Speaker 2: They were living in a household together.  I don't know that they were married at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but at some point they did?
Speaker 2: At some point later.
Speaker 1: I just wanna--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like I'm just not sure, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you were born in Arkansas, but then you what, she came back to Chicago soon after that then?
Speaker 2: When I was six weeks old.
Speaker 1: When you, oh were six weeks then okay.
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it's not like you really lived in Ark--
Speaker 2: No, I never lived there.
Speaker 1: Okay I, I just wanted to be sure.  So what part of Chicago were you living in at that time?
Speaker 2: My parents, let's, we lived and I don't know how I remember this, but I know that it was 29th [Street] and Prairie [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where we lived.  I think it was, I wanna say 2929 South Prairie, but it was on 29th and Prairie.
Speaker 1: Well that's, that's considered the South Loop [Chicago, Illinois] today (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know right (laughter).  I look at it I'm like wow everything has changed so much down there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not long after I was born we, during the time when I started school we moved to 25th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so around in that area (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and we lived there for quite a while.
Speaker 1: 25th and Michigan, okay right down the street.
Speaker 2: Twenty-five- 2505 South Michigan.
Story_ID: 635933
Speaker 1: Can you remember what were the sights and sounds and smells of your childhood?
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds and smells of my childhood, the smells were always of food, greens and chicken (laughter), laughter, a lot of laughter, a lot of arguing.  My parents argued a lot.  A lot of, like I said a lot of laughter.  A lot of, lot of, lot of closeness.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember, you know we used to watch--the family always watched television, well when we got a television, we always watched television together.  We, you know my dad [German Jones, Sr.] was the kind of man that he always, later after, as I got a little older and other children started coming 'cause there's five years between my, my sister [Beverly Jones Blow] and myself--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my next sister.  I have two brothers [Charles Porter and Larry Henderson] that's older than me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and there's two years between each of us.  But as the younger ones started coming along I think my parents started getting the hang of what it meant really to be parents because they, the, the way we lived changed quite a bit.  They became a lot more attentive, and, and, and father used to take us everywhere you know.  We, we, he would, just to say he took us somewhere he would take us on "L" [elevated train] rides--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to and we would get off the "L" at McDonald's on twenty- on 31st Street or was, no 35th Street and go to McDonald's and he'd buy the McDonald's and we'd get back on the "L" and go back.  You know it was all, it was so much fun, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Take us to Riverview [Riverview Park, Chicago, Illinois] and to the, Lincoln Park [Chicago, Illinois] to ride the little ponies and--
Speaker 1: Okay and, and these memories, you were in what age range about that time?
Speaker 2: I probably was about seven.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the little, my, my next sister, she, she probably was about two or three--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause I'm five years older than her, so it was somewhere in that area.  And then my other, my sister [Rhonda Jones Mabry] after her there's only a year between them, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you remember the three of you with your father?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah we, we used to hang out, and my two other brothers--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --because they, for the first few years of their lives they lived in Arkansas with my [maternal] grandmother [Reola James Henderson].  And when my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] and father got together and, and officially became a couple that's when my grandmother came back to, came here to Chicago and my, 'cause she brought my two brothers--
Speaker 1: Brought your two brothers, okay.
Speaker 2: --here to live with us (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 635934
Speaker 1: You have happy memories of those times, seems like?
Speaker 2: I was so happy because for five years I had been an only child, well yeah 'cause it was still I think my sister [Beverly Jones Blow] was just born too.  So, it's like overnight almost it seems I went from being an only child to being in a big family.
Speaker 1: You had a big family.
Speaker 2: And it, it was kind of challenging for me because I think I felt like I was being, I had been pushed aside even more than I already was and so, but at the same time I remember feeling so happy and excited to have brothers because everybody had brothers and I had--you know I didn't have it and then now I do have some, so.
Speaker 1: And they were older brothers.
Speaker 2: And they were older brothers.  You know but one of my brothers [Larry Henderson] I think he kind of, he had a lot of resentment because he was the baby for, mama's, my mother's [Annie Henderson Jones] baby and remember, well you don't remember, but I, I, I mentioned that my mother had lived in Chicago [Illinois] for a while and he was born in Chicago--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so that means that she left Chicago to take him to live with my [maternal] grandmother [Reola James Henderson] probably because she didn't have nobody to really keep him--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --while she was working and all of that.  But, as a child I think that left a scar on him to be taken back and, and left.  And so it took him, you know it took him, he wasn't to, he was, he had, he always a little animosity and resentment about that in him.  I think he kind of equated it to having something to do with me.  "She could keep her, but she couldn't keep me," kind of syndrome, you know.  Didn't realize all this until we got grown, and I don't know that he's, I still don't know if he realize it today (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you all never discussed this?
Speaker 2: Just, just vaguely, but you know men don't talk about things like that.  They like to blow it off like it was no big deal, you know but I, I think it did have an impact on him.
Speaker 1: Now I just wanted to go back to you recalling that your father [German Jones, Sr.] would spend time with you and your siblings, would actually take you on outings.
Speaker 2: My father was the, my father he was the, he was, my mother worked.  My mother was an out, out the house kind of mo- parent.  She took care of everything outside of the house.  My father basically took care of everything inside of the house.  He was the one that cooked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the one that went grocery shopping and all of that you know.  Oh he even tried to wash, which was the worst disaster.  Every time he, he never learned how to wash (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Did, now were other people around you, did their father's take them on outings and spend that much time with them?
Speaker 2: No, and everybody, all the kids wanted my dad to be their dad.  They all called him daddy, and I would be like, "That's not your daddy." (Laughter) I was such a mean kid.
Story_ID: 635935
Speaker 1: And your father [German Jones, Sr.] though was working and you say he worked at a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, he was working.  He, he worked for, my father worked for almost thirty-four years at Batt's Restaurant [Mama Batt's Restaurant, Chicago, Illinois] located on 22nd Street.
Speaker 1: What is it Batt's?
Speaker 2: Batt's, B-A-T-T-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a family style like restaurant over there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he worked there for umpteen years.
Speaker 1: 22nd and what about?
Speaker 2: Well, first they were, they moved, at first they was on that street like on Archer [Archer Avenue]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --like around 18th [Street] or 19th [Street], somewhere like that on Archer, and then they moved on 22nd [Street] between Michigan [Avenue], somewhere between Michigan and Indiana [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to get an idea.  Batt's okay, and he worked there during your childhood and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you said for twenty something years.  And what was your father, I mean I'm sorry your mother [Annie Henderson Jones], now you say she was out the house?
Speaker 2: My mother worked, she always worked.  She worked at, and she worked at Dave's Drugstore [ph.] for many, many, many, many years.  And I think they closed down or something.  I don't know what happened.  She went to work at a factory after that called Littelfuse [Littelfuse, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  So, she worked there for some years and then they laid, you know cut, they cut back or closed down I don't, I can't remember which.  And she ended up working for the department of mental health [Illinois Department of Human Services Division of Mental Health]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's where she worked until she passed away and--
Speaker 1: Okay, at the department of mental health for the, the state, the city?
Speaker 2: It's the state, it's--
Speaker 1: The state.
Speaker 2: --Madden Mental Health Center [John J. Madden Mental Health Center, Hines, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And if you go there today you'll see probably in, in the intake department, a plaque with her name and everything on it because my mother became the union president--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of that local, yeah.
Speaker 1: Of that local, okay.
Speaker 2: And when she passed that was her, you know aside from her regular job that was her other capacity there.
Speaker 1: And so this was AFSCME Local 286 [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 286]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So she was a union representative.  What did she actually do at the health center?
Speaker 2: She was an intake coordinator.
Speaker 1: An intake coordinator okay.  And when she worked there did she retire or she?
Speaker 2: She died.
Speaker 1: She, she, okay she got sick and died.
Speaker 2: While she was still working.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was she--
Speaker 2: She was a--like I said she was a union president and it was a very stressful job.
Story_ID: 635936
Speaker 1: She [Jones' mother Annie Henderson Jones] was only fifty-three when she died (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, what did she, what did she pass of?
Speaker 1: She had a cerebral hemorrhage, stroke, and she lived for, I wanna say she lived two weeks, but it could have easily been a week.  She, she, it's not, she didn't die that same day she had the stroke.  She lived for I wanna, yeah, no she lived a week.  She lived a week.
Speaker 2: And before that she was fine as far as everyone--?
Speaker 1: Well before that she had issues that we didn't know about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --like high blood pressure--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all of these things.  We didn't know.
Speaker 2: Do you think she knew?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think she knew and she was on medication and I think that she drank a lot of coffee, black coffee.  She liked it black and strong, so she drank a lot of coffee.  She smoked cigarettes, and I think she had probably been forewarned on all of those issues, the things that she needed to do to, you know.  And I, I would, I just feel that because of the pressures of the work that she was doing it was difficult for her to not have, you know have those things to kind of help her get through it.  And so--
Speaker 2: I can imagine this was a difficult time for you?
Speaker 1: It was very traumatic.  I was pregnant.  When my mother died, I was four months pregnant with my son [Eddie Jones].
Speaker 2: With your son.
Speaker 1: And that's a whole other story.  We're not on that one yet I don't think, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But yeah I was four months pregnant and I already had a child.  My daughter [Victoria C. Brady] was fift- fourteen getting ready to be fifteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: In fact she was fifteen I think.  I can't rea- anyway I already had a child.  I wasn't trying to have any more children.  I, I, it just out of the clear blue sky, well you know I was pregnant and so I remember my mother and I talked about it, talked about the pregnancy and she became very protective of me.  You know what, "What are you eating and you shouldn't have this and you shouldn't have that." You know all the kinds of things.  She has never done this before.  She, she became real protective of--"You need to drink this milk and don't eat--" You know just all kinds of stuff like that.

Speaker 1: Well before we get there let's, let's go back a little bit--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause--and then back to your childhood and the influences.  Do you re- remember much about your, your mother's [Annie Henderson Jones] union work [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 286] and how active, so did she have a lot of meetings--?
Speaker 2: They had a lot of meetings, a lot of, they had a lot of rallies, a lot of protests and a lot of hearings.  I remembered, you know, she was always-- somebody was always at the table, wanted some kind of hearing for being treated unjustly, and she would, she was a real champion for fighting for them to help them keep their jobs or get their benefits that they were entitled to and things like that.  She, she worked really hard.  She really put everything she had into that job, and she still had her regular job.
Speaker 1: And she still had her regular job.
Speaker 2: And she still had her regular job and she also had a house full of kids by then.  There were eight of us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by then, and she had, my younger brother, younger children were--I already told you about my two sisters [Beverly Jones Blow and Rhonda Jones Mabry], well after them there were three more boys.  And those three boys kept, you know she got real actively involved in their lives.  That's why I say she, she learned over a period of time.  So she, she was, she was, and not, not just us she was everybody's mother.
Speaker 1: Everybody's mother.
Speaker 2: Just like my father [German Jones, Sr.] was everybody's father (laughter).  They all, they called her Mom.  They called her Mama.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like your parents were great role models not just for you and your siblings, but for the community--
Speaker 2: They were.
Speaker 1: --around them (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, they were.  My mother and father, they genuinely cared about kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: This is [HistoryMaker] Lynn Norment with The HistoryMakers interviewing Dr. Vivian R. Jones [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Jones].  The videographer is Matthew Hickey, observer is Larry Crowe.  Dr. Jones we were discussing your childhood and the great role models that your parents [Annie Henderson Jones and German Jones, Sr.] were.  I wanted to talk a little bit more about your mother, Annie B. Jones, and her work with the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 286] and at the Mental Health Center [John J. Madden Mental Health Center, Hines, Illinois] and that was a state agency, the health center that what you said?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: During your mother's time working so hard for the union, do you recall if she had any interaction with Addie Wyatt [HistoryMaker Reverend Addie Wyatt]?  You know she was a noted union leader and she passed recently.
Speaker 2: Yeah I, I do remember, oh well maybe that's why I remember her name, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: --just, just wondered.
Speaker 2: But if I, if I had to guess I would say yes because there is something about that even when I heard it it's like I knew that name, so I gotta do a little research to find out you know, but I'm pretty sure.
Speaker 1: Because if your, your mother would be what age at this point?
Speaker 2: Eighty-three or eighty something.
Speaker 1: And see she, she easily could have been--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --a contemporary of, of
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of Reverend Wyatt, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
Speaker 1: Okay I was just, I was just curious.
Speaker 2: But I, but I don't, you know I couldn't, I couldn't testify to that in court, but (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah (laughter).  I was just wondering.
Story_ID: 635939
Speaker 1: And with your--both your parents being such great role models and the stories that you have shared with us, which one do you think you took after more or maybe you took some qualities from, from both of them, from each of them?
Speaker 2: I think that is, I think I, I'm a little, I'm alike, a little like both of them.  But, I'm a lot more like my mother [Annie Henderson Jones]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --than my father [German Jones, Sr.].  Yeah, my father was a very disciplined person.  My mother was not that disciplined, and I'm not either (laughter).  You know time really don't mean a whole lot to her--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --didn't mean a whole lot and it--I try to do better because you know I'm old now, so I learned better, but I'm more like my mother--
Speaker 1: More like your mother.
Speaker 2: --but, but my mother was a very passionate person--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and if she cared about something she was, she cared.  My father was more reserved.  You know he, he would like you, but he kind of liked you from a distance.  He was not that approachable in many ways.  Even though the kids, now kids could always approach him, but adults not, not so much.
Speaker 1: He's not, he wasn't that approachable huh?
Speaker 2: He was friendly.  Like I said he was a no nonsense kind of person.  You couldn't come to him with no junk.  You had to be coming with something serious, you know, and, but my mother she was, she was a people's person.
Story_ID: 635940
Speaker 1: As far as your mother [Annie Henderson Jones] working with the union [American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 286], do you recall any strikes that she might have been involved in, any, you know action against the, the state?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, I can't remember.  I really, the only thing that I do know is that when she died she was working on a real important case with a woman that had, was being treated unjustly and they were making a really big case out of it, and she was advocating for this woman.  It was a white lady, and that, I, I think that's the other thing about my mother that, that, well that's probably something I did not take after her because it took me awhile to understand that people are people because I grew up in a very sheltered in kind of environment.  I didn't have that much exposure to people outside of my culture and, but my mother when she, she always worked around a bunch of different people, so people were people to her.  And I remember wondering, "Why, why are you fighting so hard for this white woman.  You know you just, you won't get any sleep, you won't take care of your--why?"  She said, "It don't, what, what difference do that make?"  And I couldn't answer that like, "I don't know" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, that was just one of the cases.  There were many other situations like, I mean anybody that needed her they had her.
Speaker 1: They had her.  And she worked in an integrated environment, work environment obviously.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to be sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they all, every, they all respected her and they all loved her.  You know there were maybe a couple of people that didn't like her 'cause she was an in your face kind of person.
Speaker 1: Your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know you couldn't just blow her off, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, would you say was she like her mother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was, my grandmother was a, was a grandmother.  I mean she was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a house, she was in the house.  She, she didn't have too much to do with anybody outside of her family.  She was very family oriented.  She, you know--
Speaker 1: And at this point she was living with you all, still living--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's, and that's Ms.--
Speaker 2: Now, now she might have been different when she was down south in her, in her environment where she had grown up and she knew everybody and all that, 'cause I do remember you know times that I might have gone down there hearing things about Ms. Reola [Reola James Henderson] used to do that and Ms. Reola used to do that.  So, she, she, I don't think she was as reserved at, in, in Arkansas as she became in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, will you spell her name for me again just to make sure.
Speaker 2: R-E-O-L-A.
Speaker 1: Middle name was?
Speaker 2: I don't recall her having a middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay and last name was Henderson.
Speaker 2: Well, her maiden name was James.
Speaker 1: James.
Speaker 2: Her married name was Henderson.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, her maiden name was James, okay.
Story_ID: 635941
Speaker 1: Now tell me more about your siblings.  Can you start at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh my god (laughter).
Speaker 1: --top and, and just come down and, and give me you know their ages and, and, are they still with us?
Speaker 2: Two of my brothers have passed on.
Speaker 1: Can you just sort of give me the order and who they were and 'cause you said you were obviously your mother's [Annie Henderson Jones] third child.
Speaker 2: Right and I prefer to just give their first names rather than--
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: It's my brother Charles [Charles Porter].  He, he's passed away.  He was born in 1944, and he passed away in 2009.  My brother Larry [Larry Henderson] he was born in 1946, and he still, he lives here in Chicago [Illinois].  He is retired now, but he was a [U.S.] military man as well as he worked here at the organization [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] for--up until his retirement.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were very supportive, my family in helping with all of this that we're doing here.  Then there's me and then there's my sister, Beverly [Beverly Jones Blow].  She was born May 26th, 1953, and she currently works here.  She's our IT [information technology] person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she, now that's really who's like my mother.  And then there's my sister, Rhonda [Rhonda Jones Mabry].  She was born November 4th, 1954, and she's, she, she had a stroke, which she's recovered from but it did leave her with some limited abilities, so she is on disability now.  She also has leukemia that's in remission right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there's my brother German, Jr. [German Jones, Jr.], who was born April 7th, 1957.  And then there was my brother, Ray [Raymond Jones], who passed away.  He was born September 30th, 1958.  And then there's my youngest brother, Cornelius [Cornelius Jones], who was born February 28th, 1960.
Speaker 1: You remember the year and everything when everybody was born, that's wonderful (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah I was the, I had to remember those things.  I was the, when the insurance man would come my mother would say, well they called me Rose, "Rose [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Jones] come here and give this insurance man all these birthdays" (laughter).
Story_ID: 635942
Speaker 1: Now, what schools did you attend here in the Chicago [Illinois] area, elementary school?
Speaker 2: I attended eight grammar schools.
Speaker 1: Oh did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  The first one was Williams [Daniel Hale Williams Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], that's where I started.  And I might not be able to name them all in order--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but I could probably name all the rest of them too.
Speaker 1: Right, just, just throw them out there and if you don't remember the order.
Speaker 2: Okay there was Beale [William G. Beale Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], B-E-A-L-E, Kozmiski [Charles Kozminski Elementary School; Kozminski Community Academy, Chicago, Illinois], K-O-Z-M-I-S-K-I, Fiske [John Fiske Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], F-I-S-K [sic. Fiske], Forrestville North [sic. Forrestville Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], and Forrestville South [sic. Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois], two different schools, two different levels you know.  Haven [Haven School, Chicago, Illinois], that's another school.  I'm forgetting one.
Speaker 1: What about your high school?
Speaker 2: Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Dunbar, 'cause I was I just thinking if you know lived and grew up in a certain area then, so Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 635943
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], but I dropped out in tenth grade 'cause I got pregnant with my daughter [Victoria C. Brady]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when I was fifteen.
Speaker 2: Okay, when you were fifteen.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay was that, how was that period of your life for you?
Speaker 1: I was, I wanted to be grown you know.  I, I wanted to be grown and out, out my parent's house.  I wanted to be married, so I figured if I got pregnant they'd have to let me get married right.  Well, wrong--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --cause I had a crazy mama [Annie Henderson Jones], a batty mama.  She said no way.  My dad [German Jones, Sr.] was willing to go along with it; my mother said no.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you wanted to get married--
Speaker 1: I did.
Speaker 2: --and you wanted to leave home.
Speaker 1: I did, I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And my mother told me, she said, "If you that much in love, you'll be still in love when you eighteen."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Of course she was right I was not in love (laughter) when I was, by the time I got eighteen.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I was, I was kind of rebellious too.  I was very rebellious 'cause I, as I said earlier I think that I felt that I had gotten pushed aside and I also realize now that probably somewhere in my childhood all those places that I stayed when babysitters and all that, I probably got abused somewhere along the line and it caused me to have certain kinds of behavioral patterns and--
Speaker 2: But, you don't recall specifically?
Speaker 1: Not specifically, but I do have some, some thoughts on, you know some things.  Sometimes I get a feeling that this is something that, that I know more about than I, than I remember.  Something will happen.  It don't have to be, it could happen to somebody else, and I'll have a thought that I know about it, you know, oh I know yeah that, but I can't--
Speaker 2: Do you mean like physical abuse?
Speaker 1: Well, I know I was physically--my father was a very tough disciplinarian.  He was hell bent on making me conform to the house rules, and I was just as hell bent that I wasn't gonna do it.  So, we had, we always had our thing, and he believed in, in, the whooping.  So, I got more whoopings than anybody in my whole family, all of them put together.
Speaker 2: Really, okay.
Speaker 1: I was the, I was the reb- I was a very rebellious child and very much into having my way, having it may way and didn't care about the consequences you know.  They couldn't, and that's what he didn't like.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He wanted to break me.
Speaker 2: Wanted to break you.
Speaker 1: Because it was like a challenge to him I think in some way that he couldn't control me, and he had real, he was real rigid and had good control over everybody else except me and my youngest sister [Rhonda Jones Mabry].  She was a lot like me, and I think she deliberately tried to be a lot like me.  I think I became a role model to her unbeknowing to me, but when I think about her life, even now today, I think that she try to live up to my, what she consider my standards.  I, I just didn't know.
Speaker 2: And so there were a lot of battles in your house, with your mother as well?
Speaker 1: Well yeah, but not so much her.  I could get around my mother a lot easier--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --than I could my father and then a lot of things she would defer to my fa- father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: "I'm gonna tell you dad."
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.
Speaker 2: But that didn't put the fear in you?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Okay and so--
Speaker 1: Obviously not, I still went and did what I wanted to do (laughter).
Story_ID: 635944
Speaker 1: So then you had your child [Victoria C. Brady] and you and your child lived there with your parents [Annie Henderson Jones and German Jones, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --obviously.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then when you became eighteen and you were officially--
Speaker 2: Well, before I became eighteen I tried to go back to school because of course I had left Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and I tried to go back.  I wanted to go--you know when I was sixteen I, I realized that I needed to go back to school.  I needed because it wasn't about me anymore.  It was really became more about my child.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry what, what, what grade were you in when you had--?
Speaker 2: Tenth.
Speaker 1: Did you finish the tenth grade?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so at that point you had a child okay and then how did that work you started going back to school?
Speaker 2: I got into, they had like a lot of different programs for kids back then, NYC, Neighborhood Youth Corps.  So, I got into one of those programs and you know they paid you to go to school, twenty dollars a week or something like that.  In fact, that, that might have been, that might have been another program.  They may have, they had several different programs.  I got in all, everyone one of them that I could.  But, I, I wanted my diploma.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I wanted to, I wanted my high school diploma, and so, and I really decided that I wanted to go to college believe or not because--
Speaker 1: Even at that point.
Speaker 2: --nobody in my family had gone to college.  But, I decided I wanted to go to college.
Speaker 1: Even as you pursued your high school degree you knew then--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you wanted to go on to college, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I, I wanted to go to nursing school, and I wanted to you know go to college to become a nurse.  And, but anyway Dunbar they would not accept me back in school.  They said I'd be a bad influence on the other kids because of the fact that I had a baby and when I was there I wasn't there half the time.  I cut so much in the, you know I was, my record was horrible--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --although I was an honor student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean my grades, my scores indicated that I was way above average in, in intelligence.
Speaker 1: And you made good grades.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, when I applied myself I made good grades when I was there, but see the fact of the matter is I was not there.  I was at--you know cutting classes.  I cut one, one whole semester really, and my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] didn't find out until that summer when we, and the truant officer came to our house in the summer and, and, and told her about all the days I had been out that previous semester and she was so, I remember her being so upset (makes noise).  She was really upset.  And she was more upset at the school than me, because she wanted to know why did they wait so long--
Speaker 1: Wait so long.
Speaker 2: --to, to make her aware of what was going on and they, they had no explanation for it.
Speaker 1: Well she never, she never spanked you or whipped you as (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She did.  Sometimes--
Speaker 1: I know you said your father [German Jones, Sr.] was the discipline--
Speaker 2: --she would do and she didn't think it was effective enough, so she'd tell my father and I'd get two whoopings that day.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So what do you think was going on in your young life that made you so rebellious and skipping school and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I just had a lot of anger and animosity.  Like I said I think it had a lot to do with me feeling like nobody cared about me, that I got you know pushed aside.  I was that middle child.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not even middle, the oldest daughter and, and, and people have a tendency to think when you're the oldest that you don't need, that you have less needs than the younger ones.
Speaker 1: Younger ones yeah.
Speaker 2: And I think I, I became resentful of that because remember for the first five years of my life I was the only child--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and now all of a sudden I'm not, you know so.  I think that was always one of the, one of the things that was underlying factors there.
Story_ID: 635945
Speaker 1: At what point did you get your, your high school diploma?
Speaker 2: My daughter [Victoria C. Brady], she was, my daughter was about seven, eight maybe, and I was helping her with her homework and she just laid her pen down, her pencil or whatever, just laid it down and looked at me and she called me Rose [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Jones], because she called my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] Mama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she said, "Rose, why don't you go back to school?  You so smart you should go back to school."  And it kind of stunned me that she said that, and I couldn't respond 'cause I had no response for that.  I mean it just totally took me off my feet, but that thought stayed with me and I, I'm like, "Why don't I?"  And so something told me, don't ask me what, the spirit maybe said well go take the test, the GED [General Educational Development] test and if you pass it then you know you can go and get in, in, in school and become a nurse.  It's like, so the dream again it, it started coming alive again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went and took the GED exam, no studying nothing just went and took it.  Failed it by two points, two points in math, which right today math is still my weakest area (laughter).  But, what happened with that is that it encouraged me.  If I could go take that test and fail by just two points--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --without studying--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --or you know cold, just cold like that, I should be able to study a little bit and pass that test because back then you didn't have to take the whole test over.  All I needed to do was take the math test over.  So, I went and registered at Kennedy-King College [Chicago, Illinois], my girlfriend and I went and registered.  Now I registered quite by accident.  The reason I say that is because my girlfriend and I, Tina Dollybingman [Tina Dollybingham Hill (ph.)] was her name, is her name, Dollybingman Hill now, but she, she had graduated.  She finished, she, she graduated out of DuSable [DuSable High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we both wanted to be nurses, so we went to get into Kennedy-King's they had a licensed LPN [licensed practical nurse] program--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we wanted to get the LPN program and we got all the way up to reg- to the registrar's and, and they told me that, that she could register, but they told me I could not because I didn't have my high school diploma.  So, I felt deflated, but they said but you could get into our GED program and then it was like, oh so now I can go ahead and get those two, study and get these two points I need, take this test, this GED exam and the, and the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --guy told me, "Yeah you, once you've been in the class for a while they'll pretest you and when you're ready they'll give you, you know you can go take the GED and you can get your GED, then you can get into the LPN program."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, that's what I said, "Okay." (Laughter) I said, "Okay, I can do that."  So, I got into the GED program, maybe studied three months or something, got acclimated to the school.  I, I liked the environment.  I liked being there.  I met some nice people.  So, I went and took the, went back and took the test and when I did I decided to go back and register as a college student at Kennedy-King, and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 635946
Speaker 1: And I ran into people like Dr. Vincent Bakeman [HistoryMaker C. Vincent Bakeman]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who was the, the founder and CEO of HRDI [Human Resources Development Institute; Working for America Institute] here in Chicago [Illinois] and Dr. Margaret Burroughs [HistoryMaker Margaret Burroughs]--
Speaker 2: Yes Dr. Burroughs.
Speaker 1: --who was my instructor for two years, two different semesters and Dr. Florence, I mean Ms. Florence John- Florence Brown, who I ended up working as her student assistant.  But, those people encouraged me quite a bit.  Dr. Bakeman most particularly, he became more like a mentor, and he, he started, he was a, he was a visionary kind of person.  And so he would tell his class, all of us, things about, that he, that he envisioned happening like starting an organization like HRDI, like traveling to Africa.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Dr. Burroughs was the same way.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was always telling us about her adventures, and I had gone during one of those classes that I had with the NYC [Neighborhood Youth Corps] programs or whatever.  I don't know how I ended up at Dr. Burroughs house, but in nin- I met her first in 1969 at her house 'cause she had the museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] in her house.
Speaker 2: Yes she did.
Speaker 1: And, and so I ran back into her again at Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  It was just really exciting to me to have her for an instructor.
Speaker 2: So you had met her previously before you ran into her at Kennedy-King?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: How did you end up at her house at that point?
Speaker 1: I mean that's what I'm saying it had to be, it was some kind of class and we, it was the worse snow that Chicago has ever had, that day.  We were at her house because I was trying to get from her house to my house I remember that, that's why I remember so vividly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Were you still in like high school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] at the time or was it (unclear)--?
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't in high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It, I, I, I was in some school--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --but it wasn't high school because I told you I went to all the programs that they had to offer.  I, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah so, so it might have been one of--
Speaker 1: So, it was one of those programs.
Speaker 2: Okay, one of those programs.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay and back to that for just a moment, because when you took the GED [General Educational Development]--
Speaker 1: I had not been in any programs yet.
Speaker 2: Okay and then you--
Speaker 1: It was after that that I--
Speaker 2: But then you got in programs, but yet you went to Kennedy-King, but you didn't have that degree yet, that GED.
Speaker 1: My GED.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but because you had been in the program, but you had never finished (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly 'cause all those programs that I went to they still was, they was only preparing for, they don't, they don't prepare you for real growth, they prepare you to maybe be able to get a job.
Speaker 2: I got you.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Those kind, that's what I didn't understand okay.
Speaker 1: It, it was kind of like you would learn how to become an officer worker--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or something like that, you know and that was, it just was never enough for me.  Well, it was enough for me at the time I thought until my daughter [Victoria C. Brady] planted the seed in my head--
Speaker 2: The seed in your head.
Speaker 1: --and, and, like it took on a life on its own.  I really can't explain how it all happened.  It's just the spirit of God I know.  That's what I know what he's got for you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it, I mean you gonna get, you're going to go, you're gonna fulfill his, his dream, his mission for you, and that is what I believed this was all about.  I believe that it was, everything that happened in my life was preordained even before I got here and so all the way, 'cause those were some really trying times, you know going to school, I got pregnant, I got a divorce, I had married a man that was already married that I didn't know was married.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I mean it was just a lot.  My mother [Annie Henderson Jones] died during the time I was pregnant with the, with the second child [Eddie Jones], four months pregnant with him.  It was like the worst, the best and worst time of my life.
Speaker 2: Okay, let me back up for just a moment.  So did you marry your daughter's father?
Speaker 1: No.
Story_ID: 635947
Speaker 1: So after you, you left school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in the tenth grade, and you were in various programs to prepare you for the work world, were you working different kinds of jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I worked at the Chicago Police station [Chicago Police Department] as a clerk.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked at Spiegel's [Spiegel Inc.] three different times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody worked at Spiegel's. I worked at Woolworth's [Woolworth; F.W. Woolworth Company].  I worked at Walgreens [Walgreens Company], those kinds of jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay and were you living at home with your parents [Annie Henderson Jones and German Jones, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Some of that time.
Speaker 1: Some of that time you were okay.
Speaker 2: When I was seventeen I think I went and got my, my first one bed, one, not one bedroom it was one room (laughter).
Speaker 1: One room okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: It had everything in there, the sink, the, I mean the kitchen.  It was kitchenette.
Speaker 1: I got you.
Speaker 2: And then I was living next door to one, to my very best girlfriend at the time that I had met at one of those schools.  She was a couple of years older than me, but she became my role model.  She became my surrogate mother like you know and so I, I--the problem was that I didn't have anybody to really take care of my daughter [Victoria C. Brady], and I had to, I was having to leave her at my mother's [Annie Henderson Jones] house a lot and while I was over here and I, I just couldn't, I couldn't deal with that.  So, I had to go back home.
Speaker 1: You went back home okay.
Speaker 2: Because I, I never wanted to be or was willing to be separated from my child.
Story_ID: 635948
Speaker 1: What year did you drop out of Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  I know you said it was the tenth grade.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  It was '64 [1964], around February or March of '64 [1964] I believe.
Speaker 1: That you dropped out and then, well you went to Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois], you wanted to get in the program and they were telling you that you needed to get your GED [General Educational Development] to go on and get that finished.  What year was that exactly?
Speaker 2: That was some years later.  I think I first went to Kennedy-King in '76 [1976] somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was some years later.  I know you said your daughter [Victoria C. Brady] was about--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I might have, she, she just have been, oh obviously she was older than seven or eight then.  I mean she was older than seven 'cause that was, she was born in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah so maybe it was seventy- oh okay so yeah it could have been '73 [1973] or '74 [1974] or somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that then you--
Speaker 2: That I went back, that I went to Kennedy.
Speaker 1: That you went back.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and you mentioned you were at [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs' home.
Speaker 2: In '69 [1969] around that time, somewhere in '67 [1967] or '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, there was a bad snowstorm, 'cause I know during that period they, they had some, I wasn't living here then, but I understand that they had some bad storms.  So you think that was '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: It was '67 [1967] or '69 [1969], somewhere between '67 [1967] and '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: 'Cause you know there was a bad blizzard in '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Well, that's when it was, the worst one.
Speaker 1: That's why I say it was during that time when it was that really bad, okay.
Speaker 2: The worse one, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were trying to get home.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay and it was after that that you went on and worked on your, on your degree.
Speaker 2: We'll, nah I didn't just go work on my degree per se, I wanted to get a GED (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's what I mean (laughter), I mean that degree, that was a degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and then, and so, then back to your experiences at Kennedy-King.  It seems as though you met some people who certainly had an impact on your life.
Speaker 2: They did and when I did get the GED I never left until, I never totally left until I had the associate's degree.
Speaker 1: Until you had the associate's degree.
Speaker 2: But I did miss a couple of semesters here or there, like the semester my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] died I, I dropped out that semester.
Speaker 1: So, that was during this period that you lost your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lost my mother in 1980.  I'm just saying I, it was sometime after, after I had gotten my, I got the diploma, the, the high school GED I think it was '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked for maybe, I went to school for, maybe taking a couple of classes or something and worked.  And so I would work and go to school and then--or maybe I'll sit out a semester and go to work.  Yeah, I was just doing whatever I could to get through it.  But, it was around '79 [1979] on--it wasn't around '79 [1979], it was '79 [1979].  My mother died September 28th, 1979.  My father [German Jones, Sr.] died September 28th, 1994.
Speaker 1: Ninety-four [1994], okay.
Speaker 2: My mother died September 28th, nineteen nine- 19--1979.  My father died September 28th, 1994.  They died to the same day--
Speaker 1: To the same day.
Speaker 2: --fifteen years apart.
Speaker 1: Fifteen years apart.  Now when you mother passed were you still living at home at that point?
Speaker 2: No, I had my own apartment.
Speaker 1: You had your own apartment with, and your daughter was with you.
Speaker 2: My daughter was, my daughter was with me.  I was four months pregnant with my son [Eddie Jones], and--
Speaker 1: When your mother died.
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: When your mother passed you were four months pregnant with your son (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So at what point--
Speaker 2: I was living on 63rd [Street] and Michigan [Avenue].
Story_ID: 635949
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) At what point did you get married?
Speaker 2: That first ti- the one, I'm trying to think of what year that was because my son [Eddie Jones] was not in the picture at all.  That had to be '75 [1975] or '76 [1976], maybe '77 [1977], somewhere between seventy- '74 [1974] and '77 [1977], somewhere in there.  I can't remember exactly when.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now so did, did you--
Speaker 2: So we, my husband, well, such as my husband and I had been through this bogus marriage and all of this stuff before I even got pregnant because he was, he is my father's, my child's father.
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to know, okay.
Speaker 2: So, this, we just (laughter), it was just one of those things we just couldn't live with each other and couldn't live without.  But, my son wasn't born until 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and he and I had already decided that we weren't gonna be together.  We, so that's why I was so devastated about getting pregnant.  All the time we had been together I never got pregnant when I wanted to get pregnant.  We wanted to be pregnant.  We couldn't get pregnant, and then all of a sudden we fooled around one time and whatever you know and there it is, so.
Speaker 1: At that point you pretty much, the relationship you felt was over?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay I just, I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but I'm just trying to put it in perspective (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I felt it was over, I, I don't know how he was feeling.  I, I don't think he had totally, I don't, maybe I hadn't even really totally given up, but, but I know it wasn't really a real relationship.
Story_ID: 635950
Speaker 1: You say your mother [Annie Henderson Jones] passed and, and you were already pregnant with your son [Eddie Jones]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but you were not living at home.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And you were still at Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] at that time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Kennedy-King, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and you got your degree from there--
Speaker 2: I was, I know I was at Kennedy-King because I was trying to--my mother was in intensive care and I needed to leave to--I was at the hospital visiting her and I needed to leave to go to school to take a test that day.  It was a very important test for a class, and as I, she really didn't want me to leave and, but I, I, I was telling her I had to go and, and, "Mom you gonna be okay." 'Cause they had already said that she was gonna be moved to her room out of intensive care.  I said, "You gonna be okay because they're gonna put you in your room and I, I, I really need to go take this test." And dah, dah, dah.  So, I said my goodbyes, I kissed her and I went toward the door, when I got to the door and put my hand on the door to open it to go out I glanced back at her and when I glanced back at her she had turned her back to me and was laying like this with her arm thrown over her shoulder and I just said I can't, I just turned around and went back and I didn't go to school that day.  And I remember she was, they brought her food and she was making me eat and doing you know all of that kind of stuff that was really not things that she ordinarily would--well she would do it but not, not since she had been sick, so I was like oh okay she really feeling good, she coming around, thinking about her grandchild now (laughter) you know.  And so they did, they, that night, that evening they moved her to the room, to her room and the next morning I called the hospital and they told me they had rushed her back to intensive care, so that was basically the last time that I ever had an opportunity to talk to my mother.
Speaker 1: To talk to her and at that point she really was talking to you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, wasn't just you talking to her.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 635951
Speaker 1: Boy I know that must have been a very difficult time for you and your fam- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I dropped out of school [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  Of course I had to drop out of school.  I couldn't, you know it was just a lot going on there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I didn't get back until maybe sometime in '80 [1980] and I went, and I didn't finished 'til '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: To get your--
Speaker 2: I started that journey way back in seventy something, '77 [1977] or something and I didn't--
Speaker 1: To get that, to get that associate's degree.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Just to get an associate's degree.
Speaker 1: And, but obviously you weren't deterred from your goal.
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I, I, it's, it's because of my children that I wasn't.  That gave me a reason and a purpose you know.  I wanted to make sure that I could provide for them and I, I take that, I took that response- even in, even at, as immature as I was in many ways that's one thing I've never been unclear about.  I always knew that that was my responsibility and that God had given me these children.  And I guess that's the one thing that I got from my own childhood no matter how crazy our family was or whatever, how dysfunctional it appeared, we always had our mother [Annie Henderson Jones] and our father [German Jones, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They were always there, you know, and so that's what I knew.  I knew family to be like that, and that's what I wanted.  Of course, I didn't have the father for my children like I wanted to, but their fathers were very much involved in their lives.
Speaker 1: Both their fathers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  In fact, we just buried my daughter's [Victoria C. Brady] father last month, yeah.  And my son [Eddie Jones] he, he lived with his father.  When he was twelve, I sent him to live with his father because he needed to be with his father, a man.  The streets, I just decided the streets was not gonna get my child.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there were some disciplinary problems or you just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a boy (laughter).  He was a boy and he was trying to hang out and the gangs was on him like white on rice, you know, trying to make him join and he couldn't even go to the store without somebody you know up in his face about getting in the gang and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you sent him to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) all of that.
Speaker 1: --live with his father.
Story_ID: 635952
Speaker 1: Let's go back to Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  Now at what year did you enroll there?  Was it immediately out of from getting your associate's degree [at Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's see I got my associate's degree in 1980, and that, the guy I introduced you to, George Jones, that's when I got my job at Ada McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  He was one of the program directors at Ada McKinley back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got a job as workshop supervisor and it was working with developmentally delayed and handicapped people, which was probably one of the best work experiences I've ever had because I learned a lot from working with, with that population of people.  I learned a lot from them.  They taught me a lot about life, about humbleness, about not giving up.  I think I picked up a lot of that right there.
Speaker 1: Right there.
Speaker 2: Yeah because--
Speaker 1: Had you--I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, because these were people that were totally disadvantaged, but they worked like they had everything going for them.  They never gave up.  They, they, they were not lazy.  They didn't make excuses.  They, they, they were just really I'm telling you special.  They were very special people.
Speaker 1: And this is where you were working after you got that degree, that associates' degree--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you had that experience.  Had you ever been around mentally or physically handicapped people in your family or while you were growing up or any other--?
Speaker 2: I think they're all mentally (laughter), but for a short period of time I worked with my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] at Madden Mental Health Center [John J. Madden Mental Health Center, Hines, Illinois] just for a short time.  That was just not, it did not work out well for me.  It was a night job, and I was trying to go to school.  I was trying to do too much, so it didn't work out.  But that was my real- only real experience aside from my own crazy family with mental illnesses or, or developmentally delayed or handicapped people.  I didn't have a lot of experience, but I had a lot of compassion and I think that's what you have to have when you're working with that population of people.  You have to go step outside of yourself and you have to join, get in their world.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, and, and so they all, they clung to me, they, they really loved me, and I loved them.
Speaker 1: And you loved them.
Speaker 2: And I still see some of them right now today.
Speaker 1: Do you?
Speaker 2: And they know me.  That's the most amazing thing.  Same thing, also getting ahead of the story again, but the same thing in foster care.  I mean I got kids, people that were little kids like this that are really grown, way grown people that still know me.
Speaker 1: Still know you.
Speaker 2: It's amazing.
Speaker 1: Well you, you're obviously very special to them.  So working at, you said Ada S. McKinley, emotionally and physically handicapped kids did that inspire you?
Speaker 2: They were adults.
Speaker 1: Oh adults, that's right.  Did that inspire you to go on and get your next degree or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because a job position came up where there was a promotion, but I couldn't get promoted because I didn't have a degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They said you needed to have a bachelor's degree to get this promotion, and I'm still trying to raise two kids [Victoria C. Brady and Eddie Jones], so I want this promotion.  So, I, I think that's when I decided I was gonna go, not only was I gonna get a bachelor's, but I was gonna get a master's [degree].
Speaker 1: A master's.  You decided then you gonna do both.
Speaker 2: To go all the way.  I didn't know how.  I didn't know, and I did a lot of things to get there like--I don't know if I should even tell you about (laughter), but like being on public aid and working.  I did those kinds of things because I wanted my fam- my kids to have a decent life.  You couldn't provide a decent life for a kid and all you get, all you was getting was public aid.  Now I ended up having to pay back money that I had got while I was working--
Speaker 1: See (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --and it was like all good.  I had no problem paying it back you know.
Speaker 1: And you did it, you did it.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was always my intention that one day I was gonna pay it back anyway.
Speaker 1: Pay it back and you did do that, paid this back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 635953
Speaker 1: How old were you at this point in your life?  And about what time was this that you started back, that you decided to go to Kennedy-King [Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois], I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went back to school in 1983.
Speaker 1: --Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] then?
Speaker 2: Chicago State.  I started there in 1983, so I was thirty-five yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-four, thirty-five years old.
Speaker 1: And then you were going, going on to get your next--and so you, well did you continue working at Ada S. McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] as you proc- you know finished this degree?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no I wasn't working at Ada McKinley.  I left Ada McKinley to go back to school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's, I left them to go back to school.  Everybody thought I was totally crazy 'cause I had no income, no thoughts, where was I gonna, how was I gonna live going back to school.  And, and you know I had my own apartment, I had the two kids, so I took out a lot of student loans--
Speaker 1: Okay,
Speaker 2: --and which is, that I still owe today (laughter).  But, I took out a lot of student loans and that's how we survived.
Speaker 1: And, and, and you made it, you made it.
Speaker 2: That's how we survived.
Speaker 1: And when did you get that degree?  What, you know did you actually--
Speaker 2: I got the first degree--
Speaker 1: The first degree--
Speaker 2: --in 1986.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got my bachelor's [degree] in 1986 and my master's [degree] in 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay, so like you said you went right on through.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and got it and during that whole time you did not try to work, I mean I'm just wondering did you have part time jobs?
Speaker 2: I did work, I did work as a graduate assistant when I was in grad school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I worked as a graduate assistant in the counseling department at Chicago State.  And when I was working on the bachelor's I didn't work.  When I got in, in Chicago State I did not work.  I, that's when I just lived off the student loans.  My mother [Annie Henderson Jones], no not my mother, she was gone, but my cousin the one that I, oh you didn't go through the halls with, yeah, yeah my cousin the one I showed you the police officer that's on the wall out there.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, yes on the, okay.
Speaker 2: He helped me a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Gave me my first car, helped me buy my books.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This was a cousin?
Speaker 2: He was a cousin.  He was my first, my mother's sister's son oldest child.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was a typical day like you while you were in school with two kids?
Speaker 2: I don't know, crazy.  Victoria [Victoria C. Brady] actually was a teenager.  She was, Victoria was, she was eighteen, seventeen or eighteen.  She was, she was real grown, I mean you know she was at--
Speaker 1: While you were getting these degrees.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was at CVS [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  She was like a senior in high school, so she was helpful in that she would watch her brother [Eddie Jones] when I was in school.
Speaker 1: And how old was he during this time?
Speaker 2: Two or three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And sometime my dad [German Jones, Sr.] would watch him for me, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I didn't live that far from him.  Sometimes his own father would watch him or take him you know and keep him, so--
Speaker 1: So you did have some support from--
Speaker 2: I had some support.
Speaker 1: --and which is always a good thing.  And what was going on at Chicago State during that time.  Was that when Mr. Alexander [Benjamin H. Alexander] was there--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: --as, as the president?  Do you recall that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't recall that.  I can't think of the name, but I don't believe it was Alexander.
Speaker 1: Okay, it might have been the person who came--
Speaker 2: I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: We didn't--
Speaker 2: But, but I wouldn't have had any interaction with him anyway, whoever he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, just in case.  You know you were very outgoing--you might have.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You might have.
Story_ID: 635954
Speaker 1: And what was going on, on campus [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] during that time?  Do you recall anything?  Were you involved in anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were, they were remodeling.  There was mud everywhere.  Ooh, it was messy.  That's what I remember mostly.  Oh, I, I got married.  I did get married in '85 [1985], not to either of my children's fathers though, but, actually it was '87 [1987], I'm sorry.  I got married in '87 [1987], but we weren't together in '85 [1985].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he would take me to school.  He would pick me up.  He was a big support to me too.
Speaker 1: So this was your second husband.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, big support to you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Gre- Gregory Herring.  As you'll see some of the documents around here have Vivian Jones Herring [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Jones].

Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: No, I don't they, well my youngest brother, the youngest one, the two younger ones, the two younger ones were very supportive, Ray [Raymond Jones] and Neil [Cornelius Jones], they were very supportive.

Speaker 1: Your brothers.
Speaker 2: My brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay then.
Speaker 2: My two youngest brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The others were kind of wrapped in their own worlds and everybody was still going through so much when my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] died.  It kind of tore the family apart a little bit.  Everybody was just so traumatized because it was suddenly, it was sudden, nobody expected it.  We were all a bunch of brats.  She had spoiled us all, you know, and so we did not handle that situation--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --very well, none of us did.  So it took us some years to--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --come back together.
Speaker 1: So what about Mr. Herring.  Was, you were in school during that time and you found was he supportive?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was very supportive.
Speaker 2: He would take me to school and pick me up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I got through it, and he would have my son, Vance [Eddie Jones], with him a lot of times, you know watching him.  He was, he was, he, he was very supportive.
Story_ID: 635955
Speaker 1: And were you involved in any activities on campus [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] or were you just strictly just going to school (simultaneous)?

Speaker 1: Yes.  And 'cause what were you getting your degree in?
Speaker 2: School guidance and counseling.  It was like a psychology based--my, most of the classes were psychology classes, but the discipline was school guidance and counseling.  It was in education.

Speaker 2: MSED, a master of science in education.
Speaker 1: And education.  And at that point did you then pursue getting a job or had you already gotten a job or what happened during this period of your life?
Speaker 2: I already had a job 'cause I had gone back to Ada McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I got the bachelor's degree--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in '86 [1986], actually I worked for a short time--I, I worked for a short time at Olive Harvey [Olive-Harvey College, Chicago, Illinois] as, I taught English as a second language and I also taught GED [General Educational Development] over there and let's see, I, I also taught in the public schools as a sub [substitute teacher] for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--
Speaker 1: And this is while you were getting your master's just--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, but I ended up back at Ada McKinley and this is how I got involved in foster care.  I went to Ada McKinley and got a job working in their foster care department, and that, well yeah that was my intro- introduction into foster care.  And that was in eighty- right, right around '86 [1986] or '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Were you able to get the kind of job you wanted at Ada S. McKinley at that point because you had your--
Speaker 2: Well, I got a job as a caseworker and you, you know--
Speaker 1: And that's the kind of job you--
Speaker 2: And that's what I wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was working on my master's--
Speaker 1: At that point.
Speaker 2: --when I went there and I had an agreement with the people, with the, the lady that hired me that I would be able to do my, do my internship at Ada McKinley and that I would also be able to leave an hour early on one day a week to go for my group at the school.  And her boss--when, when she made me that promise, when I took the job and she made me that promise her boss wasn't there.  Her boss was gone somewhere for a couple of months or whatever, but when her boss came back, her boss said no I couldn't, I couldn't have that time off and I, you know and I tried to reason with the lady.  I told her you know, "I'll come in early, I'll just--won't take lunch, whatever I need to do I need to be able to, I gotta go for this class."
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was not willing to do it, so I had to leave.
Speaker 1: You had to leave.
Speaker 2: I had to make a choice.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was either give up my, give up working on my master's or give up the job.  I gave up the job.
Speaker 1: And in what year was this and how close were you to getting your master's?
Speaker 2: I was, it was in '88 [1988], and it was in the summer, during the summer.
Speaker 1: And you would have done your--
Speaker 2: And I would have graduated in December--
Speaker 1: Oh. --of '88 [1988].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you did graduate in December--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --1988.
Story_ID: 635956
Speaker 1: And then what did you do?  What, what, how did your life move at that point?
Speaker 2: I got a job working at Lutheran Social Services [Lutheran Social Service of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] in foster care.  I stayed in foster care 'cause I, I liked working with the kids.  And I worked with a lady named Rosetta Webb, well you've got a picture of her over there as well as George [George Jones], but Rosetta Webb was probably one of the most professional people that I knew.  She had her LCSW.  She was just really, really a great person.
Speaker 1: LCSW?
Speaker 2: Licensed clinical social worker.
Speaker 1: I just wanna make sure we clarify that okay.
Speaker 2: And so we became friends and she taught me a lot.  She taught me a lot about foster care, about management and all of that, and I enjoyed working there.  In fact, she was, she wanted me to run the adoption program and I was thinking about doing it, but, but then the state opened up jobs and I decided to follow my mother's [Annie Henderson Jones] footsteps and go get a job with the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: DCSF [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services].
Speaker 1: What year and what were you doing with, with the job?
Speaker 2: I got the job in 19--I got the job toward in 1989, and I was a child welfare specialist one.
Speaker 1: And working at downtown [Chicago, Illinois] office?
Speaker 2: I worked--no I wish.  They, they assigned me to the West Side [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on Cicero [Avenue] somewhere (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 635957
Speaker 1: So we're talking about you and your years at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois], you're finishing up your degree and you left Ada S. McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] so you could finish that degree.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what was it like when you finally had that diploma in hand that day?  Do you remember the day, the occasion?
Speaker 2: Yeah I do.  It was, I was happy, but I was sad too.  I mean for more than one reason.  Of course I was sad that my mother [Annie Henderson Jones] was not there to see the, see the occasion, but I think what saddened me even more is that it didn't seem, it, it, my family wasn't as excited as I thought they would be.  You know I thought they would be a lot happier for me and proud of me.
Speaker 1: And you mean your siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my siblings.  Not my children [Victoria C. Brady and Eddie Jones].  They were happy, and they were proud and they were excited (laughter).
Speaker 1: What about your father [German Jones, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My dad was proud.  He has never been one to get too excited about much, but he was, he was, I could see that he was very proud and that meant a lot.  But, but it was my siblings that I always struggled with to have a really close relationship with, and I, I mean I had that with my two younger brothers [Raymond Jones and Cornelius Jones].  I had a very--and my oldest brother [Charles Porter].  Those were the three that I had the really close relationships with.  Now my sister, my, my sister [Beverley Jones Blow] that is next to me we're kind of close, and the one that's under her [Rhonda Jones Mabry] that wanna be like me I thought we were close, but I, I, I think that we was too much alike and so it was all, I didn't realize it was a lot of animosity between us until later in life really.  But, again that's another story (laughter).  But that day they had a little reception for me at my youngest brother's house, and I think I felt a little let down.  I thought that it was gonna be like the whole family there with all of our friends that we had grown up with, that they would make a big deal out of it, but it wasn't like that.  They had a cake about that big (gestures).  It was just something that my daughter had managed to get herself.  You know it just, it just never impacted them the way I thought it would or should.  And, and I don't know why, why it meant so much to me.  I guess because of the fact that I had disappointed so many people early on that I wanted to prove a point, and what I didn't realize is that there was a lot of jealousy in my family towards me because they always saw me as being the one to get all of the attention and being special.  And obviously it was just the opposite.  It just goes to show you, you don't what's, what's on a person's mind you know.  The kind of attention that was I getting I don't know why anybody would want to be jealous of that (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Again what was the date and the year that you actually got that degree?
Speaker 2: It was December 1988.
Speaker 1: And that was the, the same day that they had the family gathering for you too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So it was, it was probably more me than anything.  Nobody really had a lot of money right back then.  Everybody was struggling with their own issues and you know.  So, I, I probably was just being overly sensitive and, and probably more than anything else because my mother wasn't there.  But now, now that I think about it because later, and, and the other thing is, let me just throw this in, they had already gone through my bachelor's with me (laughter) and so I had had the, I did have the big family thing for the bachelor's.  So, that's probably why, you know.  My cousin was there when I had the, got the, the bachelor's degree, and he, he's like, "Nobody is gonna make the speech, family speech but me."  He wanted to make the family speech 'cause everybody was there.  It was really nice.
Speaker 1: And what was that date again just for clarification?
Speaker 2: That was in '86 [1986].  I think it was December of '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and they-
Speaker 2: That I got the--
Speaker 1: --did they did have a big gathering?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, I guess they said it's just too much.  "Who do you think she is?"  Kind of thing, I don't know.  And I might have been acting a little who knows.  I don't know.  I might have been acting like, um-hm (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 635958
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that you were the first in your family to get a college degree.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you mean as far as anybody in your family going back, as well as other cousins that you may have known of and that kind of thing as well or do you mean immediate family?
Speaker 2: I think I'm the first one in my family anywhere that got a four--regular, graduated regular college--
Speaker 1: College.
Speaker 2: --and got a degree.
Speaker 1: And got a degree okay.
Speaker 2: I know I'm the first to get a master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So where did you go from that point?  You got, you got a job I assume?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got the job at Lutheran as I exp- Lutheran Social Services [Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and then I left Lutheran Social Services and went to the Department of Children and Family Services [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked there, I went in as a child welfare specialist one and then I transferred over to investigations and became an investigator--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a child protector, child protective investigator.  And then I was recruited by a private agency, PSI [PSI Family Services, Inc.], to come and, and run one of their foster care divisions and I did that.  And that was a for profit, that was another, that was a new world for me because everything I'd ever done before was nonprofit.
Speaker 1: Okay and this was for profit.  When--
Speaker 2: This was for profit.
Speaker 1: When did this happen?  What year was that?
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991].
Speaker 1: That was in '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '90 [1990], '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: And what was that experience, how did it differ from your working experience, you know, for the government, for the state, for the (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Well first of all we had offices downtown [Chicago, Illinois], not, that were first class, class A, A, it was on the A list of offices.  And in nonprofit you try to save as much money as you can, so you try to get as little as you can.  In that world, you get as much as you can (laughter).  So, that was the first culture shock for me and the other thing was that it was a black woman that was the, the owner and, of that company.  And, and, and I, I think that's when I first realized that a black woman could run something on our own, you know.
Speaker 1: And what was her name, do you recall?
Speaker 2: Elizabeth [ph.], we all called her Liz.  She had an Anan- Anan- An- Ananuski [ph.] or something like that.  She was married to a Jew, Jewish guy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was a black woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And she lived, they were based out of D.C. [Washington, D.C.], so for her to come here and, and start a company, a for profit company and get a huge contract with the department to do foster care was, it was pretty, pretty, that was pretty ambitious I thought.
Speaker 1: That was.  Now, and she just had the office here, she did not have office in D.C. and other places?
Speaker 2: She had of, offices other places, but they did other things.
Speaker 1: They did other things, that's what I was wondering.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how long were you there at PSI?
Speaker 2: I worked at PSI several years because, well let me just back up a little bit and say that they, they recruited me but they also had hired me before as a consultant to do some contractual stuff and then she recruited me to come on full time and become a part of the PSI team.
Speaker 1: And did you work at another job?
Speaker 2: After PSI?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: P- yeah I did, I went to Lifelink [Lifelink International Adoption].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Bensenville [Illinois].  Because I think my ambition started showing at PSI and I started getting a little bit too ambitious and some of the people that worked with me were intimidated.  They, you know so they did whatever they could to help me out that door.  And you know being who I was it's like okay I can, I don't, I don't really need you anyway.  You know I've learned what I wanted to learn.  So, I went to LifeLink and I liked, I liked it there because it was, even though it was a white organization, the program director was a black female and she was one of those people that truly cared about the families and kids that we served.  And that, that's what I was looking for.  I wanted to be somewhere where it wasn't all about the money. It wasn't all about the product, it was more about the people that we were actually working with.
Story_ID: 635959
Speaker 1: So, I enjoyed working at LifeLink [Lifelink International Adoption, Bensenville, Illinois], but at the same time, by then I was bit by this bug.
Speaker 2: And what was that bug?
Speaker 1: The, starting my own organization.  And the reason was because even at LifeLink, as much as I liked it, I realized there were some things that could have been happening that weren't happing as far as service provision.  Corners were still being cut--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so that you know the, the, to save money or whatever it was, I don't know.  Culture difference, I don't know, but I just felt that the, the clients were being underserved.  So, I wanted to, I wanted to have a chance to show that a black woman, a black, somebody out the neighborhood, a regular person could start a organization and we could take care of ourselves, that we didn't always have to wait for somebody to come from downtown [Chicago, Illinois] or from another state or whatever to take care of what was going on in our community, that we could do it ourselves, and that was my agenda to show that it could be done.  And so I just, I don't even know it just like, it took on a life of its own.
Speaker 2: The, the idea of seed to start.
Speaker 1: The idea just took on a life of its own.  I got the company, the organization incorporated.  There were, you only needed three people on your board to start it, a corporate nonprofit organization, that was my daughter [Victoria C. Brady] and a lady that, that's on the table over there Myrtle Bryant who worked at Ada McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] with me.
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: We got incorporated in '93 [1993], April--
Speaker 2: When did you start it?  You started it before then and then got incorporated?
Speaker 1: Well, I started it in like, in like '92 [1992], but it was just paper.  It wasn't--
Speaker 2: Gotcha.
Speaker 1: --anywhere.  It was just really mostly in my head and them notes and, and the research that I was doing to get things, you know, but I didn't file the papers or any of that stuff until '93 [1993].
Speaker 2: Okay, and now why did you start it, you might have answered some of that, and what was the mission when you started and, and what programs did you start out with?
Speaker 1: The mission when I started was to provide effective social services, comprehensive effective social services in the community, and it was in 1993 as I said--what was your other question I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: What programs did you start with?
Speaker 1: We started, actually we didn't have any programs.  I had to, you know I was trying to get licensed by the Department of Children and Family Services [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services] to provide foster care services.  They--
Speaker 2: That was the first thing you wanted to do, okay.
Speaker 1: That's what I wanted to do, and they told me no they weren't accepting any new agencies in.  And even if they were gonna accept you in, you had to already have an office set up.  You had to have a phone.  You had to have a lock file cabinet.  It was certain things you had to have.  So my husband paid for, for me to get a storefront, and Hank Johnson who became a supporter of ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] helped us get a copier machine.  It was like that, you know got all these things.  This, this lady rented me a storefront.  Her name was Irene [ph.], but I can't think of her last name.  She was so nice to us, and we set up shop with no money.
Speaker 2: Was this before or after you were incorporated?
Speaker 1: This was after.
Speaker 2: After, so you incorporated--
Speaker 1: Because we got incorporated, we got incorporated in my--out in my house.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: So you incorporated in your house.  Was it--
Speaker 2: Yeah when I incorporated, the incorp- the corporation papers had my home address, cause that's where it was in my, in my--
Speaker 1: Okay, was it an apartment or a townhouse?
Speaker 2: It was, it was an apartment.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at my dining room table.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is where you and, and Mr. Herring [Gregory Herring]--?
Speaker 2: That's where we lived, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay that's--
Speaker 2: And my daughter and my--not my daughter she was gone, my son [Eddie Jones].
Story_ID: 635960
Speaker 1: And your son [Eddie Jones] was about what age then when you founded ABJ (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was eleven or twelve.  He was about twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's around the same time that the gangs was trying to get him and, and all of that.  And so he got in trouble in school and I, I, I told him you know that we, I didn't really know what to do with him, so I said I had just seen this movie 'Boyz n the Hood' and how Angela Bassett had done this contract with her son and if he broke the contract he had to go live with his father.  Well, that's the same thing I did with my son.  He got in trouble, I said, "Okay this is gonna, I'm going to give you a chance.  We gonna do this contract and you gonna sign and these are, this is the agreement and if you break this contract then you are going to live with your father."  And I told his father and we discussed it and he was in agreement.  Well, the little bugger, being my son, did get in trouble, he did break the contract, and I did pack him up to go live with his father.
Speaker 1: And he wanted to go right?
Speaker 2: No, wrong.  That would have been too much like right.  But you know I didn't really realize how much he didn't want to go until years later when he, and now I have to tell you that story, I mean he just out of the clear blue sky he said, "You, you didn't want me no way, that's why you sent me to my father."  I (unclear)--like what and I had to sit him down.  We had to have a real heart to heart talk on that because that had been something that was festering him for several years before he blurted that out, but I had no clue that he felt that way.
Speaker 1: How long did he live with his father?
Speaker 2: He stayed with his father 'til he graduated from high school (laughter).
Speaker 1: I see and so he blurted that out during that period when he was still--
Speaker 2: After he grad- no he had graduated and all that by then.
Speaker 1: Okay he--
Speaker 2: Because he felt grown, grown enough to say that to me.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: Back in your agency now what, what is the name and how did you come up with that name?
Speaker 2: Okay the name of the agency, first of all I've already told you how flighty I can be.  You know I can, I'll, I can get into some things and, and not necessarily see them through or whatever.  It has to mean something to me.  So, I wanted the agency to mean something to me and so I named it in memory of my mother [Annie Henderson Jones].  I thought about all her work and her, and her, her beliefs and all of that and realized that a lot, we were a lot the same.  And so I named it Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc. [Chicago, Illinois], and because of all the pa- it was such a long name I started getting a lot of flak from people about the name being so long I cut it down to ABJ.
Story_ID: 635961
Speaker 1: What was the mission at the very beginning, and what were your first programs again [at Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], I know you wanted to do foster care (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wish I could remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I wish I could remember all that, but the mission has always been pretty much what it is today--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that is (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and that's to provide effective comprehensive services to families and children.  But, we don't say that now to people, we say to people now 'cause it's not just families--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and children, it's everybody.
Speaker 1: Everybody.
Speaker 2: And we provide--now--at that time we only provided foster care, now we provide foster care, employment and training.  We have several youth programs.  We do food and clothing pantry.  We do substance abuse treatment and counseling.  So we have a pretty diverse kind of program here now.
Speaker 1: Is this your only facility?
Speaker 2: At this time yes.
Speaker 1: At this time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, one time you had others.
Speaker 2: Yes, there were like, we had like three different facilities at one time.  We started out with a hundred clients, even after being told that we could never get a license let alone a client.  They [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services] gave us, started us out with a hundred clients.  Within two years we had eight hundred clients.
Speaker 1: You started out with about hundred.  Why were you told you would never?
Speaker 2: Well, because they, they, they weren't giving, they said they weren't giving licensing out to any, and then God opened the door, so that gave somebody in the department this brainstorm.  Because they had to be able to say that they had given minorities an opportunity to, to participate.  So, they started this program through Ada McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] (laughter).  They gave Ada McKinley a contract to work with several small agencies that wanted to do foster care and help them get licensed--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and if they could do that, that's all they were supposed to do which is--they didn't have to--I got in the program, but they didn't have to do that for me 'cause I'd already done all the work.  But they gave, they let me in the program and they was able to push it through because the work was done.
Speaker 1: The work was done and less work for them.
Speaker 2: So, that crack that they left there open--God made sure it was there for me to go right on through it with you know.
Speaker 1: And, now Ada S. McKinley had been around, you had worked there, but an agency that big they, I would say was more like a mentor to you.  They, you didn't, an agency like that would not try to squash your dreams and ambitious or the people that you knew, people were helpful I'm asking.
Speaker 2: They were very helpful.  Well, you know I was part of them actually, you know being that I had been around Ada McKinley since 1973, so I had been in, in their lives one way or the other since 1973, so they you know and the, the, the record they had over foster care at that time--Carol Winn who was probably one of the most knowledgeable child welfare people that I knew aside from Rosetta Webb, she was, she was, she was very gracious in helping me, but most of all George Jones who eventually became the executive director, because remember when I started working for him I told you he was just a program director and now he's the executive director and had been for a while.  And so, and, and when he came in here to check up on me like he, he still, still take, take responsibility you know.
Speaker 1: So, he must be very proud of you.
Speaker 2: He is and I'm very proud of him as well.  He's, he's an outstanding person.
Speaker 1: Now you started the agency--
Speaker 2: Him and Dr. Bakeman [HistoryMaker C. Vincent Bakeman].  Now Dr. Bakeman was one of my professors in school and he planted that seed--
Speaker 1: At Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah. He helped to plant that seed yeah, talking about HRDI [Human Resources Development Institute; Working for America Institute, Chicago, Illinois] and talking about become- people becoming more involved in the community and doing things on your own and all of that, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, even then when you were in Chicago State is that were the dream began to have your own agency or maybe at that time it was not a dream?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think it was a dream then (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was a dream for me to be able to get a professional job and be able to make a decent living to take care of my child [Eddie Jones]; that's what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 635962
Speaker 1: And this point you say your child [Eddie Jones] 'cause your other child [Victoria C. Brady] was pretty much adult (simultaneous) (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Already, she was, she had graduated from high school [Chicago Vocational High School; Chicago Vocational Career Academy, Chicago, Illinois], was in college doing well, had started, she was, in fact she was on national tour with 'Dreamgirls'.  She was one of the Dreamgirls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So her life, her, her career had taken off.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did what I asked her to do and that was to complete school.  She got her degree in music theater from Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], so.
Speaker 1: You did not want her to take her mother's path and take the time--
Speaker 2: No, I wanted her to do what she wanted to do.
Speaker 1: I understand.
Speaker 2: You know I wanted her to have her own wings, her own life.  You know 'cause I think in another life I might have been, attempted to be a singer.  But because I had a child, there were many opportunities that I passed up in that field.  I had a chance to go to hang out with a lot of Motown [Motown Records] people back in the '60s [1960s] and so I could have easily gotten into that world.  I had, I had the talent.
Speaker 1: I was gonna say you can sing obviously.
Speaker 2: I, I can sing then (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you ever sing for your staff and people?
Speaker 2: No, I can't sing anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay, just, just wanna know.  Okay--
Speaker 2: But I used to sing in nightclubs, you know stuff like that.
Speaker 1: Part time job.
Speaker 2: That was part of the, yeah remember I told you I had a hustle, well that's part of the hustle I would say.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and this is while you were trying to support your children, going to school and this and that--
Speaker 2: Going to school.
Speaker 1: --so you sang at some nightclubs.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Any songs you remember from that period.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Thelma Houston, 'Don't Leave Me This Way'; 'My Man is a Whole Lot of Man' [sic. 'It Takes A Whole Lotta Man for a Woman Like Me'] (laughter), songs like that.
Speaker 1: You enjoyed that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: It was fun, but, but I never, It was not my world.  I never got into a real comfort zone there.
Speaker 1: Did your daughter, of course probably, knew you were singing and about your talent was she inspired by that to pursue what she did?
Speaker 2: Her father was a singer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her, her father's whole family sings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and so it's just in her blood, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's just in her blood.
Story_ID: 635963
Speaker 1: Now when did your agency, ABF, when did it first get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, ABJ, when did it first get accredited?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Like near the beginning?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.  It wasn't that easy to get accredited.  You couldn't just--I think our first accreditation might have come in 2002 or somewhere like that maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it might have been about ten years later.
Speaker 2: It was almost ten years later yeah.
Speaker 1: And your accrediting organization is COA?
Speaker 2: Council on Accreditation.
Speaker 1: Now are you familiar with--
Speaker 2: They're out of New York.
Speaker 1: Now are you familiar with CARF [Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities] as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we don't need CARF, I mean COE is the same as CARF.  CARF is more geared toward hospitals and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all that and COA is more towards social services.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to, in my mind, just to understand and know the difference there.  And what was it like the, the first time, I mean, 'cause I know it can be difficult to get accredited, it could be a stressful period trying to get ready for that and to go through the process, so what was the experience with the staff and how did you feel when you finally--?
Speaker 2: Oh my god, at that time we had over a hundred people working here, so it was a huge staff, but you'll see pictures over there, COA pictures were COA all the way and you know just a lot, we did a lot of hype kind of activities to get the staff involved and engaged and make them feel a part of which they were and get them excited about being accredited 'cause that's like a status quo thing in the social service world and they were, they were young.  A lot of the kids we hired I had given an opportunity that they ordinarily wouldn't have.  I got those kids out of Payless [Payless ShoeSource Inc.], Kentucky Fried Chicken.  These are people with degrees mind you, but they couldn't get jobs in the field because they didn't have experience.  So, I, I really, really took on a lot.  I realized that not only did I take on a lot, but I put a lot on the people that was with me, my staff that were there, to have them to work with his population of kid- of young folks that had no experience and, and at the same time being responsible for taking care of these younger, of, of foster kids and all that it was huge.  It was a huge responsibility.  But, but we did it and I believed in it and I still do believe in it and I still give people chances that they don't ordinarily get.  Now a lot of these people they go and they don't, they don't have any kind of gratitude for what you tried to do.  They only talk about the negative stuff.  They only, you know they don't see the big picture and so I realize that everybody don't have that ability.  So, I can't let that, and now I better understand my mother [Annie Henderson Jones].  Remember when I told you I used to ask her, "Why would you do this and why you helping them?" Well, she understood that I didn't have, that I was not capable at that time of seeing the big picture, that's it really not all about you.  It's more about the people that you serve, you know and that you help.  So, I, I give myself comfort in knowing that I, I believe that I'm doing the right thing.  God has, God has given me every indication that I am 'cause he's always with us.  You know we, a lot of people's doors have closed.  We still find people willing to help us, you know and so it makes a difference.
Speaker 1: So how did you feel when you first got accredited for the first time?
Speaker 2: I was excited.  I was proud.  I, I, I was overwhelmed.  I was overwhelmed with humbleness.
Story_ID: 635964
Speaker 1: So Dr. Jones [HistoryMaker Vivian R. Jones], what year were you appointed commissioner of the African-American Family Commission [Illinois African-American Family Commission] and, and how did that come about and who appointed you?
Speaker 2: I think it was, it might have been '97 [1997], somewhere like that and Governor Edgar, Jim Edgar appointed me and it came about as a result of somebody recommending me as a commissioner and I served under him and then after he left, Governor Blagojevich [Governor Rod Blagojevich] reappointed me and so.
Speaker 1: And what, what were your duties as a commissioner?
Speaker 2: Well, our biggest focus back then was to look at the disparity of services for African American families and organizations as well from those of the mainstream organizations and families and try to bridge those gaps and, and, try to be a voice of the African American community basically.
Speaker 1: And did you have monthly meetings or quarterly meetings, I mean went to Springfield [Illinois] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, back then we were meeting monthly and we were going to Springfield.  We were going to Mount Vernon [Illinois].  We, we were going everywhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it did require some time in all.
Speaker 2: We have, had an executive director who is still the current executive director, Terry Solomon [Terry A. Solomon] whose--
Speaker 1: Executive director for what exactly?
Speaker 2: The African-American Family Commission.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And she's, Terry, it, it was around '94 [1994].  Actually the commission hadn't started when I met Terry, 'cause it was around '94 [1994], '95 [1995] that I met her, and we were just talking about something like that having a--
Speaker 1: Oh so, there was no con--
Speaker 2: There was none.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) this commission, okay.  Were you on the, the first inaugural?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  And do you feel like you influenced the creation of this commission?
Speaker 2: I do, I feel like--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I played a small part in it.  There were a group of us that advocated for this.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually advocated to, and the commission exists until today?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you feel like it is serving the need that you saw or felt that it should serve when you advocated for it?
Speaker 2: I think it has surpassed my expectations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think Terry has done an excellent job and continues to do an excellent job of, of representing the African American community, keeping us abreast of what's going on and making sure that, that African American's voices are heard in the, in the arenas where it need to be heard.
Speaker 1: Is she an African American?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and again her name if you'll clarify.
Speaker 2: Terry, Terry, T-E-R-R-Y, Solomon, S-O-L-O-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and she still is executive director?
Speaker 2: She's probably right over there now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Would you like to meet her?
Speaker 1: Afterwards, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 635965
Speaker 1: At some point, and maybe you can tell me exactly when, you created the Rising Sun Awards, and what was the purpose of that?
Speaker 2: The Rising Sun Awards, I think we started it in something like 2002 or maybe, no, no maybe before that.  Actually it was before that 'cause the first one might have been in '95 [1995] actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, I wanted to create a, a venue where people in the community could be recognized for what they do.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not, not so much the people, the well known folks, but the everyday person--
Speaker 1: Everyday okay.
Speaker 2: --that are doing great things that nobody ever acknowledge or give them credit for, and that's why I came up with the Rising Sun.
Speaker 1: And do you still do that to this day?
Speaker 2: Right now we're not doing it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause of financial problems or whatever, but we did do it last year--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for the first, we had skipped several years and we decided to do it last year and it was okay and we might go back to doing it again, but we have to get lot more support for it 'cause we stopped--when you don't do fundraising for a long time then you have to rebuild all over again.
Speaker 1: I know, yeah.  And what va--
Speaker 2: Right now we, we, re- rebuild, rebuilding our organization [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] back up so.
Speaker 1: And what do you mean by building it back up?
Speaker 2: Well, during all these budget cuts and all this transformation that's been going on as far as what's allowed, what's not allowed we have to do a lot of downsizing and a lot of cutting and a lot of programs that we had are no longer in existence, so had to create some other programs and all that, that's what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's like, and, and remember I told you and I said this for a reason when we started we had a hundred cases remember I told you that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then within a year or two years we had 800, actually it was 1,100.  We, that, I want, I said all that to, to insinuate to you that we never had a chance to really put any real infrastructure in place.  So, we did everything by, by on the wing--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --you know just, just to keep everything moving.  Well now we're going back putting in that infrastructure.
Speaker 1: Putting in that infrastructure.
Speaker 2: So that when we move like that again, we'll have organization, we'll have the roadmap that we need without having to backtrack.
Story_ID: 635966
Speaker 1: And I know that during this time especially, budget cuts on all levels especially from the state, it must be very challenging for an organization such as this.  Can you just share some of those challenges and, and fundraising and grant writing and how you're able to keep your doors open so you can serve the community.
Speaker 2: Well we, you know we have the foster care program and, and our programs have always been high quality programs.  I think that's one of the reasons the funding sources kind of advocate to work with us because they do respect our work quite a bit.  We have had to cut in some areas that I really didn't wanna cut.  Like this clubhouse.  We couldn't get the funding that we needed to hire somebody to run the clubhouse the way it needed to be run.  So we, we had to do some thinking about well we got all this, what do we do with it.  So now we use this, this space for our employment in training people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They come in here, they learn how to do resume writing and job searches.  We couldn't just let it sit here and do nothing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we do have many after school programs that are not necessarily Intel [Intel Corporation] kind of programs, Intel that's what this was Intel Clubhouse [ph.], now it's ABJ's [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] clubhouse.  So--
Speaker 1: What do you mean, oh Intel from the corporation?
Speaker 2: And they had a structured program that you, if you're a part of their system that you have to follow, so we--I, I'm not knocking that system it works for, for them, for people, many of them, but for our community, for me it didn't work.  Our kids, the Intel structure calls for kids to work freely, to do whatever they want to do, but our kids need structure in many cases.  They need guidance because see the kids that they're used to working with get a lot of that stuff at home.  Our kids don't, a lot of them don't.
Speaker 1: A lot of them.
Speaker 2: Some of them, most, many of them do, but there are many others that don't.  So, when they come they need to be in an environment where they feel like they matter and not so you just there do what you wanna do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, it was disaccord for me and it was hard for me to go out and, and ask for money to keep something going that I just did not totally believe in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There I said it, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 635967
Speaker 1: Tell me now, so what--give me just a brief overview of then the programs that you offer now.  'Cause you had mentioned different things, and so I can get a, a feel for this day and this point, what services are offered by ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, you already know about the foster care program.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: We have employment in training and we, that program deals mostly with people that receive food stamps, and the goal is to get them to be self supporting, help them find job--get them job ready, you know teach them some soft skills like resume writing and interviewing techniques and different things like that, and then helping them place them in, in some jobs that they feel comfortable in and getting them ready mentally to work, to become self sufficient.  So that's one program.  The other program is TANF, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families [sic. Temporary Assistance for Needy Families], which they've changed that to another name and I can't think of the name off hand.  But those are people mostly women that have children and they have like a cer- a specific amount of time that they can receive assistance before they will lose those benefits, so our goal is to get them to become self sufficient prior to them losing their benefits.  We do substance abuse treatment for adolescents; that's really our specialty--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and counseling chil- counseling youth.  And a lot of the, the police department [Chicago Police Department] and the schools or whatever they send a lot of kids to us when they get community service or any, any kind of restrictions like that they usually send them to us--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to work with them.
Speaker 1: Substance abuse and, and other problems too okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then we have a food and clothing pantry, which really caters a lot to, it's, it's open to everybody, but we get a lot, lot, lots of seniors--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that come here every Thursday and for a while we closed the pantry down because we didn't have the money to keep it going.  Well, that time that it was closed we got phone calls, people coming by here.  They were all saying the same thing they really needed it.  Some of them told me about their hor- horror stories.  They was eating cat food.  They were going in garbages.  They was, it was just awful.  So we, one of my staff members wrote a proposal to the Chicago Community Trust [Chicago, Illinois] a couple of years ago, and they gave us twenty-five thousand dollars to reopen the pantry--
Speaker 1: The pantry.
Speaker 2: --and we've been making it work ever since then.  And we still get, like this past week we had two hundred people that came to our pantry.
Speaker 1: You open up once a week and the people just come and they get what they want.
Speaker 2: Sometimes we open for emergencies, if some real emergency occur we'll help somebody.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the people just come in and get what they want or you have people there to actually bag it up?
Speaker 2: Oh no we have people there that bag it up--
Speaker 1: Bag it up and--
Speaker 2: --volunteers.
Speaker 1: Volun- okay.
Speaker 2: And now we, that food pantry was named in mem- after, her name was Murtese Brady [ph.].  She is the champion of that, of that program, which is why we're able to keep it open.  She, she do a lot of fundraising including hunger walks--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and all kinds of things to, to, to make it, you know keep it going.  So, I totally credit ABJ's ability to do the food pantry to the commitment and loyalty of Ms. Brady and a couple of other people that work, voluntarily work with her every week.
Speaker 1: And along with that do you have the clothing pantry too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So people can get clothing and--
Speaker 2: Yeah people donate clothes to us and we, whatever clothes, furniture they, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they donate all that stuff to us and we give it out on the same day that we do the pantry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People that come to the pantry they can go and look through the, the things that are available and pick out some things that they need or want.
Story_ID: 635968
Speaker 1: There any program that we haven't touched upon?
Speaker 2: Well, we have what we call the A.G.A.P.E. program [Across Generations Action and Prevention Education], that's, that's a new program, generational where we work with generational family's issues trying to help them to bridge those generational gaps of being able to work together and understand each other and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and communicate with each other.  And it's about lifestyle changing really.  Yeah, we just started that one.
Speaker 1: And you, you have a lot of, you do a lot of things for teens and children you say, so is there an after school program, can kids come?
Speaker 2: Well, we have a, Ray of Hope [Ray of Hope Center of the Arts, Chicago, Illinois] is another organization that, that's housed in this building.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We work with them and they have a program called after school matters.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] had an after school matters program, but we decided to, to step out and let Ray of Hope do it because they were, they, they, they, most of their focus is totally on youth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were, they're an artistic organization and I, I believe that a lot of kids--it's, it's so much easier to reach the kids through the arts--
Speaker 1: That it is.
Speaker 2: --then it is through anything else as far as I can see, and it's been demonstrated to me on more than one occasion.  For instance, back in 2002 we got a grant from the state, a $250,000 grant from the state.  Senator Emil Jones [HistoryMaker Emil Jones, Jr.] helped us get this grant.  And the reason he gave us the grant is we, I went to meet with him and I was telling him that we needed to do something about the kids, you know there was too many of them on the streets, they, they don't have any after school program, they don't have any activities.  And he, he was like, "Well they're not gonna do anything anyway." And he was just really upset with the kids because I guess something had happened recently--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and he was just really upset.  And I told him, I challenged him.  I said I, "I guarantee you that if they get the, if you give these kids an opportunity they will show you that they are about more than what you think they about."  He said, "Okay." He said, "I'm gonna try it.  I'm going to, I'm going to see if I can help you get a grant, and I'm going to see what you do with it and I want a report."
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: I said, "You're gonna get a report."  So, he helped us to get the $250,000 grant, and we put together a program, a cultural tour.  It was a culture program of the Civil Rights Movement.  We took two hundred kids, that's four different bus loads, of kids to the South.  We started the tour in Atlanta, in Georgia, and where they went to Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] house, The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change].  They went to the, they went all over everywhere in Georgia, in, in, you know that had--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --anything to do with the civil rights--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the barbershops, everywhere.  And then we took them on from there to Alabama.  They went to Mobile [Alabama].  They went to Montgomery [Alabama].  They went to Selma [Alabama].  They went to the park where the dogs attacked them.  They saw the dogs.  They went to the Rosa Park museum [Rosa Parks Library and Museum, Montgomery, Alabama], sat on the bus that, where they saying, "Go to the back of the bus"--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and all that.  They saw all of that, and we took them to the church where the, the little, four little girls got bombed in the 16th Street Baptist Church [Birmingham, Alabama] and all of those; they went to all of those places.
Story_ID: 635969
Speaker 1: Let me just preface this by saying, going down there on each bus we gave the kids what you call a pretest, and they couldn't answer any of the questions about the Civil Rights Movement.  They--just a couple, maybe about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and maybe a little something about Rosa Parks, but that's it.  They didn't know anything else about the civil rights.  They didn't know white people was in the Civil Rights Movement, that a lot of kids were responsible for that movement.  These are things they did not know.  So, they was playing and acting crazy as kids do when they're on a bus.  You know how they act all wild and woolly, you know it's everything is a joke right.  Well, we finished that tour and we went through everything I just told you about.  We finished the tour in, in Memphis [Tennessee] at the Lorraine Motel [National Civil Rights Museum]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where Dr. King was killed.  They saw his room.  They saw everything that was set up, still the same way it was when he was there.  So they, they had all those emotions out there.  We gave them a post test, and this is every bus without exception.  We gave them a post test.  They answered every question and on each on bus there was other questions that was added to, to that.  You could hear a pin drop on each bus without exception.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: And so we got back here and got, and we got a good deal of them together, just to kind of debrief them and all of that, and we talked about it.  Victoria [Victoria C. Brady], that's my daughter, she took the lead on it and got the kids to talk about it.  They just couldn't let it go.  So, they wrote a, they, along with her, they wrote a play about it called 'Pieces of a Shattered Dream.' I mean it was most, and we invited Senator Jones [HistoryMaker Emil Jones, Jr.].  They let us do it at Olive-Harvey College [Chicago, Illinois], and he came and some other dignitaries came, and they were just amazed at the difference.
Speaker 2: And, and the money to take the kids on this tour of the South and the Civil Rights Movement that came from the grant Senator Jones gave you?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now you said several buses.  How many buses?  How many kids?
Speaker 1: Four, four buses and--
Speaker 2: And how many kids?
Speaker 1: --like fifty, about forty-five kids on each bus--
Speaker 2: All together.
Speaker 1: --or something like that.
Speaker 2: On each bus.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, but we didn't take them all at the same time.  We took two buses each time.
Speaker 2: Okay, and just over the course of a year maybe?
Speaker 1: So, we had to make two different trips over a course of six months.
Speaker 2: Six months.
Speaker 1: Not even that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, incred- did you ever go down with them?
Speaker 1: Every time.
Speaker 2: Every time.
Speaker 1: I did every time.  I, I had to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was just wondering.
Speaker 1: You know I wanted to, I, I, I had to.  You know it was--
Speaker 2: That was--
Speaker 1: --important to me.
Speaker 2: And this, this happened when in what--?
Speaker 1: In 2002.
Speaker 2: Okay that's quite, quite an, an adventure and for them and enlightening.
Speaker 1: So we've been talking about it lately.  We want to do that tour again--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but now we want to start it in Africa.
Speaker 2: Oh wow, okay.
Speaker 1: See we, my daughter and my granddaughter, three generations of us went to Africa, and it was just, it was, it was a life changing experience--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for my granddaughter and my daughter.  I had been to Africa several times, so I had already had my life changing experience, but for them it was really, and especially my granddaughter, it was just life changing.
Speaker 2: When did you, you go, your, your daughter, granddaughter, and you?  What, what year was that?
Speaker 1: This probably, oh I don't, I can't even remember now, but it's been about five or six years ago--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --somewhere like that, maybe seven.
Speaker 2: That gives me an idea.  Okay and so now you want to take some of the children in the community--
Speaker 1: I wanna, I wanna do a group of ten first to start out with.
Speaker 2: Yes that's right.
Speaker 1: Small group and start the trip in Africa.
Speaker 2: And where might the funding come from?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, but this is the dream.
Speaker 1: But, it's coming from somewhere.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is something that actively on your agenda and on your heart and mind.
Speaker 1: It's on my heart, it's not on my agenda totally yet.  'Cause when it get on my agenda it's gonna happen.
Speaker 2: Yes ma'am, okay.
Speaker 1: You know right now like I said we're into this infrastructure thing of rebuilding the organization and getting it on solid foundation--
Speaker 2: That's good.
Speaker 1: --so that, after this is at a point where I feel comfortable with that, then that will be my next major project.
Story_ID: 635970
Speaker 1: I have a few things that I just want to go over to just put things (background noise) in perspective.
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I know that in 2000 your organization came under scrutiny of DCFS [Illinois Department of Children and Family Services] and there was a Tribune [Chicago Tribune] article and that kind of thing and it's something about a child, a little boy being placed in foster care.  How did that ever turn out, and what lessons did you learn from that whole?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all we went from a, I think with that hundred kids we got a grant, we had a budget of something like maybe 280 or 300,000, not more than $300,000.  That was our first budget.  In less than two years, that budget had jumped to $10 million because we had all those cases coming.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now I'm, what did I tell you when we first started where my weakness is in math, that's the first time.  But the second, and I'm not making any excuses either.
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no.
Speaker 2: It's just a lot of things about management as, financial management that I just didn't know.  Like I didn't know we wasn't supposed to go out and by new carpet or have nice, 'cause that was one of my objectives.  I worked at Ada McKinley [Ada S. McKinley Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois], but they had the raggediest, it was the raggediest of the raggedy offices, and I was like I'm never gonna, if I ever get the chance to start anything that, I knew what I didn't want and that was something raggedy like that.  So, and I, I would give the staff the, the managers money to go out and buy stuff to fix up their offices and, and of that.  Sometimes they bring the receipt back, sometimes they wouldn't.  I didn't you know and I thought if you earn the money it didn't matter as long as you was doing the work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know that you supposed to report every, but anyway--
Speaker 1: Yeah I know.
Speaker 2: --they came in and audited ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and when they did they said that there was a million dollars missing that couldn't be accounted for and I'm like you know what do you mean can't be accounted for.  They tried to say that maybe I had stolen a million dollars, at least that what they insinuated, to me that's what it felt like and whether they meant that or not I don't know.  But, I couldn't, all I could say is, "No, I didn't, know.  I don't know what you're talking about."  Yeah, we spent money on, on, on stuff like I would tell them and they could see the stuff, but it wasn't no receipts for a lot of it, and they like, "Well you shouldn't have been buying this anyway.  You're supposed to use the money to buy used stuff.  You not supposed to go out and buy--." You know these are the kinds of, these are the kind of things they're telling me, 'cause they know I don't know right.  So anyway they had, they put that, it was a draft audit that they put out there.  It wasn't even a final audit.  It was a draft audit they put out there, and that's what the Tribune got hold to, a draft audit.  And somebody recommended us to an accountant and asked him to come and help us out.  And he came and he interviewed me and I, I was so angry, that old person that I told you about came out.  I was so mean and nasty to him, 'cause now I'm feeling like everybody trying to persecute me and all I'm trying to do is do something good.  So, I had a bad, bad, bad attitude.  But, he was like oblivious to that.  He stuck to the, to the agenda, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He, he wasn't thinking about my attitude.  He was just thinking about my answers to his questions.  And I, I finally settled down a little bit and I started answering him and just telling him everything that I could I told him.  You know I held nothing back.  And after he got through he told me he said, "I'm gonna help you guys."  He said, "I'm gonna take you and I will help you." And he did.  He got involved.  And when he got involved he made DCFS have to come back out here and do the audit all over again, and when they did the audit all over again they did everything they could, but they couldn't--the only thing they could say is that we had inappropriately spent $226,000, not that it was missing, but that we had inappropriately spent it on things that weren't okay with DCFS for us to spend it on.  So, we had to pay that back, which we did.
Speaker 1: You paid it back, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, this was a learning lesson.
Speaker 2: It was absolutely a learning lesson (laughter).  But it was, it, it left a real bitter taste in my mouth.  I, I felt like you know they, they really, they, they give you things to say they're trying to help you, but always knowing that they don't really mean to help you, you know.
Story_ID: 635971
Speaker 1: It would seem that once they [the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services] give you the--it should, they should have made it clear then the guidelines.
Speaker 2: Well, they should have given us technical support.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We were a brand new organization.  In the first place, why would you give a brand new organization that kind of responsibility and that kind of budget, you know with no technical support.
Speaker 1: No, no, no technical support that makes sense.
Speaker 2: No, no technical support or whatever, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that had nothing to do with you resigning from, as commissioner from the African-American Family Commission [Illinois African-American Family Commission]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, that was just--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --you just felt like you had served (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I just didn't want to do it anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had done it for like eight years or so and it was enough.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's, that's what I wondered as well.  Then you became affiliated with South Shore Chamber of Commerce [South Shore Chamber Inc., Chicago, Illinois], you were vice president.
Speaker 2: I was yeah. I'm just a member now.  I'm not vice president anymore (laughter).
Speaker 1: You just recently--
Speaker 2: In the last couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and how did that come about and when did you become vice president?
Speaker 2: I am terrible with dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really, maybe 2001 or something.  I, I don't really know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't even, and don't--
Speaker 1: I have here 2002.
Speaker 2: --ask me how it happened either.  I don't even know how it happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I lived in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois], I worked in South Shore, my church was in, everything was in South Shore, so I decided to get involved with the chamber to see what I could do to help and because I really thought that it could make a difference to have a strong chamber in South Shore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to bring the community together.  When we moved over here in South Shore it was in '73 [1973] and it was a, it was a, it was a real community.  You know my, my dad [German Jones, Sr.] used to get on the bus or, or even walk sometime from our house all the way over to ShoreBank [Chicago, Illinois] and he didn't, he never felt threatened or, or--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know like--it was always a comfortable place.  But, it had got to a point where you know seniors could not do that kind of thing walk anywhere.  It, it just had gotten out of control, so I wanted to get involved and I did.
Speaker 1: And you did.  And do you still live in South Shore?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is, so this is your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: This is your, your home and where you work?
Speaker 2: I left South Shore for a while and when I first, like around '95 [1995] you know people started telling you're the executive director [of Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and you should be doing this and you should be doing, now here you talking to a girl out the projects who never really you know had that much of anything, so I went and bought me a house in Olympia Fields [Illinois] with a pool, swimming pool and all that, and it was nice.  It was beautiful.  And I'm glad I did it because my son [Eddie Jones], even though he lived with his dad, on holidays and weekends he came home and I, I did not want him to have to come to the city, so home was Olympia Fields and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I stayed there until he decided that he was not gonna come, that he was, you know he was grown, he wanted his own place and when I realized that he wasn't coming back home to live--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --I came back to the city--
Speaker 1: You came back to the city.
Speaker 2: --came back to South Shore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you, one--
Speaker 2: Well, I went downtown for about a half a year.  I hated it.  I was out of my element.
Speaker 1: And where downtown?
Speaker 2: River North [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 635972
Speaker 1: Now, I know that you hired Samantha Oliver Mitchell at some point to work with you. What, when was that and, and what was her role, and is she still with you?
Speaker 2: Why is that relevant to this?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  We don't have to talk (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know either.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just had the notes here.  I--
Speaker 2: The reason I'm asking that is because I've had people a lot more significant than Samantha that nobody asks about.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't, I don't why--in my research, in my notes this was just here.  And, and I thought--
Speaker 2: Well maybe it's because our, she's our chief, she was our chief operating office recently, but she left about, she left in October.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But she's still consulting with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she.
Speaker 1: Is there anyone with your organization that you would like to comment on contributions that they made?
Speaker 2: I'd like to comment on all of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay then, well.
Speaker 2: They all, well my daughter now, Victoria Brady [Victoria C. Brady] is now the chief operating officer and she was also a founding board member of ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  So, she, she's in line hopefully to become the, the next CEO of the organization.  Samantha was that person until she had a lot of family and other things going on and she felt like it was too much, so she wanted a lesser role, so she went to work for another organization on a part time basis and she's working here as a consultant part time, but that gives her a lot of flexibility.  She's got four little kids, four little girls.  So, I supported her in that and I still support her in that because like I told her with kids once that time is gone you can't get it back you know so.  And, and then I have Nicole Anayso.  She's the director over foster care, and Nicole has been with me since, she's been with me about thirteen or fourteen years, almost as long as I've been here.  Gloria Stiles [ph.], she's over the employment and training and safety networks programs, and she's been here about thirteen or fourteen years as well.  So those--
Speaker 1: Okay, you do have some long time employees with you.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the management team is pretty much all the, you know, people that I totally,--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --they, they just as committed to this organization as I am really.
Speaker 1: That's excellent to have that support.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I only asked you that question about Samantha because I was thinking there's like Jackie Sharp [Jackie Sharp Akins].  She's running Lakeside [Lakeside Community Committee, Chicago, Illinois] now.  She was significant.  She was, she was in the role of something similar to chief operating officer at one time, and she did an excellent job.  But it was, when she, it was time for her to me on she moved on and she got hired by Barbara Jones Green.  I don't know if you knew her from Lakeside, and Barbara she died suddenly--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --and Jackie was there to take over.
Speaker 1: And she still--
Speaker 2: And she still, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --was there?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we're still good friends and you know every once in a while she still call for support.
Speaker 1: Yeah I would say it must make you proud to feel like you--
Speaker 2: I am very proud and, and then we had Delphine Rankin who is a former person that was over foster care.  She is the executive director of the Belov- Beloved ministries [Beloved Community Family Services, Inc.] over in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois].  She's, so I have three black female women that came out of my shop that are now executive directors or have been and that, I, that to me is something to be pretty proud of.
Speaker 1: For good reason.
Speaker 2: And I know you mentioned that your daughter founding--
Speaker 1: Victoria [Victoria C. Brady].
Speaker 2: --board member, Victoria, and she, you say she's COO?
Speaker 1: She's COO now, yes.
Speaker 2: COO right now?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And you mentioned earlier that your son [Eddie Jones] is involved in the--
Speaker 1: He's a caseworker.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He works in employment and training.  And I tried to get him to come over here, but he had a client and he wouldn't leave his client, so I told him that's okay.  I left him, he did the right thing.
Speaker 2: That's dedication.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 635973
Speaker 1: Now at some point did you not become a board member of the Illinois African American Coalition for Prevention?
Speaker 2: We was, I was one of the founding members of that.
Speaker 1: A founding member.  Tell me a little bit about that organization.
Speaker 2: Well, we started that organization because of all the cuts that were going on and a lot of the cuts seem to be, they didn't seem to be doing it in a real fair way, equit- equitable way and so a lot of our programs that we felt were very necessary, prevention kind of programs were being cut, so we formed, formed the coalition so we could have voice and try to you know be able to be at the table when some of these decisions were being made or whatever.  And it's still going strong today, but I left the, I left the coalition because I felt that some of the, the mission that, well the intent of why it was originally started was not being, was not being addressed.  The issues they got kind of convu- convoluted and, and they started trying to do more programming, which is what the members are doing, the members do the programs, that what's, that was my impression.  And the organization brought in resources to assist the members and to help the members to grow, you know to help the, the community based organization.  So, we got kind of mess- you know in a competitive mode with each other right, you know it just, I just didn't like it, so I left.
Speaker 1: When did you leave the organization?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: When did you leave, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Me and dates, oh.  Time go by so fast it's ridiculous.
Speaker 1: I know.
Speaker 2: It had to be 2010 maybe, or somewhere like that.
Speaker 1: Okay not that long ago then.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not, not a long time ago.
Story_ID: 635974
Speaker 1: Now at some point--and what I have here is 2007, if you'll make sure that I am correct on that--ABJ's foster care department [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] was considered one of the top in the state I presume.  Was it number five, one of the top five?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: So is there a listing that comes out from the state or was there a ceremony or how?
Speaker 2: No, it's a listing that comes out, and it still come out.  We're still in the top twenty.
Speaker 1: Still in the top twenty.
Speaker 2: But we not in the top five like we wanna be, so we working on that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's part of this infrastructure thing that we're going through.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's hard for anybody to stay in the top, in the top five of twenty unless you got five or ten cases--
Speaker 1: Oh no I understand.
Speaker 2: --but if you got more than a hundred.
Speaker 1: But you must have been pleased and proud that you did that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I've, I've always been proud of our foster care program.  I still am.  The, the people there are very, very committed to the clients that we serve, and they go always above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that our kids are well taken care of and families because it's more than just the kids.  You know you got to reach out to the family, the foster family, the biological family, you know all of it is relevant.
Story_ID: 635975
Speaker 1: Now was it 2009 that you were recognized by the Chicago [Illinois] newspaper and Urban Sustainability [Urban Sustainability Association]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how were you recognized, what, was that an honor?
Speaker 2: They had an award ceremony--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and gave me some, a plaque.  It was lunch or dinner.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell me about your degree from the International Pentecostal Assemblies at Community College of Bible Theology [sic. International Pentecostal Assemblies Ecumenical College of Bible Theology].
Speaker 2: That was, that, that's, that's my honorary doctorate in divinity, and it's based on my, my experience and my work history.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: Two thousand and four [2004].
Speaker 1: Okay and--
Speaker 2: That I remember I think.
Speaker 1: And how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Some- somebody filled out some documents or something telling about my, my work, giving them a lot of background information about me and, and then they contacted me and they interviewed me and I had to fill out a bunch of forms and take a, had to even take a little exam sort of thing, and then they selected me.  They--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I have here that you were affiliated with the Illinois African American Coalition for Prevention.
Speaker 2: You already, we've discussed that.
Speaker 1: And, oh and you retired from that okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I, I resigned.
Speaker 1: You resigned, I'm sorry.  That's the one I got that mixed up okay.  So what about the productivity at work from Com- Comcast [Comcast Corporation], yeah that particular--
Speaker 2: Comcast.  That was, that was a competition that they had for nonprofit organizations and they were, the goal was to select three organizations that they could go in and upgrade their infra, their, the IT [information technology] infrastructure and offer us, they offered us some consulting time to get people to come in and help us with our strategic planning and different things like that.  So, it was a vote.  You, people, you had to be voted for, and we were one of the three that was selected based on the votes that were received.
Speaker 1: And, and how did that benefit the organization [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, it got us some new computers.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Got us new phone system.  It's got, it got a chance to meet with some professionals that could help us strategically plan our next moves as it relates to development, fun- funding you know develop, fund development and all of that, which is why we kind of stopped the Rising Sun [Rising Sun Awards] because it wasn't really ben- it wasn't really financially sound for us to continue to do it and you know that consultant helped us to see that while it was a really great idea and we should probably get back to it, it's gonna take work to build it back up.
Speaker 1: So, have you had any other relationship with Comcast as far as supporting their agency or was it just that one particular event?
Speaker 2: It was that and, and they, you know from time to time when they have different projects going they'll contact us, and if they have e- big events they always make sure that we're invited, things like that.
Story_ID: 635976
Speaker 1: Now I know that throughout our conversation you have mentioned God and religion, and how that has sustained you.  Was church a very big part of you growing up even and, and how, is that, how involved is your life in the church at this moment?
Speaker 2: Well at this, as, as of today I'm not as involved as I have been in previous years.  I, I think that I've come to a point where I see my, this, my work here [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] as my ministry and so I give all my time and effort right now to that.  But church has always been a huge part of our life.  We, everything that's relevant in my family that's ever happened, happened at Tabor Lutheran Church [Chicago, Illinois].  We've been members, my family has been members there since 1973 and is my eye going crazy on your, is that why you keep looking back?
Speaker 1: Who are you talking--
Speaker 2: I'm talking to you.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: See I, you can't even tell I'm looking at you, but anyway my, my mother [Annie Henderson Jones], my mother and my, my father [German Jones, Sr.], he wasn't a real churchgoer, but he was a very religious man.  You know he would watch church on TV.  He believed, he always believed that God was there no matter what, you know, so I think I was just raised to believe in something higher than ourselves, in a higher source and then we cannot forget about my [maternal] grandmother [Reola James Henderson] who really, she put the, the, the fear of God in you at an early age when she would talk to you about the Bible and read to you.
Speaker 1: The one that read from the Bible to you.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, you know it's like I, I had a lot of respect for the Bible, for the word of God and for you know.  I believe that God put us all here for a purpose, and I believe that nothing really can change that purpose except God.  You know so I don't usually take no for an answer unless it's from Him.  When He say no, then it's no, but if, if I feel really strongly about it, I'm not gonna give up until it happen.
Speaker 1: Until it happens.
Speaker 2: Unless He, now He have a way of letting you know when you're on the wrong track, that you need to leave it alone.  And when that happens I leave it alone.  You know but even down to my first boyfriend, which was my son, my daughter's [Victoria C. Brady] father, he was, his family was very religious and I at some point in my life I spent a lot of time with them.  So, I got involved with the sanctified church, which was not something I was used to, but so God has always played a major role in my life.  When I, I think even as a little kid when I was somewhere being kept by somebody that wasn't paying me no attention, that it was God that kept, that kept me company and comforted me.  I really do because I never felt really alone, even though I knew I was alone you know physically, I never really felt alone, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you feel like he's still with you?
Speaker 2: So, I, I, I, I, yeah absolutely, absolutely.  I have gone into, to the hospital for major tests and I'll go to sleep.  They'd be like how could you be so calm?  I'll be like 'cause I got that inner, that inner spirit is there.  He's with me, so.
Story_ID: 635977
Speaker 1: Now at some point you mentioned Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and your affiliation.  You knew him, you worked with him, you supported him.  Can you just give me just an overview of that, because you met him long before he, he went to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yeah I did.  I met him long before he was--the first time I met President Obama, at the time Barack, he was having a little comm- community meeting in the, in the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  I don't, I, it was either the Y on Drexel [Avenue] or it was the Y on--it, it had to be the Y on Drexel.  I believe--
Speaker 1: Do you remember about what year that was?
Speaker 2: --it was the Drexel Y [Harriet M. Harris YWCA, Chicago, Illinois].  Year? (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) A period of time or how long ago.
Speaker 2: That had to be in '94 [1994] or '95 [1995] that I met Barack Obama because we honored him in '95 [1995], so it was some time prior to that.  And I met him and I met Michelle [Michelle Obama].  The baby, they had, the oldest child [Malia Obama] was just a baby, arm baby, and Barack was our senator.  His office was right across the street from here, so he used to come over here and help give out turkeys at Thanksgiving.  He would get turkeys for us and then he'd come and help give them out.  If he had some major announcement that he wanted to make, he'd have somebody call me to come over and stand over his shoulder while he made the announcements.  And you know I, I organized several fundraisers for, on his behalf when he was running for senator.  And I, I always found him to be, to me he was always a man that, that truly cared about the people and that's what got my interest in the first place is that he was in touch with reality as far as what's going on out here in the world with people.  And I, I, he made me believe what he said.  I trusted him and I still do.  I think he's an amazing person of principals.  I think he's probably one of the most intelligent people I've ever met, and I, you know I've always found him to be pretty much the same.  He doesn't change in midstream.  He's always basically the same.  For instance, I, I had not seen him in a really long time and just before he ran for president or whatever I was at a benefit, at an Asian benefit dinner and I don't know some people invited me and I went for it, and I don't know why I even went, but I went.  And he was the, oh maybe that's why I went 'cause he was the keynote speaker.  I might have gone just because of that.  Well anyway when he finished his speech he was, he came down off the stage and he was walking out to go out and I was sitting like on one of the end seats and he saw me and he just came up to me and gave me this big old hug, "How you doing?" You know, very familiar like, like he recognized my face and all that.  It's not like acting like he don't know you 'cause you out of the neighborhood kind of thing.  I really, that, you know he got a lot of respect from me because of his down to earth, 'cause he's so down to earth.  And Michelle I found her to be the same way.  When he was getting ready to, just before he announced that he was running for president, they had a big fundraiser at the Holiday Inn [Holiday Inn Chicago Matteson] out in Matteson [Illinois] and I went to that fundraiser.  And I had occa- had an opportunity, I took photos with Barack Obama of course, but I talked to Michelle and I told her, I said, "You know that if he run for, for president he's going to win."  I said, "And you know that if he win, your life is gonna change, it's never gonna be, it's never gonna be the same, and you know anything could happen."  She said, "We understand that." She said, "But we don't, we won't live in fear."  She said, "We won't live in fear."  She said "So we gonna go forth and we gonna do what we have to do." And I said, "Well you know what I'm glad to hear you say that, you've got my support, whatever I can do," and that's how we kind of left it.  I told Jennifer Hudson the same thing when she got ready to do 'Dreamgirls,' well she had just done 'Dreamgirls' and we did the play 'Dreamgirls,' and she came to our play and she was sitting next to me and we were talking and, and she was enjoying the play.  I said, "Well you better enjoy this, because after your movie come out you won't be able to sit here like you're sitting now."  I said, "Your life will never be the same."  She said, "You don't think so?"  I said, "I know it won't."  I said, "It will not be the same, so you're not gonna have the kind of luxury that you got sitting here."  I said, "But you gotta promise me one thing, you gotta come back and do a fundraiser for ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] when you ma- when, when that movie hit and you get, become a big star."  She said, "Okay I will I promise."  Of course you know I never heard anything (laughter).
Story_ID: 635978
Speaker 1: So, and have you been in touch with, with--
Speaker 2: I haven't been in touch with her [Jennifer Hudson] yet.  I'm kind of holding that favor, but I'm--it's time for me to get in touch with her 'cause she's gonna be here this summer a lot.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: So this will be a good time.
Speaker 1: And what about the Obamas, have you had a chance to see them since they--
Speaker 2: Well, we've reached out to, to the president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] on several occasions.  At one time we almost had him ready to come here and something, 'cause something really important happened in Washington [D.C.], some crisis came up and he had to cancel all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we almost got him, but we didn't quite get him, but I'm, we're gonna get him.  I believe that the president is gonna come back to ABJ [Annie B. Jones Community Services, Inc., Chicago, Illinois] and walk through these halls again just like he did before.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that you really would like to share?  We talked about a lot of things, but I know you're a woman, you've done so many things and you're still doing so many things.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I just want, I, I wish that we could all really just get along better.  I wish that people really loved each other more and, and that we would reach out to help each other a little bit more than we do.  And also I, I just really, I'm appreciative for what you guys are doing with the history, you know gathering this information and having it put in the archive for our future generations to have something to look back on.  It's pretty much like what Dr. Burroughs [HistoryMaker Margaret Burroughs] tried to do and did do with the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois], and Juliean- Julieanna Richardson, Richardson is, she has a lot of vision and this was just really a wonderful, wonderful task for her to undertake and I know that it hasn't been easy.  But, she, she kept her dream and it's really, really gonna be beneficial to a lot of people.  And I hope somebody will see this documentary or whatever you call it and some young girl somewhere will look at it and say you know what I can do it.  I can have, I can make a difference.  I can become who I want to become, and I can make a difference.  I hope that's what happens at the end of the day with this.
Story_ID: 635979
Speaker 1: How do you want to be remembered?  What kind of legacy do you want to leave?
Speaker 2: I wanna do, I wanna be remembered as somebody who cared. Someone who really cared and who tried to make a difference and who tried to create opportunities for other people so that they could have an opportunity to contribute and become, not only contributors but self supporting and just taking control, having an opportunity to take control of their lives to become a pers- I wanna be remembered as a person who believed that you could do it.
Speaker 1: You could do it.  And, and what do you feel is your greatest contribution professionally and then on the personal side too?
Speaker 2: Professionally I believe that my greatest accomplishment is, is taking people beyond what they think their limits are.  I kind of challenge people to go forth.  It's not always in the best way.  Sometimes I'll make them mad just so they'll do something, just to get, get some kind of reaction out of them.  I, I, I'm a catalyst for change.  I instigate, I, I do things to instigate a lot of changes.  You know I might have the idea, but I'll pass it along to somebody in a way that it will fall on the right ears and it will happen.  So, that's, that's pretty much what I do you know.  I like to see people become their best, long before Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] (laughter) I like to see people become their best selves.  And I, I just think that there is good in everybody.  I think everybody has some good in them.  I think that everybody has something to offer.

Speaker 2: I can't remember the names of the other young lady, but that is Apostle William McCoy in the middle.
