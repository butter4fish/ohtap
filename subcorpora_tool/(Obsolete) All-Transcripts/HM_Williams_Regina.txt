Speaker 1: I want to continue with just the front matter, if you will, for the interview by--and ask a few People magazine-ish type questions.  Would you first tell us what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I have a favorite food, but I guess maybe if I had to name one I'd say turkey and dressing (laughter).

Speaker 2: My favorite time of year is late spring and early summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess one of the thing, one of the places that we have gone recently that was--has become a favorite is Rhode Island.  We've gone to Narragansett [Rhode Island] to Point Judith [Rhode Island], and that's just been very relaxing and a lovely place.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: This too shall pass (laughter).
Story_ID: 217666
Speaker 1: In this next section, we'd like to focus on the HistoryMaker's family background.  And I'd just like to start our conversation by asking if you would please tell me about your mother: what was her name, and, and where was she born, and where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Coranell Collier.  She was born in Kentucky and grew up in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: And did she share with you any special stories about her childhood in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: No, she may have.  I just don't recall any right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how would you describe your mother?  What kind of personality did she have?
Speaker 2: A very, very warm, very loving, very generous to all of us.  We, I come, come from a large family, but very generous to all of us and to each of us in a spec, in our own special way, and seem to know how to nurture each of us as individuals and as a family group.  And those are things that are become, that are very popular now in the science of family rearing, but I don't think it was then.  But those were some special traits of hers.
Story_ID: 217667
Speaker 1: And can you tell me a little bit about your father?  What was his name and--
Speaker 2: My father's name was Charles Louis Sallee.  He was a plasterer contractor by trade.  He was just a very interesting man, very; lots of energy; small in build.  He was shorter than my mother [Coranell Collier Sallee].  My mother was tall.  My father was short, but just very, very industrious and very serious about all of us being industrious as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do you have any information on his childhood?  Where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Kentucky also.  I think her was born in Louisville [Kentucky].  And while my mother was an only child, my, as far, my father had fifteen siblings.  I think there were sixteen in his family; they were a large, large family.  And I knew some of my aunts and uncles on my father's side.
Story_ID: 217668
Speaker 1: Now you said you were born in Ohio--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was born in--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Sandusky [Ohio].
Speaker 2: --Sandusky, Ohio.  My parents [Coranell Collier Salle and Charles Sallee] moved to, first to Oberlin, Ohio.  And my oldest brother, Charles Sallee, Jr., was born in Oberlin.  And then our parents moved to Sandusky, and the other eleven children were born in Sandusky, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your parents actually met in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And married there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then migrated to Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 217669
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask also, before we get too far in our discussion, of the other family members.  If you could describe your father [Charles Sallee]? I know you said he's very industrious, and he's a plasterer.  What did that involve?  Was he constantly building or with other journeymen, trademen, tradesmen?
Speaker 2: My, my father was a plasterer and contractor.  He has his own business--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --and had really had quite a business as, you know, where he employed many other men to work with him.  But he was actually the premier plasterer/contractor in Sandusky, Ohio, and did much of the interior work in buildings there.  And he built our own home.  He really did a lot of that decorative plastering work that you see now in older homes with the, the decorative moldings around the ceiling and those medallions in the center of the ceilings.  My father did that kind of decorative work.  And he built our home, and so our home had a lot of that decorative work that he did, some very beautiful pieces in our home.  He built a beautiful plaster mantel and fireplace, and just, those were artistic traits that he brought to the profession of plastering.  And then, of course, he did regular plastering.  But in our home he did this, the swirling of the plaster on the walls, so that made it very decorative and very, very nice, very nice.
Speaker 1: And what time period is this when he's establishing his own business and building a home for his growing family?
Speaker 2: Well, it certainly was before I was born.  I was born in 1931.  But I was born, I think in, I was born in a hospital, but my parents owned their own home, so before I was born because I was number eleven (laughter) of the twelve children.  And so they had, he had established that from very early on.
Story_ID: 217670
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about some of your other siblings, their names?  I know that's a long list, but if you would share their names with us?
Speaker 2: Of the ones who--because many of the children had died very early in, as infants and some as older children.  But children died earlier in those times.  My oldest brother, though, the oldest of our family, Charles Sallee [Jr.], is still living, and he is in his nineties.  Leroy, my--Charles, of course, was, is an artist and has, well, some renown, I would say.  Leroy [Sallee] did my father's [Charles Sallee] trade, is plasterer and contractor and lived in Ashtabula, Ohio, and then was a businessman; he had a couple of businesses.  A brother, Henry [Sallee], or I should say in between there was Charles, and then Leroy, and then Rebecca [Sallee Tate-Stanton], our oldest sister, is married and lives in Cleveland, Ohio, and right now lives in Euclid [Ohio].  Henry spent a great deal of time, I guess about thirty years, he lived in Canada.  Henry was a freelance artist and lived in Montreal [Canada] for about thirty years.  Both Leroy and Henry now are deceased.  Henry died in nineteen--in 2002.  And then after Henry, June. June is [HistoryMaker] Mrs. June [Sallee] Antoine, who is very civic-minded and is very involved with civic organizations and is one of the co-founders of Creative Writing Workshops Projects [sic. Creative Writing Workshop Project], lives in Shaker Heights, Ohio.  And I'm here in her home now.  And my younger sister is Mrs. Marlene [Sallee] Blount, who was a, a, was at the United Nations as a guide right out of, when, right out of college and was there for some time, and is recently retired also as a--from the job as a federal probation officer.  June, and Marlene, and I were all at [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] at the same time, so we were at the end of that group of twelve children, and so some of those in the middle, we did not know as well.  Our older brothers and sisters, we got to know them better as we became adults ourselves.
Story_ID: 217671
Speaker 1: And all of this is happening in Sandusky, Ohio?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're coming of age in the 1930s and '40s [1940s] there.  What was life like in Sandusky for working families like yours?
Speaker 2: Well, as I recall, you know, growing up there, Sandusky is very small.  It was a--there was no big industry in Sandusky.  I think there were two small family-owned foundries various people lived in.  But my father [Charles Sallee], of course, had his own business.  My mother [Coranell Collier Sallee] did not work outside of the home.  And we were a very close family.   We still are today, those of us.  And so we did a lot of things.  We were very, were active in church things.  We were active in school.  We did something that I don't know that other families do routinely, but I recall that when we were growing up, we would have amateur nights at home, the--and my brothers were elocutionists in elocution, was, that was very popular, people.  And they recited a lot of Paul Laurence Dunbar's poems. And so we had great fun with that.  Rebecca [Sallee Tate-Stanton], my sister, had a beautiful singing voice, and she would sing.  And [HistoryMaker] June [Sallee Antoine] has an absolutely fantastic voice, and she would sing.  But June was very musically talented and played the violin, and the viola, and the piano, and the organ.  Marlene [Sallee Blount] could, would dance and was quite capable modern dancer, danced in, when we were in college [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].  And I sang; I played the violin.  But we had those family activities that I just think made us really a very strong family and very supportive of each other, all of us were.  All of us were supportive of one another in any endeavor that any of us chose.
Speaker 1: So this music that was so much a part of your life at home, is that something you were encouraged to pursue at school, or were your parents musically inclined at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we were encouraged not to pursue necessarily music, but we were always encouraged to pursue those things that were of greatest interest to us individually.  Now, as two of my brothers [Charles Sallee, Jr. and Henry Sallee] were artists, and, and so they were encouraged in those pursuits.  And June was encouraged in music and Marlene in dance.  And I decided I wanted to be a nurse, and so I was encouraged to do that.  So each of us were really encouraged, strongly encouraged to do kinds of things that we had a great interest in.  But our parents felt that what you did was--it was important to increase your, your knowledge, to always learn.  And so education was very much the theme that went through whatever we did.  We--and my mother had a very good voice, and, and my dad did too.  They would sing with us and do things with us.  And so I think that that made--that makes a lot of difference I think in, as you're growing up, is your parents are involved with you, and do things with you and encourage you.  And they encouraged us to have our friends to our home, and so it was I think a very good childhood growing up.
Story_ID: 217672
Speaker 1: It's wonderful, wonderfully optimistic, I think, of you to describe those times as good times, because we've heard so much about the bad times of the 1930s, and your birth date and your early childhood sandwiched between the stock market crash of 1929 and America's entry into World War I [sic. World War II, WWII] in 1941.  But were you aware that those things were happening as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, at World War II, which--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, World War II, thank you (laughter), 1941 to '45 [1945], thank you.
Speaker 2: Yes, I recall being in grade school in--all of us went to Campbell [Elementary] School [Sandusky, Ohio], and it was interesting because as the last three of us were going through Campbell School, the thing I was aware was that people at Campbell School knew our brothers [Charles Sallee, Jr., Leroy Sallee and Henry Sallee] and our sister. And so you have to do, there is an expectation that was put, spoken or unspoken, on the Sallee children, that they always were achievers; they were anxious to learn; they were, they were just smart people (laughter).  And I must say that of myself that what, we were.  We were encouraged to learn.  We were encouraged to love learning, and so we, you know, my parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] turned out a group of quite intelligent people, all of us (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and you found that the teachers were supportive of your high aspirations--
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: --in the--
Speaker 2: --they had, they had little alternative (laughter) but to be supportive of us.  We were, we were, I think, all of us from early were always respectfully assertive in achieving goals that we would set.  And that's how we were taught, you know, to be assertive and know, doing what you, to pursue what you know is right but to be respectful always of everyone, and we were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, in that, did you say the Campbell Street School?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Campbell School?  Are there any teachers that, that you remember being especially supportive?
Speaker 2: Yes, one of my teachers that was a wonderful teacher, and I think it was in the--I think it was my fifth grade teacher.  Her name was Betty Wilhelm Rinderle.  And I keep in, I am in contact with her even now.  She lives in Florida, but we have, we correspond occasionally.
Story_ID: 217673
Speaker 1: Is Sandusky [Ohio] a really diverse community, I'm thinking ethnically and racially?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were growing up in Sandusky, there were not a lot of blacks living in Sandusky at that time, and I think that certainly has changed.  But as we were growing up, that was not the case.  So, other than, you know, that there were--we I think that there were many instances of probably of discrimination that we did not, as children, did not--did not impact on us, and probably because of my father's [Charles Sallee] standing in the community, and the fact that I think that our parents really tried to insulate us from any kind of really unpleasant situations.  That is my recollection of it, you know.  I don't recall that we had a lot of unpleasant experiences, because, as I say, my father was very well known in the city.  And so, other than that, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, how do you do that for twelve children?  How do you protect them if they're, they're very much in the minority and even in a small town like Sandusky?  Is that through the employment opportunities that he could offer to other heads of households or through other organizations within the black community that you--
Speaker 2: I don't know how, you know, you know, I just know that my parents were active within the community.  They were active in the church [Second Baptist Church, Sandusky, Ohio].  And they cared about people, and so they did many things within the community.
Story_ID: 217674
Speaker 1: Well, what church did the family attend?
Speaker 2: The family attended the Second Baptist Church in Sandusky [Ohio].  And it was one of the weigh stations on the Underground Railroad, as I'm told.
Speaker 1: So historically this is an, an African American congregation or--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Is the church still there?
Speaker 2: The church is still there, yeah.  And I do have some pictures of the church early on.  And my father [Charles Sallee] and my brothers [Charles Sallee, Jr., Leroy Sallee and Henry Sallee], the older brothers, did the plastering work and decorative work within the church.
Story_ID: 217675
Speaker 1: You told me, then, about three very important institutions: the family first, and then the school, especially the Campbell [Elementary] School [Sandusky, Ohio], and now the [Second Baptist] Church [Sandusky, Ohio], that were important to shaping, I suppose, your worldview--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from that vantage point in sun, in Sandusky, Ohio.  But I'm wondering when it's time to, to move up and out of that elementary school, very nurturing environment.  Did you find that there was the same kind of support academically in junior high school and high school in Sandusky?
Speaker 2: Yes, we--there was only one junior high school, and so, while there, I think there were six elementary schools in Sandusky.  And then there were, there was one junior high school and one senior high school.  And we, to, you know, to my knowledge, we had--we moved along through the school system easily.  As I said, we understood why we were in school and that was to get an education, and to do well, and to do your best.  And that was always what our parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] taught us, was that it is important to know who you are, to respect who you are, to believe in yourself, and to do your best.  I can remember my dad saying it doesn't matter if you are sweeping the floor someplace; you should do the very best you can.  So you strive always to do better things, but whatever it is that you do, you do the best that you can.  And that I think all of us have carried throughout our lives.
Story_ID: 217676
Speaker 1: Today, are there sights, and sounds, or smells even that remind you of those early years in Sandusky [Ohio], and maybe the turkey dinners that you said were among your favorite (laughter)?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I do remember, you know, early on in, in--you know, sometimes I used to joke and say I think I was just born grownup, because (laughter), because when people ask about well, what did you do when you were little?  I don't know (laughter).  But I, you know, you, at least for me, I remember some things, sort of like flashes of things.  For example, and this is getting off your question a little bit, but I can remember when my oldest brother, Charles [Sallee, Jr.], was graduating from college and the graduation ceremony was at Severance Hall [Cleveland, Ohio], which I learned later.  I didn't know it then.  But I was I think maybe about six or seven years old.  But I remember it was just sort of like this thing that you sort of see in your mind's eye.  I remember being at that ceremony, and I remember sitting on my mother's [Coranell Collier Sallee] lap, and she was pointing down when my brother went across the stage and received the diploma.  And at that time diplomas were in that scroll that you see on all the graduation cards that you see now.  But, and I remember having, I remember what I was wearing.  I had on a white dress with a big yellow sash.  And the--that sort of remembrance sort of struck me.  I was buying a dress for my daughter [Regina Williams], and we were--she was getting ready for a communion ceremony.  And I was out buying a dress, and I saw this dress, and it just hit me like a flash.  And I remembered being at that ceremony for my brother, sitting up there with that little dress on.  And you know, you just sort of thing, "Oh, how could I (laughter)--why is it that I remembered that?"  And that was just a very interesting kind of thing.  And so, but I do remember some of those kinds of things.  I remember growing up in Sandusky that in the winter we would go down to the [Sandusky] Bay, because the bay would freeze over.  And we were in like junior high, we could go down and ice skate on the bay.  I also remember that in the summer one of the things that we did was to, we always went to Cedar Point [Sandusky, Ohio].  And there was this big boat [G.A. Boeckling ferryboat], and that was sort of two-tiered, and people took this boat to, over to Cedar Point, which then was not anything like the Cedar Point of today, you know, that's--at that time there were, I think there was a midway and some of those kinds of things.  But there were eight rides; they had--and a couple of games where you, you know, and--that sort of thing.  But we went over to Cedar Point.  I also remember that in the summer there, there would be this influx of June bugs.  Now, since I now live in Detroit, Michigan, and live across from Canada, they're called, in that area they're called, they're Canadian flies or something, but there are, they are these fish flies they're known as.  But they would come in overnight, and the next day you would see these fish flies all over the street and windows of stores and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I also remember that when we were growing up it seemed like by Thanksgiving it was always, there was always a lot of snow.  And I can remember that when my mother was making Thanksgiving dinner, we would go outside and make those snow angels, you know (laughter).  And so that was, those are some of the kinds of things I remember--
Story_ID: 217677
Speaker 1: All right, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Regina] Williams, you told us about childhood in Sandusky [Ohio], and then remembering your brother's [Charles Sallee, Jr.] graduation at Severance Hall [Cleveland, Ohio], the home of the world class Cleveland Symphony Orchestra [Cleveland Orchestra, Cleveland, Ohio], and then you talked about, a little bit about college days at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].  And we're gonna get to that in greater detail.  But I'm just wondering if you can help our viewers sort of visualize the geography.  We were talking three different communities.  Where is Sandusky in relation to Cleveland [Ohio] and Columbus [Ohio], the other place that you mentioned?
Speaker 2: Sandusky is right on the lake [Lake Erie], and it is sixty miles west of Cleveland and sixty miles east of Toledo, Ohio, which is--(unclear)--comes down there.  It is a hundred miles north of Columbus, Ohio.  Sandusky is, when I was growing up there, was a small population, about thirty, thirty-five thousand people.  And I guess I should remember that, because when I went to Ohio State at that time went to Ohio State in the '50s [1950s], early '50s [1950s], and there were I think twenty-eight, twenty-nine thousand students on the campus and so that the campus, the student population, was nearly the size of the population of my home.  And so that was kind of an interesting thing.  The people, the population within the city of Sandusky, though, was primarily German, Italian, some Polish, but, and a large Jewish population, but very, very small black population at that time.
Story_ID: 217678
Speaker 1: I think that as the population of blacks in Sandusky [Ohio] increased at the time or shortly after World War II [WWII], as you had mentioned that.  I remember really vividly when the United States joined the Second World War. My mother [Coranell Collier Sallee] and father [Charles Sallee] were always very, very interested in public affairs, and we discussed that as, as youngsters growing up.  No matter what your age, we were always included in adult conversations; that is, it was just considered conversations.  And so my dad was very interested; my mother was very interested in going, what was going on.  And my dad would discuss the news every evening when he got home, and we'd talk about what was going on.  At that time, of course, there was no television, and I remember, I can really see in my mind's eye that picture of all of us gathered around the radio and listening to the president, [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt at that time, talking about what was going on, and when he gave the speech in which he declared war, so I remember that.  I remember my brother, Henry [Sallee], who was, graduated from Sandusky High School [Sandusky, Ohio] in 1941 and his going to, down to the office of Selective Service [System] where you had to register for the war.  So, those were some of the things I remember.  And I also remember that during the war there was rationing.  So you had ration stamps for shoes.  You'd ration stamps for meat and that kind of thing, and that you were in encouraged to, they had ever, air raid drills.  And you were encouraged to darken your windows, pull the drapes at particular times when they did a drill.  But that's the kind of, I remember those kinds of things.  I remember in high school, junior high and high school and being active in the various clubs that they had formed: forum club, the home ec [home economics] club, just those kinds of things being in, involved in high school.  I still correspond, I have recently started corresponding with a person who was in my grade; we went to grade school and high school together.  And he lives in Florida now and, but we've corresponded and still correspond.  And I go back to our high school graduation, I, our high school alumni reunions, and so, and keep in touch with some of those, some of the people who you became friends with over time.
Story_ID: 217679
Speaker 1: We started our discussion of your childhood and school days in Sandusky [Ohio] by saying you're coming into the world during the early years of the Great Depression, beginning with the bottom falling out of the economy with the stock market crash and then going into this period of World War II [WWII].  But even though we had those major, almost catastrophic events that we associate with American history, you've also described a pleasant kind of existence, I don't know, in the midst of all this chaos, or in spite of.  You mentioned Cedar Point [Sandusky, Ohio], and music, and you know, the teachers who were very nurturing.  But I'm wondering for, when I think of Cedar Point in Sandusky today, I envision this wonderful amusement park, and everyone's having a good time.  Was that the kind of spirit that's associated with Sandusky?  Even in that time of want, there's this, this excess money for recreation--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --in Sandusky?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) When we were growing up, Cedar Point, which is still there, but it was not developed like it is now, we, you went over on the, I think it was the [G.A.] Boeckling was the name of the boat.  There were just a few rides; there were eight.  I could--I used to be able to remember them all.  It was the roller coaster, the and the, that, it was called the Blue Streak, and I think they've--they may have maintained, that because it was a wooden structure, the Caterpillar, merry-go-round, those kinds of things, but a few--and the rest of that, that part that is now developed, was just, it was just grassland.  And, and there were tables, you know, the, and benches, and people took lunches over there.  And you'd go over on Sunday afternoon and you could stay all day.  Families would go over, and that was, that was the entertainment.  It costs fifteen cents round trip on (laughter), on that big ferryboat.  And there were very wealthy people in Sandusky.  I think at that time there were fifty to fifty-two millionaires in a population of thirty-five thousand people.  And that was when being a millionaire really (laughter) meant something.  I think it, you know, it was a lot of money.  So that many people had homes on what was called the [Cedar Point] Chaussee [Sandusky, Ohio].  That was--Cedar Point is often described as an island, but Cedar Point is actually a peninsula, because it is connected to Sandusky.  And the connecting area, people had beautiful homes along that strip, and that was a private road that went along that strip.  They had homes that were huge, huge homes.  They were their cottages.  And so it was an area where people came in the summer.  Very wealthy people vacationed in Sandusky in the summer.  Beautiful boats out on the bay, and so it was--I don't recall any rancor or you know.  My recollection is one of, we did kind of just pleasant things: going to work, going to school.
Story_ID: 217680
Speaker 1: But I would say that my parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] were very active in understanding politics, and understanding the implication of war, and getting through, as I said, the sacrifices that people made during a war and that was with the rationing and accepting that as something that was your role at that time, in terms of supporting the country.  I remember also at the end of the war [World War II, WWII] there is big, there was a big parade down, in downtown Sandusky [Ohio].  And the people dressed up, and they decorated their cars.  And you know, that was on V-J Day.  There was V, V-E Day, and that was Victory in Europe and then V-J Day.  So those are some of the things that I remember.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that, that V-J Day, Victory over Japan [Day], came after the dropping of the bombs on--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --Hiroshima [Japan] and Nagasaki [Japan].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Were you aware of any reaction at the local level to the use of that kind of--
Speaker 1: I can remember--
Speaker 2: --technology?
Speaker 1: --just the understanding of that devastation and, at least within our family we talked about it, that it was, that it was just a terrible thing, you know.  And, and I think that the nation, the whole nation must have reacted very much this way we did, that, well, we, you ended the war, but you also, that was unparalleled loss of life, and you know, even for war.
Story_ID: 217681
Speaker 1: And I know you said you had an older brother [Charles Sallee, Jr.] who registered for Selective Service [System].  Did you have relatives who served during World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: Charles, brother Charles was in the [U.S.] Army and landed on the beach headed Normandy [France].  I have a cousin who was one of the first commissioned, first black commissioned officers in the [U.S.] Navy.  He was one of the--the book ['The Golden Thirteen: Recollections of the First Black Naval Officers,' Paul Stillwell] is written about the Golden Thirteen.  His name was Sam [Samuel E.] Barnes.  And so that, they were--and his sister, my cousin, Margaret Barnes, was in the [U.S.] Women's Army [Corps], and was retired from the Women's Army as a major, and was the, a commander of a black WAC unit, as it was called, the WAC.  So that, I think our family were contributors as far as being involved in that war effort.  And I remember others in Sandusky [Ohio] who lost, other black families, who lost sons during that, during that time, the Wilsons and so--
Speaker 1: But of--
Speaker 2: --there were sacrifices.
Speaker 1: But of your close relatives who went, they all came back home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so there is this jubilation then--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the end of the war, you know, when that victory comes, even if it comes in the midst of, or on the heels of the great violence associated with the bombing (simultaneous) of [Hiroshima, Japan, and Nagasaki] Japan.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 217682
Speaker 1: I'm wondering also about how population, internal population movements helped transform some communities in Ohio, especially in Cleveland [Ohio] with the war time [World War II, WWII] migration and lots of African Americans coming from the South.  Did you see similar population changes in Sandusky [Ohio] with a great influx of folks coming in search of jobs during the war period?
Speaker 2: There were, yes, a large number of blacks from the South came to work in the foundries in Sandusky.  There were two foundries that I recall.  I think there were only two, and that was the heaviest industry that they had.  That was the one that was called I think Farrell and Cheek [Farrell-Cheek Steel Company, Sandusky, Ohio].  And there was another I don't recall the name of that, but blacks did come to work in those foundries.  So that was the greatest change in the population that I would recall.
Story_ID: 217683
Speaker 1: As you're approaching the senior year in [Sandusky] High School [Sandusky, Ohio], have you already decided at that point what your life's work is gonna be?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, at that time, I had always said that I wanted to be a nurse.  And, and then I said, well, maybe I'd like to be a pediatrician, take care of children, and went back and forth between them.  I wanted to be a nurse taking care of children, or I wanted to be a children's doctor.  I ended up being a nurse, and that has been my life's work.
Speaker 1: And so you made that decision before graduating from high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I think that one of the things--you know, when you have your picture made for your yearbook, they ask you to say something about what you're gonna do in the future.  And I think I said something about being--taking care of children or something as a nurse.  I'm, I'm not sure but something of that nature, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: --so.
Speaker 1: --in that year of your graduation, what nursing schools are you considering?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a school in our hometown, and I thought about going there.  And I did apply for it and sent, made out an application.  And I had done very well in, in high school, in the sciences and--(unclear)--things.  But I was not accepted into the nursing school at that time, and that was because they were not accepting black students.  We were called colored then, and they didn't accept colored.  And so my sister, [HistoryMaker] June [Sallee Antoine], was at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] at that time, and she was telling, well, you know, they have a nursing school [The Ohio State University College of Nursing] at Ohio State.  And so I thought--my parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] and I, we talked about my going to Ohio State.  She then came back and said you know, she had talked with the people and with, who had the relatives in nursing.  And they said well, you know, there is a really fine nursing school, a hospital school of nursing, and those were schools that were really well-respected now.  And she knew this--someone told her about this one school in Columbus [Ohio] that was a very, reportedly very good nursing school.  And I applied there, and it was Mount Carmel School of Nursing [Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio].  And I applied there, and I was accepted, and so I went to Mount Carmel School of Nursing.  What I found out later was that I was one of the first group of black students accepted into that program.  Five of us were accepted into the program.  Four of us graduated from the program, and so I was one of the four who graduated from that program.
Story_ID: 217684
Speaker 1: Now I always have this image of OSU [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] as just this huge campus.  And I think you said earlier the campus community is about the size of the city?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Of Sandusky [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: At that time.
Speaker 1: But how large was Mount Carmel [School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio]?  Was it an intimate kind of setting?  You said there were five African American students, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how large is the student body within the nursing school?
Speaker 2: Oh, let me see--
Speaker 1: Approximately.
Speaker 2: --probably maybe a hundred, a couple of hundred at that time, that would be the freshmen group, the juniors and the, and the seniors, because there were three groups, three years, so probably maybe two hundred--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --in all.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: I could count it up, I--
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 2: --(laughter) I have my own group picture.
Speaker 1: Okay, but the, the hospital school then affiliated obviously with the [Hawkes] Hospital [of Mount Carmel; Mount Carmel Health, Columbus, Ohio] is, it also connected with the [Catholic] church community [Sisters of the Holy Cross] or--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --how is the funding--
Speaker 2: --it, it, well, I think the funding came from the hospital.  It was a hospital school of nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so the funding was from the hospital.  Hospitals had schools of nursing.  As a matter of fact, in the east I think some hospitals still have schools of nursing.  The hospital school of nursing was the first nursing school in--collegiate schools of nursing did not start until--I think 1909 was the first collegiate schools of nursing.  But hospital schools of nursing were really the order of the day at that time.  However, when I graduated, or was near graduation from Mount Carmel, one of the things that was being said at that time was that it was very important to get a bachelor's degree in nursing, and so I went to Ohio State then right after graduation.  And that's how it happened that Marlene [Sallee Blount] was at Ohio State then, and I and [HistoryMaker] June [Sallee Antoine] was just leaving, were there at the same time, overlap at, at Ohio State.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the hospital school of nursing awards the equivalent of an associate's degree or--
Speaker 2: No, the hospital school awarded a diploma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a three-year school, three-year programs.  All hospital programs at that time were three years in length, and you were awarded a diploma.  The associate degree programs didn't--did not come into being until 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And those were the two-year schools.  After that, then some hospital schools reorganized their programs into a two-year format to be and to remain competitive with the two-year associate degree programs.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you find that Mount Carmel was affordable, or were you also working and going to school at--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --the same time?
Speaker 2: --it was affordable.  I had a small scholarship help from one of my teachers [Betty Wilhelm Rinderle] on graduating from school.  And then our parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] and you know, really worked to keep us in school, and as we finished, we helped each other.  I-because, when I went to Ohio State, at that time, I was a nurse, a registered nurse.  And so I worked while I was at Ohio State, but I did not work while I was in my original nursing program.  You did not have time, because at that time we, number one, we had to be in at six o'clock in the evening (laughter).  And you spent a lot of time in clinical practice, so that you did not work while you were in your program.
Story_ID: 217685
Speaker 1: But I know that one of the arguments for launching an all-black hospital in Cleveland [Ohio], the Forest City Hospital [Cleveland, Ohio], was that it was difficult for nurses to get that clinical experience because a lot of the majority white hospitals weren't willing to give them those opportunities.  Did you have those similar experiences in Columbus [Ohio] or with Mount Carmel [School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio] or with [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: No, I did not, because for one, Mount Carmel was a hospital school of nursing.  So our practice was done at that Mount, at Mount Carmel hospital [Hawkes Hospital of Mount Carmel, Columbus, Ohio].  That's where our, we did our clinical practice.  And we had affiliations with Children's Hospital [of Columbus; Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio], and they accepted the students for our, from the schools, the hospital schools in the area.  And if they had any--well, I do remember running into one of the nurses, a clinical nurse was on one of the units who had some kind of, I thought, an unkind remark to make, but generally, people did well, you know.  We did not have any problem.  I did not find that to be true at Ohio State either because they had their own hospital [The Ohio State University Medical Center; The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio] too.  And so, but we did not have difficulty doing clinical in those hospitals.  But I do understand that what you're saying did occur in--as a matter of fact, a colleague of mine, since I've moved to, after I moved to Michigan, was talking about going to the, she had gone to the [Wayne State University] College of Nursing at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan].  And because they could not place their students in some of the hospitals in Michigan, that they, she and other black students had gone elsewhere to, for their clinical and then had come back to get their--to receive their degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know, that kind of discrimination, as you look at over time and historically, you see that it's very uneven.  Some place it is, and some place it isn't.  So, in a way, it helps us to see the capriciousness of discrimination as--and racial discrimination as it has been practiced in the country, because some places you still see some of that kind of behavior, not that you are barred because of really specific laws now.  But some of the attitudes have not significantly changed.  I can recall going to the hospital as a patient when they did not put blacks and whites in the same room.  You were in a double-bed room, but if there was only a room, if there was one room left, and there was a white person in there, and you were being admitted, you wouldn't be admitted, because they would say there's no room, because they did not mix.  Incidentally, that was (laughter)--when I was at Mount Carmel--I'm sort of backtracking now--as a student, because five of us were admitted, and because they did not put the students of different races together as roommates, there were two sets of roommates for the five of us.  And I happened to be the one who got the private room, (laughter) because there was not another black or colored student for me to room with.  So I had a private room. And we used to (laughter)--that was really great.  We would assemble there and study together, the other four students and I.  So, sometimes it works out to your advantage (laughter).
Story_ID: 217686
Speaker 1: Well, it seems that you've described a situation in Columbus [Ohio] then in the late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s] where you're getting a good classroom education, hands-on experience with the clinicals, and the best accommodations (laughter), that Mount Carmel [School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio] can--you got your private room.  But after graduation, that occurs in '53 [1953], you had the--
Speaker 2: I--no, I graduated from Mount Carmel in 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the bachelor's degree in nursing?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 1: In '55 [1955], okay.  And then, what's your first work experience after [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: My first work experience?  My first work experience as a registered nurse was I worked for a short time between the time I graduated from Mount Carmel and I went to Ohio State at [Hawkes Hospital of] Mount Carmel [Mount Carmel Health, Columbus, Ohio].  I worked in the operating room.  At that time, nurses worked in the operating room.  Nurses passed the instruments to doctors.  And so, I worked there and then went on to Ohio State.  At Ohio State I worked on one of the units in the university hospital [The Ohio State University Medical Center; The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio].  And while I was at Ohio State I joined a [Nurse Corps Scholarship] Program that the [U.S.] Army made possible.  That was for nurses--registered nurses to come into the Army--stay in a baccalaureate program, but they were actually in the Army, and then to go on active duty as they grad- as soon as they graduated.  And so I was in that program.  As it happened, I was one of the--I was the first black nurse to avail myself of that particular program in Ohio.  And I found out later that I was only the second in the nation to be a part of that particular program where the Army was paying you to complete your baccalaureate degree.
Story_ID: 217687
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Regina] Williams, you said very early on, in your young adult life you decided even before graduating [Sandusky] High School [Sandusky, Ohio] that you wanted to be a nurse--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for life.  And I think you mentioned also that you'd received a scholarship to help with your education?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was the source of that funding again?
Speaker 2: The source of scholarship was this, actually not high school teacher, fifth grade teacher--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --the fifth grade teacher [at Campbell Elementary School, Sandusky, Ohio] that I mentioned that, all the students who were in her grade thought she was wonderful.  But she had--she belonged to an organization, and she had said to me that their organization gave small scholarships and that she was going to submit my name for that.  And I was delighted.  And then later, after the time at which they were to award the scholarships, she talked to me and explained to me that they elected not to give me the scholarship.  And she was sure that I was gonna get the scholarship, because she had told them about me, and everybody agreed that I would be getting the scholarship.  I could only surmise that once they found out that I was a black student that I did not get the scholarship.  And, but one of the things that happened was that she then said that she and her husband would give me the equivalent of that scholarship.  And it was a couple of hundred dollars at that time, but that was, you know, that was a good amount at that particular time.
Speaker 1: And what was her name again?
Speaker 2: Her name was Betty [Wilhelm] Rinderle.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is a white teacher--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from the Sandusky schools--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --taking a chance on a colored nursing student?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A colored student who was going to become--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: A leap of faith, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah, she's--because she knew that I was a good student, and she had faith in me.  And it's those kinds of things that are really important, and it's the kind of thing that makes you really reflect on how important it is for someone to believe in you and to help monetarily to support you.  And it has really--it was one of the influencing factors in my own giving that I have done in establishing scholarships.
Story_ID: 217688
Speaker 1: Just before our last break, you had started to tell me about a special [Nurse Corps Scholarship] Program supported by the federal government that gave nurses, or young women especially, and men, trained as nurses to serve in the [U.S.] military at the same time that they're serving as nurses [sic. studying for a bachelor's degree].  Can you tell me a little bit more about that?
Speaker 2: In that particular program what the [U.S.] Army was doing was attempting to have more nurses with baccalaureate degrees in their--the Nurse Corps.  So they set out a program that was geared for registered nurses who had graduated from diploma programs who were in baccalaureate programs.  And the Army said if you come into the Army or you commit to being in the Army, we will--if you go through everything, if you are admitted, if you are accepted into that program, and then they would give you a stipend for the rest of your--the time that you were in school that supported your education.  And then you went into, you went on active duty when you graduated, and that is what I did.  That was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and as I was saying, I was the first black nurse in Ohio to be accepted into that program, and I was the second in the nation accepted into that program.
Story_ID: 217689
Speaker 1: And so how long did you serve in the [U.S.] Army, around?
Speaker 2: I was just in for one tour of duty.
Speaker 1: Is that two years?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what happens after that? After the three years of [U.S.] military service?
Speaker 2: I was out of military service.  I came back to Ohio.  I was married, and I applied for a job.  My husband [Robert Williams] was still at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].  And I applied for a job, and I went for a job interview.  I was, I was accepted, and the job was teaching nursing at the Grant Hospital School of Nursing in Columbus, Ohio.  That's an interesting story (laughter), if you want--
Speaker 1: I would love to hear it.
Speaker 2: I had sent in my information.  I was responding to an ad in the newspaper, and so I sent the information.  And I didn't hear anything, and my husband and I--I think it was probably a school break, and we went to Sandusky [Ohio] for a few days visit with my parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee].  When I came back I had a letter asking me to come into for an interview.  So I went to the Grant Hospital School of Nursing for the interview.  And I was sitting in an area, sort of like a corridor.  There were seats.  And I was early, about, say ten minutes, ten, fifteen minutes early.  And at about, oh, about five minutes of the time, to the time I was supposed to be there, a woman came out.  And she looked up and down the hall, and then she turned around went back into an office.  And within three or four minutes she came out again, and she looked up and down the hall, and she turned around and went back into the office.  The third time she came out she looked up and down the hall.  She started back into the office, and she turned around and she said to me, "What is your name?"  And I told her my name.  And she had a look of surprise, but it was sort of reserved surprise, and she went back into the office.  And so she came, and then she came back out.  Now it was, by this time it was after the time I was supposed to be there becau- she came back out and she said, "Well, would you follow me please?"  And I went in, and they were waiting for me for the interview.  So that really what had happened was she came out, she saw me sitting there, but she did not, it didn't occur to her that I was the person applying for the job.  They had never had a black faculty member before.  They did not expect one to come (laughter).  But they had invited me to come for an interview, so there I was.  So, I went in, and I talked to the director of the hospital and the director of the school of nursing, and we had quite a conversation.  And subsequently they sent me a letter inviting me to join the faculty.
Speaker 1: And what year is this, please?  The year?
Speaker 2: That would have been in 1957. Yeah, 1957.
Story_ID: 217690
Speaker 1: Can you tell me how you met him, and what program he was enrolled in at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I met my husband at Ohio State.  He was in art education, and we met while we were on campus, and that was that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his name please?
Speaker 2: His name is Robert. Robert M., Morris Williams.
Story_ID: 217691
Speaker 1: And so it's 1957. And you are a new faculty member at a hospital school of nursing [Grant Hospital School of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Actually, it's probably I think 1958.
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], fifty-eight [1958], okay, when you're starting there.  And my goodness, you're very young.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're only twenty-six (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was--
Speaker 1: --twenty-seven years old.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You're on the faculty (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was young once (laughter).
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm just saying for the amount of responsibility that goes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --hand in hand--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --with being a faculty member and having students in their twenties, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That must have been quite a challenge.
Speaker 2: It was, it was, but I enjoyed it.  And the other faculty were, for the most part, were accepting.  Because they had never had a black faculty before, and they'd never worked with a black faculty person before.  And some of the head nurses on the unit in the hospital were not used to having a black nurse as a faculty who brought students into the--I do recall that going into--as an instructor, you went into patients' rooms with, with students and supervise them doing any particular procedure.  And I recall going in, into a patient's room and the patient could not accept that I was the instructor, and that this--the young white woman with me was the student.  It was just not something that--I mean she could finally accept that, but it was--(unclear)--all of those kinds of things are kind of interesting when you think about them.
Speaker 1: So, was that your, was that the beginning of an ongoing time period where you're teaching at the post-secondary level--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in nursing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you start in the late '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you just continue with it?
Speaker 2: It has continued, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you have the opportunity outside of the classroom activities or the clinical experiences to actually work as a nurse where you're not instructing?
Speaker 2: To, to, to nurse?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, but, but you did, the clinical nursing, you did a lot of that nursing yourself--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because you, you had to demonstrate to the student how to do something--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the patient.  Because at all times you, you were interested in the well-being and the safety of the patient, so you had to show how to do it and then you had this, you know, the students were doing it.  Students had practice, of course, in labs, but when they went into the hospital, the instructor very often did the original procedure, the patient.  And then the second time it was to be done, the faculty member would observe as the student carried out that, but, so actually, as far as my clinical nursing prior to my teaching clinical nursing was, I just, I think during the first year after I graduated from school [Mount Carmel School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio] and then during the time I was at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and worked in the university hospital [The Ohio State University Medical Center; The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, Columbus, Ohio].
Story_ID: 217692
Speaker 1: I wonder if you could help us understand some of the changes that have taken place in the profession of nursing since your first years of teaching up through your experiences in Michigan as one of the top administrators here [Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan].  And, and I'll tell you why I ask this.  I guess I was fortunate to be in one of the best hospital in the nation yesterday.  It was at Cleveland Clinic [Cleveland, Ohio].  And the nurse who assisted me was a man.  (Laughter) And--(unclear)--and he kept teasing me about various things, because he knew I didn't wanna be there.  I had something else I was planning to do last night and this morning.  But just the idea of a man being a nurse and dressed the way that he was, it was just something that, it must have been I suppose the same kind of reaction perhaps that you got from people who weren't used to seeing African American--male or female--as nurses and certainly not instructing others, you know, in the profession of nursing.  But when do we start to see those changes, where we don't see the women in white with the little hats, and we don't see just women anymore in nursing, but we also see men.  Is that a recent occurrence?
Speaker 2: Well, actually it is not that recent.  When, when I went to Mount Carmel [School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio], there was one man who was, who was a senior, or--yes, he was a senior when I went, and so he--but there was only one, and then I didn't see any other men in nursing for a long time.  When I started teaching at Grant [Hospital School of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio], I--we had one or two men, as I recall.  As I went on in teaching, we had, in the '60s [1960s], a few men start, had just started to come into nursing and so that gradually a few men have come into nursing, starting in the '50s [1950s].  Now it's fairly commonplace that men are in nursing.
Story_ID: 217693
Speaker 1: As far as the change in the apparel (laughter). When I was a student, we wore white uniforms, white stockings, white shoes, and a cap.  When I started teaching, that was still the uniform of the day, and they had ceremonies for capping in hospital schools of nursing.  We wore long sleeves.  If you were a graduate nurse you wore a long-sleeve uniform.  That was kind of, you know, an indication that you were a graduate nurse.  I think it was probably, as far as I can recall, in the '70s [1970s] that changes started occurring in the nurse's uniform.  And one of the first changes was pant suits.  Instead of wearing a starch white uniform, nurses started wearing pant suits.  And they started not wearing caps in the late '70s [1970s], in the schools where I--that I was familiar with.  And what was said was that in order to be, in order to do the things that we needed to do, in order to perform the kinds of things that we need to do, we need to have a great--a lot more freedom in what we wear, so the pant suit and not wearing a hat, because that was getting tangled with overhead--at that time they used have traction that was an overhead of the beds and things like that.  So those were changes that started.  More men started coming in as--but still only a trickle.  And I think that now even there's probably maybe 11 percent in most schools as far as men are concerned.  But as the salaries increased, it became more attractive to men to come into nursing, and many men used nursing as the first step in becoming nurse anesthetist.  So they went into nursing; they graduated from nursing; and then they went into a program in anesthesia and became nurse anesthetists.  So they were not doing clinical rotations on all of the units.  But more and more men have come into nursing, and now men have said that they like nursing.  And they used to sort of low key it: oh, I only came into nursing because I want be an anesthetist, and so I'm gonna be a nurse anesthetist.  But now you see men on the pediatric units; you see men in oncology units and men who are very proud of being nurses.  And of course you see more women in medicine, who are physicians.  So it's kind of a thing that is--that you see much more now than when I first was, you know, early in my career.
Story_ID: 217694
Speaker 1: In thinking back on my early years in school when I had to make career choices, the nurse was usually presented as the person who supported the doctor or assisted the doctor but didn't really have a profession of her own that she was really skilled at.  But I'm finding now, maybe it was just what the amount of information that was shared, that nurses have a great deal of responsibility.  It's not just about changing bed linen or bringing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --water.  The medication and everything else is there as well.
Speaker 2: That is very true, but that has always been true.  It's just that it was not as well known.  Nursing, as I've said in, when I've spoken to group, is that nursing is, in fact, an academic discipline, and it is a practice profession.  So you have an academic background, a very rigorous academic background.  But we are a practice profession, so we put into practice those kinds of things that we learn academically.  And nursing has become more of an academic discipline over time.  And as one of the, one of the reasons why professional nursing organizations wanted to move nursing out of hospital schools and into universities was because there was the need to develop the academic aspect of nursing, to really develop that academic side.  I think that some of, sometimes people forget that medicine was not always what it is today either.  Medicine had some very humble beginnings, and they had to review, and to reorganize, and to become more academically sound, and nursing has done that as well.  Nursing didn't do it as fast, and we still lag in terms of moving into university schools and having the baccalaureate degree as the single entry-level degree into the practice of nursing, because we still have the associate degree as an entry level because you can take, you can--a nurse can graduate from an associate degree program and sit for the board to become certified or to become license as a registered nurse.  And so we're still moving along that battle.  I think, as I said before, when I first graduated from the hospital school of nursing [Mount Carmel School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio], I went right way into a baccalaureate program [at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio], and that was, remember, 1952.  And they were saying in 1952 everybody is going to have--all nurses are going to have to be prepared with a baccalaureate degree.  This is 2004, and professional nursing is still--the organization is still striving toward that end.
Story_ID: 217695
Speaker 1: Nurses assisted physicians and still assist physicians.  However, as nursing is an independently licensed profession, we now have nurses who are--who have degrees, master's degrees, as nurse practitioners, who have their own practice and care for people with more common, chronic illnesses, and so that the practice of nursing is as very much a scholarly pursuit and it requires a lot of learning, a lot of knowledge base, a strong knowledge base, and a lot of skill, a lot of skill.
Speaker 2: And if I'm hearing you correctly, nurses can be almost autonomous.  You don't--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --necessarily have to practice with--
Speaker 1: You--
Speaker 2: --a physician.  Skilled nursing care--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --can be provide--
Speaker 1: There are--
Speaker 2: --out of that.
Speaker 1: --there are some nurse-run clinics where the nurses, the clinic is run by nurses.  And nurses do the intake; they have their own--they have their patients; and they provide the care.  And they, many times there, they have a relationship with one or several physicians that they refer a patient to if they require the care of a physician.  But not every health concern requires a physician, so that the practice of nursing is an entity that is independent of physicians with long practice in conjunction.  There are a lot of practice groups with physicians and nurses working side by side as colleagues in the care of individuals.
Story_ID: 217696
Speaker 1: But when you have, as you have--when you aspire to become, or to earn a doctorate in nursing, or to become an administrator in a school or nursing, or a department of nursing, or perhaps in some situations, a college of nursing, how do you go about preparing for that?  Say there's a student who has a bachelor's degree in nursing, you know.  How do you prepare then to become an administrator in a school of nursing?
Speaker 2: Most of the time what would happen, anyone who is aspiring to move on with their education goes into a master's [degree] program; gets a master's in nursing.  And some people will get a master's in nursing and continue on to a doctorate where they're going to be involved in much more research, just as any doctoral student would be.  And some decide that they will become nurse practitioners, and they get the master's as a nurse practitioner and go out into practice.  To go on and to get a doctoral degree, one has a master's and then goes on to doctoral study.  And there's a great deal of emphasis on research, the diff- various types of research, and all that that entails, and the theory of nursing, studying the theoretical frameworks of nursing, is part of that, and then studying administrative--administration, because not all Ph.D. prepared nurses are in administration.  Many, as a matter of fact, more and more of nurses with Ph.D.s are really looking at nursing research, in which they are looking at clinical problems that have been identified by clinicians as they have given care to patients.  And there are--they are looking at those problems within a nursing context within a theoretical framework of nursing, and doing the search is necessary to be able to solve some of those kinds of problems.  Nurses who then, who want to go into administration would take courses, other courses in leadership and administration as well.  And so that being an administrator, whether you are a nurse or whether you're in another discipline, has some elements that are different (laughter) from the clinical aspect of it.  But clinical nursing is very rigorous, and some of our very best Ph.D. prepared people remain in clinical nursing or combine their clinical nursing practice with their teaching in colleges of nursing.  And there are many fine colleges of nursing here in Cleveland [Ohio], in Michigan, in Columbus [Ohio], all over.  And nurses are doing some really hallmark research across the country.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at an awards dinner for the Detroit Black Nurses Association.  And I was receiving an award from that group.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was 1994.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of me being inducted into a nursing service sorority at [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] when I was, early on in my career, in 1952 or '3 [1953] that was.
Speaker 1: Picture of me at a convention of Michigan Nurses Association, 1985 or '6 [1986].
Speaker 2: That is a picture in my backyard--(unclear)--that pond is in the backyard.  I can sit on the deck and look at that pond.  The pond was built by our [HistoryMaker Regina Williams and Robert Williams] son, Peter [Williams].
Story_ID: 217698
Speaker 1: Yes, my grandmother was a nurse.  Of course, she was a practical nurse and was become quite skilled as a midwife and delivered babies.  And she was in Kentucky.  I'm told that she would--when they called for Ms. Becky, her name was Rebecca [Sallee]--and they'd call for Ms. Becky to come and deliver a child, particular if the delivery looked as though it was going to be a bad one.  And she had a horse.  She rode her horse to the home and to help them to do--and delivered the child.  So she performed as a midwife during that time.
Speaker 2: And when did you learn about her work as a--
Speaker 1: I remember when she--and I don't remember how old I was, but I remember her visiting us in Sandusky, Ohio.  And my brother injured himself, Henry [Sallee], and--his leg, and I remember grandma taking care of him and doing the kinds of things that we would do now: make sure that his, the pressure on the wound, elevating it, putting ice on it and those kinds of things.  So, that was quite an influencing factor I am sure, that, you know, you see that kind of, that action.  I think another thing that also influenced me, I remember when we were I think in junior high, a friend had been hospitalized.  And because they were from out of town, we would go and visit.  And I saw the nurses walking around in the starched white uniforms and caps and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Okay, now the midwife, the nurse midwife you, whose work you described, that's your paternal grandmother?
Speaker 1: That was my, yes, my father's [Charles Sallee] grandmother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My father's mother.  It was our grandmother.
Speaker 2: So her name would have been Rebecca--
Speaker 1: Her name was Rebecca Sallee.
Speaker 2: Sallee, okay.  Now if we can--
Speaker 1: And she was, of course, lived in Kentucky.
Story_ID: 217699
Speaker 1: Now my doctorate is not a doctorate in nursing.  I have a doctorate--my, I have a master's degree in nursing and, but my doctorate is in higher education administration.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And so that I was specifically prepared for administration, being the administrator in a higher education in, an institution of higher education.  And so while doctoral study, there are similarities across the--but as far as the discipline, I--my discipline in my doctoral study was education, although I did look at some nursing kinds of things as I went through that program.  But, because I had taught for a long time, I was interested in administering a nursing program.  And so that influenced the kind of doctoral degree I decided to get. Rather than getting a doctoral degree in nursing and focusing on clinical nursing, I decided that I would get a doctorate in higher education administration, because I did want to be in that kind of role.  And I had decided that, I think, probably when I was teaching and at the time I was teaching in, at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], in their [Wayne State University] College of Nursing [Detroit, Michigan].  And I really was interested in that, so I did go to, I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I was in that, their program.  And that is what my degree is in, and I--before I left Wayne I was interim assistant dean in the college of nursing and then went on to become the head of the nursing program in Eastern Michigan University [School of Nursing, Ypsilanti, Michigan].  I was kind of a dean; it was a dean role.  I had--we had over two hundred students in the program and over twenty faculty.
Story_ID: 217700
Speaker 1: If we can go back for just minute to that list of publications that I looked at on your C.V. [curriculum vitae].  I noticed a lot of the articles were in journals dealing with nursing and education.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So it seems that the Ph.D. and the master's [degree], that you found a good fit--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, with those two credentials.  But can you just tell me about some of those journal titles, if people want to do additional reading about the kind of research that you focused on as a nursing administrator?  What are some of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I published in the Journal of Nursing Education.  When I went from teaching to administration role, I did an article on the transition from a faculty member to an administrator ["Using Theory to Facilitate the Transition from Faculty to Administrator: A Personal Account," R. Williams].  And I thought that that was an important thing to do because as a faculty member your perspective of the program is very different of your perspective when you are an administrator, because as a faculty member you're thinking about your students, your courses, what you have to do, those kinds of things.  And as an administrator you're thinking about all of the faculty members, not just one.  You're thinking about all of the courses that have to be taught.  You're thinking about how to utilize people in the best way.  And so I likened it I think in my article to, it's like actors in a play.  You have an actor and you have a director, and the actor in the play is focused on their role and what they do, where the director has to be focused, has to really look at all of the people, the whole scope of the play and what has to be done.  So that's one of the kinds of articles I've written.  I think the last publication I did was a chapter ["The Economics of Nursing Education," Regina M. Williams and Susan K. Pfoutz] in a book in looking at the economics of nursing education and the costs, what it cost to educate a person who's in a practice profession, looking at some of those kinds of things.  That book is 'The Economics of Nursing' [sic. 'Economics and Nursing: Critical Professional Issues' Cyril F. Chang, Sylvia A. Price, and Susan K. Pfoutz] is the name of that book, and I have the full title that I can provide for you.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I also have written some articles on nurses who are registered nurses, having been educated in an associate degree program, who are moving on to get a baccalaureate degree.  And so I've written articles on that kind of transition from the A.D.-educated nurse to the baccalaureate-prepared nurse.  And I had developed programs like that, and so some of that research came up from programs that I developed for nurses who are transitioning from the associate degree programs--the graduate of associate degree programs and going to baccalaureate nursing programs.
Speaker 1: Okay, and those citations then we would find under Regina Sallee Williams [HistoryMaker Regina Williams], Dr. Regina Sallee Williams?
Speaker 2: I think it would be under just Regina M. Williams--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --most of those citations, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  There is a, a saying that I hear a lot in the academy, "Publish or perish."  Have you heard that one?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, you obviously didn't perish (laughter).  You've done very well in that environment.  But--and I'm confident that the publications were a part of your success at the post-secondary level.
Story_ID: 217701
Speaker 1: But can you tell me about the atmosphere and working in that director's position in higher ed [education].  Did you find that there were special challenges to go along with those rewards of seeing your name in print in the publications?
Speaker 2: I think there were always--wherever I have worked, whether I was teaching or when I started doing, being an administrator, I have always found challenges in just about everything that I have done.  And the challenge is to really look at what needs to be done, or what you are doing at that particular time with your teaching, then you need to look at how to focus anything you write on your teaching.  And if--when you go into administration you wanna focus your research and your writing on things that have to do with the administrative role, and that, those are things that are important.  It is always necessary, particularly in academia, to be able to balance teaching or administration and your committee work and, so it's the scholarship, teaching and committee service kinds of work.  And those are--the challenges range from one place to another: if you're in a program where research is very, very important because not all colleges or universities require the same level of research.  There are some research universities, and so what the expectation in terms of research is obviously greater in those institutions, but in all institutions there is an expectation that you will be productive of, in terms of writing and disseminating your knowledge that you gain.  And that is, that's the crux of it.  It's the importance of disseminating new--finding new knowledge and disseminating knowledge.
Story_ID: 217702
Speaker 1: But what are some of the service activities that you're involved in when you're a director of the nursing program at [Eastern] Michigan [University School of Nursing, Ypsilanti, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, as an administrator you find yourself on a variety of committees within your particular academic unit.  You are looking at finance committees, so looking at what are the dollars we have, and how will they be allocated?  What are things that take priority?  Working with faculty and figuring out what the needs are for the whole group, and you know, the--you can't say well this person got to me first, so they get the money.  You have to look at what is needed for the good of the whole.  There are committees that have to do with admissions of students, there--have to do with the promotion of a student from one student--from one level to another.  There are committees that look at the promotion of faculty.  Faculty are brought in at one level, say an assistant professor level.  What does it take to be promoted to an associate professor?  So you look at their, at the scholarship of that individual; you look at the service that they have provided the institution; and you look at their teaching expertise, as measured by a variety of things: other teacher colleagues, students, and by administrators.  As an administrator, I always visited our faculty, visit their classroom, make an observation of their teaching, visit them in clinical settings, talk to students, talk to colleagues, so those are some of the kinds of things.  And then you also are active at a larger level outside your particular college, so at the university level where you interact with colleagues from other departments, and because, again, it's the sharing of those dollars of, at the university level from department or college, between colleges.  So those are kinds of real things that you have to consider, and you have to negotiate, and collaborate, work on things.
Story_ID: 217703
Speaker 1: But I'm wondering, too, if your work in Michigan [at Eastern Michigan University School of Nursing, Ypsilanti, Michigan] provided you with opportunities to really shape the profession of nursing as far as accreditation is concerned for schools of nursing.  Did you have an opportunity to be involved in those discussions about the changing profession?
Speaker 2: I think I've always been involved in--I've always been involved in professional organizations.  From the time I first graduated from school, I belonged to professional organizations.  The--in Ohio it was the district, the Ohio District Nurses Association, and so wherever I've been.  And I have gone from being a member at the district level to becoming a member at the state level, and in Michigan I became a member of the District Nurses Association in my district.  And then at the state level I was elected to, at the state level, to the Michigan Nurses Association board of nursing and  their administrative board for that association, and went on to become president of that organization.  And the Michigan Nurses Association is the state organization of the American Nurses Association.  So you then become a member of committees at the national level as well, so where you are really shaping nursing and shaping some of the changes that occur in nursing.  Also, in addition to being very active at the Michigan Nurses Association, and as I said, becoming the president of that association--there were seven thousand members at the time I became president of that association--but I also then was appointed by the governor to become, to sit on the board of nursing.  And the board of nursing is the licensing board.  And so they have, look at the regulation, the legal regulation of nursing.  As a matter of fact, one of the publications that I was very much involved with was the legal and professional regulation of nursing in Michigan, where you looked at the differences between.  What are the professional regulations, and what are the legal regulations?  They are not always exactly the same.  And so I've been involved with that.
Story_ID: 217704
Speaker 1: On the [Michigan] Board of Nursing, one of the things that I was involved with was a committee that included people from the legislature, members from Michigan Nurses Association.  We worked on, on putting together a structure that allowed nurses who had problems with substance abuse to get into a program, just to surrender their licenses willingly and get into a program that help them to recover from their addiction and then were able to get their licenses back without having to go through board action.  That was a program I thought was--it is a very worthwhile, very good program that helped to get nurses who were substance abusers out of the clinical situation prior to having done something that was harmful to a patient and still enabled them then to get through that recovery phase and back into the profession in a health state.
Speaker 2: So you're actively involved in an, those organizations that shape the policy--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --through, through the various memberships and then as leader of the Michigan organization with--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the seven thou- seven thousand members.
Speaker 1: Yes.  I was, now I--it was after I was no longer the president when I went to the board of nursing because that would have, in fact, have been a conflict of interest, but they were two separate kinds of activities that I did.  And it's important to realize that the legal obligation, and for the board of nursing, we look at nursing, the practice, legally.  You're role is protection of the patient, the consumer, and not the protection of the practitioner.  But you do set policy for practice of individuals, and you set policy for schools of nursing, for educational structure as well.
Story_ID: 217705
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Regina] Williams, we've talked a lot about your professional career and maybe your public life and public face, but I'd like to talk for a little while about your private life.  I know you already mentioned that you met Mr. [Robert] Williams while you were both students at [The] Ohio State University in Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you tell me that Mr. Williams an arts educator.  But I'm wondering if Dr. and Mr. Williams had children also--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in common and what life was like in the Williams' household.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, we did have children.  We had three children, one son--we had two, two boys [Michael Williams and Peter Williams] and one girl [Regina Williams].  One son [Michael Williams] is deceased.  When our children were growing up, we had a really a wonderful time with them in rearing them.  My husband really worked very well with the children in growing.  One of the things that we did that I, now when I hear about it as though, you know, as something new, I thought, "We did that when our kids were small," and that was that we used to have family meetings.  So we would talk about different things and how you behave, and different ways to go about studying, ways to interact with other--with their peers, how to deal with peer pressure, things like that.  And one of the children would take the minutes of the meeting, and they would have their say about different things.  And, and so it was, it was fun, I mean raising our children; we enjoyed that, and--
Speaker 1: Was this a democracy in action here, or were they just--
Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: --expressing themselves only to be overruled?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, but their ideas and their thoughts were given due consideration.  And so if they had an idea that was not exactly one (laughter) that, that would work well for the whole family, they would have to, we'd really have to talk about that and help to let everyone know why that would not work, or that was not a good idea.  And they were applauded for bringing forth ideas about how they should behave or how we should do things as a family.  We'd say, you know, that's a good idea.  You know, why don't we do that instead of--do this instead of that?  So it was a way of getting them to understand roles, and to understand leadership, and understand give and take, and that you can't always have your way, or nobody can always have their own way; there always has to be some sort of negotiation.  So it's interesting and fun.
Story_ID: 217706
Speaker 1: Can you share with us the names of your children please?
Speaker 2: Yes, our oldest son was Michael [Williams], and Michael graduated from the Georgetown [University] [Edmund A. Walsh] School of Foreign Service [Washington, D.C.].  Our second son was Peter [Williams], and Peter is, graduated from Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan].  He has an undergraduate degree in political science and a near-graduate degree in history.  He loves history.  He is really very much a student of history, and his current, his work is looking at the Underground Railroad and looking at, going from slaves coming in and going across into Canada.  Our third child was a daughter.  Her name is Regina Mary [Williams].  She is, she lives in Washington, D.C.  She is the public affairs officer for the secretary of the District of Columbia.  And they--our daughter graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 217707
Speaker 1: Did all of your children grow up in Detroit, Michigan?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they attended the public schools there or where?
Speaker 2: Our, when we moved to Detroit, our oldest son [Michael Williams] was in third grade, and he--and the other two children were not yet in school.  Peter [Williams] went to the public school kindergarten.  Our children went to Catholic schools.  We are Catholic, and so they went to a Catholic grade school, elementary school that went through the eighth grade and then to Catholic high schools.  And they--Regina [Williams] went to Immaculata High School [Detroit, Michigan] in Detroit.  Peter went to [Detroit] Catholic Central High School [Detroit, Michigan], and Michael went to the University of Detroit [Jesuit] High School [and Academy, Detroit, Michigan] in Detroit.  So, they're all products of those schools.
Story_ID: 217708
Speaker 1: Now, you told me earlier that you grew up in the Baptist church [Second Baptist Church] in Sandusky [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you're Catholic--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a young mother and wife.  So when did that change take place?
Speaker 2: I think in probably nineteen--it's when I graduated [1952].  I went to a Catholic school, nursing school, and that influenced in many ways, and--
Speaker 1: Oh, so Mount Carmel [School of Nursing; Mount Carmel College of Nursing, Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Mt. Carmel was--
Speaker 1: --is a Catholic school.
Speaker 2: --a Catholic school, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I became Catholic, and my husband [Robert Williams] was Catholic.
Story_ID: 217709
Speaker 1: There's quite a lot going on in the Williams' household and also in those different areas where you're working.  Did you find that it was difficult to balance all of the demands that are placed upon you as a wife, and mother, and educator, and nurse, or were you pretty good at juggling?
Speaker 2: I was; I think I was pretty good at juggling, but I think the main factor there was that my husband [Robert Williams] was very much a person who shared responsibility in terms of taking care of the children, doing things in the house, he--cooking, cleaning, washing.  We really shared all of our responsibilities.  And because my husband taught in the public schools, in the high school, he got home usually before I did, and so he--there were things that he would take care of.  We used to plan meals like a week in advance, and so we knew what we were going to have. And so whoever got home first would get things started.  And the children [Michael Williams, Peter Williams and Regina Williams] all had their chores to do, and we'd have a list of chores.  And I laugh about one of the things.  One of our friends came over.  We were having some sort of little get-to-together.  And a friend wanted to use the phone, and she used the phone.  She came back and she said to me, "[HistoryMaker] Regina [Williams], I see that you have a list of chores out there by the phone for your children to do, things for them to do when they get home from school."  And I said, "Yes."  And she said, "Well," she said, "do they do them?"  And I said, I said, "Yes, they do."  And she said, "Well, how do you get your children to do those chores?"  And I looked at her.  I was really surprised.  I said, "I'm their mother, that's how I get it. I tell them to do it," (laughter).
Story_ID: 217710
Speaker 1: We were talking just a minute ago about life in the Williams' household, and the stories that you recounted were told with a smile.  So I take it that most of the time things were pleasant in your household?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were always. They really were always pleasant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We had, our children [Michael Williams, Peter Williams and Regina Williams] were absolutely wonderful children.  And my husband [Robert Williams] was a wonderful husband and father, and he really set a tone for how important it is just to do, you know, the kinds of things and to just move on with it.  My husband, my husband was a Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] and had fought at--actually was in the Korean War and fought at the reservoir, which was the [Battle of] Chosin Reservoir [North Korea].  And people were--the Marines refer to that as the frozen Chosin, because it was extremely cold in that--but and as much of a Marine as he was, he was very, very kind and gentle with the children.  And they really grew into being very strong, but gentle, and respectful human beings.
Story_ID: 217711
Speaker 1: Now, we spoke for a few minutes about the children growing up in Catholic school settings, and the fact that the entire family, eventually everyone became members of the Catholic church.  Did your schedule allow time for you to participate in any special church functions, or was it primarily through the Masses that the family was really drawn into the traditions of the Catholic church?
Speaker 2: My husband [Robert Williams] and I were very involved in our parish.  And actually when the Catholic church moved toward greater openness after, back in [Vatican] II, and they had laypeople being very much involved in the service, in the Masses, and they started having lay readers, my husband and I were, began as lay readers in our church in Columbus, Ohio.  And then when they decided to, to have lay readers at our church in Detroit [Michigan] when we moved to Detroit, we were the first lay readers in our parish, probably because we had the experience before, and we had read.  And I was the first woman to read from our, the--from the altar, from the--in the church.  And so we were very much involved in, in reading the Mass, we were Eucharistic ministers in the Mass, very involved.  And the children also as they grew are--were altar servers, and then were also lay readers.
Speaker 1: And at this time, that, or at least in your parish, is the Mass being celebrated in English?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Masses across the nation following Vatican II could be celebrated in, in the vernaculars, so.  There, I know that there are some Masses, some churches that have Masses in Latin, but that is extremely rare.  Extremely rare.

Speaker 1: Yes, it is a sorority for college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Delta Sigma Theta, all right.
Speaker 1: --educated women, Delta Sigma Theta.  I am very active with organizations for--that are charitable.  There's an organization called COTS in Detroit [Michigan], and that's Coalition On Temporary Shelters [sic. Coalition On Temporary Shelter] for women.  At our church we host the homeless people for one week over the--you know, a coalition of churches will rotate hosting homeless people during the winter months.  And my husband [Robert Williams] and I were active helping out with that.  I--we've been active in politics and supporting politicians financially.
Speaker 2: Is this bipartisan support or--
Speaker 1: No (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --not bipartisan support.

Speaker 1: I belong to EMILY's List, the Sojourner [sic. Sojourners] organization.  That's an organization, supports women.  I've tried to do a lot of civic things with the time that I had.  And one of the things I used to say when I taught the students was that, with regard to them becoming active in the nursing organizations, was that everybody has the same twenty-four hours in a day.  It depends on how you use those twenty-four hours.  And some people will use it; some people will squander it, and other people use it in very productive ways.  But everybody has an opportunity to do some things that benefit other people.  And you can't just be benefiting yourself.  We all have to do things that will benefit the society as a whole in order for us, our society to survive.  Because if we all were only interested in ourselves and in our immediate families, this would not be a good place to live in this world.  We all have an obligation, and I think that's something that comes from early on, you know.  Our parents [Coranell Collier Sallee and Charles Sallee] really thought it was very important to give of yourself and to do things for other people.  I know that growing up, our--my sisters and I were in an organization that was called--I don't remember exactly, but it was the Young Colored Women's--Colored Women's Federated Clubs [sic. National Association of Colored Women's Clubs].  And we were in junior high and high school [Sandusky High School, Sandusky, Ohio] when we were active in that.  And its motto was, "Deeds not words shall be our motto.  We are lifting as we climb."  And that was something that our parents really stressed with us: you lift as you climb.  And we--it's something that we passed on to our children.  I know that my siblings passed it on to their children.  We have got to be instruments of peace in the world and instruments for growth in a good way, you know, for everybody in our immediate society and for other societies as well, because when you look at what's going on in the world today, we have got to realize that we are all very connected to one another, not just in our own families, and our own communities, in our own country, but in other countries as well, and we have all got to lift as we climb.

Speaker 1: Any other people, advisors, or teachers from elementary through the post-secondary level?  Any other stories or individual names that you wanna mention at this time?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that was sort of could have begun as a negative: when I went to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and that to get my bachelor's degree, one of my advisors there said to me, "Well, why would you want to get a bachelor's degree?"  Because at that time most nurses had, the extent of their education was a diploma in nursing.  And I said, "Because I want to have a bachelor's degree.  I believe that it's important, because I believe that's the direction that the profession is moving toward."  And at that time, with a bachelor's degree, people were teaching in schools.  She said to me, "But where would you, with a bachelor--you're going on to get a bachelor's degree--where would you get a job to use that bachelor's degree?"  And I said, "I'm not gonna think about where I would get a job to use that.  I'm going to get a degree because that is an increase in my education, and that is important to me."  Subsequent to that, my first job teaching--as I was saying, I was the first black faculty on the staff at, at the Grant Hospital School of Nursing [Columbus, Ohio]--we were having an alumni affair.  And so all of the faculty--at that time we wore our uniforms, and so we were in our uniforms, and we were in a receiving line to receive alumni and to, you know, and then we were going to talk about what we were doing in the school.  Well, one of the first people through the line was this advisor who had said, "Where would you get a job teaching?"  And I found out she was one of the alumni of the school in which I was teaching.  And it was quite interesting because she just flushed and sort of stammered.  And I said to her, "Good evening, how nice to see you again," (laughter).
Speaker 1: To remind her of the earlier conversation (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, she knew exactly who I was.
Story_ID: 217715
Speaker 1: And there have been other people who have been very, very supportive.  I've mentioned Mrs. [Betty Wilhelm] Rinderle, some wonderful faculty in my master's program [Wayne State University College of Nursing, Detroit, Michigan], wonderful faculty in my doctoral program [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Dr. [Robert T.] Bob Blackburn was my advisor at the University of Michigan, and he was a wonderful person and a very good advisor, and I appreciated all of his wise counsel.  So I have met some very wonderful people throughout my career in nursing.  I am a fellow in the Nightingale Society.  I am a fellow in the American Academy of Nursing.  And I have had a wonderful relationship with colleagues and wonderful networks.  I've had the privilege of, in addition to being the--having been a president of the Michigan Nurses Association, to being a chair of the [Michigan] Board of Nursing in Michigan, to being chair of committees at the national level, I've just had a lot of opportunities.  In Michigan, I was also the president of the Michigan Association of Colleges of Nursing dean's group.  And so I've had an opportunity to be in many leadership roles and to exercise leadership in a way that I thought facilitated the profession going on just as--so I believe that my professional goals have been achieved, and I'm very pleased with the kinds of things that I have been able to contribute to the profession and that I have, I feel honored by the fact that I have been elected or selected or appointed to many positions of leadership.

And I went with a group, and I spoke at the nursing--the university nursing school in China and visited hospitals.  I learned some Chinese, just a few words, before I left.  And a friend of mine at the University of Michigan gave me a list of common phrases.  And I practiced them, and I really was so good at it that I would say hello and to people I met, and they would just beam and start talking to me in Chinese (laughter).  And I'd have to tell them no, that's all I know (laughter), that's all I know.
