 Finchum  Today is June 24, 2014. My name is Tanya Finchum along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University and today we   re in  Pryor, Oklahoma to speak with Juanita Patterson LaMunyon?  LaMunyon.  LaMunyon. LaMunyon. This is part of our 100 Year Life project so  thank you for having us today. Let   s start with having you tell us when  and where you were born.  I was born in Elk City, Oklahoma, June the 19th, 1913.  And what did your parents do for a living?  Well my dad was farmer for years and then he went into the oil company  and worked in the oil field practically the rest of his life.  Where did you go to elementary school?  Three Sands. Well, I started in Elk City, Oklahoma. My first grade was  Elk City with my parents. I went to school in Elk City until I was about  nine I guess, eight or nine and then Three Sands. The rest of my  schooling was in Three Sands.  And that is where? I   m not sure.  Well that   s south of Tonkawa, Oklahoma and it was a boom town, an oil  boom town.  Were you born on a farm or in the hospital?  5  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  I was born in a home in Elk City, Oklahoma. Not a hospital.  Well did you have chores growing up?  Pardon?  Did you have chores?  Oh yes. Oh yeah. Dishes was we kids chore and taking out the trash and  stuff like that, but we did have things to do.  Sounds like you have siblings.  I have one sister.  Older? Younger?  Two years older than me. Those are one of her letters over there too with  mine.  What was her name?  Veola. V-e-o-l-a. Not Viola. Veola.  So you went to school, the older years in Three Sands.  In Three Sands. Yes.  Did you have a favorite subject?  I like geography and history and I was never very good in mathematics.  (Laughter)  Were you a member of 4-H or FFA or anything like that?  No, we didn   t have 4-H in Three Sands. We were in the glee club and  those things that you had in high school.  Did you play sports?  Oh yeah. I played basketball.  You did? Half court, full court?  Well I was the center. They had different rules back then than they did  now. They had three different sections of the court and you had the  6  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  home team and you had the visitor   s team and then you had center. Two  girls in the center couldn   t get into the line of the others. It was odd.  And what would you wear?  Bloomers. (Laughs) That was funny. (Laughter) We had, you had great  big blossomy bloomers. I don   t think, I don   t know if you   ve seen them  or not in other times, but they weren   t shorts or tight like they are now.  We had midis. You had long sleeves. I mean there   s nothing like their  costumes are now.  They   re not much now are they?  Not much now. Well, I don   t see why they didn   t hinder us with our  playing because you had so much clothes on. (Laughs)  Would you travel to other schools to play?  Not much. No. We didn   t, we didn   t have much. I guess the school  didn   t have much money because we didn   t go much of anywhere else. I  think we went to Marland and we went to Tonkawa, but that   s about all.  Those were just towns that were close.  Let   s back up a little bit. During 1918 you would have been five or six in  there when the flu epidemic came through. Did you have any memories  of that?  Well, yes. I had to be taken away. My sister and I were parted because I  think one of those letters has something to do with, tells that I   m away  from my family because they were afraid I would get the flu and it was  very bad at that time, but I don   t remember any of it. I guess I should,  but I don   t.  No, you five or six you wouldn   t have too strong of a memory I wouldn   t  think.  No. Huh-uh.  So     I just remember being separated from my sister. That   s about all.  Well would your mother can and grow a garden and things like that?  Oh yeah, oh yeah. All farmers did and my grandmother did too. When I  was a kid, I went to school each school year with my grandparents,  7  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  because my dad (and mom went with him) moved on wildcat wells in  the oil field and school time we were with my grandparents, because you  never knew what town you were going to be in. So in the summer we  were with my parents and then school time we were with my  grandparents. My grandparents helped raise me as much as my parents  did.  Wildcatting? You don   t hear too much about that these days.  No, you don   t, but that   s what they used to call it.  Well did she work, your mother work too or just travel with him?  No, she usually cooked for the crew when the wildcat was way out  somewhere from towns. Well, they lived in a tent and she usually  cooked for the crew and they all stayed there at their location with the  rig and then she usually did the cooking and whatever the mama   s do in  those days. (Laughs)  Well did your grandparents    house have electricity and running water  and     No, no. No electricity. No running water. We had a well and lamps. In  fact, I still have some of the lamps. (Laughs)  Did homework before the sun went down then?  Oh. Well no, we had the lamps and you see, my granddad was a stickler  with-you got your lessons. No matter whatever else you had to do, you  got your lessons first. That   s the way we did that way.  Did you have a room to yourself?  No. My sister and I slept in one room together most of our lives.  How would they heat the house?  With coal stoves and it was usually, wasn   t usually in the bedroom. You  had a central heat in say the dining room or the living room. You didn   t  have central heat. Not central heat. No. You didn   t have the stove in the  bedroom. (Laughter) It was in the other rooms.  So in the wintertime, how did you stay warm?  A lot of cover. (Laughs)  8  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  And dress quickly I guess.  Oh yeah. We had the, that was one of our chores was to bring the coal in  and take the ashes out. (Laughs)  So how would you get to school?  We walked. In Three Sands, when I first went to school in Three Sands  it was two miles. We walked two miles just     One way?  Yes and then after we moved... oh after we moved about a, it must have  been six months or a year. Was over a year, then it was just one mile.  That was better. That was at IXL that we lived. I went to Valley Center  and IXL in Three Sands.  And about how many students would be in your class?  Oh heavens, I don   t know. There was a gob of kids. Maybe the first  school was all eight grades. I mean from first to eighth. There must have  been twenty kids or more in that school and then when we moved up to  IXL there were more kids because it was a larger school. Then the high  school was still more kids. (Laughs)  I was just letting it finish before we moved on. (Laughter) So did you  have a job yourself during high school or anything like that?  No, well in the summer time my uncle was an engineer in a gasoline  plant and all of the guys wore khakis, and in the summer time my job  was ironing the khakis. Well, that was their work clothes, their khaki  shirts and khaki pants. I did a lot of ironing when I was that age.  Did you get paid?  Sure. That   s why I did it. (Laughs)  Do you remember how much?  No.  Did you have an electric iron?  No. We had what they call them sad irons. You put them on stove and  you had the handle. You heated the iron on the stove and then when it  finally cooled down you changed it to another. You had two or three  9  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  different ones. Then later we had gasoline and you pumped it up and had  a fire in it. Now that was hot. Then later we had electricity, but I didn   t  get to use that one. I was a teenager. I didn   t have electric then.  So what year did you graduate from high school?  Oh heavens, I don   t know. (Laughs)  Let   s try to figure it up. If you were born in 1913     In    13.  So    31,    32?  Something like that. I   m not really sure.  So what did you do after high school?  Well I, as I said, I worked   I did the ironing and then in   I think back  to the    30s I lived with my sister. She lived on a farm. I lived with my  sister because Mom and Dad were going around, and then I got married  and that was it. (Laughs)  Well how did you meet your husband?  Well I was good friends with her (Mique) mother. He came to meet, he  was her cousin and that   s how I met him and married him. Her mother  and I have been friends for how many years Mique?  Ever since they moved to Tonkawa     Uh-huh.  Which would have been, oh I don   t know. Bob was     It was before    30.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  I was little.  I don   t know. Years and years and years. (Laughter)  Early 30   s.  10  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Then we moved to Inglewood, he and I did. His parents lived in  Inglewood, Kansas, which is a little town just across the border from  Oklahoma, out practically in the Panhandle.  What would you do for your dates, before you got married?  Oh, we danced. Well, Rex, my husband, didn   t dance, but when I was  dating I danced almost every night. Around there somewhere there was a  dance you could go to almost every night. Even on Sunday night there  was a dance at what we used to call Cowboy Hill and that was south of  Ponca City. That was a big deal. (Laughs)  But he didn   t like to dance, your husband?  No he never danced.  Never did?  No. So after I got married I didn   t dance anymore.  Well, how did he ask you? How did he propose?  Oh, I don   t know. We were   I think we were out with her parents. I   m  pretty sure that was it. They were kidding about getting married and he  said,    Yes, we   re going to get married.    I said,    Huh?    (Laughs) And we  were married at Alva, Oklahoma in    30,    34,    30, I don   t know.  Somewhere  in then . I should have dug that out. I guess it   s in the  safety deposit box though isn   t it? My marriage  certificate .  How long were you married?  Until 1972.  Forty something  years . So after you got married, take us through a few  of the things as you progressed.  Well, the first job I had after I got married, I was a waitress in a little  caf   next to my husband   s dad   s garage and filling station. Then after  that, I was a clerk in the post office. That was before the war, World  War II. After World War II  began , we moved to Wichita and I worked  at Beech Aircraft, and we built training bombers at Beech. Then after the  war, I went to Washington State and I was a dispatcher for a taxi cab  company. (Laughs) Then I came back and by that time, my husband was  back from the war and I went to beauty school with her mother. After  that, he moved to Indianapolis because he helped build the Eli Lilly  11  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  plant in Indianapolis. He was a construction worker or welder. Then I  moved up there with him and I went to work for Western Electric at  Speedway. Then we moved, they build a new plant in Indianapolis and  then we moved the whole thing and I worked for Western Electric for  thirty years, twenty-five or thirty, about thirty-five, about thirty-six  years. Then I moved back down here and I   ve been back down here ever  since.  Let   s back up to when you were building bombers. What was your job?  Well, at first I was a nose   well, how am I going to say this? I was a  nose plumber in the nose of the bomber because I was small. We can   t  tell it now, but I was small and most of the women did that kind of job in  the smaller places, and I did nose plumbing in the nose of the bomber for  quite a while. Then I became a, I don   t know what they called it.  Anyway, we had certain bomb sights that go into certain planes. We  built AT-10s and AT-11s and a certain bomber had to have a bomber  sight. This one had to be in this plane and that one had to be in that  plane. I went to the warehouse, got them, brought them back and made  sure they were the ones that were supposed to go in each plane, the right  kind. That was about all. Well, not just bomb sights, but other things that  had to go in the planes, that you have to go get them and come back and  make sure they were in that plane with that number and that was it.  Well, how had you gotten the job to begin with?  Well, I just applied for it and got it. (Laughs)  And your husband was away at war?  Well, he worked in Boeing Aircraft, and he built the    shoot   m-up     bombers, and I worked in Beech Craft with the AT trainers. That was  until he went to the war. He was a Seabee in the war, but I worked all  during the war at Beech Craft while he was in the war.  What took you to Washington State then?  Well, my boss and his wife and I became close friends, and his boss had  a brother out in Washington State and his boss said,    Well you guys  come on out and we   ll give you a job.    So they went out and then  because she was such a good friend, they said,    Hey Juanita, come on  out and we need a dispatcher.    His brother had a taxi cab company out  there in Kelso, Washington. I went out there. That   s what I did. They  needed a dispatcher for the taxi company and so that   s what I did.  Did you like doing it?  12  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Yeah, that was fun. Yeah. I had my first earthquake out there. (Laughs)  Scared me. It wasn   t a big one. It was just a little one. We   re used to  tornados, but not earthquakes. (Laughs).  Quite a change from here to there, too.  Oh yes, it was beautiful out there. We took, she and her husband and I,  took a trip out there. What time was that? What year was that in?  Well, oh that we went     That we were out in South Washington.  Oh gosh. We went on up to Mount St. Helens    uh.  Anyway, I got to see the place where I worked.  Yes. It was early    90s or late    90s.  Yeah in the    90s.  Late    90s     When you were working there, had you driven out or did you take the  train or plane?  Oh, on the train.  On the train.  I went out on the train and there were a lot of soldier boys and sailor  boys trying to get to where they were, and the trains were so crowded in  those days. Oh boy, you couldn   t hardly find a seat. I went out on the  train and came back on the train. I came back because my mother was  ill. My sister said,    Mother   s ill. Come help us.    I came back.  Wasn   t that about    45,    44,    45?  It was later than that.  Near the end of the war.  It was later than that, about    45 I guess, because we went to beauty  school in    46.  13  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  I think so.  I think so. Went to beauty school in Ponca City.  And did you have a shop?  No. My sister had a shop and we came back and her (Mique   s) mother  and I worked for my sister in the beauty shop. Then when I left and went  to Indianapolis, her mother bought in with my sister and both of them  ran the beauty shop for years and years in Tonkawa.  Hair styles were a little bit different then.  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. (Laughter)  Do you remember some of the cuts you would do?  Pardon?  Remember some of the cuts or styles you would do?  Well, when we learned to do permanents, they had a machine that you  clamped   how do I explain that? I   m sure you   ve seen them. It   s a big  ol    machine that had a lot of wires, electricity, and you clamped the  thing on your hair and if you weren   t careful you   d burn your head.  Then you have to be careful, but that was the first kind of permanent  machines that we had. That was before they had the kind you just rolled  up and had the solution on. We did marcelling, what they call  marcelling, with a marcel. You heated the pinchers, I guess you   d call  them. Then you crimped them up and made waves in their hair. You  couldn   t get it too hot because it would burn the hair. It was kind of fun.  And when you moved to Indiana you decided you didn   t want to do that  any longer?  No, I was tired of that, and they were hiring at this Western Electric and  I thought,    Oh boy, that would be a good deal,    so that   s what I went  for.  And what did you do for them?  The first time I was working on the line. I was building telephones on  the line. Then I got into the inspection and later when we move to the  new plant in Indianapolis, I was an investigator for inspection lines. If  anything went wrong on the line, we had to find out what it was and try  to fix it before too many telephones went by to get that way.  14  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  Was it mostly women doing that type of job?  Oh no, it was men and women. Uh-huh.  And how would you get to work? To and from work?  I drove a car.  Did you?  My first car was a, well, I had the first car during the war because I  drove to work at Beech, but after I moved up there I had my personal  car. He had a car and I had a car. My first car was     Tell them how you learned to drive.  Oh, I learned to drive setting on my dad   s lap. It was Model T time and I  couldn   t reach the pedals so he taught me how to steer until I was big  enough to reach the pedals. My first car I ever drove was a Model T.  Was fun. Dad let us have   well, when we were in high school he let us  drive a car. You didn   t have to have a license then. Kids could drive.  (Laughs) He   d let us drive the car. Not all the time, but he   d let us drive  the car, which was good. We thought we were something else, you  know.  How  old were you ?  Oh I don   t know. Probably twelve, thirteen, something like that.  Mostly dirt roads?  Oh, my yes  Muddy too, bad roads. Very seldom did we ever get to  drive on the pavement. Why that was something else.  Well, when you were in high school would you travel into Tulsa or  Oklahoma City very often?  No. No.  The closest big town was      Ponca City. (Laughs)  Ponca City.  15  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Would you go to the Ponca City library?  No. Most of our reading was schoolwork, was about all school work.  And what would you do for fun in high school?  Well, course we played ball and school activities, and that   s about all  there was to do.  Go to the movies?  Yeah, we did. We went to movies. One time I remember I saw  Frankenstein, the story, and then I had a nightmare and my mother said,     No more spooky stories for you. You don   t do it.    So I don   t like them  to this day. I don   t. These crazy things in television, I don   t watch. I   m  afraid I   ll have another nightmare. (Laughs)  Well did you learn to sew when you were younger?  No, I was the outdoor type. I liked to do things outside. My parents had  chickens and cows and stuff, and I learned to milk when I was just a  little kid. I loved the chickens, to gather the eggs, feed the chickens, and  play with the little chickens. My sister was a wonderful cook, she and  my mother. I   m not a very good cook and I never was because I was the  tomboy type. I played outside and worked in the garden and that type of  stuff. I didn   t like to cook. I didn   t even like to do dishes, (laughs) but  that I had to do anyway.  Was church an important part of your growing up     We didn   t have church in Three Sands much until after I moved to a  bigger town and then yes, church was very important. It   s always been  important to me. My grandmother was a staunch Baptist. When we were  in school we went to church of course, but then when we moved to  Three Sands there wasn   t much of church there. It was Tonkawa or  Perry or someplace else. There wasn   t much church in Three Sands.  Well after I married we had church.  Would you go on vacation much as a child?  We didn   t know what vacation was. We just lived day to day. (Laughs) I  didn   t travel until I was married and we had a trip out West. I hadn   t  traveled, only just from school to wherever Dad and Mom was working  and you just stayed there. You didn   t travel. You went there and lived  until you had to go back to school.  16  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  Tell her about the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  I didn   t hear you.  The North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Well yeah, but that was after I got married.  Yeah.  What were holidays like?  Just like they are now. We had a gathering, of course, with families and  Christmas, Thanksgiving, and that   s about all.  Fourth of July?  Not much. We never did do that much. We weren   t allowed to have a lot  of fireworks because they were supposed to be dangerous for little girls.  Ho, ho. (Laughs)  Well do you have a favorite childhood memory?  A favorite what?  Childhood memory?  Just everyday living, I guess. Nothing exciting ever happened to me.  (Laughs)  A favorite toy or game?  Oh, I loved my horse. My dad bought me a horse when I was, oh I don   t  know, going in my teenage years. Before I got married I had a horse.  That   s about all. Only toy I had besides pups, of course. Everybody,  every kid had a pup. (Laughs). As you can tell, I like dogs.  At what point did you realize you might make it to a hundred?  (Laughs) Well, I am hundred. No, age never did bother me. As I was  growing older you know, thirty, forty, fifty, never did bother me. Age  just didn   t mean anything. It still doesn   t mean anything to me. It   s just  another day, and the Lord   s just letting me live this long, and I   m  thankful and that   s it.  Well, I   m sure people ask you what your secret is? Do you have an     17  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  Oh, everyday        answer for that?  I have no secret. I just had good genes and I tried to eat well and behave  myself, after I grew up. (Laughs)  Meaning before, you weren   t?  Oh, I was an ornery kid. Course I was the baby of the family and spoiled  rotten. Now the kids spoil me. I   m spoiled again.  Well, did you sister live to be     Uh   She died in nineteen     Eighty-five.  Eighty-five, and she was born in 1911.  So, in her seventies then. How about your parents?  My mother lived to be ninety-two. My grandfather lived to be ninety     how much was Granddad? Ninety     Do you know when he was born? He passed in, after Terry was born.  Oh yeah.  She was about six months old. So that would have been fifty-five?  Fifty-six. Something like that.  Fifty-six.  Anyway.  Yeah. About fifty-six.  I had one aunt that lived to be ninety. So I   ve just had good genes.  That   s the only thing.  Did you have children?  No.  18  Bishop  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  Bishop  LaMunyon  Bishop  And so you said with the kids, can you explain a little bit. Who are your  kids?  She   s my kid. (Laughs)  But she   s not a blood relative?  Well, in a way. No, not a blood relative. Her mother and my husband  were cousins. Now you figure it out, but to them I   m Aunt Nita. They   re  my kids. She and her brother were my kids, really, and their descendants  are my kids, too. Her sons and daugh... Oh, did I tell you Terry called  me?  No   She called me from Alaska the day after     Your birthday.     my birthday. She   s afraid to call me on my birthday because she  figured we was living it up. (Laughter)  And she was right.  But she called me the next day. She lives in Alaska. Her daughter does.  She called me for my birthday. On my hundredth birthday they gave me  a big party at the Elks Club here in Pryor and people from Tonkawa and  her brother   s kids, and oh just a lot of friends. We had a big blowout on  my hundredth birthday. Her son   s cousin made that hundred   see here it  says a hundred up there. That was on my birthday cake. He made that.  He said,    Well that was the candles.    So he made that for me.  Aunt Nita belongs to all of us just like she is blood kin.  We had a big deal. Then my 101 we had a big steak over at the race  track here over there at Salina Speedway. It was a big deal.  Top of the line steak place in this part of the country.  Can   t go wrong with a good steak   Pardon?  Can   t go   beat a good steak.  19  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Oh no  (Laughter) It   s delicious. Yum, yum. They   re always taking me  out to eat.  What   s a typical day like for you? What time do you get up, what do you  do during the day, and when do you go     You should be proud because at this time I   m usually asleep. (Laughter)  No, I am a night owl. I watch television usually late and then I sleep late,  and I just sleep when I want to, and eat when I want to, and it   s just  doing my thing.  Aunt Nita, did you work a lot of night shifts?  Yeah. All during the war I worked second shift, four to midnight.  Yes, if you had somebody in the hospital, Aunt Nita was always the one  that took the night shift. She could stay awake at     Oh, yeah.     those terrible hours between midnight and six or seven.  I can do that yet. I mean, if it   s a good show on and I just watch it and  then sleep when I want to. (Laughter) But see, I   m so privileged. I don   t  have to do anything I don   t want to do and they don   t make me.  (Laughter) Well, I say they don   t make me. Two years ago, they called  me and said, at Thanksgiving, and said,    Aunt Nita we   re gonna bring  Thanksgiving dinner,    and they did. They brought over the turkey and  the whole bit.  To Tonkawa.  I was living in Tonkawa and at the dinner table somebody said,    We   re  having a family conference.       Oh, what is it?       You   re moving to  Pryor.    (Laughter) I had no idea I was going to move, and they said     Do you remember the conversation that precipitated the discussion about  moving to Pryor? Do you remember what you asked Nick?  No.  Well, you asked him how to connect your freezer and your refrigerator  to the generator if the electric went off.  Oh yes. That   s what started it because always electricity was going off in  Tonkawa and I wanted a generator so I could keep going with the  20  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  electricity in the storms. That   s when they said,    Hey, you   re moving to  Pryor.     Well, I had this vision of this little old lady with a gasoline can making a  generator run.  (Laughs)  No.  Anyway     In what year was that?  We came over here and she and I, in one week, found this house. We  drove up and down the streets and     Umm    let   s see. That was   this is the second year you   ve lived here.  Yes this is      Yeah. It was January. Thanksgiving and then moved in in January.  In  20 13.  Of that year.  I   ve only been over here that long.  January.  But they said,    It   s too far for you to be over there and us to be over  here.    Nobody over there, but just me. So they moved me over here. One  day, I slept over there that night. The next night I slept here. That was  something. (Laughs) So, see I   m spoiled. See I   m privileged.  Along way from Elk City?  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I haven   t been in Elk City in, since I was a little kid.  You didn   t tell them about your uncle. Wasn   t it the uncle that had the  telephone company in his house?  Oh, that was my great-uncle.  Great-uncle, okay. (Laughter)  21  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  He had a telephone company in Canute when you had the telephone,  what do I say, punch boards in his home. He was a telephone operator in  Canute, Oklahoma, years and years ago. I just remembered that. That  was a     Kids ran the     Pardon?  Kids ran the board.  Oh yeah. Well, yeah. When somebody would call up, whoever was there  would answer, you know,    Ring so and so for me. Ring so and so for  me.    (Laughter) That was odd.  That was party line days too, wasn   t it?  Oh my land, yeah. You had to, if somebody was on the line and it was  an emergency you said,    Hey get off the line. They   ve got an  emergency    which they usually did.  You didn   t tell them about your grandmother who tied you on a horse.  What?  Your grandmother that tied you on the horse.  (Laughs) Well, that was when I was a little kid.  Yeah.  My dad   s mother lived around Moorewood. I think there   s a letter from  Moorewood. Did you read that?  Yes, I saw something on that.  Yeah. Okay. I think here   s what it was. We had to drive cattle from one  place to another because of a drought, and I don   t know. We didn   t have  very many, probably fifty. I don   t know how many. I was just a little  kid, and I was spending time with my grandparents. I kept falling off the  horse. She couldn   t leave me. I was too little to stay at home by myself. I  kept falling off the horse so she tied me on the horse. My legs were  about like this (gestures) from the old mare she had. The mare was that  wide. (Gestures). I couldn   t stay on the horse. (Laughter) She tied me on  the horse. She got tired of picking me up, I guess.  22  Bishop  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Well, speaking of the drought and that, how were you impacted, or were  you impacted, by the Great Depression or the Dust Bowl?  I lived in Kansas during the Dust Bowl. I started in Tonkawa and then  the Dust Bowl was in Kansas and that was bad. We used to put, we wet  sheets and put them up to the doors and windows so we could breathe  with some of that dust. It was terrible. I   m glad that   s over. I hope they  learned something about it. My dad, father-in-law, I always called him  Dad, he was a wonderful guy. He had a garage and a filling station and  my husband was working with him during the Dust Bowl days. We lived  with my in-laws. After, of course, the World War broke out, we moved  to Wichita.  What about helping them put in the, wasn   t it the bathroom?  Oh yeah. That was our first bathroom that we had. It was out in after     35,    36, something like that. We plumbed the bathroom. (Laughs) Used  the upstairs closet for the bathroom because the house wasn   t built to  hold a bathroom. (Laughs) We were real proud of that, too. So was my  mother-in-law.  How had you taken a bath prior to that?  Well, in a tub. You come in and we had a big ol    long tub and you take a  bath in it. You heated the water and you poured it in.  How many people all bathed in the same water?  Well, when I was a kid the kids bathed first and then my mama and then  my daddy. He was the last one in the water. (Laughter) I guess the kids  were dirtier because they always got to bathe first.  Was that an everyday thing, or every other day, or once a week?  Well about every other day. Well, we washed every day. You bathed in  a dishpan, not a dishpan, a water pan, but you didn   t have a tub bath  every day, or we didn   t. We didn   t have the water. I mean, when we  lived in Three Sands, the first thing my granddad did was dig a cistern,  then he dug a cellar, then they built the house, (laughs) but then that   s  the only water we had.  Tell them about your grandpa being with you at that time.  Pardon?  23  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Finchum  Bishop  Tell them about your grandpa being with you.  With me?  Yeah, that he moved with you.  Oh yes. When my grandmother died in    36, my granddad lived with us.  Course, he was my dad because my dad was gone most of the time. My  granddad was my dad. He was a wonderful guy, too.  This is the one that lived a long time.  Oh yeah. Ninety, he   d be ninety. He lived with my sister. After my mom  and dad died, he lived with my sister.  Where   s he buried? Where is your granddad buried?  Elk City. Grandmother and Granddad are buried in Elk City.  And his name?  Lacey.  Lacey.  John Lacey. That   s all.  Now you said you went  to church  and everything. How important is  religion or spirituality today at a hundred?  I don   t get to go to church now because of my legs, but it is important. I  study my bible. It   s very important, because the Lord let me live this  long and I   m very thankful.  When did you give up driving?  Driving?  Yep. When did you     Driving? I haven   t given up driving.  Okay. Bad question then.

Well, I drive first one then the other, because I have to keep the batteries  up. (Laughter) But the kids usually drive for me. They don   t let   I have  to sneak out to drive. (Laughter)  At night?  I never drive at night. I haven   t driven at night in a long time.  Well, but I was thinking if you   re a night owl and you sneak out, it   s got  to be at night.  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.  They   ll be asleep.  Oh, no I don   t drive at night. That   s one thing I don   t do. I don   t     Oh, she tells us. I went to here, I went here, I went there, I did this, and I  did that.  Oh yeah. I do     In case she has to go to grocery store and we   re not.  Of course I do.

I don   t watch a sex pit.  (Laughter) I think that   s silly, and if you   re not careful you have bad  language, and I don   t like the language. So that   s it.  She knows how to turn it off, I think. Or turn to a different channel.  Are there a couple of historical events that stand out in your mind?  When President Kennedy was killed. When Will Rogers died, was  killed. I guess it   s nothing much other than that historically. Of course  the war, that was everyday living, too.  Do you remember voting for the first time?  Not the first time, but I voted through the years. I don   t remember the  first time. It seems to me like it was for Roosevelt. I   m not sure. I don   t  know who it was.  Did anyone in your family do WPA work?  WPA? No.  CCC or WPA?  No.  Did you ever have traveling salesman come through?  Pardon?  Traveling salesman?

Do you have any     I don   t have any motto, that I know of. (Laughter) Philosophy is,    Just  do the best you can with what you got.    All I know about     How about,    Use it up, wear it out, make do, or do without   ? (Laughter)  That   s a good deal  (Laughter)  When history is written what do you want it to say about you?  26  LaMunyon  Bishop  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  Mique  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  Finchum  LaMunyon  Mique  LaMunyon  I don   t care what you say about me. (Laughter) I   m not interested in me.  How do you want to be remembered?  Just like she said,    Use it up and        What did you say? (Laughs)  Oh gosh.  I   m don   t really don   t care. I don   t even think about that, being  remembered. I don   t care whether they remember me or not. Surely they  will because,    Look, a hundred. Well Aunt Nita lived to be hundred.
