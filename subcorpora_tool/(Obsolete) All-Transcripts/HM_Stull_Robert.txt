Speaker 1: Do you have a, a favorite saying or phrase that you use on a daily basis or with friends or something that's--guides your day-to-day philosophy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of corny, but I sort of--I don't know if I created it, but I, I like to sort of live by "never a person any reason to deny you anything", which kind of means you constantly have to stay on top of your game, you know.  Sort of like, sort of like a rallying cry, you know.
Story_ID: 19884
Speaker 1: We're going to start with your family history so that the people who look at this oral history that you're gonna provide for us will have some kind of a background and context in which to look at your development and your career and so on.  And we're gonna start with your mother.  Would you tell me your mother's name and when she was born and where she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Patricia Ryder.  She was born in Columbus, Ohio, 1938.
Speaker 1: Okay, and could you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: R-Y-D-E-R.
Speaker 1: And she was born in Columbus, Ohio, and where did she grow up, where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Columbus.
Speaker 1: In Columbus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of my family's from there.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background before you were born?
Speaker 2: She had a pretty crazy relationship with her older brother.  They were constantly at each other, fighting all the time.  But that, I, I think she's very--she helped out a lot because my grandmother was sort of had to raise the kids by herself, so she helped a lot around the house.
Speaker 1: You mean your mother's brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were only two, my, my uncle, who's now deceased, and my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there was no father.  So, well, there was no father for much of the time.  And, and she helped out a lot, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about her schooling, her elementary, high school?  Did she--you much about her schooling in Columbus?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she went to--there's a main strip on, in the area that they grew up in, my father too, called Broad Street, Broad, Broad and High.  So if you come to Columbus, that's all Columbus is, it's Broad and High.  So whatever you're looking for, it's either on Broad or High.  So they went to East Broad High School.
Speaker 1: East Broad High.
Speaker 2: I believe so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she--has she shared with you stories about her growing up years at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from time to time.  I really have to, really go way back in my memory to try and remember some of 'em, but I know that I have two sisters.  And my younger sister, me and her used to go at it all the time, when we were growing up.  So she would kind of share with me similarities that she had with my uncle.  My uncle was a little older than she was.  So kind of to, you know, to try and discourage us from, you know, being so yan, yan, yan (ph.), she, she would kind of tell us stories.
Speaker 1: You said that your mother was a helpful person.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How else would you describe her personality?
Speaker 2: She's very nurturing.
Speaker 1: Very nurturing.
Speaker 2: Very kind, very warm.  She, she's an inspiration to me in a lot of way.  I, I take a lot from her, you know, various personality traits, I would say.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: I think I get a nice balance from both parents, but what I get from my mother is very nonjudgmental, you know, sort of the ability to kind of see the good within people, give people a chance.  But then that's countered by a lot of stuff that I get from my pop, where, you know, not being so quick to trust people, and, you know, never taking things at face value and really always investigating and trying to, to sort of dissect and really get into the, to the core of, of any given situation or scenario.
Speaker 1: Now, your mother still living?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where is she now?  Where does she live?
Speaker 2: She's still in Columbus.
Speaker 1: She's in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 2: She was in Boston for a while, you know, I mean they, they--most of my family is from Columbus, Ohio.  And my father moved here to Massachusetts when he started his business.  And then when they later separated, she went back home to kind of take care of her (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: So how old were you when you came to Boston?
Speaker 2: No, I was born here.
Speaker 1: That's right, you were born here, I'm sorry.  You were born in 1967.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they, they moved to Boston and started the family.
Story_ID: 19885
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father, his name, when he was born and where he was born?
Speaker 2: Donald Leroy Stull.  You want me to spell that too.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He was born in 1937 in Ohio.
Speaker 1: In Columbus?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did he grow up?
Speaker 2: Columbus.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about his growing up years?  What has he shared with you about his growing up years before you were born?
Speaker 2: Not much.  Me and--me and my pop are kind of quiet guys.  I think as I got older, I became more intrigued and curious about the kind of life that he had since my folks separated when I was young.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Maybe eight.  It didn't really affect me though, not like I, not like you hear it affects most kids at that age.  It really bothered my older sister.  But he, I, I found that, because I spent most of my, my adolescent years being raised by my mother, so I got to that point in my life where I really wanted to know who my father was.  And I didn't have the, the, the burden of him being in another state or being very far away.  He was a train ride away.  He was a phone call away.  So I kind of took it upon myself, it was about the first year in high school, where I, I kind of pursued a relationship with him.
Story_ID: 19886
Speaker 1: You, you grew up where?  You grew up back in--?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in Brook--here in Boston, in Brookline [Massachusetts], but when they had separated, everybody still stayed here.
Speaker 1: Oh, I see, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was just with one parent, and then he was over here doing his thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, you mentioned an older sister, her name?
Speaker 2: Cydney, Cydney Lynn Stull, no Gareito (ph.).  That's her, her married name.
Speaker 1: All right, and now, how old is she?  When was she born?
Speaker 2: She's, she was born in 1960.  She's forty-four.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960], okay.  And you have another sister, a second one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, younger sister.
Speaker 1: She's younger, born when?
Speaker 2: I, in, born in 1971.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Gia Virginia Stull.
Speaker 1: Okay, Gia Virginia, how do you spell Gia?
Speaker 2: G-I-A.
Speaker 1: G-I-A, okay.  And Cydney?
Speaker 2: C-Y-D-N-E-Y.
Story_ID: 19887
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: In a word, can I use--?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: I have to use a few words.  He's quiet, serious, very serious.  (pause)
Speaker 1: Did you say, did he, I think I may have asked you this, but did he ask--did he tell you much about his growing up years at all or stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Not, not much.  I mean, I, I guess I was getting around to answering that and kind of got sidetracked.  When I got a little older, I started asking him, and then he would share, maybe about eleven, twelve or early teens.  And he was, all of, all of his siblings, my aunt and his older brother, they, they're very career-minded.  They grew up poor.  My grandmother on his side of the family, from the South, and, you know, he--you hear the stories about how people grow up.  I mean they had, they did their own thing.  They had their own businesses, but they were very, very humble, you know, but they were proud people.  And they, I, I think one of the stories he told me was that my grandmother had a restaurant way back in the day.  And, you know, she, she sort of did a whole lot of things, you know, to, to take care of the family.  And I think all of the siblings knew at a early age that they needed to do something significant with their lives.  My uncle on my father's side who's also deceased, he, he was the dean of the art department at Ohio State University.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Robert Stull, Robert J., but he's my namesake.  I was named after him.
Story_ID: 19888
Speaker 1: Now, you knew your father's mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She's still alive, right?  And her name?
Speaker 2: Ruth Branson.
Speaker 1: And what stories has she told you about the family?
Speaker 2: She's the storyteller.
Speaker 1: Now, (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's, she's a riot, man.
Speaker 1: What has she told you that sticks in your mind?
Speaker 2: It just, you know the kind of stories that, that your parents might tell you are kind of edited, you know, all of the little embarrassing stuff is kind of taken out.  But then, but then, you know, the mom, that's, that's kind of the parents' job, of kind putting the kid on the spot.  And, and it happens to me in, and all of my brothers and sisters all the time too.  So, she, she would tell me little, little silly things like, you know, what they did when they were kids, like sports that they would play, and, and I think--I don't know if she said my uncle or my father was the prankster, always playing jokes.  And, but it's, I really can't, can't really remember anything specific.  But she would always, not, not in a malicious way, but always sort of poked fun at people.  You know, when I was little, I didn't like it.  You know, I would come to visit, and, and she would always say something that would, that would embarrass me, you know, like when I was--I, I, I think I went through a growth spurt when I was really young.  I was really tall and skinny.  And she, she said she was watching me sleep one time, and my feet were hanging over the end of the bed or the edge of the bed, but she would say in such a way where, you know, it was comical.  It had a whole lot of humor to it, you know, and, you know, they, they pick those times where everybody's around, like the whole family's present.  And, you know, as a kid, you know, you don't really quite know how to take that.  But as you grow up, you, you really appreciate it, you know.  But she--.
Speaker 1: But tell me about your mother's mother, your other grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Virginia Ryder.
Speaker 1: And--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, sim-similar, you know, the family backgrounds are, are really similar, both families.
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: When I think of my grandmother, we just call her Nana all the time, she, I just remember her constantly moving.  I had great grandparents, and they were up in age, and she was taking care of 'em.  So we kind of, as kids, saw at an early age, the importance of a solid family structure.
Speaker 1: Of a what?
Speaker 2: A solid family structure.  And I saw, and, and kind of processed it in my own way, how my mother, when my grandmother got, started getting up in age, she's eighty-seven now, felt the need to go back home, not necessarily to take care of her, but to, to be close to her.  And she did the same thing for her parents, my grandmother, Nana.  So when I was young, we would, we would visit them, me and my, and my younger sister--my older sister, but, you know, as, as she got older, it was more me and my younger sister.  We would take trips to visit, and she had a system, man.  I mean she would get us up, and we would all eat breakfast together, and we would all participate in the chores.  We would do laundry, we would do yard work.  We would clean.  We would, you know--and they both, my Nana and my mother instilled those values in us, me and my sisters, at a very early age.  We, we had to know how to do basic things, like sew.  If your button popped off your shirt, you have to know how to, to fix that and basic meals, cooking, household chores.  You know, we all had a day of the week where we had to cook something.  It didn't always--.
Speaker 1: What'd you cook?
Speaker 2: --taste that good, but--.
Speaker 1: What, what did you cook (laughter)?
Speaker 2: She, she taught us basic things like, like BLT sandwiches or pancakes.  And then she would help us if we wanted to learn or know more.  And I think my oldest sister kind of developed a knack for it.  Ah, I like cooking now, but at the time I didn't really, it didn't really jibe with me too well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did your great grandparents on your mother's side, did, did you know them?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  Where did they live?
Speaker 2: Columbus, Ohio.  Yeah, they're John Copeland and Fannie Copeland.
Speaker 1: Okay, did they share stories with you about their lives growing up?
Speaker 2: Not much.
Speaker 1: Not much.
Speaker 2: I was very young, very young.  When my grandfather, my grandfather, my great grandfather was really ailing and getting up in age, he would sit in the corner and just talk.  And my mother, when she would visit--now, this is when we were all here in Boston, and we would go to Columbus summer times to visit.  He would--she would ask him certain questions, my mother.  And then he would go way back and just start telling stories.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the stories?
Speaker 2: Just random stories.  She would tell me what she was doing, and it was such great information that she started taping him.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have those tapes today?
Speaker 2: Ah, no--- Now, she, she might have them kicking around somewhere, but, but my mother was really great for that.  I mean she, she would document everything, especially when we were kids, like every little drawing that I did, she would save and date.  And if there was a, a situation or, or a circumstance behind the drawing that inspiring the drawing, she would write it down.  And, and she presented me on one of my birthdays a few years ago with this big portfolio of all these things that I did from the time I was in kindergarten all the way up until maybe high school.
Speaker 1: When did you first start to, to draw or to paint or whatever?
Speaker 2: As far back as I can remember, I was always drawing something.
Speaker 1: How far back can you go, you remember doing something?
Speaker 2: As soon as I could walk.
Speaker 1: Before kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah, easily, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna come back to your (unclear) as an artist--.
Speaker 2: But the thing about my grandfather, you know, I just wanted to finish up about that--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 2: --he, he never really shared stuff with us.  I mean he was sort like, and the times were different back then, you know, and he, he was more providing for the family and doing what he had to do to keep things going.  But he was a jolly guy, I mean he had a big gut and bald head, (cough), excuse me, a bald head, and he loved to cook, good cook too.  I think, I think he used to--I have to ask my father, but I think he used to cook, he was a professional cook at one time for I think--.
Speaker 1: How was his chicken?
Speaker 2: Ah, man, fried chicken like nobody's business, man, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's why you like chicken today?
Speaker 2: Chicken, maybe, maybe.  I think he had something to do with it, but he, he'd do this chicken-fried steak.  I don't know if you're familiar with, where you, you make a batter for it like you would fried chicken, and then you, you'd fry the--I mean coronary on a plate probably, but, but back then, oh, man, it was good.  It tasted like steak, but how you know chicken to taste too, so.  But he, he was the one with all the stories and, and my mother was really fascinated, you know, as he got up in age, just before he, he passed.
Story_ID: 19889
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories, your farthest back memories that you have of growing up here in Boston [Massachusetts]?  You were born here.  What's your earliest memory of, as a child?
Speaker 2: Just anything?  Just, I have a good friend of mine who's the son of my father's business partner.  And when we live in Brookline [Massachusetts], we lived in adjoining houses.  It was two different houses, but they were connected and split right down the middle.  And much of my childhood memories are with him, his family and neighborhood kids.
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: Aaron Lee.
Speaker 1: Aaron Lee.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you lived in Brookline then, as a youngster?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you were born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, well, those are my--.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you knew Aaron Lee?  (Unclear) kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten, yeah, we go back that far.  But there were other neighborhood kids, and we all stay in contact to this day.  You know, we did little, little crazy things.  I mean we were all into art.  Aaron, his nickname is Teo, so I'd rather call him Teo.  But he--.
Speaker 1: How, how do you spell that?  T-I--?
Speaker 2: T-E-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he, he shared the same kind of passion that I did in art.  When we were in, in kindergarten and third grade, we would make own comic books.  And, but we also liked sports.  You know, I leaned more toward the art side, but I still did the sports, probably more out of peer pressure than anything else, cause I was a real shy and quiet and introverted kind of kid when I was growing up.  But the neighborhood kids, that's what they did.  And, and we had our own little baseball leagues and football leagues.  We had a big park right down, the end of the street.
Story_ID: 19890
Speaker 1: What part of Brookline [Massachusetts] did you live in?  What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: Waverly Street.
Speaker 1: Waverly Street?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What number?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight.
Speaker 1: 48 Waverly?
Speaker 2: Forty-eight, I believe, yeah.  And they lived at fifty.
Speaker 1: You what?
Speaker 2: They lived on fifty, and we lived on forty-eight cause the numbers go--.
Speaker 1: Was this close to the Boston [Massachusetts] side of Brookline or was it?
Speaker 2: (unclear) Brookline is a little small town, and so Boston is, is like right there.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me a little bit about your--you've told me about your playmates and your close friends and so on, tell me just a little bit about the neighborhood in which you grew up and what was it like around your home and around the immediate area?
Speaker 2: It's very diverse, like a lot of different nationalities of kids.  You know, we had--there were, one, it was another black family that lived on the same street in addition to us and the Lee's.  And, I think there was an Asian family.  It, it was cool.  It was--I didn't have a traumatic childhood, not, not at all, you know.  Growing up was pretty, was pretty fun, yeah.
Story_ID: 19891
Speaker 1: What school did you first attend?
Speaker 2: Pierce [Elementary] School [Brookline, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Pierce School?
Speaker 2: In Brookline, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your early schooling, and do you remember entering that school as a kindergartener?  What was school like for you at Pierce?  How do you remember it?
Speaker 2: I was very quiet when I was a kid.  And, but I was always drawing, and that was sort of like my tool to, to sort of socialize and, and communicate with people, you know.  I didn't have that sort of outgoing personality.  I was very withdrawn and very shy and very quiet.  So I, when my parents look at me back then and see the kind of person now, that I, that I am now--I mean not, not that I'm a showboat or a loud mouth, but, but I broke out of that, I would say in my first few years of high school, and maybe about sophomore year in high school, I broke out of that.
Speaker 1: But going back to your elementary ages, and you were doing a lot of drawing, who you--who were you drawing for at that point?
Speaker 2: I'd have to say myself, yeah.  I mean that's, that's how I--now, I, I don't know what I would have done if I couldn't find a pencil or a crayon or something and, and just be doodling.  I mean I, I've got several early examples I can show later, where, I mean, I would turn in little papers.  You know how they give you little assignments when you're a kid, you know, and you, you have to--there's no illustration or drawing required in the assignment.  It's just a writing assignment, and there would doodles and drawings all over it.  You know, I'd had, had just always had to be drawing.
Speaker 1: Did you like school, elementary school?
Speaker 2: For the most part.  I mean, like I said before, I mean I was, I was a real quiet kid so the only bad memories I have of school was, maybe not being able to, to relate with a lot of the other kids because I was so shy and so quiet, and not being able to do a lot of the things that sort of came natural, or seemed like they would be natural for, for a young child to, to be experiencing, and I really kept to myself.
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time drawing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were in school five hours a day.  And you had your playmates that you associated with.  What else did you do out of doors?  Did you do anything out of doors besides sports or anything?
Speaker 2: That's, that's really about it.  I mean we, we clowned around in the neighborhood, you know.  We, I think kids still do it today, you know, but my girlfriend has two children, and, you know, they have play time at so and so's house.  And they have their best friends and their buddies and it kind of reminds me of the same kind of things I was doing at their age.  So we--.
Story_ID: 19892
Speaker 1: At the Pierce Elementary School [Brookline, Massachusetts], did you have formal, regular art classes or art education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we had--it's so sad, man, cause now a days with all of these budget cuts, you know, with all the things going on in the world, a lot of the things that we kind of took for granted as kids, just aren't available to children now-a-days.  Like we had P.E., you know, gym on a regular basis, you know, if not every day, every other day.  We had art, if not every day, every other day, wood shop.
Speaker 1: Was the art instruction that you had a Pierce, did it aid and further develop and help you or was that a hindrance?
Speaker 2: No, it, it was definitely an aid.  I think the, the plus that I had as a kid growing up, that had an obvious ability, I think I was very fortunate to be in the company of caring faculty and teachers, and, and really kind and nurturing people that, that could see something or see ability in a child and help them nurture it and help them develop it.  And that's, I think that's what I got pretty much everywhere I went with the art.  So I got it, yeah, I got it at Pierce, it--early on, it was at Pierce, yeah.
Story_ID: 19893
Speaker 1: Now, what was your father [Donald] doing professionally at this point, as you are five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten years of age?  What was your father doing?
Speaker 2: He was busting him hump, man.  He was, he started his firm, I think he was twenty-six.
Speaker 1: What firm?  What did, what was his profession?
Speaker 2: He's an architect.  He was Stull Associates back then.  But he didn't, he didn't just at twenty-six--wait, he, he worked for people, other people in the Boston [Massachusetts.]  I can't remember the names of those companies back then.  But--.
Speaker 1: But he was an architect?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did his profession, did his work influence you in any way in terms of your interest in art and drawing?  IS there any connec-- (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, from, from, from the standpoint of, of--of just seeing him constantly drawing and constantly working on, on, on projects.  And he was, he was always busy and, and I know I, I've adopted all of that from him.
Speaker 1: Was he designing and drawing and sketching--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at home or at the office or both?
Speaker 2: Well, home was the office.  So--.
Speaker 1: So you saw this going on right in your home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's how we grew up.  I mean in the very beginning, and I don't really have, really solid memories, they had a--cause we all grew up here in this house.  We, they, they had, the location of the firm wasn't in the house.  It was off of Huntington Avenue, I think.  And, and soft of like a lofty warehouse kind of, kind of atmosphere.  And I, I have some memories of that place.  I think the, the biggest memory I have or the clearest memory I have, they had a big orange tree in the middle of wherever it was, right next to the staircase.  And I, that's what I associate with that place, that big--maybe it wasn't an orange tree.  It was a big tree right in the middle.  And, and home was the office later, you know.  He moved everything over here to Marlboro Street [Boston, Massachusetts].  So we probably lived on the top floor or the top two floors, and at every other place in the--.
Story_ID: 19894
Speaker 1: And then what was the next step in terms of your education?  Where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: Went to Brookline High School [Brookline, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: And what was that experience like, Brookline High?
Speaker 2: It was, it was okay.  It was okay.  It was, it was a rough going at first because I was still, you know, in that shyness mode.  So, but once I broke out of that, it, it was kind of cool.  You know, I mean I, I still sort of feel back on my art.  That's kind of how I met girls.  If I thought somebody was kind of cute, I'd draw her picture.  And I'd give her the picture, and then go to like high school reunions and stuff like that and somebody'll come up to you and say, you drew me this picture when you were (unclear), yeah.  I don't even remember (laughs).  But that's how I did my thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Looking at your family life during elementary school and then moving into high school, what sights, sounds or smells remind you of your growing up years?
Speaker 2: I think that smell that you get, like around autumn time, that kind--it's hard to explain, that crisp smell that you get.  I think like when the leaves are turning and falling off the trees or like hazy summer.  And I have crazy hay fever and allergy problems, have had 'em all my life ever since I was a kid.  But that--not, not hot, humid and sticky, but just a nice summer day.  Those kind of smells bring me back, that feeling that you get.  You know, I, I kind of like those times of the years, autumn and, and summer, yeah.  I don't mind winter.  I, I like getting bundled up, but I could care less--I've had it with all of this snow.  Snow's only fun when you're a kid, and you don't have to go to school.
Speaker 1: Any sounds or special sights that--I remember you talked about the, maybe the orange tree that was in your father's warehouse studio firm, as a sight, as imprinted on your mind.  Any other special sights or sounds that, that take you back to your childhood growing up years?
Speaker 2: I, I guess if I'm in the neighborhood, the old neighborhoods, you know, and, and seeing how things have kind of changed, but still look really familiar, but specific (unclear) I would say.
Speaker 1: In your family here and in Brookline, were there special holidays or family events or traditions that you and your family experienced together growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we liked Christmastime.  That was a special time.  Well, they made it special, my parents made it special for us.
Speaker 1: What did they do?
Speaker 2: My father would really get into it.  I think he--I mean he worked so hard all the time, you know, just, just taking care of us, that he really enjoyed seeing us happy.  And, and he would do--I, I remember, this is, this is going back.  I mean this is dating everybody cause we're all getting older.  We--this is before VCR's and DVD players and all of that, he brought a projector for the family so we could watch our own eight, Super 8 movies.  And I think Mighty Mouse, if you can remember Mighty Mouse was really popular back then.  Well, Mighty Mouse was old, but you know, you, with, with TV and, and syndication, you know, you get all of those old classics.  So he would buy some of the original, some of the original cartoon shorts.  And I was sleeping on Christmas Eve, and he couldn't get it right.  So I was, I wasn't sure if, you know when you, sort of in a dream state, you don't know if it's, you're hearing actually or if you're, if it's something that you're dreaming.  But I, he couldn't get it right, and it was so loud.  And it was waking up the whole house, but nobody went downstairs.  But I heard it.  And I didn't put it together, but what he was trying to do is rig it so that when we came down in the morning, the movie would be playing and we'd go, oh, wow, Mighty Mouse, you know.  So that's, that's, that's a real clear memory that I had, you know, just, just sort of--he takes on this role of, you know, the man, you know, where, where, if he doesn't know how to fix it, he'll figure out how to fix it, you know.  So, Christmastime was a special time.  He, he would do things like that, maybe go out of his way.
Speaker 1: In addition to raising you and your sisters, your mother, was she working or what did she do in her leisure time, what did she like to do?
Speaker 2: She worked too.  She, she pretty much held secretarial-type jobs.
Story_ID: 19895
Speaker 1: Well, when you got to Brookline High School [Brookline, Massachusetts], tell me about the art program there.  Was that a big asset for you, the art program there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  The--I had two teachers, Ms.--no, I had three teachers.  My first teacher was Mr. Lamb, character, boy; little short guy, had a little pot belly, and he, he almost kind of looked like one of the elves cause he, he had a little bit of hair running down the middle, and his hair receded all the way back, and a little poof right in the middle.  And he would curl his mustache on the ends.  And he had these little spectacles.  And, man, if he wasn't an art teacher, he'd be a real good candidate for one, man.  He had all kind of character with him, but real intense guy.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: He taught art.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So he, he was one of those, remember when I was talking to you earlier about, you know, being fortunate to be in the company and presence of, of faculty that really cared.  He, he was one of those, those teachers that would, would see ability in a student and really want to help them nurture it.  And if you expressed an interest in having a career in the arts, then they would really work hard to try and steer you in the right direction.  He was one when I first got there, and as I was leaving, Ms. Osna Sens.  It's S-E-N-S, I think is how you spell her last name.  And, boy, she was on me all the time because I, I became a bit of a slacker.  You know, I, I discovered hip hop and break dancing and graffiti so it was more appealing to me to be spinning on my head, you know, in the gymnasium than being up in the art room.  But that's what they did, you know, if you showed particular pro--prominence or, or ability, like in sports or something.  You know, the, the faculty would try and help you push that, and, and realize it.  And that's what she did with me.  You know, I was sort like one of those special kids that, you know, I--open door to the art room all the time.  I had, you know, different projects than the regular class.  And they put like a lot of--I don't know what the word is, I'm, I'm looking for, not pressure, but sort of like, you know, when you grow up and there's certain functions that high schools have or, or schools have that require art.  And the kid that's real good at art does it.  It was those kinds of things.  And I would neglect that stuff to go hang out with my buddies and, you know, do graffiti and break dance, and essentially, waste time.  I don't want to say waste time because that, that formed a lot of my, my character as well.  But she knew where I was all the time, and she was like, the next best thing to a mother, cause she would find me when I was supposed to be in the art studio.  And almost like those, those cartoons, where they grab you by your ear, and she, she, she would come into the gymnasium or wherever I would be.  And I remember there was a gym, that we had two gyms.  And there was a new gym and an old gym.  The old gym is where the basketball games were played.  And then the new gym, it's sort of like swimming and gymnastics and stuff like that.  But we liked to, to dance in the lobby of the new gym because the, the, the tile or the marble was really slick.  So you could spin faster.  She'd come in and open that door, and she'd say, "Robbie Stull, get in that art room."  I mean I'd be like, oh, man, right, like your mother, you know what I mean, you know, come on, ma, you know.  And she would always catch me, man.
Speaker 1: You said there were three teachers.  Was there a third person who was influential in your--.
Speaker 2: Not, not in high school, but there was in Pierce School.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It was a black teacher by the name of Mr. Rose.
Speaker 1: Rose?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I don't know his first name, but he, he was a big help and a big influential.
Speaker 1: It wasn't Steven Rose, was it?
Speaker 2: It could be, could be.  I just know his last name was Mr. Rose.  And there was a teacher before him that I, that I can't remember.  I don't have a memory of, but he came in after.  He was sort of like the new guy.  And a lot of people didn't really care for him.
Speaker 1: Was he black also?
Speaker 2: No, the first one wasn't.  He came in after.
Speaker 1: Was Rose black?
Speaker 2: Rose was black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came in after the regular guy, who left, and I can't remember that person's name.  But he, he took a shine to me, and, and really made sure that I was doing what I needed to be doing.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any art classes or instruction outside of school, while you were in elementary school or in high school?  Did you go to any art schools or art classes?
Speaker 2: While I was in high school?
Speaker 1: And elementary school, yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't have any after-school art or Saturday art?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know, like a lot of youngsters will take music lessons or swimming lessons or boy scouts, (did you do any of that?)
Speaker 2: I did sports.  Like I did little league, you know, triple A baseball and Pop Warner football and all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but no, no, no outside art instruction?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, were you a good student--outside of the art, were you a good student?  Or what kind of student--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I was, like again, that, hip hop, boy.  When hip hop came into my life and then, you know, I went probably an A and B student--and I didn't fail anything.  Let me not lie, I might have failed a couple of classes, but, yeah, I, I came, I entered into high school--I never did good at, at math.  I was never a really good math student.  But I, I--I did good in all my other courses, pretty straight A's and B's.
Story_ID: 19896
Speaker 1: Now, while you were living in Brookline [Massachusetts] and attending Brookline High School, did you come into the city of Boston [Massachusetts] at all for anything?  Did you come into the city?
Speaker 2: While I was in high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had girlfriends that lived in, you know, places like Roxbury, Mattapan  and stuff like that.  So it, it seemed like a lot of my friends were METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity Inc., Boston's voluntay busing program] students so, you know, they were from the city.
Speaker 1: What do you mean met, what is met, what do you mean METCO students?
Speaker 2: Met--the, the busing program.
Speaker 1: What was that?
Speaker 2: That's, well, I don't want to say it wrong.  But they, they were kids from inner cities that would come into the high schools, the suburban high schools through a program.
Speaker 1: And it was known as?
Speaker 2: It was known as METCO, yeah.  And like a bunch of my buddies lived in, in Brookline like I did, but a lot of them didn't.  And, and, and that's, that's how they--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Metco stood for the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity.  That's where Metco came from, I believe.  All right.  So you had girlfriends in the city, and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I had a girlfriend that lived in, in Mattapan, so it was a big trek for me to go see her.  She was right off from American Legion Highway.  So I had to take, coming from Brookline, if you can imagine, that's, that's a, that's a distance, and get on a couple of different trains and a few buses.  And then I had to walk from Mattapan Square all the way up American Legion Highway to, to go see her.
Story_ID: 19897
Speaker 1: You graduated from Brookline High School [Brookline,Massachusetts] in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty-five [1985].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-five?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did you do that summer after you graduated from Brookline High?
Speaker 2: I knew I wanted to do art, so my professors at high school, or my art instructors at high school kind of recommended the direction that I should take.  Osna Sens, who I mentioned before, she--.
Speaker 1: Would you spell--did you spell her name for me?  Did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think S-E-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think you did.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: She suggested that I go into graphic design and advertising, things like that, if I wanted a career in the arts as, as opposed to just being a painter, and, you know, just waiting for my big break or just having various gallery shows or whatever.  She wanted me to understand this, the importance of trying to make a living with your talent, if that's what you so choose to do.  So I kind of had it engrained in, in my subconscious that I need to make money doing what I do.  And, you know, my, my parents helped reinforce that, obviously, but she was really instrumental in, in getting me to understand the importance of, of trying to make a living in doing something that, that a lot of people can see and experience and, and enjoy, you know, the importance of getting yourself out there so, so that everybody can, you know--not, not just your immediate peer group, but, but everybody can, can see you.  And, and, yeah, so I knew I wanted to go to art school before I graduated.  So just prior to graduating, I was taking maybe summer courses to sort of prepare me.
Speaker 1: Where did you take those courses?
Speaker 2: At the Museum School [School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Massachusetts], that's where I went.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you--do you think you were when you made a decision or knew that you wanted to be an artist?  I mean how far back did that go?  Do you--?
Speaker 2: Like I said before and probably--it, it just happened.  It was just such a natural thing for me, you know, it was--.
Speaker 1: At what age, at what age?  How early?
Speaker 2: Kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Kindergarten?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, of course, I didn't know, okay, one day I'm gonna be a famous when I'm like two years old, but I, I knew that this is what I'm gonna do.  It, it--as crazy as that sounds, I, I kind of knew that that was what my path was gonna be, and, and the older I got, then I started putting things together, and people started explaining things to me, and helping me make sense out of what I do, all these doodles and all these drawings I'm constantly doing.  So.
Story_ID: 19898
Speaker 1: Did you enter any art contests or exhibits or competitions when you were in elementary or high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, high school I did, the Scholastic Art Awards, I, I won some of those.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about that.
Speaker 2: Those, those are, again, the teachers, you know, they, they have all of this information.  And they submit a certain number of students, ballots for consideration.  And, and it's judged city-wide.  And you get accepted and then you get judged and you get gold keys, blue ribbons, whatever.  I, I think I got--I don't remember the exact number, but my art instructors in high school would always enter me into them.  It was just, you know, they didn't even question it.
Speaker 1: Now, how many prizes did you win?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I had, man, off the top of my head, I might have gotten maybe three gold keys, never got any blue ribbons.  But I, I got some gold keys.
Story_ID: 19899
Speaker 1: What were you drawing at that point in time?  What was the content of your illustrations?  Was it very diverse and eclectic or were you always concentrating on certain types of images and content?  Do you recall?  What was--?
Speaker 2: It was very specific.  I was fascinated by animation in cartoon.
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I grew up on stuff like the "Flintstones" and "Jetsons" and the old Warner Brothers cartoons, you know.  I loved the Warner Brothers cartoons, the [Wile E.] Coyote and the Roadrunner, Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, much more so than, than the Disney cartoons.  I think my appreciation shifted to Disney when I got a little older.  But the stuff I liked, man, "Tom and Jerry" and "Woody Woodpecker", and "Mighty Mouse", things like that.  So I--what I was drawing as a kid was always derived from images I would see on TV, "Speed Racer", "Hong Kong Phooey", just, just all kinds of--like sixties, Hanna Barbera, Warner Brothers, that's, that's what I would draw.
Speaker 1: I see.  Now, at Brookline High School [Brookline, Massachusetts], you had an art room and art studio, you had materials supplied to you--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you did a lot of work in school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Where else did you do your art work outside of school?
Speaker 2: At home.  At home, my, my, sort of taste shifted when I went to high school.  I had instructors encouraging me to go different places where the--like I would do still life's and portraits.  And I was drawing with a great degree of realism.  And then that became sort of important to me, and then I got turned on by painters like Layendecker, who used to paint the 'Saturday Evening Post' covers.
Speaker 1: The name again?
Speaker 2: Layendecker.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: J--J.C., Layendecker, L-A-Y-E-N-D-E-C-K-E-R, maybe.  But he, he inspired Norman Rockwell.  And back in the twenties [1920], in the early 1900s, artists, commercial artists were sort of revered as movie stars.  And they spawned a whole bunch of admirers like, like, like--I don't know who some old, old actors, Clark Gable or, or whatever, you know.  And you'd see them at the movie premiers and everybody would try and grab their autographs, and ooh, ooh, ooh, but it was the same thing if you were an artist and wanted to do the same kind of thing, then, then they had the same kind of importance.  And old stories, cause I, I love Laydendecker.  As a matter of fact, my uncle on my mother's side, he, he gave me, one year for my birthday, an old "Post" cover, Layendecker "Post" cover.  And he explained to me the whole thing about how Norman Rockwell was inspired by him.  And his stuff, I could see there was more of a cartoonie side to his art, and we all know Norman Rockwell as being a super realist.  So I thought it was interesting how he became such, the kind of painter that, that he became, Norman Rockwell, and was inspired by this guy, who's style is, I mean it's relevant today.  So many of my buddies in the comic book industry borrow from him, are influenced by him, not only me.  So, so my uncle would tell me stories about how Norman Rockwell would know the number and the time of the train that Layendecker would take from a suburb of New York City [New York] into town to deliver to his publishers and his editors.  And he would hang out by the train just to get a glimpse of his idol, as he was going to and fro the city.  And, and just say, oh, wow, and then go back to his buddies who were all little art nerds, and say, well, I saw him, I saw him today.  I saw him.  And he was wearing this kind of suit and all of this stuff.  So I, I thought that was really cool.  I thought that was really cool.  And, and the same year that he gave me that Layendecker cover, he gave me a, a Rockwell cover.  And they were framed in the same frame, the, the two covers together so that he could--it was his explanation to me that this guy was inspired by--(simultaneously).
Story_ID: 19900
Speaker 1: Did you have a special place in your home in Brookline [Massachusetts] where you did your art work?
Speaker 2: Not a special place, my room.
Speaker 1: In your, just in your room?
Speaker 2: But I, you know, my parents, they, they outfitted me with a, a drafting table at a young age.  So they, they made sure I had all the, the tools that I needed.  And I guess like, like any, any parent would that kind of sees something, you know, you kind of want to give it that break-in period to see if it's just a fad or a passing fancy.  And if it hangs around, then you, you help the kid develop it.  So that's what my folks did.  So I was just like any other kid.  I was all over the place.  And one minute I wanted to be a basketball star.  The next minute I wanted to be a football star, you know, and the art stuck.
Story_ID: 19901
Speaker 1: So you enter the School of the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts] in September of 1985, is that correct?
Speaker 2: More or less, I, I--no, it wasn't right after high school.  It wasn't right after high school.
Speaker 1: So what did you do right after high school?
Speaker 2: I, I did some, some part-time courses at Museum School, and then I entered maybe, eighty--'86 [1986] maybe.  It was close enough after high school, but not directly after high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a year in between, roughly, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I, I did some odd jobs.  You know, I was a go-for my father's company.
Speaker 1: To make you some money?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, you entered the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, tell me about that experience?  How many years were you there?
Speaker 2: Five years.  It was cool.  It was cool.
Speaker 1: And was that full time--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the five years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, well, part time, one year, and then for four full years, full time, four years.  It was, it was good.  The structure wasn't, because it was a private school.  You see a lot of kids coming in that really didn't really have any business being there, didn't really want to be there, like their parents needed to keep them busy or something or, or give them something to do so that they'd just--(tape stops)
Story_ID: 19902
Speaker 1: What was the most significant and meaningful experience that you had during your four years at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts]?  I mean what stood out in that education for you?  What, what did it do for you?
Speaker 2: There were a couple of high points.  There was a very small black student body.  So we created an organization called Spectrum.
Speaker 1: Called?
Speaker 2: Spectrum.
Speaker 1: Spectrum.
Speaker 2: And we caught a lot of heat from the other students cause we wanted to bring attention to what the black students were doing in school.
Speaker 1: And how many black students are we talking about now?
Speaker 2: Handful, man, maybe--when I first got there, five or six.
Speaker 1: Out of how many students?
Speaker 2: Hundreds.
Speaker 1: Hundreds?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's, it's kind of funny because I'm the kind of guy where when I get to an environment, I want to go out in or seek out the people that look like me, you know.  So I sort of took it upon myself to introduce myself to every black student that I came in contact with, as well as the professors.  When I got there, there were maybe three professors there, Stanley Pinkly, Milton Derr (ph.), he was a drawing teacher.  Stanley was a drawing teacher.  Ellen Barnes, she was a painting teacher, and that was it.  Yeah, that was the three, three of them.  So we, we wanted to do something that would bring attention to, to what the black students were doing, and, you know, to kind of acknowledge Black History Month, and we organized it and put it up and did our own programs--I got some of those that I did some of the art for.  And we, we, we caught some, caught some heat for it, but it was, it was positive.  And it was, it was uplifting.  I think it was--.
Speaker 1: You caught the heat from whom?
Speaker 2: Other students that couldn't really understand why.  They looked at it as separatism and really couldn't understand the importance of it, you know.  And (pause) one, one student, she was from South Africa.  And she was Caucasian, but she couldn't understand because we were calling it African American.  She couldn't understand why she was denied access into the show because she was from Africa.  And we were trying to explain to her, you know, the significance of it and why you couldn't participate.  And she tried to make some noise about it, so.  But it, it--it was, I think it was good and positive for the students at that time.  And in a way, and in a round-about kind of way, it kind of brought other students together, whether they were there, you know, disagreeing with it or out of protest, but it got people talking.  And it kind of brought the community of the school kind of closer together.  So that was one.
Story_ID: 19903
Speaker 1: And I think the other one was when I got accepted into school cause I was doing--all I wanted to do was graffiti.  I mean I was so influenced by hip hop and that whole subculture and it really became an important part of, of my life, and kind of my thought process, and I was heavily influenced by graffiti.  It's--that's all I did, you know.  I had a lot of things like I, I did a lot of work just prior to leaving high school in pastel.  And like I told you before, I had this realism kind of thing, like I did a lot of still-life stuff and I'd draw vegetables and people and clothes, just to sort of show as much of a variety and spectrum of what I could do.  I worked in the various mediums.  I worked in full color, and I had the graffiti pieces, you know.  And it was sort of leading up to what I really wanted to show 'em.  And one of 'em is down in the, in the hallway, that piece that has a subway train--I don't know if you guys saw it or not.  That was one of my pieces that helped me get accepted into the school.  So I did that after high school.  That was right around high school.  But that was a piece that I had submitted into two shows, a regular show that--because I was a graphic design major and illustration major, one of a regular series of shows that the school would randomly put on, and in the very first Spectrum show.  So those were the two high points, me getting accepted and being able to not only do traditional subject matter and work in traditional medium, but to also do something that, that I really got turned on by, and was really important to me and still be accepted.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where did you do your graffiti?  I mean--?
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, I worked out of a t-shirt store that was in Coolidge Corner, called Brookline T-Shirts and Jeans [Brookline, Massachusetts].  And a good buddy of mine, he--his name is Joe Wrightman, he's married to this Hollywood actress now, so I always see him on shows like "Entertainment Tonight" and stuff, and I say, "I know that guy, I know that guy".  But he, his parents owned this shop.  So what they offered was--and, we, we were friends, we were buddies, but we, you know, how you know people.  It was one of the guys that I knew.  He was a local guy.  So, and if I saw him today, we'd recognize each other.  But he came up to his parents, and he was like, you guys should have my friend, Rob, do custom-made graffiti designs, cause I did graffiti on everything, jeans, baseball hats.  The real popular thing back then in the '80s [1980s] was to do 'em on denim jackets, cause the way the jackets are, are  constructed, you have a panel in the back that kind of goes in, in like a upside down triangle.  And it's, it's, it's like a canvas.  You prime it, you put your gesso on there, and it's a canvas.  So that's what kids did in New York City, you know.  And then, you know, you have this, this walking piece of art that you can sort of display every time you put your jacket on.
Speaker 2: So your graffiti was on clothing then.  Was that on walls out--?
Speaker 1: It was also on walls, it was also on walls, but that, that occupied a lot of my time.  And it was kind of cool cause I could everything out of my house.  I'd go to school.  I'd come home.  They'd give me a call or I'd call them when some orders would come in.  I made up a nice little sign that they stuck in the store window.  And when some people had some orders to fill, they'd call me.  I'd come pick up the garments.  I'd do my things on the back.
Speaker 2: So it was custom, custom graffiti then--
Speaker 1: Custom, custom, everything was different, man.  One of a kind.  So, well, that's, that's what I did, and I also, I also did it on the other side of the law too, you know.  You, you kind of, you kind of got to go both ways, man, you know.  But I did have a respect for, like, like traditionally speaking, I was opposed to doing  graffiti on trains because I looked at that as a New York phenomenon, and I'm not from New York.  I'm from Boston [Massachusetts].  And you can appreciate it, but the trains, that's a New York thing.  And for a lot of different reasons that I probably, you know, don't need to go into, but Boston was different.  It's just made different.
Story_ID: 19904
Speaker 1: You graduated from the School of the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts] in 1989, I believe.  And then what happened?  Where'd you go?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I kind of kicked around for a little bit.  I, I did some internships while I was at school, you know.  I worked at Channel 7 [WHDH, NBC affiliate, Boston, Massachusetts] in their design department.  I worked for the Children's Museum [Boston, Massachusetts] in their design department, the Aquarium in their design department, and just, just trying to get involved in as many different things as I could. One, to see if I could make a living and two, to get experience.  (pause) Excuse me.  At Channel 7, I was assisting the, the artists that did a lot of graphics by the news people's heads and the anchor people, and they have those graphics there, right.  He did that, and I was fascinated, man, because it's--was totally out of my element.  These guys work at incredible speed, and they, they do these little patterns.  They have all this, this big library book shelf of, of reference material.  Whatever they need, they get the cue from the editor of whatever segment.  They shoot that down to--and this is going back a few years, so I mean it's obviously--technology has, has improved it since.  I can't imagine how.  I mean they, they ran it like, it was tight as a drum.  They had a, a computer back--they were called Quantel Paint Box.  And you had these big, more or less, drafting table, kind of easel thing.  It was a huge mouse pad, basically.  And the mouse was in a pen, and these guys would just, you know, lightening speed.  And they would scan images in that they might need that pop up on this monitor right in front of 'em.  And they'd tweak 'em, and, you know, and then they had their little menu over here that they could choose different techniques and, and material and tools from.  And then, in a matter of seconds, there's this graphic from no where.  Then they shoot it right down to the broadcast room.  And my job was to take the graphics.  I sort of sat across from the main guy--there were two of 'em.  It was one that was sort of studying under the main guy and the main guy--I can't remember any of these guys' names.  The main guy was a real anal guy, that--very intense, real asshole, sorry, most, most of the time.  You know, real, real fowl disposition cause he was the man, and, and he was, he was incredibly talented.  And the other guy was sort of this rock and rock, real loose, laid back kind of dude, and, and we kind of got along real good cause, cause I would try to teach myself how to do it on my lunch breaks.  So I never took lunch.  Yeah, that was my time to play around on the computer and try and get, you know acclimated to it.  But my job was to take the finished graphics and shoot them down to the broadcast room.  And you couldn't tell me I didn't have a, a serious job to do, man.  When people asked me what I did at Channel 7, I said, I, I work on the graphics for, for the, for the evening broadcast, you know.  But that was one, and the stuff I did at the Children's Museum and Aquarium was more traditional, dark room, you know, photostat machine, paste-up kind of stuff.  So.
Story_ID: 19905
Speaker 1: Well, today, you are deeply involved as an artist in the comic book industry--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you have been for a number of years.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about when and how you broke into that particular industry?  When did you first get started with--what was your first assignment, first job with--?
Speaker 2: My first job was back in 1994.  But my pursuit of work in that field began in maybe '93 [1993].  You have to understand, I've always been a fan of the medium.  I've always read comic books, (excuse me) when I was kid.  I'd have my mother take me to the drugstore.  And, you, you know, how you talk to people and say I remember when comic books were a dime a piece.  I can remember when they were twenty-five cents and thirty-five cents.  So that's, that's going back a little ways.  So, in third grade, as a matter of fact, my third grade teacher, she--you had different, different things to do at different parts of the day, like quiet time, like reading time.  And if you wanted to do quiet reading, there was this, this little--you know how the Pierce [Elementary] School's [Brookline, Massachusetts] configurated on the inside.  It's, it's like something you never seen before, especially back in them times.  So we had this little clubhouse, we called it.  And she had that place stocked with comic books.  So me and my body Aaron Lee that I was telling you about, Teo, we would go in there.  And we'd read the comic books all the time.  And then when you passed from one grade to another--I hate to admit this, especially, on camera, we swiped every last one of them books, man.  And she knew we did.  She knew we did it because we really showed an interest in the art, and all of our stuff was comic books, doodles on our pages and our papers all the time.  So, so that's, that sort of created it, you know, and the appreciation for collecting comic books.  So I did the monthly, I had monthly shopping list where I'd go collect the books.  So I've always had that.  I never thought that I'd do it for a living.  When I was in, in art school, I was really geared towards having a career in illustration or advertising, and I had friends of mine, just regular students that showed me what comic books--cause I fell off of the collecting game for a while.  And they showed the, what had--technology had contributed to the medium.  And books were being colored on the computer now with photo shop programs and stuff like that.  And the quality of the art and the execution and the draftsmanship just, just, was like nothing that I could remember from being a kid.  And, and I think there was a company called--I, I know, there was a company called "Image Comics" that was founded by a bunch of real popular Marvel artists at the time, who broke from that system to create their own imprint and do their own licensing and create their own characters and own those properties.  The down side of the comic books is most of it is work-for-hire kind of situations.  So you, you work so hard, you know, especially if you're on a, a regular assignment, on these preexisting characters that somebody owns the copyrights to.  So everything that you create for that character, the second it leaves your hand, it's owned by somebody else.  So you can only do that for so many year before you're like, okay.  What am I gonna do for myself?  So they broke, and everybody called them crazy in their first couple years out there, and made money hand over fist 'cause they took their fan bases right with them.  And although all of their characters were complete rip-off's of the characters that they were working on for Marvel, they still brought the fan base with them, and those were the books that some of my college buddies put in front of me when I was trying to decide what I wanted to do with my life, and said, well, you, you always did this.  This, this is what people are doing right now.  And I said, "Yeah, but there's no money in it." And I talked to a friend of mine who graduated from Parson's [School of Design, New York, New York] out in Brooklyn [sic. ref. to Pratt Institute, Brooklyn, New York] , and his buddy was working for a independent company called Valiant at the time.  Acclaim was a video game manufacturer, and they owned Valiant, and they had a line, a comic book line, very popular, the resale market.  And he told me what comic book guys were making as far as money, and for royalty incentives and everything, and I said, okay (laughs).  It's something to look into.  All of that's calmed down now, but back then, there was a big resale market and comic books were selling upwards in millions and millions and millions of copies.  So you can imagine, you know, a, a buddy of mine did some, some ink work--not a buddy of mine, a guy, an artist that I was familiar with at that time, did some inking work and might have got a couple or a buck and a half a page, and got a royalty check for Spider-Man, annual, an anniversary issue, and they did a nice little hologram graphic on the cover, and might have got a royalty check for thirty grand.  That's a year's salary to some people, man.  So I said I need to look into this (laughs).  And never looked back, you know.
Story_ID: 19906
Speaker 1: In about 1994, where I got, my, my very first work.  It wasn't a, a full-time kind of thing, but just prior to, to working full time in comics, yeah, I did my research.  I, I kind of figured out what you have to do to pursue a career in that, in that kind of field.  And it's so funny because I, I got an opportunity to do ad work at a company called Hill Holiday here in town.  And there was another--who's become a good friend of mine, I didn't know him at the time, a guy named Roger Andrews, who has had a nice little, little career in advertising.  So here's this little brother who wears hooded sweat shirts and jeans hanging off his behind and Timberland boots going to work.  I said, well, he looks just like me, you know, and he's got his little office with a window and stool, and worked on campaigns like Cola-Cola and all this cool stuff.  So I said, well, I can do that.  And they said, yeah, you can.  And they said, "What do you want to do?  You want full time, you want part time, you want this, you want that."  And at the same time, I was waiting to hear back from a comic book, my very--would, what would be my very first comic book job.  And it wasn't for a major publisher.  It was an independent, but it was for a artist named Larry Stroman, who is originally from Boston, lived in Brooklyn, New York at the time.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Stroman?
Speaker 1: S-T-R-O-M-A-N.  And real soft-spoken guy, a big, big guy, looked like a bear, like a teddy bear, but real quiet and soft spoken.  But he worked on a book called "X-Factor" for Marvel for a number of years.  He also worked on a book called "Alien Legion" for an imprint at Marvel called "Epic".  And Epic was sort of geared toward older readers.  It didn't have any nudity or cursing in the, in the material, but it was just older stuff that maybe younger kids couldn't handle.  And he had a, an incredible following, and I was familiar with his work, but had no idea he was African American at all.  So when I met him, that, that's how it clicked.  And he kind of took me under his wing, and told me what I needed to do to get work in that field.  So he had broken away from Marvel and the mainstream publishers to start his own imprint called "Axis Comics".  So it would be an honor for me to have anything to do with a guy that used to work on "Alien Legion" and all these other projects for Marvel and all these other companies.  So that was my first shot at comic book work, professional comic book work.  So, yeah, so, so, but it, that never really turned into anything.  They were very short lived.  I did some work, but none of the, the stuff we worked on was published or, or saw the light of day, cause they were going the self-publishing route.  And we can take this conversation in different areas and, you know, talk about diversity or separatism and racism and prejudice and all that other stuff that exists in this field, like, like any other.  But for now, I'll answer your question, and that was the very first, very first assignment.  And I had the opportunity for full-time employment at an ad firm versus a little, what we called one-shot in the comic book industry, which means one project.  When it's over, that's it, nothing else, no promise of more.  And the comic book job came up, and I took that (laughs), because I just knew I was so good that the jobs would be pouring in, man.  And it kind of happened that way.  I gave myself deadlines, personal deadlines.  I said, okay, I gave myself the opportunity to kind of learn the language, and what I needed to do to get a job.  I came out of art school, so I was--I hate to say it, I was kind of arrogant.  And I knew that I could paint, and I knew that sculpt, I could draw.  So this is drawing for a living.  How difficult can that be?  So I, I thought I was hot shit.  I'm, I'm sorry.  I can--I shouldn't do that.  I shouldn't curse, should I?  No, sorry.
Speaker 2: Don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: But I, I knew my stuff was good.  So I didn't think that there would be problem getting work in that, in that area.  And I was sadly mistaken.  Yeah, you can draw, but that's just part of it.  You have to know how to draw very good, but think about that.  How many people out there can draw really good?  Lot's of them, tons of 'em.  So you have to really have an understanding of how to tell a story.  That's what the medium is.  It's a storytelling medium.  So once I understood all of that, I gave myself personal deadlines, gave myself a year to learn how to do all of this stuff and, and within that year, to break in, to get my first assignment, cause in my mind, if it took longer, the whole process took longer than a year, I was wasting my time because I already had this other offer for, for work, at what I went to school for and what I, I studied for.  And once I was able to do that within a year, then I, I tasted it for the first time.  I liked how it tasted, and then I gave myself another personal deadline of a year to get another assignment that would subsequently lead into regular work.  And if I couldn't get regular work inside of a year, then I had to leave this alone and go do something else.  And everything happened just like that.  And some twelve years later, you know, I might have been--and it's a freelance kind of thing.  So it's like acting, you know, it's great work when you can get it, but you kind of have to--you know, unless you're a marquee player, you kind of have to constantly--.
Story_ID: 19907
Speaker 1: What was that next big stepping stone for you then, to, to launch you into this?  What was the next step?
Speaker 2: It was the Spider-Man project, if you can believe that.  I went straight from working with one of my heroes, Rich Stroman, to having him walk me up to Marvel [Comics].  And he took a job specifically so that I could ink it.  There's different disciplines and areas in comics.  There's a writer, there's a penciler, there's an inker, there's a colorist.  There's a letterer, and it's all an assembly line kind of process.  For monthly comic books, it's important for artists to specialize in one area.  If editors gave all of those responsibilities to one artist to do, no monthly comic books would ever come out.  And they'd be waiting for everything for, or for one guy to do everything for too long.  So that's kind of how traditionally, kind of how comic books have broken down.  If an artist can do all of it himself, they have to specialize.  And that was the criticism that editors and artists in the field and veterans in the field were giving to me, when I was trying to break in, cause my portfolio was all over the place.  I was just trying to dazzle people with my ability.  And they said, yeah, all of this stuff looks good, but it doesn't tell me anything at all of whether you have the ability to tell a story with pictures.
Speaker 1: So you became an inker?
Speaker 2: I became an inker because when I was told I had to choose and be more disciplined, and what area--there's a trend in comic books, and it still exists to this day where there's a current vogue of style, like a penciling style.  Remember when I was talking about [J.C.] Leydendecker and Norman Rockwell, every so often, maybe four to six years, an artist comes around, and he possesses a style that's so exciting and inspiring, he spawns a whole lot of imitators and copy cats.  And then the industry, it's, it's not so much unlike anything else.  You know, it's like Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola.  You have to compete, and you want to produce a product that you know has a guaranteed bill of sale, that you're gonna be able to move your product.  So that's what comic books are.  You know, if, if they develop a system, and it works, and it sells and it generates money, then they don't want to stray too far from that.  So, so as an artist, and being as anal, as arrogant as I was, I--it seemed like to much of a compromise for me to draw outside of my own parter--particular style.  I knew how I liked to draw, but nobody was falling all over me like I thought they were gonna, you know what I mean?  So I had artists telling me, well, if you just did certain things, then I could tell you, I could show you how to get a job in this business.  But you just have to modify your--and I said, no, way, man.  So, to, to be an inker, what you have to do, is you still have to have all those tools and that understanding, and, and, and innate drawing ability to communicate the storytelling process, but you're enhancing what the guy before you has already laid down, be it lay-up's, be it rough pencils or breakdowns--.
Speaker 1: So as an inker, you're responsible for what part of it?
Speaker 2: Sort of it, it's called embellishment.  You know, you, you take what a penciler does, and you bring it to finished stage.  It's called line art.
Story_ID: 19908
Speaker 1: So you're doing Spider-Man adventures at Marvel [Comics].  Well, tell us a little bit more about Spider-Man, and about that--?
Speaker 2: That was my first--like I told you, I gave myself personal deadlines.  So what better way to get introduced to the world of monthly comic books than to have Spider-Man be one of your very first assignments.  So I, I said, okay, cool, you know.  And at that time, we were talking about the whole competitive nature of the business.  D.C. Comics did a Saturday morning cartoon show of Batman.  And it broke all kinds of records.  It did really well in the ratings, and it was very, very popular.  And, you know, kids and adults would tune in to watch it.  And, and it was kind of dark, dark like--maybe not, you know, the greatest stuff for little kids.  So they started putting it on in the evening.  And people would race home from work to see this cartoon.  So they did a comic book adaptat--adaptation, excuse me, from that series.  And it sold just as well as the series did on, on television.  So, of course, Marvel, since they didn't create or do anything, you know, to, to kind of capture that, that audience in that market, they copycatted.  And they said, ok, we'll put out our equivalent which is Spider-Man.  And they kind of--with the advent of computer animation and the technology, it was still kind of in its infancy as far as animation back then.  They didn't have a, a way to properly fuse the two, the two disciplines together like traditional cell animation and computer animation.  They, they didn't know how to, how to mesh it very well back then.  It was still kind of trial and error.  So they--not, not like the movies you see now, like the Disney productions and "Toy Story" and things like that.  So they took traditional cell animation and had these, these nice, kind of crude looking, if you look back now, but at the time, these nicely rendered computer-generated back drops.  So you have this cell character in the traditional way of animation, zipping through this city that's all this CGI, and it just didn't look good together, you know.  It stuck out.  It's like oil and water.  But the cartoon surpassed Batman in the ratings, the first season out.  But then it fell, and then Batman took over, but Marvel doesn't like to talk about that.  So, the very first season Spiderman passed Batman, and Marvel made a big to do about that.  Okay, we, we're doing better on Saturday morning than you are.  So they did the same thing that D.C. did, they put the comic book adaptation out, and the book just didn't sell. It didn't sell.  I mean it did okay, when you start from number one.  Everybody buys number one.  And they it kind of lasted for, you know, a year or so, then petered off.  And then they canceled it and reintroduced it, switched the name around or, or the title around.  'Spider-Man Adventures', then it was the 'Adventures of Spider-Man', just so they could start from one again, and get the initial sales.  So we, we enjoyed some nice sales in the very beginning because the cartoon was doing so well.  But that was my very first assignment.  And I was working with a veteran named Alex Saviuk [comic illustrator].  And he worked on--oftentimes, comic book companies will do different versions and different variations of one character, like Batman, for example.  D.C. publishes Batman.  Then they'll publish detective comics which is Batman.  Detective Comics was Batman's very first appearance in a comic book.  So D.C. had been publishing comic books since the early 1900s.  So in the '30s [1930s] and, and the late '20s [1920s], they had detective comics that were just featuring detective stories like you would see in the movies back then, that Humphrey Bogart type stuff.  And then when super heroes kind of became fashionable, Batman was like this dark, kind of creature and he was real cool to the people that were buying books back then, or the kids buying books back then.  So he kind of took over D.C. Comics cause he was real popular.  That's all anybody wanted to see.  So you have all these difference variations to this day of, you know, books featuring one character.  So Spider-Man was no different.  You had the 'Amazing Spider-Man', which was the, the original one.  That was his very first appearance.  Well, it was 'Amazing Fantasy', featuring Spider-Man, and then his popularity rose.  And then he got his own title, which was "The Amazing Spider-Man", still playing off of the same, the same name or title.  Then you had regular Spider-Man.  Then you had 'Peter Parker, the Adventures of Spider-Man', and you had 'The Web of Spider-man'.  So there's all these different titles, but they're still based around the same kind of character and his life.  So we did 'The Adventures of Spider-Man', which was a direct adaptation from the cartoon.  So.
Story_ID: 19909
Speaker 1: What are some of the other products that you worked on with Marvel in addition to--?
Speaker 2: I kind of had my hand in pretty much everything.  I did some X-Men stuff, and the X-Men, they were super grouped, a grouping of a number of different super heroes.  The X-Men in this case are, are what's called mutants.  And they're super beings.  They're not human--they, they're human form, but they have these mutated genetic--their bodies are all screwed up.  So they can do really crazy and, and powerful things.  So they're a group mutants, grouped together.  And they're a super group, and they're called theX-Men.  And there're specific characters within the group that sort of stand on their own.  You know, they have their own titles, just like, like a Spiderman or a Batman.  And the more popular ones tend to have their own individual books, like "Wolverine".  Wolverine was a character who--he did, you know, the animal, the wolverine.  It's kind of like the name sake.  He's, his skeleton is made of adamantium steel, which is supposed to be unbreakable.  And he has a, a healing power, where if he gets injured and hurt, his body recovers and rejuvenates itself.  But he has all the characteristics and qualities of a wolverine.  There's ademantium claws--if anybody's familiar with the movies that are really popular right now, they're an extension of the skeleton.  And when he gets angry or needs to defend himself, they come out.  And it's, a lot of it is through his, the process of his mind, but sometimes, they just come out on their own.  So, you know, he's a very, very popular character, within the X-Men.  So he, he has his own, his own title.  And then there's other ones like "Night Crawler", "Storm".  Storm is African American.  She, for a time, was the leader of the X-Men.  It's my personal favorite character.  I, I think my favorite Marvel character is probably Storm.  I kind of was sort of drawn to her for the obvious reasons.  And just what I mentioned with the other Batman and, and Spiderman titles, the X-Men have several different titles.  The Uncanny X-Men is the core X-Men book, like the 'Justice League' for, for DC Comics.  And then there's other forms and variations.  The X-Men are, are--they're, they're, sort of a little bit of their background is they're, they were grouped together by a professor named Charles Xavier.  That's how they get the name.  And he created a school for gifted youngsters.  And a lot of this information and background is, is sort of given to you in the movies that are out now so that people who don't really know too much about the characters can go to the movies and, and get a little bit of their history, and then get right into it and, and, you know, see them do their thing.  So he creates a school and like, like any school, you get to a certain level and you have to move on.  So there's constantly--he, he's creating the, or he's suggesting that there're mutants within us so--or among us.  So that they're constantly coming into their own and, and discovering their powers.  So when the first batch moves on, then there's another one following it. So you, you have all of these stories that you can keep telling.  So it's the, it's the core group.  And then there's other titles that Marvel has produced over the years, like 'The New Mutants'.  And New Mutants just suggests these are newer versions of these X-Men characters, New Mutants.  So that's, that's where their name comes from, X-force, X-factor.  They're all different variations of the, of the same group.
Story_ID: 19910
Speaker 1: You were the co-founder of a group known as the Armada or Armaeda Design Group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Armada.
Speaker 1: Armada.
Speaker 2: Like a Spanish army, Armada.
Speaker 1: What was the purpose of the organizing--what is, what is this group?  And what did you do?  What, what is it doing now?  When was it formed?
Speaker 2: It's disbanded now.
Speaker 1: What was the purpose of the group at the time?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we kind of wanted to--when we formed it, I, I had two other partners.
Speaker 1: They were?
Speaker 2: A brother named Chris Walker.  He's originally from the South and another brother named Koran Grant.  And they still, you know, are currently doing work in the field.  We--our backgrounds are really similar as people and as artists or were very similar.  And a lot of our influences are, are coming from the same place, derived from the same things, like hip hop, like comic books, animation.  We all share in a lot of the same kind of loves and interests.  So--and as professionals in the commercial art field, we--there, there are a lot of other forms of entertainment that, that borrow from our chosen area or our field.  A good example is there, there's been a, a long-standing underground marriage, I like to refer to, between comic books and hip hop.  And it's been there from the very beginning, from the influence that comic book characters have had on graffiti artists back in the day to, to what rappers talk about.  You know, I mean if they're not talking about diamonds and champagne, they're talking about just unhuman, you know, feats of, of strength and prowess and all of that stuff, bravado, where it's derived from stuff that they were into when they were kids, you know.  We, we all kind of, kind of grow up, unless we're on another plant in similar kind of fashion as kids.  You know, every, everybody plays a sport.  You either decide you like or you don't.  Everybody watches a cartoon, everybody picks up a comic book at one point in their life or, or their, their development as, as young men or women.  So it's just, you know, different facets of pop culture, that everybody is predisposed to.
Speaker 1: But the three of you came together for what purpose?
Speaker 2: To, to, to kind of work together--and it was very short lived.  I think the intention was stronger than the collaboration, if that makes any sense.  We, we just got tired of, of, of other areas of entertainment borrowing from what no one does better than us.  And as comic book artists and, and commercial and graphic artists, we--our, our, our views were shared by a lot of our colleagues, you know.  And, and, some, some of our buddies in the field would dabble, and they would do stuff like, you know, album covers for rappers or, you know, story boards for, for a cartoon or a music video or stuff like that.  So we always dabbled, but nobody, to, to our knowledge and through all of our research, ever really tried to capitalize on it.  So we were kind of groundbreaking in that.  And we wanted to kind of market ourselves or present ourselves to that community as, you know, the real deal, you know, the real thing.  You know, if you want this kind of inspired energy for whatever you're trying to sell, you need to go to the guys that do it for real.  (Unclear) I remember the Wachowski Brothers, they created the 'Matrix' [films].  Their ideas were kind of similar, you know.  They, they--well, not their ideas, but, you know, all comic books really are is like film on flat paper if you think about it.  It's, it's a, it's a storytelling process just like film is.  It's a cheap, it's the poor man's film medium, a lot of people refer to it as, because you can get your idea across in very little time.  And by comparison, very little money.  So you're seeing this push by Hollywood now to, to snatch up all the comic book-inspired material now, with all of these movies like "Spider-Man" and "Dare Devil" and, and "Cat Woman" and, you know, you know, you know what's out there.
Speaker 1: What did you guys' produce?  What did you end up--?
Speaker 2: We, we were visual artists, you know, that's what we were really priding ourselves in, you know.  And we know that so many other things can spawn from that basic, grassroots approach to comic books and to storytelling and to art.  So that's what we wanted to provide.  I mean we worked for, for different companies, Tommy Boy Records, 'cause they're no longer in existence.  Cornerstone Promotions, they produce a magazine called 'The Fader', which at the time was an industry magazine.  We, we made some noise.  We, we--we did, you know, a lot of things sort of on our really underground level in New York City [New York].  We did--Cornerstone Promotions would put out, you know, before they really became anything, they would put out sample tapes by different D.J.'s.  The D.J. for, for hip hop is, is sort like the backbone, the staple of, of the culture.  And you would take different D.J.'s from, from different areas and--that have their own particular followings, and they would do what would, what's called a mix tape.  And, and they would mix pre-existing artists, hip hop and otherwise, of R&B singers, and mix all of the, the songs together.  And they would sort of offer them to prospective clients and packaged up as mix tapes.  And they're very exclusive because you couldn't go to the store and buy 'em.  You had to have them sent to you.  So a lot of those early volumes are now collectors items.  So what we did, for doing what we do, is we did the cover art for a D.J. named D.J. Green Lantern.  Now, Green Lantern is a comic book character.  He's, he's from D.C. comics, and he's not a D.J., but he's a comic book character.  This also re-enforces of the notion of comic books' influence on hip hop and that whole subculture.  D.J. Green Lantern knows where he got his name from.  So we thought it would be really interesting and cool to do a little play on his name.  So we turned his CD cover in, into CD size, into a comic book.  So it looked just like a comic book, you know.  We had the D.J. fighting all of these creatures made out of record vinyl, and they were clawing, you know, to get his records.  And he possessed the same powers that the, the super hero comic book character, Green Lantern had, he was a D.J.  And now he's, I'm sure a lot of people are familiar with Eminem.  He's Eminem's main D.J. now.  So this is way before a lot of that.  So we, we had a opportunity.  We were right on the cusp of a lot of really exciting and cool stuff.
Speaker 1: Why was it short lived?  Very briefly, what--?
Speaker 2: I think as individuals--it was a limited partnership.  You know, we all knew that we wanted to do different things for ourselves on a personal level, but we still shared the importance of, of trueness, if that's even a word and a need to really have our, our stuff out there and appreciated and seen by people that were sort of settling for sub par, you know.  We knew that we were that good, and it's sort of that theory, "if you build it, they'll come".  If people know that you're out there, and that you exist, and this is what you're offering, then they're gonna want that because that looks better than everything else.  So that was our attitude.  And we kind of used ourselves as--just three people, to kind of be a litmus test, if you will, because we had a stable of other people that would be willing to jump on board if we could prove this thing to work.  So, it, it was short lived because you have real life knocking on the door.  The rent has to be paid, you know, the bills have to be paid.  So, you know--
Story_ID: 19911
Speaker 1: You made another move as the creator and curator of "Sequential Art", the next, the next step.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was that all about, and when did you initiate this venture?
Speaker 2: Well, believe it or not, "Next Step" was an idea that I had before I broke into the comic book industry.  It was sort of a need or it came about as a need to inform people of the presence that--and contributions that African Americans have made and continue to make to the comic book industry.  And I say a need because I as oblivious to them, I mean I wasn't totally ignorant thinking that black artists don't work in this field, but I didn't know to what extent, like, like the number and who was doing what.  Like, I had no idea that a lot of the books that I, that I read and a lot of the artists' work that I followed when I was younger was being produced by people that look just like me. Until I started, like I told you earlier, until I started actually pursuing, you know, this as a, as a career.  And then I would meet these, these artists and hear their stories, and some good, a lot bad about breaking in and just trying to exist in this, in this kind of industry.  And you can really, if you think about imagine, how competitive it must be to just be in an industry where all you do is draw because, you know, so many people share that gift.  What do you bring to the table that makes you any more important or relevant than the next guy?  And then you're just in a sea of talented people as far as the eye can see, fighting for elbow room.  So, okay, here's your chance.  Make, make your impression on the world; make, make people sit up and notice you.  What, what are you gonna bring to the table?  So I, I kind of saw very early on, and this is like I said, it was before I even broke into the field and started working regularly that, you know, if this, if this is news to me, the presence of, of our brothers and some sisters, working within this industry, it's something I didn't really know about, then that might be information to other people as well.
Speaker 1: So what was your strategy?  What was your program?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: I knew none of them would take me seriously if I was stepping to them and not being in the trenches, so to speak, that they were.  You know, I knew that par--part of the importance of, of even having this kind of thing take flight is to, to be respected.  Now, how is some guy that's never seen you before, doesn't know anything about you, gonna respect you and ask you or, or participate in something that you want to do if you don't have a clue as to what kind of life that they lead.  So I knew I had to get a job (laughs).  You know, to make a long story, so, so that was also a, a motivating factor for, for breaking into the field.  My mission was to bring about a greater appreciation and understanding for the medium, which, even to this day is not fully understood and appreciated and respected is a viable art form.  But to also exploit the fact that a lot of artists of color, African Americans, have had something to do or a hand in a lot of the characters that everybody is familiar with.  And, you know, the, the, the very first official show that was mounted, we had over thirteen different represented and well over a hundred pieces.
Speaker 1: So 'Sequential Art: The Next Step' was a, was a show then, is that what you said?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's, it's an exhibition.
Speaker 1: It's an exhibition.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm, I'm sorry.  We, what we did or what my intent was, was to, to, to really dissect and, and expose the language of sequential art so that the viewer in one instance can see what that medium is all about.  For example, comic books are twenty-two to twenty-five pages, more or less, each month bound, bound in a cover with staples.  Those, each one of those pages is a piece of art in and of itself.  And it's one thing to pick up a comic book off of a, off of a newsstand or at a specialty comic book shop and flip through it, and say, oh, look at all the pretty pictures and nice little story, whatever, and do that from month to month.  It's another thing to, to see that same work isolated and showcased on a wall, under glass, presented in, in the same manner that a Picasso painting is or a Michaelangelo or Miro, or who, whoever turns you on.
Story_ID: 19912
Speaker 1: So when and where was your first exhibit?  When did you launch your first exhibit?
Speaker 2: Well, the very first one, I was invited to participate in a festival of cartoon art, and that's an annual thing that Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio] puts on.  And Ohio State, at the time, their cartoon and graphic arts research library was the largest archive in the country of original comic strip art and cartoon art.  And we're going all the way back to stuff like "Little Emo", and cartoons by Windsor McCay and a lot of those things that inspired a lot of those shorts that you would see, sort of an intermission at movies back in the early 1900s, and you'd--"Gordy the Dinosaur", all this silent movie kind of stuff, all of those were individual drawings that were sort of done in what's called a flip book kind of fashion and in rapid succession, they would, they would create a, a little scene or a scenario.  So the, the year that I was asked to participate--I believe it was in 1994, and I had the idea for the "Next Step" back then, but I had a chance to kind of test waters to see how well it would be received by participating in this show.  Now, this, this was groundbreaking in several ways because the history of these festivals that Ohio State puts on, comic book art has never been featured or showcased.  It's always been comic strip art, but when we're talking about comic strips, we're talking about everybody or, or people that everybody knows, like "Doonesbury", like "Shoe", like, you know, artist like Gary Trudeau and Jeff McNeely and, just, just mainstays of, of the newspapers and the Sunday funnies.  That's the kind of company we were in.  And, and Lucy Casswell, she was the curator of the library.  And they had, you know, at that particular year, it was the centennial celebration of the comic strip.  So there was a whole lot of cool stuff going on.  And we had a exclusive exhibit that was in connection with the festival, that showcased the work of comic book artists.
Speaker 1: So you took this out there.  You took this exhibit to--(unclear) (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, who was "we"?  I mean you did this solo or with other people?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, no, my aunt, Betty Stull, she has a gallery called "The King Arts Complex" in Columbus, Ohio.  So she was asked to participate and by, by offering her gallery space for whatever shows that, that they decided that they wanted to have through there.  So she told Lucy Caswell, my aunt told Lucy Caswell, well, my nephew does the, that stuff, you know.  And she didn't know to the degree, and Lucy told me, how many times has somebody, a business colleague said, oh, my nephew or my niece or my cousin's brother's whoever, does that stuff.  And (unclear) like, okay, yeah, sure, he does.  So she didn't really understand to the degree that I did, that I was a professional comic book artist.  So she, she found out, and then said, well, wow, you know, we really--this will be a good opportunity for you guys to, to--or for you to participate.  And I said, well, I got friends.  So I got the, the invitation myself, solo, but I had this idea for the "Next Step" back here.  So I said, this will be the perfect opportunity for me to see what we could do here.
Speaker 1: How was it received?
Speaker 2: Ah, man, like you couldn't even imagine, man.  I mean the audience was out there, and they were waiting.  And there was a, an alumni at Ohio State University, a gentleman by the name of Jeff Smith, whose--he had a, create (unclear) named Bone.
Story_ID: 19913
Speaker 1: So after you had your first sequential art traveling exhibit at Ohio State [University], Columbus [Ohio], where did you take the exhibit next?
Speaker 2: Well, I had approached Barry Gaither, family friend.
Speaker 1: And who is Barry?
Speaker 2: Barry, Barry is the, the founder, director of the National Center of Afro American Artists here in Boston, Roxbury to be exact.  And I approached him, sort of like a warm contact, with this concept I had for the show.  And he wasn't biting at all.  He, it was unfamiliar territory to him, and he didn't want to chance it.  And I told him if he just created the venue, and agreed to mount the show, that I'd fill the gallery.  That was my promise to him, and--.
Speaker 1: And so you had an exhibit there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And when was that, year?
Speaker 2: That was one year after the, the show in, in Ohio.  Like I was saying, Ohio was a good opportunity for me and us to kind of test the waters to see if it would be received, and it--(unclear) (simultaneously).
Speaker 1: How many different artists were involved in the National Center of Afro American Artists exhibit?  How many different people's work--your work was there, and who else?
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen.
Speaker 2: Thirteen different artists, and I kind of did a little snippet of that, a edited down version of that for the Ohio State show.
Speaker 1: Where else have you taken this exhibit?
Speaker 2: We, we go wherever they want it, man.
Speaker 1: Where was the last--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, the last showcase was in Macon, Georgia at the Tubman Museum, and that, that was a hell of a show.  And before then, it's been to the Afro American Institute--no, the museum in Charlotte, the Afro American Cultural Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.  And Harry Harrison, the director of that institution got the position of the director for the Philadelphia Museum.  And he made me a promise, and my partner, Gloretta Baynes, who was assistant to the director at the National Center in Boston, to Barry Gaither--she's, she's my partner with the, the "Next Step" exhibitions.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's her name again?
Speaker 2: Gloretta Baynes.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell the last name?
Speaker 2: B-A-Y-N-E-S.
Speaker 1: And her first name?
Speaker 2: Gloretta, everybody calls her Glo.  And Glo is, the exhibit couldn't happen without Glo because her involvement with the museum and the cultural institutions sort of crossed over when she left the National Center, you know.  Her, her, her relationship with those other institutions was, you know, keeping the interests out there.  And, and that's why it's continued to travel.  And she's a big comic book junkie too, so when I, when I brought the, the concept to Barry, she was like, ho, ho, we are definitely having that show here.  And it was a chance for her to really be involved with something that she's always been into too.  And it's, and it's kind of cool because the two of us, we sat on a panel at Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in May of last year.  And it was a whole bunch of my other buddies and colleagues in the field.  And, and we were talking about, you know, our presence in the industry.  And it's cool, and it's important for people to put a black face, female, to, to what we do, you know, to, to let people know that, you know, all walks of life, everybody, everybody's into comic books, cause comic books are cool.  And, and she's got a lot to say too.  So, you know, it's, it's pretty cool.  But, yeah, the, the Harry Harrison was--he, he took that position in Philadelphia, and unfortunately, we haven't had a chance to showcase there yet, and he's no longer with Philadelphia, at that institution.  But wherever he lands next, you know--.
Speaker 1: You'll be there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we have his promise.
Story_ID: 19914
Speaker 1: Now, you've been able to take your work recently to an international level--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In 2004 you were in Europe.  Where were you in Europe and what did you do there?  Tell me briefly what that was about?
Speaker 2: Well, my involvement with, you know, different hip hop groups and, and with the music and stuff from my time in New York City, I, I had the opportunity to, to meet and, you know, make relationships with artists that, that do music and, and other things and other entertainment.  So the Les Nubians is an internationally based singing group--.
Speaker 1: What's it called?
Speaker 2: Les Nubians.
Speaker 1: Les Nubians?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's two sisters and they're from Bordeaux, France.  And they're, they're, they're pretty well known.  They've, they've worked with other American rappers and, and musicians.  And they had the opportunity to be artistic directors of this carnival that Bordeaux, France puts on every year.  It's called the Carnival of the Two Rivers [Carnival des Deux Rives].  There are two rivers that, that meet, that are separated by this big bridge.  So it's a big--lot of history in there that I'm gonna spare you, but it was a big to do for them, you know, a big honor for them to, to be artistic directors.  And what they did was kind monumental and, and groundbreaking because they, they brought artists from all over the planet, all different walks of life to, to come in and teach workshops, specific workshops.  And they were open to the public, and at the end of the festival--it was a, a two-week period, at the end of that two-week period, what the students learned would all culminate together in this sort of climax with this big parade and festival that the city would put on.  And they'd do this on an annual level.  And I was kind of like the outcast because their music, and all the people that they brought in were music folk, you know.  They brought in a percussionist from Brooklyn [New York].  They brought in a percussionist from the West coast, a vocalist from, from Atlanta and all these people have worked with, with the likes of like Janet Jackson's and, and people like that, to let you know the, the magnify--the, the, the magnitude and, and the importance of this.  And they were kind of like these two little, there two little chicks hanging out, you know, bringing all of these people together from all over the place.
Speaker 1: So they brought you there.
Speaker 2: They brought me there, and I was, I was sort of like the outcast because--.
Speaker 1: What did you bring and what did you do?
Speaker 2: --because I was this, this comic book guy.
Speaker 1: So what did you do there?
Speaker 2: So I, I say, well, you know, and I was talking to her, and said, well, how can I incorporate what I do and, and, and have it be a legitimate part of this, of this carnival and this celebration.  And I said, it was obvious, you know, talk about the connection between hip hop and comic books.  And, and that's kind of how I presented it, and they brought me there to conduct a two-week workshop doing basically, the mechanics of comic books.  So it was a grassroots kind of crash course, if you will, because we only had two weeks.  That was our biggest hurdle to try and figure out how I could communicate enough language, which was key because there was the language barrier.  I don't speak French.  So everything I had to instruct them had to be translated and vice versa.  So that was a hoot, but we, we got through it.  But, but, and it was very well received, and what a lot of people in the states might not realize is that music and hip hop is so global and so universal that a lot of what I had to talk to them about, they already knew.  I had students coming to my class that were already familiar with the work that I'd done in comic books in the states, and they were bringing in published volumes of, like a series that I might have done back in 1996, bringing it to me, that's totally in French, you know.  So it, it was, it was a kick in the pants, you know.  I mean it, it was, it was a pretty good, a pretty good time.  And, and they had a chance to, to--the, the work that was produced by the workshop would later be featured in the library.  There were a lot of famous European artists and, and commercial artists, European artists exhibit on a, on a regular basis.  So I mean that's, that's the level of importance and, and significance that this whole thing had.  You know, I had to come back to the States before I could, you know, experience the, the climax of the whole thing, which was unfortunate, but, you know, that's, that's what I did out there.
Story_ID: 19915
Speaker 1: All right, is there anything else that you'd like to add to this oral history interview that I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: Well, my baby, I mean is my exhibitions.  I, I think it's really important for children, you know, of, of all nationalities and backgrounds to know that, you know, there are people that do cool things and, and create things that they're familiar with, that look just like them.  I mean it's one thing to say, you know, this, this black comic book character or, you know, that a Marvel or a D.C. Comics may have created a hundred years ago.  And okay, yeah, that's positive, but when I was growing up, the black comic book characters that I--that were available to me at the time, were characters like "Luke Cage, Hero for Hire", and he's basically, a paid, hired hand assassin that goes out and kills people, you know, like a, like a glorified prostitute.  And how positive is that message?  There was a character that I kind of connected with called the "Black Panther" because he was a descendant of royalty.  Wesley Snipes is suppose to do the film adaptation whenever that happens.  John Singleton's supposed to direct it, whenever that happens.  And all of that might have changed by now, but I, I'm--I hope, I hope it happens, but he was a descendant of royalty.  He was a king back in Africa, and he found his way to the states, and he, he always handled himself in a, in a very regal and respectful manner.  And I applaud Marvel Comics for, for taking a chance cause they created him in the '60's [1960s] in the height of the Civil Rights Movement, and to create a black character with that kind of rich background and history and to do a half way decent job at it--these are two Jewish guys that created this, this character, you know.  And, and they were pretty right on with it, and he remains to be one of my, my most favorite.  But, you know, I think the message that we send to kids and people that artists of color have had a hand in creating and producing some of the characters and stories that they're really familiar with that they might not know otherwise, I think that message is just as positive as, you know, black super heroes that have been created or preexisting creations of black superheroes by companies at a time when the message wasn't really all that positive.  It was such a different world back in those days in the '30's [1930s] and the '40's [1940s] and the '50's [1950s].  And we still got a long way to got, as far as, you know, acceptance and prejudice and racism is concerned, but I think that's my, my driving force behind, behind the exhibitions, to, to really put it out there.  You know, I'm a, I'm an advocate of this medium.  I'll be doing it till the day I die.  If it's not on a regular basis, it'll be some kind of, of involvement in this industry.  I love it that much, and, and I, I think that to constantly reinforce the notion that this is a viable art form and an important medium and, and, and to--I just know this is a very--it's, it's just as important.
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you have not yet been able to do?
Speaker 2: I, I kind of want to try and create some time for myself to, to take advantage of all of this information and technology that's out there.  I know a little bit, but I, I don't know as much as some other people do.  I really want to get into this animation and, and more and more involved with CGI--computer-generated imagery and graphics and all that, much more so than I am.  I mean I, I know a little, but I, I want to know a lot more.  And that's, that's the future anyway.  So it's important that all visual artists have a firm understanding of, of those mediums and, and we have to peace, find a way to peacefully coexist with the changing time and the evolution of technology or we're left behind.  So.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: I don't have any complaints.  I'm kind of--I look in the mirror, I like what I see.  I like the kind of person that I've become.  You--could I do things differently?  Sure.  But, but I'm, I'm pretty pleased.  I'm pretty pleased.  I still get a kick when--if I go to a trade show for comic books, people coming up, you know, and waiting in lines to, you know, get my signature on a comic book.  I still get a kick out of seeing my name in print, a kick out of having a fan base.  You know, it might not be as, as extensive as, as some of these other artists.  Some of these guys have, have really gone on to do some really great things, and then come back to comic books and it just reinforces their, their presence and the work that we all do.  But I, I still get a kick out of the little things.  You know, we--you know what people say, you know.  When it becomes old or it becomes a job, then you got to leave it alone, you now.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you would have done differently or anything you would have--that you've already done, that you think you may have, would have done differently as you look back at this point?
Speaker 2: Career-wise or just life wise?
Speaker 1: No, life-wise, career-wise, primarily.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure I think it's, I think everybody feels that way about one thing or another.  I had an opportunity to take advantage of a lot of this technology when I was pursuing a career in this field.  And ask anybody that does what I do for a living, man, it's so time consuming.  The deadlines can break your back sometimes, but a lot of my buddies that were trying to break in back here in Boston at around the same time that I did and weren't able to do it, went that other way.  So now they're doing all this cool computer stuff, and I'm doing what they've always wanted to do.  So that's the sort of grass is always greener concept, but, yeah, that would be my only regret, but I've got a lot more living to do, you know, I'm just a baby (laughs).
Story_ID: 19916
Speaker 1: You're only thirty-eight years old, is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, thirty-seven.
Speaker 1: Thirty-seven, and my--
Speaker 2: Thirty-seven.
Speaker 1: --I was never good at mathematics or arithmetic either.  I was off by one, but you're only thirty seven.  Our last question, what message or, or lessons do you have to share with young people today in junior high school, in high school who have the talent that you had, and want to perhaps be an artist.  What would, what's your message for young black people today who want to be artists?
Speaker 2: Be about it, be about it in every aspect.  Study, research.  There's so much information out there that's available, and most of it's free.  Learn everything you can possibly learn about whatever it is you want to get into.  And then when you think you, you've learned everything that you can, go out and search for more.  And just fill your head, use your mind and your brain, it's just like a sponge, like absorb as much information as you can.  And, and just be about it.  And, like I said before, at the top of the interview, never give anybody any reason to deny you anything.  That's, that's kind of my approach to what I do, you know.  I, I, I'm very anal.  I would, I would get criticized because my packages were so professional, and there was a whole lot of stuff that, unnecessary stuff that I was doing that I didn't have to do to get these jobs.  But if I covered all those bases, then they wouldn't have any reason to deny me anything or if they do, then it means something else now, doesn't it?
Story_ID: 19917
Speaker 1: Oh, that little guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: That is my mother, Patricia Ryder and my grandmother, Virginia Ryder.  What I see when I look at that picture is probably strength more than anything.  I believe a lot of my character is formed from my mother.  I have a lot of her features, people always tell me.
Speaker 2: When was that taken about, approximately?
Speaker 1: Maybe three years ago, in 2000-2002.
Speaker 2: [Robert Stull's mother, Patricia Ryder and grandmother, Virginia Ryder, ca. 2000-2002. From the collection of Robert Stull.]

Speaker 1: That, there's the man.  That is my father.  That's Donald Stull.  This picture's important to, to both of us for a lot of different reasons.  He has his Middle Passage memorial.  This was taken sort of in the beginning stages.  He was ill when the image came to him, and he sketched in bed these ideas that he couldn't get out of his head, and that's after the model was completed obviously.  So that's a favorite picture of his and mine.  I think that was taken, wow, I'm not sure.  It's over ten years ago--it must be ten years ago.
