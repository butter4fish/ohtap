Speaker 2: Mattie Lightfoot Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was her date of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You know where she was born?
Speaker 2: Virginia.
Speaker 1: What part, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't really know what part.  She hated Virginia, and she didn't talk much about her life.  Most people in those days, they weren't really proud of their backgrounds and you know.  They didn't talk much.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any stories of her family that were passed down about slavery or the Civil War--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I think my grandmother might've been a child in slavery.  Yes, many stories passed down, I know they used to talk about how they lived in this one room and they had a dirt floor.  And a group of men, black fathers they stole and killed this cow and they cut it up and divided it and they had to bury in the dirt.  And they dig it up and cook it at night and the children would have to eat it, whether they wanted it or not, stories like that.
Speaker 1: So they had it eat it to get rid of it?
Speaker 2: Yes, well the children weren't getting any meat or anything and they stole, they had to bury it, that's the only place they could hide it and then they dig it up, and you know.
Speaker 1: Any other stores from that period that they talked about?
Speaker 2: Maybe, but I think I brought it out most of them.  You know you try to get rid of that sort of business; you don't wanna remember it.
Story_ID: 151365
Speaker 1: Did you know--well you knew your grandmother right, you said your grandmother--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I didn't know my grandma; she died before I was born.  My mother [Hattie Lightfoot Jones] was married to Mr. Richards and she had the first four children by him, three sons and a daughter, my sister [Celestine Bayne].  Then she married my father [Walter James Jones] and she had me, and I was the only Jones.
Speaker 1: Now did she get married in Massachusetts or in Virginia?
Speaker 2: No she got married in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She moved to Massachusetts relatively young?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she came up to Massachusetts when--and married Mr. Richards in Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was like around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Well, my sister was six years older than I and I was born in '13 [1913].  Which meant she was born in what six, 1906.  Probably in the 18-somethings, because she had three sons they were older than the girl.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your mother like, what kind of person was she?
Speaker 2: Strong person, strong-willed person and she taught me to be strong, all of us to be strong.  She had--her first husband died, so she had to really raise those four children, three boys and girl for a long time before she remarried--by herself.  And in the meantime, she--my grandmother worked for some wealthy white people in Massachusetts and they sold her their family home.  And my grandma was the first black woman in Malden [Massachusetts] to own a house, and she left it to my mother.  And my mother wanted--when she remarried, she--when I was five years old, she wanted to move to Boston [Massachusetts].  Because my father worked at Swift & Company and he had to get up so early in the morning to go from Malden on the streetcar so she--they moved to Boston and my mother kept the house in Malden, but she bought the house in Boston, and there we lived.   And my mother took in--she never went to work, but she did have roomers, and she had three roomers there.  She saved that money and bought another house in Roxbury and during the depression she lost it.  And we had to move back to Vienna City and it's very complicated.  Life is like that, but you just go from day to day, but when you look back on it, you say I wonder what happen here?  You lose little pockets but anyway, we lost the house at 60 Townsend Street and in the meantime, I started my school and my mother started to save money for me, so we bought another house on Townsend Street, which was 148.
Speaker 1: That was in Boston.
Speaker 2: Boston, beautiful house, very happy house, lovely days there, lovely memories Christmases and New Year's and Thanksgiving.  And then--from then on, she bought a house at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], the one I tell you that we used to go to.  And that she was that kind of a person.
Speaker 1: Very industrious.
Speaker 2: She was really, and she never went out to work.  I never remember going home and finding that house--she was always home, but she saved that money that she got from her lodgers.  And that wasn't much, probably five or six dollars a week from each of them, which will have been about fifteen or twenty dollars but she saved every penny of it.  And she, I can remember when we bought the house in Boston, the first one, how I used to--we used to go down to a Jewish friend, named Lanahan [ph.], and we used to go there every week and take a payment on the house and life is fascinating.  And he was killed, he had all that money, he had many houses and people used to come to his home and pay under his mattress, that's where their banks were, under their mattresses.  People didn't put their money in banks, in those days.  And I had a fascinating, wonderful life.
Story_ID: 151366
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father, can you give his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father, Walter James Jones, was a wonderful man.  He taught me how to dance, he taught me how to schottische and two step and one step--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Where was he from, when he was born?
Speaker 2: Carolina.
Speaker 1: Carolina, you don't know exactly where?
Speaker 2: No, but there--in his place, there are a lot of Joneses down there.  My niece went down there one time and she came back and she came and said, you know the whole family--the whole little town is Joneses.  But he was a wonderful man, he could do anything.  He played the harmonica, he played the piano by ear, he couldn't read music.  He used to make rugs; he used to organize games for us to play at night for our memory, for our spelling. He was a fun, wonderful man.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did he have any stories from his ancestors?
Speaker 2: He never talked about them.  Those people did not talk about their--they just didn't, memories were so painful, who wanted to go back there?  They wanted to forget them, and--they thought the things were gonna to be better, so they threw away all that old stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so when did he come to Massachusetts, did he come when he was a child or when he was after--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I think he came--he had five or six sisters and his mother was a person without a man, a father, whatever.  And he came and brought those children up to Melrose, Massachusetts, another little suburb, place where the blueberries were so delicious.  And that's where they grew up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is--now did he get much schooling?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but not much, but I'll tell you what, he had a curiosity, he wanted to know, and did know every country, what they exported, what they imported, what they grew, what languages they spoke, he was curious about everything about life.  And he used to read the dictionary, spoke beautifully.
Speaker 1: But he didn't go to college or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But still was very interested in learning.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 151367
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] and father [Walter James Jones] meet, did they have a story about that?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I don't really know.  But I know they both liked to dance, so I'm sure they must have met at a dance or something like that, I don't know.  But they both were good dancers and liked to dance and liked fun.
Speaker 1: So your mother had been married before--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So you were the only child of theirs?
Speaker 2: Of Jones, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 151368
Speaker 1: Now, reflect back on growing up and give us some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I think I told you that I always wanted to dance, and my mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] loved that.  She loved dancing and she loved--we--I saw it--I went to see every musical, comedy, many plays.  She had the love for a Jewish comedienne, I forget what her name was, and a man who used to play a harmonica, who was on Key Circuit, but every Monday morning, she would keep me out of school and take me to the theatre--Every (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Every Monday morning?
Speaker 2: Every Monday morning, Harry Haughton [ph.], all the big bands, all the others that came on the key circuit or low circuit and they changed their shows every Monday, and we would go.
Speaker 1: So you'd miss school every Monday--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So did that that bother you at all to miss school every Monday?
Speaker 2: Bother me, and the teachers didn't--I don't know.  I don't  remember the teachers saying anything, but I went and then besides that, if we could afford it, we would go to--if there was a--when Josephine Baker was in town, I saw her last performance that she did in the United States before she went to France, became so famous, I saw her.  I saw all the comedians, everybody.
Speaker 1: Did you see Bert Williams?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I didn't see Bert Williams but my father [Walter James Jones] had recordings by Bert Williams, and he told me all about Bert Williams.  I knew he was a very, very fair black man who used to put on black makeup and you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Who was some of the others you saw?  Josephine Baker well now--tell us about her.
Speaker 2: Oh when I saw her she didn't do much dancing, she didn't do much singing in that particular show.  She just ran out and she was tall and skinny and angular and but--she wasn't as beautiful.  When she went to France, they made her over, her skin was like satin, her hair was beautiful, she wore beautiful clothes.  They made a beautiful artist of Josephine Baker, but when I saw her she just ran out and shook herself and threw her arms around.  I forget what show that was; I can't remember which one it was.  But it's the last one she did in the United States, she never came back.  She didn't come back for years--I don't know she came back for one show and she was gorgeous, she had beautiful gowns and everything.  And people didn't like us, you know, she looked like a movie star and--when [Jackie] Moms Mabley and those people begot us, they couldn't respect Jo Baker.
Speaker 1: Now, do you remember [James Hubert] Eubie Blake and-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, Eubie Blake and Sissle.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Noble Sissle.
Speaker 2: Noble Sissle, yes, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Who else, I mean some of that--Ethel Waters I know was good.
Speaker 2: Oh, well Ethel Waters, yes, well you should remember Ethel.
Speaker 1: You know I do, I do.  I never saw her when she was real young, you know.
Speaker 2: Well she was also--always--Ethel was never thin, she was always sort of hefty, but beautiful, beautiful actress and singer, beautiful voice, beautiful smile, warm, warm, wonderful person.
Speaker 1: And what's that, Florence Mills?
Speaker 2: I don't remember seeing Florence Mills, but probably I did, yeah.
Story_ID: 151369
Speaker 1: Well tell us some more about growing up.  Now you went to the show every Monday with your mother--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh don't.  Yes, I went every Monday.  I told you in the beginning I wasn't particular--the school was not for me.  Two and two and all that, I really wanted to be an artist before, you know.  And my mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] had an understanding of that, we had an acquired understanding that I wanted to dance and I wanted to see as much theater as I possibly could.  And I wasn't bright, I wasn't stupid, I was just average child as far as two and two, and that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: But you knew you wanted to dance?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did you--what did you like to do in the neighborhood, you know when you could, would you do a lot of things that developed you as a dancer or I mean did you jump rope?
Speaker 2: Well, you know I was thinking the other day, I went back and thought about all the girlfriends I had and I didn't have many girlfriends because they weren't interested in that.  They couldn't understand it, they really weren't interested so that, that interest, dance and music and theater was me, you know.
Speaker 1: What other things did you like to do when you were--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, I used to ice skate, roller skate and what else, whatever children do.
Speaker 1: What kind of personality would you say you had when you were little--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I was like sweet as pie, sweet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Determined, very, very determined.
Story_ID: 151370
Speaker 1: You all had--I guess you had a phonograph or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had one of those crank ups and every record, my father [Walter James Jones] and mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] had every record from [John Philip] Sousa's marches, my mother loved marches.  My nephew, Gunther [ph.], he loves a parade, I think he got it from my mother, loved flags and parades and the marches.  She loved Sousa 'cause she used to go see Sousa's Band you know and we had those.  And then of course my father played the piano, I told you he played the harmonica, so he liked everything.  He liked the jazz, my mother liked the classics, so we had a wonderful record library.  In fact I have some very good seventy-eights downstairs, you know that I've had.
Story_ID: 151371
Speaker 1: Now what did your father [Walter James Jones] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father worked for Swift & Company.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Swift's at that time, had a market, Faneuil [Hall]--Faneuil park, Faneuil market--and they sold meats and that's all they sold.  And he was the main--all these new cuts of meat, you know they didn't just used to have steak that other thing, and now they have all everything.  And he helps Swift get all of those things straighten out, economy cuts.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so he was a butcher--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he ever get a chance to perform any himself?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he wasn't--no he--the only time he performed for us is, what we call supper, now they call it dinner, we used to call it supper.  And he got off work at five o'clock at night and at six, we'd all sit down and have supper.  And from five, while we're waiting for it to cook, he would play on the piano and he played Scott Joplin music, and he played whatever was popular.
Story_ID: 151372
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school that you attended?
Speaker 2: What do you mean, day school?
Speaker 1: Well you know grade school.
Speaker 2: Went to--I went to Concord [ph.]--what they call a Concord Street School, that was my first three years, and then I went to Everett [Elementary] School [Dorchester, Massachusetts] and then I went to [High School of] Practical Arts.
Speaker 1: Practical Arts, a high school?
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were in school four days a week and (laughing) But how did you like school when you were there, did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was okay.  This happened early when I went to elementary school, between four and eight.  When I went into high school, I didn't stay out at all.
Speaker 1: All right. What were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: History, I hated gym.
Speaker 1: Now that's strange, 'cause you're--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I know people thought--that has nothing to do with gym.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That has nothing to do with horse and the rings and those things.  And I, you know I didn't want to play any of the games or run in any of the races, I had nothing to do with that, and thank goodness I didn't have to.  In high school we got out at three o'clock and my gym teacher used to say, "Now Doris I want you to come--we're gonna do so and so."  I would go straight home; I wasn't interested in that kind of activity.  Besides, it developed all the wrong muscles.
Story_ID: 151373
Speaker 1: Are there any teachers in school that stand out as--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had two teachers when I was in the fourth.  A redhead, a redheaded Irishman by the name of Ike [ph.].  And I guess, I don't know what the other's name was Wigginbottom [ph.], they were very wonderful.  I can remember them because every year, they'd come from New York and do a little show at the school, and they come down and audition the children.  And they came down one year and they--I guess I was in the fourth grade, and they needed a dancer and my two teachers, Ike and Wigginbottom, they encouraged me, and, "Oh yes, you gonna win," but I didn't.  This pretty little blonde girl won and I was disgusted, they went to the principal and carried on but it didn't work.  But I remember then, and then I had a wonderful teacher in high school, Miss Rose, she taught English.  And I had a teacher that said to me every day, she taught mathematics, Miss Henderson.  She'd say, "Oh, your sister is so pretty, Celestine--just what happened to you?"  She worried me with that, and then I had one male teacher in high school by the name of Freeman, he taught history.  Those were the five teachers that I remember.
Story_ID: 151374
Speaker 1: So, now you started taking formal dance classes in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, yes, I was out of high school.  I first started, remember, with the tap, I told you about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how old were you when you started tapping?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was about fourteen or fifteen.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the first--yeah.
Speaker 2: And Johnny Brice [ph.] was the tap teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he taught you tap and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yes, he taught me tap and he took me over one time to Dimmers Grey [ph.] for class of a white teacher and he went in and had liquor on his breath and she got very upset.  And she called me asked me if I could come there and teach for her, if I'd come and teach.  And my mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones]--I told my mother about it and I said Miss Philbrook, her name was, will pay me, but my mother said no.  She said you don't need the money.  I don't want you to get paid for it, just ask Miss Philbrook to exchange the ballet classes for the tap, which she did, and we had a long relationship, years.
Speaker 1: And so you studied--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And I was the only black person that she ever talked to, she never had a black maid, or no black students, but she said you're different, but I wasn't, I wasn't.
Speaker 1: You were the only one that she knew.
Speaker 2: After she'd come, she have dinner with me and she.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're about age fourteen or fifteen?
Speaker 2: When I started teach for her, yes, I was about fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: Fifteen or sixteen.  So you started ballet sort of late in life, I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh very late, very late.
Speaker 1: Most girls start when--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Oh they should start by the time they're eight.
Story_ID: 149923
Speaker 1: My mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] was trying to find a ballet teacher for me and--
Speaker 2: This was when you were about eight years old?
Speaker 1: Eight years old, so she heard--read about Miss Philbrook, who was in the Gainsbourg Building there in (unclear) the Boston Conservatory Music, so she went over to Miss Philbrook and she called up on the phone and made an appointment with the secretary, she told Miss Philbrook, "I have a little girl, eight years old, very talented."  She said, "And I wonder if you'll take her."  She said, "I'll bring her any time, bring her morning, afternoon, evening, whatever, Saturday, Sunday, and pay you," she said.  "If you just take her."  Miss Philbrook said, "I would like to take her, but," she said, "I can't because I cannot take her by herself and she'd have to go in a class and the white students just will not be in a class with a black student."  So she said, "I can't recommend anyone," she said, "Just make her forget," you know.  So it's very interesting that was when I was what eight, when I was about eighteen or nineteen, and was Miss Philbrook and I was exchanging classes, I said to Miss Philbrook, "Oh come on over and have dinner with us one night, meet my family.  I'd like for you to meet my mother and father and sister."  She said, "Okay," and she came and I introduced my mother, and she met her and said hello and everything.  And my mother didn't mention to me, said this is the woman that I tried to get you to--well my mother died, and about thirty years later, Miss Philbrook and I were still friends, and we had acquired that house at Martha's Vineyard.  And I said [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was coming down to lecture one Sunday, and I said to her, I called her and said, "Oh come on down," her name was Lulu, "and spend the weekend with us and meet Mr. King.  I want you to hear him and see him."  So she came down and she spent the weekend with us, so after we left--after we left, it was Sunday, he talked to us Sunday we went home.  And while Miss [Claire] Haywood was getting dinner, Lulu and I walked over the island, and so she said, "You know, I don't understand Doris, what you people want."  I said, "We just want you to move over," I said, "You keep standing in front of us and we can't get by you, just move over."  So she started to cry, she said, "Well, you know, I have to tell you, your mother should have said that to me a long time ago, because she brought me to you.  She brought you to me and tried to make me take you and I would not take you."  And that's when I found out what had happened, my mother never said one word, she refused to mess up our relationship by telling her what--'cause my mother was dead at that time.  But I had so many interesting things happen to me.  That was one.  After Miss Philbrook told me, I said, "Oh, well you know you should be really angry," I said no, I wasn't angry, I just pitied her that she had to live with it.  And she had to live with it because at that time my--I was the only one in her school that had done anything with dance.  I was the only one, and my life has been filled with all those things.  I think it's strange because to me, it didn't seem that the dance was that important, but it made big errors and big holes in many people's lives.
Speaker 2: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Well, because I think--obviously very important to people.  And some people pay it no mind, they don't care if there's a good painting on the wall and or there's a good pianist playing the piano, but it's important to the lives and the fiber of many people's lives.  They'd starve to death without that fulfillment and some of them do, they don't know what's wrong with them.  It's missed from their lives and they can't figure out what it is they need, but you need those arts, the children need them.  Grown-ups need them, if you understand, what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 149924
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about how you started teaching dance.
Speaker 2: Well, you know I told you how I was asked by the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] to do something on their program, and I had three paying students at fifty cents a week (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: You started--I mean well tell us the whole story 'cause, you know when we were talking I--the tape wasn't rolling, so.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) tell us.
Speaker 2: Well I, I was teaching three little students, and--
Speaker 1: And you were still a teenager, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  And my sister's [Celestine Bayne] friend said, "Oh, Doris [HistoryMaker Doris Jones]," it was a (unclear), "we need to have you on the program; we're having a annual program, and we'd like to put you on the program."  I said, "I don't want to dance, but I would love for my children to dance."  So I got seven of them together, three of them were relatives.  Two were my nieces and one was my cousin, and then I got four other little people; and I gave them a little dance routine, my mother [Mattie Lightfoot Jones] made costumes for them.  And they danced; and they were so wonderful that, starting the following September, I had a registration of thirty people who called who wanted their children to come--still fifty cents a lesson.  That was--they came once a week, and I taught some ballet, but I wasn't really up on it yet.  So I stuck with the tap and every year the class--every year the class grew.  And I taught about ten--let me see about thirteen years in Boston [Massachusetts] before I came here.  And I went to--I used to go to Camp Atwater in East Brookfield, Massachusetts [sic. North Brookfield, Massachusetts].  (Unclear) De Berry [William De Berry] had a summer camp there.  He had the girls--the boys in July and the girls in August; and he--I went there as a camper and when I grew up and he found that I was teaching dancing, he asked me to come up and teach the month of July--month of August, when the girls were there.  So you had to be a counselor and do an activity, teach art or swimming or something.  So I said to him, "No, I don't want to come, 'cause I don't want to be a counselor."  I said, "I just want to teach dance."  So he said, "All right Miss Jones, you come up and you'll teach just dance," which I did.  And I used to do a program--I was up there for four weeks, at the end of two weeks, I'd do a program with the children, and the other two weeks I'd do another program.  He would invite rich people who had money and they'd come up and they'd be so fascinated with the, you know, what was accomplished in the dance, they'd make donations.  So after that, he said, "Well you don't ever have to be a counselor, all you do is put on this program twice a season."
Story_ID: 149925
Speaker 1: So I met some lovely friends up there, one year I went up, I met Claire Haywood and she was from Atlanta [Georgia].  Her father was the man that started Atlanta Life [Alonzo Herndon, sic].  And she came up--she taught art, and she came when I was practicing one day, she said, "Oh, you dance beautifully," she said, "Why don't you dance?"  I said, "I don't wanna dance, I wanna teach," so she said, "Where do you teach?"  I said, "I teach in Boston, Massachusetts, but I don't think I can get anywhere.  I can't make any professional dancers because most of those people want their children to take dance for recreation, occupation or something.  And I just wanna deal with children who can become professional dancers."  So she said, "You ought to come to Washington [D.C.], she said, "I think that there's a good, you know, place for you to develop a school."  Do you know Mamie Brown--you know Anne Brown who did Porgy and Bess?  Do you remember her, you don't remember Anne Brown.  Well Mamie Brown, her sister, was there and she was from Washington too, she said, "Doris, you'll do fine."  So I came on to Washington and that was when I was about twenty-five years old and I came here and started my school.  First--when I was first here, I didn't have a job and nobody knew me, so I worked at a--I took a job running an elevator and I ran the elevator until one Thanksgiving, the first Thanksgiving I was there.  I wanted to go home and I lived with Elsie Lewis, who died last year. And I said I want to have Thanksgiving dinner, I'm not coming to work on--so he fired me.  So I said okay, so then I went to the Recreation Department, they say, go to Recreation, Washington Recreation Department [sic, Washington, D.C. Department of Parks and Recreation] and they'll give you a job.  I met Miss Sue Allen [ph.] and she gave me a job.  So then I taught at the schools, every school in the city and during my travels, I worked so hard at one school, and I go running out and I caught pneumonia.  So then the doctor said, "You can stop that, you got to stop--you can't, you gotta teach in one place and the children have to come to you."  Well the Recreation couldn't do that, so then I said, I'll try to see if I can find a place where I can--and that's when I started my school.  This lady came to me, her name was Darling, Bernice Darling [ph.], she said to me, "I hear you teach dance."  I said, "Yes, but I'm teaching at Wake and Midway and it's so hard," that was during the war [World War II, WWII].  And that was when girls were coming from all over the country to work here in the government and they lived at Slowe Hall, where--I think Howard University [Washington, D.C.] has that place now.  And I used to go there at Slowe Hall and have classes and Miss Darling was there, and she said to me, why don't you come out and teach at our--I'll clean up my living room every Saturday, if you'll come out at ten o'clock and teach from ten to five.  And I have three classes of children from the neighborhood and you know you get paid.  So that's when I started my class at northeast.  Well it got so large, that I couldn't go out there into her living room, so then I said well, I'll see if the people will come in to northeast in a town, it's northeast, way out, northeast of town.  So Miss Lewis, the lady I was living with, said, well you know you can use my basement, she said I'll let you fix it up, however, and you can use it.  So for a couple of years, I used it, but it was cement floor, so then I found that I couldn't do that.  Cause children couldn't leap and it was low ceiling, they couldn't get up, and so.  Then I said, well, I'll see what I can rent, and I went to the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and they had a beautiful big room, and they let me rent that every afternoon, and that's when I started having school.  Then at that time, Miss Haywood was taking classes with me and she got to be a wonderful student and she said, "Doris, I want to be a good teacher," now she was way up in the government, seventeen or eighteen, way up there.  And I said, "Okay," so she taught for me in the afternoons and then the school got so big, she said, "Well I may as well leave" and she said, "We'll buy--we'll rent a studio."  Because sometimes that YWCA would be busy, they'd have meetings or something; we'd have to postpone classes.
Story_ID: 149926
Speaker 1: So then we [Jones and Claire Haywood] bought--we rented this place on U Street [Washington, D.C.], which was a very fine--it's coming back, it was very--anything on U Street was really top notch.  So then we got our school on U Street, we rented this building, had two stories and three little studios--not particularly big.  And then we started our school there, and it grew and grew and grew.  So finally we got--decided, well now if we're gonna make these ballet dancers, they can't come once a week; they have to come twice a week.  That went all right.  And the next year, they had to come three times a week; then the next year, they had to come four times a week.  And that's when the people said, "Oh, no, my child can't be--no four times a week.  I can't afford it and I can't afford to get them there; it's too much coming back and forth."  So we said, "Okay, well we'll take three children who--," you know.  And they began to see that the difference between the child who came twice a week, and the child that came four times a week was a big difference.  Then they began to realize that if they wanted their children really to dance, they had to be in the studio.  So then, now the children take four times a week: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday--(unclear) Friday, we never worked on Fridays; we always had Fridays and Sundays off.  And that's when the school grew, and we began to make dancers.  And then we realized we had to have a small company because there's no--these people were dancing so well, there was no place for them to dance.  So then we had an, assemble professional company and it just grew.
Speaker 2: Now when did you establish the company?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-one [1941].
Speaker 2: So that--so--and what's the name of the company?
Speaker 1: Capitol Ballet Company.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Capitol with an O.
Story_ID: 149927
Speaker 1: How did people receive the ballet company [Capitol Ballet Company]?
Speaker 2: Oh, they supported it beautifully.  We had a wonderful guild, we had wonderful presidents, a man named Clyde [ph.] was our first president.  Our most important president was a white man by the name of Robert Cantrell.  And he's the one who introduced us to the Russians, took us into the French Embassy to dance, the English Embassy to dance, The White House.  And he's the one who made the contact with the Russians for us to take that little girl over in 1973 to be in the ballet competition.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I don't want to get too far ahead, but--it's got to be a big story between '41 [1941] and '73 [1973] that's thirty-two years of teaching--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, yeah, Punkie, that's her name, [HM] Sandra [Fortune] Green, beautiful dancer, I wished she had gone on professionally but she wouldn't go on professionally.  But anyway, Sandra came to us when she was ten years old and her mother brought--she wasn't particularly pretty and sort of gangly and funny and but a beautiful worker, and dedicated.  Whatever she did, bake a cake, it was the best cake it could be or whatever, so she came to us and we started to training and all of a sudden we had this beautiful-she grew into this beautiful young lady, beautiful skin, beautiful looking girl, golden.  And we had a boy by the name of Sylvester Campbell; we had him when we first opened at the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association].  And he wanted to dance, some beautiful dancer and when he graduated from high school, he went to New York and he auditioned for George Balanchine, and George Balanchine said that he couldn't dance.  So then he said, "Well Miss Jones," he said, "I'm going to Europe;" he said, "I'll never get a chance here," so he did.
Story_ID: 149928
Speaker 1: Anyway, and Sylvester [Campbell] went to Europe and of course in Europe, they're not messy, if you're good you're good, and if you're good you're recognized, and if you're good, you get a chance.
Speaker 2: So it's not political like it is here.
Speaker 1: He had worked with--I don't think he was the English ballet, the Royal Ballet, but he went to the French (unclear) and then he ended up in the Netherlands and they loved him.  They made him the premier, the number one dancer and he was beautiful, they loved him.  So then, he decided to come back here, he said I've been over in Europe and he said, "I want my people to see me dance before I'm too old."  So we said, "Okay Sylvester, we'll have you as a guest artist with the--with our Capitol Ballet Company," so he came over and he needed a partner and he saw [HM] Sandra [Fortune-Green], and he fell in love with her, and they both were golden beautiful dancers.  And she had been to Europe, and that's the way it started.  Then of course behind them came Hinton Battle, Chita Rivera and all those people.
Speaker 2: Tell us about some of them.
Speaker 1: Hinty [Hinton Battle]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He's multi-talented, choreography, music--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Hinty, how do you spell that?
Speaker 1: Hinton.
Speaker 2: Hinton?
Speaker 1: Battle.
Speaker 2: Hinton Battle, okay.
Speaker 1: He at thirteen could out-dance anybody and he went to New York [New York].  He went to School of American Ballet (unclear) and he went there on scholarship.  And they gave him six hundred dollars a month that was for his room and his board and everything.  And we say--I say don't give that child six hundred dollars a month, he's had fifty cents a week, but they gave it to him anyway.  That was his room and he lived with his uncle.  And something odd happened, I don't know if it was a murder or something happened at his Uncle's house, and they found out Hinton was living with him and they made him come back, 'cause he was about thirteen or fourteen.  Made him come back to Washington [D.C.] and finish his high school, then he could go back, and then he came back here.  And when he was seventeen years old, when he finished high school, they were auditioning for the Wizard of Oz and he went up one day and the next day he was, you know taken for that he did the Wizard, the stage show.
Speaker 2: The one that [HM] Geoffrey Holder was the director of?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's where he started, then he did 'Sophisticated Lady,' he got two or three Emmy Awards, you know.
Speaker 2: He was in the movie 'The Wiz?'
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.  No, Judy Garland, no.
Speaker 2: No, 'The Wiz' with Diana Ross.
Speaker 1: Was he in that?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: I guess so, that's the one [HM] Louis Johnson did.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 149929
Speaker 1: What about Chita Rivera? (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Well (chuckling).
Speaker 1: I didn't know she was--was she a black dancer?
Speaker 2: Chita was just a glorious dancer and actress, a singer, a comedienne.  She was all those things with a good dance background Chita was the one--many of them, they was so well trained technically, that they never had an injury.  Chita had an automobile accident and that's the only injury that she ever had the landing, jumping and landing and all that, you know she--but anyway, she went when she graduated from high school, Miss Himberman [ph.] and I took [HM] Louis [Johnson] and Chita to New York [New York] to audition for a scholarship for School of American Ballet.  And we took then up and Mr. Balanchine came in, he came in, he saw that she was a friend of--a daughter of a friend of his who was a Puerto Rican comedian, by the name of Figueroa, so that's why he came in and he auditioned her.  And he gave them a scholarship and Louis [Johnson] stayed at School of American Ballet a long time.  But women are so vicious, and Chita was so talented, they, some of the teachers there told her, you'll never be a ballet dancer, why don't you just go in the, you know stage and musicals.  So they were auditioning for some--one of Ethel Merman, one of her shows.  I forget which one it was 'Call Me Madam' or, so she went to audition for that, and they took her.  Well after she went there, and I don't know what the salary was, probably two hundred dollars a week.  She didn't know how to--she thought that was heaven.  So she left school, and started traveling with this show, and that's really what cut her off of her ballet work.  And I'm glad, because she turned out to be a fantastic artist.  She was another pure, religious, dedicated person to the art, and she gave everything to it.  And she learned from other people, she grew so beautifully and then she went on--she did everything, every show under the sun.  Until she made Spiderwoman, which I think was fabulous.  I don't know whether you saw it?
Speaker 1: 'Kiss of the Spiderwoman'?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, she was wonderful in that, along with every other thing, but that was hers alone.  She didn't share it with any other dancer or singer or anything.  Like 'Chicago,' I mean with just a part that she played.  And she--and after that, she got, she got the Kennedy Central Award and now she's on Broadway in "Nine," she staring there and I think, you know, she's.  And Hinton went on; he did all kinds of things.  He writes music, he sings, he choreographs, he dances, just musical theater, both of them, they do everything.  Now Sandra didn't, she was just a ballet dancer.  Sylvester would not wiggle his hips one bit, he was a ballet dancer.  Louis, he's another talented boy--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: What was his name Louis?
Speaker 2: [HM] Louis Johnson.
Speaker 1: Louis Johnson.
Speaker 2: He was something else again.  Louis could work with his hands, he could make clothes, he could design costumes, he can paint.  He had a loft in New York, you know, great big loft, I wish you could've seen it, it was beautiful.  He does everything, now he's really frustrated.  'Cause he wanted to be a dancer and he could jump higher than anybody and do everything and he--they wouldn't let him.  They pushed Mitchell; they went to school together, but what a talent.  Some of them would just, would challenge it, but only one thing, ballet, Sylvester [Campbell] ballet, he could make costumes.  But Louis did everything; and he had such wonderful taste in colors, in furniture, in fabric.  Where do they get that from?  They're not raised with it; they brought up in an ordinary house with a kitchen table and four kitchen chairs, where does it come from?  That, I think about, and I love to think about it, you know.
Story_ID: 151375
Speaker 1: Ma'am, have you ever had any tough times?
Speaker 2: Yes, I love tough times, makes me work hard, keeps me alive.
Speaker 1: What kinds of the things have happened over the years?
Speaker 2: Well, we [Doris Jones and Claire Haywood] needed money to build a studio to get the equipment, bars and mirrors and things.  But they wouldn't give two black women money for a black school [the Jones-Haywood School of Ballet] and we when we bought this house was--this house was--we found out one of our friends told us about this house.  We came by and we knew it--we were trying to buy the place where we could have a school and home all in one place.  And we came by here and Mrs. Hodgeton [ph.] was here and we loved the place.  So we submitted a contract on it and I forget what the price was, the house was.  As soon as she found out that we were black and had cash, went up about two or three thousand dollars on the price, but we finally got it and we moved in.  And that week we moved in, it was filthy, the downstairs they had used for the kitchen-well it was a family home.  Downstairs was a kitchen, dining room, living room and where the studio is, was a backyard.  And the family--Mrs. Hodgeton, her name was Madeline [ph.], Madeline wanted to have a girl's dance class, so they put that building that's down there in the backyard.  And then they got--they moved out, and gave her the whole house, which she rented this spot and had her school down there.  But after the riots--well you know they killed [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], remember, you remember that?  And they had these riots, the white people moved out of this part [of Washington, D.C.], so she sold the house and that's when we got it.  And we moved in on a--we moved in on a Friday and opened school a week.  And that week we had to paint and clean and get everything straightened out.  Claire [Haywood] and I did all that work.
Story_ID: 151376
Speaker 1: Now do you have a particular philosophy of dance or the way that you teach dance that's different from other people perhaps?
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't, but Miss [Claire] Haywood did, she wanted to go through her students' brains, brain and then body.  I did the other way, I wanted the body to get the feel of it and then the brain to take over it and remember it.
Speaker 1: So you wanted--you had two opposite goals and you were trying--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well she was Claire and I was Doris.
Speaker 1: But how did it work out?
Speaker 2: Very well, we never had a disagreement.  We argued and we fight, so and so, but you know.  We realized that and many people try to--"Oh Miss Jones told me we could do this, or Miss Haywood," but we never paid any attention to that.  I'd tell Claire, "Did you say--" she'd say, "No, I didn't tell her that" or you know.  We were old enough to treat life like that.
Story_ID: 151377
Speaker 1: Tell me what do you think has been the highlight of your career in dance?
Speaker 2: Well, perseverance, beating my head against that wall, and the fact that I have such an alumnus--alumni all over the world.  People who still love me, and still write to me and call me after years and years.
Story_ID: 151378
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well, when I came to Washington [D.C.], Washington was a wonderful place and wonderful schools, wonderful teachers, wonderful students.  Students graduated, went to all the paths, went to Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts], went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], school were wonderful.  I don't know happened, what happened, what happened to the children who became vicious and mean or to the teachers who got old and were replaced with inferior teachers.  I don't know what happened, but I know when I first came to Washington, these schools were very tremendous.  Dunbar were wonderful students and wonderful teachers, but now, you know if you don't say ain't it this or ain't it that or did I do this you know what I mean?  The way they speak and their manners, 'cause here in the school we tried to get that straighten out.  You got to help your neighbor be nice to them, speak well, don't steal from--you got to be a decent person to be in the school.  We can't keep the child in this school that way and we don't keep the child.  Besides, I don't care if their family dances, they have to go.  And what's happened to Washington, I don't know, most, even the private schools are screwed up.
Speaker 1: So you think things have kind of regressed you know maybe?
Speaker 2: Have we?  Yes.
Story_ID: 151379
Speaker 1: How would you--do you think that we need more arts in the schools today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well they just put that on TV every day, you know they're taking it out of the school.  That's because we have someone, a leader who doesn't care about our life.  I've spoken to you about that, I told you, haven't any soul for art.
Speaker 1: So how did--now in the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s] at--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh those were beautiful days.  We started the company in '41 [1941], Washington [D.C.] was neither black nor white; they all together and working together, it's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't finish the question, but you know, late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s] there sort of a black art resurgence in the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: People writing poetry, a lot of plays were produced, a lot of dance groups popped up, some were doing ballet and modern dance, African dance, you know.  This became popular too; I mean how did that affect you--? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, I loved--well I'll tell you, in two ways.  I love the African dance, the drums give me a headache but I like it naturally the rhythm is fascinating, makes you want to move.  But--and I never could--I could never do the African dance, I didn't think that I--the drums couldn't sway me, you know  But it is beautiful, it's really beautiful, when it's done beautifully.  The Boot Dance [ph.], but I never played with African dance because, African dance has to do with the harvest and marriage, that sort of thing, it tells the story.  I don't know anything about that.
Speaker 1: You don't think that ballet doesn't tell a story?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure it does, but African tends--tells a real story, it's happening out there, but ballet is a made up story, 'Sleeping Beauty' or 'Cinderella,' those things are made up stories.  The story of 'The Nutcracker,' but African is real, you know, they're stories about real people.
Story_ID: 151380
Speaker 1: Ma'am, at this juncture, what would you see and I think you talked about it some--oh I know what we haven't discussed, the trip to Russia.  Yeah, tell us about that trip. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well, how did it start?  That fabulous place that we have, [Robert] Cantrell, he was a wonderful American.  I think he was really an American, not black, not white, just American.  A lot of people say I'm American, but dammed they don't act like it, but he was an American.
Speaker 1: What do you mean by that, you mean he's somebody that really believe in the ideals or--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Really acts that way, and knows that he's an American, where his responsibilities lie.  That was Cantrell and his wonderful family.  And he made friends with the Russians.  He was--Washington, Mayor [Walter Edward] Washington was Mayor of the city and Cantrell was his secretary.  And he had to deal with all the Embassies and every-the noise?
Speaker 1: Hold on a second.
Speaker 2: Okay, where you wanna go?
Speaker 1: Okay.  We were talking about the trip to Russia, Mr. Cantrell.
Speaker 2: Oh, Robert, he was friend with Embassy, and we danced for the Embassies and we went over to the Russian Embassy and met the people over there and so he--they used to come to our concert, the Ambassador was--they were very friendly.  It was during the Cold War and they really wanted to make friends with the black Americans to show the white Americans, you know about how they liked black people, so they invited [HM] Sandra [Fortune-Green] to come to Russia to dance in their first [sic, second] ballet competition, which they had every four years.  And so she accepted and we raised twenty thousand dollars so that she could go.  She had to go with her partner; she had to have a partner do the pas de deux, and we got a very beautiful boy from--Clover Mathis, black as tar but beautiful looking and he said he'd go.  So he came down the whole year, that week he came down and they worked together.  And finally we got money and we went and they fell in love with Sandra.  There's a lot of information about her--the picture, the program and everything that happened to her--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: What's her last name again?
Speaker 2: Her name is Sandra Fortune, but her married name is Green.
Speaker 1: So, how was it trying to get a whole group to Russia, what do you think of Russia when you got there?
Speaker 2: I loved it, people would--you know, we're dopes, they told us you have to take stuff to clean the toilet, don't do this, don't take that.  We got over there, beautiful luxurious bathrooms in the hotels, not much food, cause they didn't have much food.  They had meat pies, they had strawberries and they had beautiful cream, whipping cream, sad coffee.  They used to have--they'd bring little chickens from the countryside already cooked and they--you know, you could go in and buy a chicken, food was terrible.  But that Bolshoi Theatre, we don't have anything like it.  The beautiful mahogany furniture, the velvet, red velvet carpeting and cover of the furniture, we don't have nothing like they have over there.
Speaker 1: No place in the USA, have anything that's comparable to that?
Speaker 2: Well, no, Boscia [ph.] La Scala Italy has, but The Bolshoi is gorgeous, it's big, that's what Bolshoi means, big.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful--Kennedy Center, they have all these old sitting rooms with furniture and draperies and the theater, the stage is actually almost as big as a football field.  Four thousand people work at the Bolshoi Theater in the basement.  They made their own dyes, they made their own ballet shoes, they made their own--I don't know what it is now, I don't think it's that way now, but at that time, their athletes and their dance artists and those people, treated like kings and queens.
Speaker 1: Four thousand people.
Speaker 2: Worked down there, made everything.
Story_ID: 151381
Speaker 1: Now how many people did you take over to Russia?
Speaker 2: Just two, Miss [Claire] Haywood and I went and the two dancers, [HM] Sandra [Fortune-Green] and Clover.  Sandra was--Clover was not competing, Sandra was.
Speaker 1: So how did she do?
Speaker 2: She did beautifully the first night she--well, the first night she did on cue and she was gorgeous.  And of course the first time they seen a black ballerina, they were fascinated.  The Russian--the program I have around here somewhere, they came backstage and made paintings of her and she was in Pravda, the Russian newspaper, I think was on a Monday and Tuesday they wanted to choose, she was in Pravda, but Sandra was about nineteen and a friend of hers was getting married and she was gonna be the girl's bridesmaid or maid of honor, we didn't know that.  And so her mother told her, now don't stay over there, but she--the second round she won the first round and then the second round, she threw it all away, she just fell all over the stage.
Speaker 1: Was it--what happened?
Speaker 2: Well she--if she had won, she would've had to stay there two or three weeks, cause they go--the winners go to the other cities, Moscow and Leningrad, and she would've had to done that, then she would have missed the wedding.
Speaker 1: She had intentionally--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: And the boy, Clover, he cried, cause he knew, he was her partner; he knew she wasn't acting right.  Yep.
Speaker 1: How did you feel, how did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Well, we knew--we watched her from the wings and this particular dance was easy for her, where she could just (unclear) away, so we knew the minute, you know, she got there, you know, that she was just falling all over the stage.
Speaker 1: So what did you all do, did you--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: What could we do?
Speaker 1: What did she say to about it?
Speaker 2: Nothing, not a thing.
Speaker 1: So okay.  So it's one of these things that just--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Nothing you could do about it.
Speaker 2: Yep, what could you do about it?
Speaker 1: Okay, so, All right.  So did she continue to dance after that time?
Speaker 2: Well, she tried to give it up, but we wouldn't let her give it up, but she would never--she was offered many good dance positions, but she would never go.  She just didn't want to be a professional dancer, I guess, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What does she do now, if you know?
Speaker 2: She teaches dance at Duke Ellington [School of the Arts, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: That's a school here in [Washington] D.C.?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 151382
Speaker 1: When you look back over the years, now you won numerous awards and been honored--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, I have.
Speaker 1: What do you think was your biggest honor?
Speaker 2: Martin Luther King Award.
Speaker 1: That's given by, by who?
Speaker 2: The President of George Washington University [Washington, D.C.], I forget what his name is [Stephen Joel Trachtenberg].
Speaker 1: When you look over all these years, what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Gee, I don't know, has to do with children achieving.  And I think about it--you're interested in me because of my teaching and dance.  But I was just interested in making good citizens through the dance, through the discipline of the dance.
Story_ID: 151383
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Mattie Lightfoot Jones and Walter James Jones] get a chance to see you become successful as a dancer?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My mother always expected it; my father didn't really realize it until it really happened, but my mother was definitely, knew that it would happen.
Speaker 1: Ma'am is there anything that you would do differently if you had to do over?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, I keep thinking, I put so much work into people who didn't have the discipline, could've been dancers and what.  I wish I had put that on myself, that energy, that time, that planning that they led me believe that they were going to do it and they didn't do it.  Maybe I gave away too much.
Speaker 1: How else would you have used that energy?
Speaker 2: I would have developed my own talents.
Story_ID: 151384
Speaker 1: Lastly, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Gee whiz, I don't want to be remembered, I just wanna be around here all the time (laughing).  Remembered?  Well, I don't know, I just, I just want people to remember me as a hard--a person who wanted to go someplace, not by myself, but with gangs of people, with a whole entourage with me.
Story_ID: 151385
