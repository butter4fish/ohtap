 Finchum Today is February 17, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum, and along  with me is Alex Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University, and  today we are in Stillwater, Oklahoma, to interview Ruth Martin. This is  part of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for having us  today.  Martin You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s begin by having you tell us when and where you were born.  Martin I was born December 11, 1915, about four miles out from the little town  of Isabella, Oklahoma.  Finchum I   m not sure where that is.  Martin It   s about thirty-five miles from Enid.  Finchum Okay, so a little north of us. What did your parents do for a living?  Martin At that time they were farmers.  Finchum What did they farm?  Martin (Laughs)  Finchum Anything and everything?  Martin Oh we farmed wheat, a wheat farm.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  5  Martin I had two brothers.  Finchum Older or younger?  Martin Younger. One was seven years younger and the other was eleven.  Mother had three families.  Finchum Three?  Martin Because of our births.  Finchum She got everyone out of diapers before she had the next one.  Martin (Laughs) Right.  Finchum Were they from Oklahoma, your parents?  Martin No. I   m not real sure about my Grandpa Hall   s family, but I think they  came from Ohio. My mother   s family came from Kansas.  Finchum Haws, H-A-W-S, or H-A-L-L-S?  Martin Just H-A-L-L.  Finchum Okay, and so it was a wheat farm. Did you live out on the farm?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Did you have chores?  Martin No, we moved from that farm. My grandfather had made the Run, but  we moved back here to Stillwater. I don   t remember how many years  we lived here at Stillwater. Then we moved to Ponca City. My dad was  the assistant manager of the store there in Ponca City, a Piggly Wiggly.  Finchum A Piggly Wiggly. Oh a grocery store   Martin Right.  Finchum He didn   t much like farming then?  Martin I think he liked the wheat farming, yes. I don   t know for sure, but I kind  of think it was my mother that     Finchum Funny how that works, isn   t it?  6  Martin Right. (Laughter)  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  Martin I went out here to Pleasant Valley my first year.  Finchum Really? That   s the building that   s on Sangre and Nineteenth now?  Martin Yes, and then we moved to Isabella, and I went to school there in the  little town.  Finchum What was the name of that school, do you remember?  Martin It was probably just Isabella.  Finchum Was it through the eighth grade?  Martin Yes.  Finchum And then where did you go to high school?  Martin Ponca City. Then the Great Depression hit us. We moved out here on a  farm that was my grandmother   s. That   s where we lived a while. My  daughter and her family have a nice house out there now.  Finchum Still have the land in the family. What year did you graduate from high  school? In 1932 maybe, or    33?  Martin I lost a half of a semester because of the Depression. We had to move.  We lost our home in town and so that meant we moved. We moved  back here out on the farm where     Finchum And the farm was in Payne County?  Martin It is in Payne County, yes.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject while you were in school?  Martin Oh I suppose after I really learned how to read, I liked reading and  books.  Finchum Novels or biographies?  Martin Historical novels were the ones that I enjoyed.  Finchum After you graduated from high school, what did you do?  7  Martin I got married. (Laughter)  Finchum (Laughs) And what was his name?  Martin Loren Martin.  Finchum And how did you meet him?  Martin You   ve heard of probably, maybe you haven   t, Brush Arbor meetings?  Well, we met at a Brush Arbor meeting.  Bishop What   s a Brush Arbor meeting?  Finchum He doesn   t know. Do you want to explain it?  Martin A church would build an arbor, that   d be logs or whatever, and covered.  Then they would have a preacher there that would preach and challenge  you to live the way the Lord wants you to live.  Finchum Kind of like a revival?  Martin Yeah, we don   t have very many of those anymore.  Finchum No.  Martin That   s the thing that bothers me the most is how great we have changed  in this hundred years.  Finchum Good and bad changes.  Martin Yes, but naturally if you put a dot on a paper you   re going to see the  dot, so you are inclined to see them. (Laughter) There   s lots of good,  but there   s lots of changes that have been bad for us.  Finchum You   ve seen a lot too. Do you remember seeing your first car?  Martin Yeah, we had a Dort. (Laughs)  Finchum A Dart?  Bishop A Dort.  Martin Dort.  Finchum I   m not sure what a Dort is.  8  Martin It looks like   well it was like Henry Ford   s car, only it was a little more  plush. Not a great deal, but just a little bigger. I think they lasted about  ten years.  Finchum Did you learn to drive on it?  Martin No, I was just a little kid. I did drive it in the pasture one time while  Dad was fixing a fence. I would drive from pole to pole or to post to  post.  Finchum Was it black? Do you remember what color it was?  Martin Yes, it was black. It was black all its life. (Laughs)  Finchum Before you got the car how would you get from one place to another?  Martin That was before I was born. I guess it was horse and buggy.  Finchum How would you get to school?  Martin Walked. Went out here to Pleasant Valley my first year.  Finchum And you walked? Rain, snow, sleet, whatever?  Martin Yes, but it wasn   t ten miles. (Laughs)  Finchum Or uphill?  Martin No. (Laughter)  Finchum So you got married in what year? Do you recall?  Martin Let   s see, I went back to school when I was forty-two. Do you, Joyce,  remember?  Drew Which year you got married? Nineteen thirty-nine.  Finchum  In  1939.  Martin That   s when I was married.  Finchum Did you get married in a church?  Martin Yes, a church that was here but that is no longer here.  9  Finchum Did you have a special dress?  Martin Yes, made my dress.  Finchum You did?  Martin It wasn   t satin, but it was white. (Laughs)  Finchum Make your own pattern or buy one? Do you remember?  Martin I don   t remember.  Finchum Long or short?  Martin Long.  Finchum And did you go on a honeymoon?  Martin Yes. We went to Winona Lake, Indiana.  Finchum Okay.  Martin That was the church affiliated camp.  Finchum And what did he do for a living? Your husband?  Martin He was the accountant for   now here I always have a brain   I want to  say World Impact, but that   s not it.  Finchum Accountant   s good enough, that   s fine. It was here in Stillwater?  Martin No, it was Oklahoma City.  Finchum So you   ve always lived in Oklahoma?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Just various places in Oklahoma.  Martin Yes, many places.  Finchum You have a favorite place in Oklahoma?  Martin I don   t know, I don   t think so.  Finchum Where do you consider home?  10  Martin Stillwater. Yeah, my grandparents had a farm out there by the Pleasant  Valley schoolhouse.  Finchum What did they raise?  Martin I suppose you   d say various things. I can remember corn, but     Finchum Dairy? Did they have a dairy?  Martin No.  Finchum You have to milk some cows anyway?  Martin No, I asked to, which was a stupid thing to do. (Laughs) I asked to learn  how to milk a cow, but I didn   t have to do very many things.  Finchum Did you get the hang of it?  Martin Yeah  Might be able to do it yet. (Laughter)  Finchum Who taught you how to sew? If you made your wedding dress, who  taught you how to sew?  Martin My mother, and I had one class in school.  Finchum A home ec.-type class?  Martin Yes, made a dress.  Finchum Where would you get your fabric?  Martin We had Montgomery Ward   s and Sears then, so probably one of them.  Finchum Mail order?  Martin No, we didn   t use the mail order very much.  Finchum Had a Montgomery Ward store?  Martin They had here in Oklahoma   in Stillwater they had Katz that     Finchum That   s right, and they had fabric?  Martin I   m not real sure.  11  Finchum I   m not sure either. They may have had everything.  Martin They had a lot.  Finchum Did you have children?  Martin Three.  Finchum Three?  Martin Yes, there   s one, Joyce. They live here, and a girl and her family lives  in Texas, close to Tyler. Then I have a son and his family that live in  Canon City, Colorado.  Finchum Scattered a little bit. Did you space them like your mother spaced hers?  Martin (Laughs) Well, they all have about four years in-between them.  Finchum Out of diapers too then before the next one. You mentioned you went  back to school when you were forty-two?  Martin Yes.  Finchum How did that come about?  Martin My husband had ulcers and he had a bleeding ulcer that wouldn   t stop.  So they took out three-fourths of his stomach. So that left us with the  idea that maybe I better have something to do in case I needed to. That  was the reason I went back to school, but he lived until he was in his  seventies, and he was able to eat. Some could scarcely eat. It   s like  these that they have today. They   re a success and some of them aren   t.  Finchum Where did you go back to   where did you go to college?  Martin To the Nazarene College in Bethany.  Finchum And what was your major?  Martin I started out with speech, but then I got married and I decided I wanted  to teach children instead of teenagers, so I finished up with a   for grade  school. I went on and got my masters.  Finchum From there? Same place?  Martin Yes. No. I got my master   s at Edmond.  12  Finchum Oh, UCO?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Central Oklahoma. Then did you teach?  Martin Twenty-four years.  Finchum What grade?  Martin First grade or fourth grade.  Finchum Takes a lot of patience, doesn   t it?  Martin (Laughs) Yes.  Finchum You like one better than the other?  Martin I liked first grade, because it was that time, then, when they learned to  read, but I liked the fourth grade because they were more curious     well, not more curious, better than the first grade.  Finchum Ready to learn more?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Where did you teach?  Martin In the Bethany Public School, a suburb of Oklahoma City. I guess that   s  what you   d call it.  Finchum That   s a suburb, bedroom community. In those twenty-four years did  much change within the school system?  Martin Quite a bit, but it   d always change back. Our superintendent, one of the  things, first thing, they told me was that schools were always changing,  and you   ve seen that. (Laughs)  Finchum By forty-two your children were already grown or in high school, so  that   s why you went back too?  Martin Yeah.  Finchum And then you retired.  Martin Yes.  13  Finchum What did you do after you retired?  Martin What did I do? (Laughs) Move up here.  Finchum Travel any?  Drew You went to Europe soon after you retired, you and Daddy.  Finchum Traveled some?  Martin Yes, we went to Europe. Got to go to Europe two times. It was  interesting.  Finchum Where in Europe?  Martin Well, the first time we went just to England. We joined a tour group and  nine other countries: Holland, and France, and Italy   I don   t remember  the rest of them.  Finchum That   s okay. It was a fun trip?  Martin Yes.  Finchum And then the second time.  Martin My youngest granddaughter and I went.  Finchum Just the two of you?  Martin Yes.  Finchum That was special.  Martin Yes.  Finchum Go to England or     Martin We went to England and we stayed quite a little bit in Wales. We liked  that. It   s an interesting little country, but pretty too. It was green and  maybe not as green as Ireland. We didn   t get to go to Ireland.  Finchum And did you like London?  Martin Not any more than any big city. (Laughs) It was more unique of course.  14  Finchum Changing of the guards.  Martin Yes, I watched that.  Finchum The only other thing I can think of is Big Ben?  Martin I stood under Big Ben when it chimed its noon-day.  Finchum That   s pretty neat. You plan to do that?  Martin No, it just worked out that way. We   d gone to the church that Queen  Elizabeth goes to. Then we went across from there, there was a  restaurant on the other side, so we could   but it came at that particular  moment for us to be     Finchum Meant to be.  Martin Yes. I had always dreamed of hearing a lark. We don   t have them, not  these particular kind, but that   s another story though.  Finchum That   s okay, did you hear one?  Martin Yes. We rented a cottage and the first evening we were there, why, I  saw this little bird take off and it sang all the way up in the air and all  the way down. But that   s in England. We have birds here, too. (Laughs)  Finchum Are you a bird-watcher?  Martin Yeah, I   m one of those stupid birdwatchers. (Laughs)  Finchum They   re not stupid   Martin I heard somebody say that one time. (Laughs) She didn   t know that I  was around, but anyway.  Finchum I like to listen to them. I don   t know too much about them, but I like to  listen.  Martin Yeah, I know most of them around here, what they are.  Bishop What   s your favorite native bird?  Martin I suppose a cardinal. However, the little chickadee is a mighty funny  little bird. They   re so tiny. They   re almost, not quite, but almost as tiny  as the hummingbird.  15  Finchum I see those once in a while. Chickadees, I   m not sure I would know what  they were.  Martin They wear a little black cap.  Finchum Okay, I   ll pay attention. Cardinals we see from time to time.  Martin We   ve had   the most we   ve seen, six I think, this year   at one time.  Finchum I   ve been told that they don   t live in California because they can   t make  it over the Rockies.  Martin (Laughs)  Finchum I don   t know if that   s true or not.  Martin Well, they don   t, that   s right, but I doubt that   s     Finchum That   s the reason? (Laughs)  Martin Right. It seems like in every state there are certain birds that are not in  the other states.  Finchum Like the scissortail that   s here.  Martin Yes, I never view anymore of them.  Finchum I had never seen one until I moved here. I   m from Tennessee. I hadn   t  seen one there. They   re neat to watch, though, with their tails going.  Martin I   ve got a picture in there that I drew.  Finchum So you   re an artist?  Martin Not exactly, but I can draw a straight line. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you paint or just sketch?  Martin I did a little bit of all of it.  Finchum After you were in college or before? When did you get started?  Martin I guess I doodled on practically all the paper I had. I was going to  school.  Finchum Doodled, you have a little creativity.  16  Martin I guess that   s what you call it. (Laughs) Anyway, it was fun.  Finchum Did you sew and make your kids clothes?  Martin I didn   t sell anything, but I made the girls their clothes. I made David  one outfit, boys clothes are harder to make.  Finchum Did you quilt?  Martin My grandmother was making me a quilt for my wedding, so I went to  visit her and learned how to quilt a little bit down near at the end. That   s  all I   ve ever   that   s not mine   that   s too tedious.  Finchum And it takes a lot of time. Did she finish it for you? The one that she  started?  Martin Yes, and then when we lived out east of town in Oklahoma City  somebody broke into our house and took it.  Finchum Do you remember what pattern it was?  Martin No. But she had a top,    Road to Oklahoma    and I do have it finished.  Finchum    Road to Oklahoma,    I   ve seen that.  Martin It   s a whole lot of little blocks.  Finchum Yeah, little   like two-inch squares, yes. That   s a shame that someone  stole yours. So you lived in Enid, Isabell a , Stillwater, Oklahoma City,  Ponca City. Any place else?  Martin Did you name Bethany?  Finchum No, Bethany.  Martin That   s where we   at the edge of Bethany is where we spent     Finchum Most of your married life?  Martin Right.  Finchum Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  17  Martin Yes, I rode in my first airplane. Wasn   t   maybe it wasn   t the first one I  saw, but my brother who was about sixteen had learned how to fly one.  Right out here on the corner of Lakeview and     Drew Country Club. (Whispers)  Finchum Country Club?  Martin I can   t read lips. (Laughs) Yeah, my brother had a little one-seater, so  he took me up. We flew around. I like to fly.  Finchum At sixteen he was a pilot?  Martin Yeah. That was back   I don   t suppose he had to have a pilot   s license  or anything, probably. If he did, he broke the law. (Laughs)  Finchum Did he have his own plane?  Martin He and I think the boy   s name was Payne, they had the plane together.  There may have been some others, I don   t know. He   they shared.  Finchum So how old would you have been, roughly?  Martin Don   t tell me I have to do numbers. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have to ask your mother permission before you went up with  him?  Martin No. (Laughs)  Finchum Did she know you were going up with him?  Martin I don   t remember that there was anybody with us that day except his  wife, and I guess my husband was out there too.  Finchum You were older then. I need to do my math, because you said he was  younger than you.  Drew He was married at sixteen.  Bishop She was married at sixteen?  Finchum No, she got married     Martin I was twenty-two.  18  Drew She was twenty-two.  Finchum He was sixteen.  Martin My brother was sixteen.  Bishop So your little brother took you up when he was sixteen.  Finchum If it was a one-seater, where did you sit?  Martin I meant   one-seater would mean the driver and one passenger.  Bishop You talked a little bit about the Great Depression. Can you talk a little  more about what it was like around here at the time?  Martin We didn   t have it as bad as they did in New York. I don   t know whether  we ever had any soup lines down through Oklahoma, but we lost our  home at Ponca City. My grandma had this farm out here that she had  inherited, and there   s a little three-room house that we moved into. No  running water, but we survived.  Finchum How was it heated?  Martin Stove.  Finchum Wood?  Martin Wood. And we cooked by wood. I can remember seeing Mother can  green beans over that hot stove. In the summertime even, it could really  get hot when the fire, the stove was going.  Finchum She had a large garden?  Martin Yes.  Finchum And a cellar? Storm cellar?  Martin That   s depends on which place we was living in. (Laughs)  Finchum How would you do bath time at that place?  Martin Bath? (Laughs) Let   s see, we had a tub and we had to fill the tub up.  Finchum Not with running water though?  Martin No, a bucket.  19  Finchum How would you heat it?  Martin Our stove had what they called a tank like on the end of it. That was  heated by the stove going, so that would be the way we would do. Then  if your stove is going you put a bucket on.  Finchum Do that once a week or every day? Or how often?  Martin Once a week. (Laughs) Course the men that worked in the fields, they  would make a dive in to the ponds at the end of the day sometimes,  when they were working in dirty work.  Finchum What were holidays like?  Martin Christmas was much more of a sacred day than it is now. Other  holidays we observed, maybe. I remember we usually had a shamrock  and a valentine at least on our door or someplace.  Finchum Celebrated July fourth?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Homemade ice cream?  Martin Oh yeah. Homemade ice cream was sometimes a disaster. (Laughs)  Sometimes it wasn   t good ice cream, so you kind of knew which ones  to pick out. It   s like good cook and bad cook.  Finchum Which were you?  Martin In-between. (Laughter)  Finchum How about your mom?  Martin My mom was a good cook.  Finchum What was the favorite thing that she fixed that you liked?  Martin Our homemade ice cream.  Finchum When it worked.  Martin Yes.  Finchum Would she fry her chicken, or bake it?  20  Martin She fried it. I don   t know of anybody that baked chicken. You baked  your turkey, but you fried your chicken. (Laughs)  Finchum Did she have chickens?  Martin Yeah, we had chickens.  Finchum Who would do the wringing their necks?  Martin My mother. I did a few times, but I didn   t care for that.  Bishop Did you typically eat a lot of chicken, or pork, or beef?  Martin We probably ate more chicken. We usually would kill a roaster, a pig,  and that would be to go along with the chicken.  Finchum Had a smokehouse to cure it?  Martin No, we didn   t happen to have one. I guess we moved too much to, when  I was little at least.  Finchum Back in the first and second grade, through there, did you all do the  Pledge of Allegiance?  Martin Of course  And we sang. Usually sang the song    America   .  Finchum When you worked at Bethany in the school system, did they do the  Pledge of Allegiance still?  Martin That came in probably just about the time I retired that you couldn   t.  Finchum That they stopped?  Martin Yeah, because I had   I read to my children out of the Bible usually.  Finchum You couldn   t do that today.  Martin Yes I could.  Finchum You could?  Martin I could end up in jail too. (Laughs) No, but I think there is a way to get  around it.  Finchum You think?  21  Martin It   s good literature, so why couldn   t you read it today, if it   s good  literature. You could have a special one of   anyway.  Finchum There you go.  Bishop I want to know   teachers usually have a child they remember. Do you  have a particular student you remember?  Martin Yes, a little boy named Larry   maybe I shouldn   t say his name.  Finchum First name   s fine.  Martin Alright, Larry. His mother had been on drugs, so his aunt had adopted  him. In school he was like he was being   having withdrawals all the  time. He was just continually doing something. I   ve wondered about  him because he was   he usually really had a hard time of it.  Finchum Did you follow him through?  Martin No, I didn   t have an opportunity to do that. Wished I had.  Finchum Just hope for the best.  Martin Right. Do what you can and leave it to what they would retain.  Finchum When we got here you were talking about your   one of your favorite  books.  Martin Well, Lu Ann (caregiver) over here   you got it on Facebook?  Lu Ann A secondhand store.  Martin A secondhand store.  Finchum The Little Black Sambo storybook?  Martin They took it off, Little Black Sambo, off. He   s actually an Indian from  India, but they got so worked up about it that they had him Little Black  Sambo.  Finchum When you were teaching, did you use the book or was that a different  time period maybe?  22  Martin I can   t remember using it in the classroom, but I used it at home. I don   t  think it was because I couldn   t. I think it was just because there is so  many good books.  Bishop Do you have a favorite book, personally? A book that you enjoy the  most that you   ve read?  Martin Well, I would say the Bible has been mine. I think I   ve read it through  four times.  Finchum Favorite verse?  Martin    Search me oh Lord and see if there be any good way in me. Prove  me       and I don   t remember the rest. (Laughs) But lots of things go  through and you look back and you see some funny thing, some types  of funny things.  Finchum Growing up, was church an important part of your life?  Martin Oh yeah   well, not the first nine years of my life, but after that it was.  Finchum What changed at that point?  Martin My mother and dad made a real commitment to the Lord.  Finchum When you were nine?  Martin Somewhere along there.  Finchum What denomination?  Martin Free Methodist.  Finchum Methodist?  Martin Probably haven   t heard of a Free Methodist.  Finchum No.  Martin They started in the East up around New York City.  Finchum Well once you started to church, did you participate in the choir or  music?  Martin Well, I don   t have much musical ability, but I did sing in the choir  some.  23  Finchum Favorite song? Church song? You don   t have to sing it, just the name.  (Laughter)  Martin There would be a number of them, but I guess    Love Lifted Me    would  be what I would     Finchum I remember that one. It   s a good one.  Martin They   re all new ones now.  Finchum Did you ever think you would make it to 100?  Martin No.  Finchum No? Had anyone else in your family?  Martin No. I had a grandpa that made it to ninety-seven. No, it wasn   t a  grandpa, but anyway, somebody in my family made it to ninety-seven.  My parents were in their seventies.  Finchum When you reached ninety-nine you thought,    I want one more year      Martin Right. (Laughs)  Bishop What   s your secret to living so long? Longevity?  Martin Well, I see it as a gift of God. Not many people do, so it must be.  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Martin Had close to a hundred people to come and say congratulations or  whatever. (Laughs)  Finchum A big party, huh?  Martin Up there in the lounge.  Finchum Did they put a hundred candles on your cake or just a one-zero-zero? A  one-zero-zero. Good, that   d be hard to blow out a hundred. (Laughter)  Martin Yes, it would be.  Finchum Is there anything on your bucket list you   d like to do that you haven   t?  24  Martin There   s several things. One of granddaughters   no, great-granddaughters  graduates from college this year. I   d like to go see that.  I   d like to make a trip to all of them one more trip, at least.  Finchum All of them? All your     Martin All my children. Do you have another question? I can   t think of any.  Finchum You   re doing good.  Bishop When history   s written, how would you like it to say about you? How do  you want to be remembered?  Martin First, that I loved God, then my family, and that my family includes not  just my immediate family, but the people of the world. I guess that   s it.  Bishop Being a hundred, what   s a typical day like for you? What time do you  get up, how do you start your day, and what do you do during the day?  Can you describe that?  Martin I sleep until about nine o   clock. Then I have my breakfast, and I have a  little devotional book I read, and then in the afternoon sometimes I  have   I haven   t lately, but sometimes I have some little cards I make  with flowers on them. That   s   and I read some in there between.  Finchum And what time do you go to bed?  Martin I go to bed about nine o   clock. I   m getting plenty of rest. (Laughs)  Finchum You watch much television?  Martin No. I watch Wheel of Fortune some, but there   s not too much on that  that   s uplifting or anything.  Finchum Not Jeopardy?  Martin I can   t see how some of the things are even called good advertisement   (Laughter)  Finchum To keep up with current events, how do you do that? Watch the news  or     Martin Yeah, usually. Then I listen (laughs) to people and hear what they have  to say about various things and that   s always interesting.  Finchum What do you call the noon-meal? Lunch or dinner?  25  Martin Dinner.  Finchum Then what   s the late meal?  Martin Supper.  Finchum So breakfast, dinner, and supper?  Martin Yes.  Finchum I like to ask that question. We get different answers. Lunch is lunch, and  supper is dinner, and you grew up with dinner being the noon meal.  Martin Yes. Course, when we were married it was probably the other way,  because my husband had to eat at lunch. (Laughs)  Finchum Back when you were in elementary school, how did they do lunch? Did  you have to take your own or did you go home?  Martin If you were close enough, you went home. I went to my grandma   s part  of the time, because she lived close enough. Otherwise, you put it in a  gallon or a half-gallon, I don   t know which it was, little bucket.  Finchum What would you have in the bucket?  Martin Oh, probably   I don   t know, I didn   t have to...  Finchum You went home. What would she have waiting for you?  Martin I don   t remember.  Finchum Fried chicken?  Martin Maybe so. (Laughs)  Finchum Would she do cakes or cookies? What for sweets?  Martin I can remember her one time giving me a quarter to go to the store to  get some cookies. I got quite a number of cookies for it   a quarter.  (Laughs)  Finchum Did any of them make it back home?  26  Martin They did. There was one fluffy kind that I had wanted for a long time,  but I couldn   t afford it, but that day I could, but it didn   t taste half that  good. (Laughter)  Finchum So you could walk to the store without an adult during that time?  Martin During that time, yeah. I was staying with my grandma a while, but we  were making the adjustments for the Depression.  Finchum How often would you get a new pair of shoes?  Martin I can only remember one pair of shoes (laughs) and I wanted them so  badly  Probably once a year.  Finchum In time for school? New school?  Martin Yes.  Finchum During the summer would you go barefooted?  Martin Oh yeah.  Finchum Did they do home remedies of some kind that you remember? If  something happened?  Martin They had several kinds of things that they   linseed oil and     Finchum If you got a bee sting?  Martin Soda I think  Finchum Snake bite?  Martin I don   t know about that.  Finchum Didn   t have one, huh?  Martin No.  Finchum Would the doctor make house calls?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Were you born at home or in a hospital?  27  Martin Home, and I fell off a horse, broke my arm, and the doctor came out  and set it.  Finchum So your family had horses?  Martin Well no, I was at a girlfriend   s. She had a horse. We did have horses,  but not at that time.  Finchum When you would get in trouble, who would do the discipline your  mother or your father?  Martin Probably Mother more than Dad.  Finchum But you didn   t get in trouble that much?  Martin Of course not  (Laughs)  Finchum Did you all have a Christmas tree? Chop down yourself?  Martin I imagine most of them were a cedar tree until they started bringing in  the commercial ones. I can   t remember any commercial trees until  along about    39 somewhere. There might   ve been, but     Bishop What did you typically get as a gift at Christmas or during Christmas?  Martin Well, usually it was clothes or something useful.  Finchum Not a baby doll?  Martin No, I didn   t   yes I did get a baby doll, but it got broken.  Finchum By a brother or by you?  Martin No, somebody went tearing through the room where it was and knocked  it off.  Finchum Was it a porcelain head or   yeah. The shoes that you wanted really  bad, what were they like?  Martin They were brown around the edges and tan where the tongue is.  Finchum Lace ups? High-tops?  Martin No, just whatever you call   I   ve forgotten what we called them.  Drew An oxford?  28  Finchum An oxford?  Martin Yes.  Finchum You had to wear dresses to school? Or did you get to wear pants?  Martin Nobody wore pants.  Finchum But the boys.  Martin You going to have to leave? (Speaking to daughter, Joyce Drew)  Finchum We can stop for a minute, that   s fine.  (Daughter leaves)  Finchum While I   m thinking about it, can you tell us a little more about how you  met your husband? It was at the brush arbor, but what   s more?  Martin Well it goes back really. He was probably five, or six, or seven.  Somewhere in there, and then he grew up and went off to college. The  boy he roomed with lived in our town, and so we kind of exchanged  letters. Then I started going with him, and we went out to Lake  Overholser and walked across that bridge. It was a romantic bridge.  (Laughter) He didn   t propose to me there, but that   s when I knew he  was kind of interested in me.  Finchum And how did he propose?  Martin (Laughs) It was one moonlight night and we were sitting out in our  front yard. That   s when he proposed to me. Just asked me if I loved him  enough to live my life with him. The answer was yes, so that was the  beginning.  Finchum That was the beginning. Did he have a ring then? At that point? No?  Did you get to pick out your ring?  Martin No, now this will sound silly to you, but our church at that time did not  believe in wearing rings. They do now, but     Finchum So you just exchanged vows and no rings?  Martin Yes.  Finchum Did you get a ring later?  29  Martin Well, yes. Somewhere in there   s my wedding ring. I never got a fancy  one, but that one   s my wedding ring.  Finchum It   s a sentimental one. That   s what counts.  Bishop I   ve got the most important question, did he ask your father?  Martin Later he did. (Laughter)  Finchum He would   ve said yes anyway, wouldn   t he? Your dad?  Martin I think he would   ve.  Finchum Was he much older than you?  Martin My husband?  Finchum Yes.  Martin No. I was older than he was, by  thirteen months .  Finchum You were older than him? You robbed the cradle. (Laughter) He was  already out of college at that time?  Martin Yes, he had just taken two years and then he got a job. Later he went  back and finished up.  Finchum Were you working at that time? When you were dating him, were you  working somewhere?  Martin No.  Finchum Still living at home?  Martin Yes.  Finchum That   s a pretty good story, moonlit night.  Martin I can remember the moon.  Finchum What would you do for dates?  Martin Lots of times we   d just sit and talk.  Finchum That was the    30s and money was tight during that time.  30  Martin Right. When I was in college I   d carry around a nickel in my pocket so  that I wouldn   t be broke.  Finchum Would you go to dances, or was that not something the church would  do?  Martin Yes. No.  Finchum Did he have to serve in World War II?  Martin He had a heart murmur and then that put him on four, but he was  getting down on the list pretty far. If the war hadn   t stopped, he  probably would   ve had to have gone.  Finchum Did your brothers have to?  Martin They were too much younger then, but eventually both of them served a  while.  Finchum Anything else you want to tell us before we shut off? Something that  might surprise your daughter? Something she might not have heard?  Martin Something that might   well our children asked me always to tell my  Okie stories, so I think I   ve told all my stories. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have your children at home or in the hospital?  Martin The hospital: St. Anthony   s and Deaconess.  Finchum You   ve seen a lot of changes in Oklahoma City in your time, too.  Martin Every time I go back there I feel like I   m in a foreign land.  Finchum When you were first married, did they have street cars? When you first  went to Oklahoma City?  Martin They had one that they hadn   t taken up. Did I hear that they were  planning to put them back?  Finchum At least one, I think I   ve heard that too. What goes around comes back  around I guess.  Martin I guess so. (Laughs)  Finchum I appreciate you talking with us today, it   s been fun.  31  Martin Thank you, I   ve enjoyed it too.  Finchum You   ve done great, thank you.  -------  -------
