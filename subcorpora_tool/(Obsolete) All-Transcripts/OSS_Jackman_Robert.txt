 Finchum. I   m with the Oklahoma State University  Library project called O-STATE Stories, and we   re here with Bob  Jackman, a 1957 graduate of OSU.  Tell us how you came to be at OSU.  Well, I went one year to junior college at Northeastern Oklahoma A M  Junior College at Miami, Oklahoma in 1953-54. Then I went to  Oklahoma A M in 1954 and graduated in the first graduating class  when they changed their name. The first graduating class was in the  summer of 1957. So one of my claims to fame is to tell people that I was  in the first graduating class of OSU  Oklahoma State University , which  happened in the summer of 1957.  I majored in and graduated with a bachelor   s degree in geology and I  also went one year to summer school at A M or OSU, and that was in  the summer of    56. Then I went to geological camp with about thirty or  forty graduate students which included students from OU  University of  Oklahoma  and OSU. We had a joint camp at Canyon City, Colorado,  and I went to school there for one month   actually it was a geological  summer camp. And that   s my brief background on the days and numbers  and so forth.  Did they call you a transfer student at that point?  No, there were a lot of people that came in from other schools, so  technically I may have been a transfer student, but basically there were a  lot of people that would come in after one or two semesters from junior  colleges or so forth, and there wasn   t any real designation that I recall.  Did you have any opinion regarding the name change?  5  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Oh, there was some, yes. My personal thoughts were that there was a  sweep across the entire United States, and especially in Oklahoma, to  name everything a university, and of course the agricultural and  mechanical schools got more or less eliminated and everything became a  university whereas there were a lot of us that said,    Oh, let   s leave the  designations.    But it was, you know, at that point in my life I was glad  to get the degree and very happy to have the opportunity to go to school  there, so it wasn   t that controversial with me.  What were some of the things you remember doing for your fun time?  Ping-pong. (Laughs) This was, you   ve got to realize, in the days before  television. We did not have TV. We had, my senior year in 1957, TV   s  in some of the dorms, but there were no TV   s in residences per se,  maybe a few. So watching TV was not one of the things that we did.  Now, you   re leading up to my famous part-time activity that I did my  senior year for maybe a semester and a half. I lived in North Murray.  That was a boys    dorm then. Is it currently?  I think it   s been renovated for offices.  Okay, well, it had been a girls    dorm, North Murray, but they changed  over. My senior year prior to that, I had lived off campus and I have  some stories about that. But my senior year   and you   ve got to realize  this is in the days when Oklahoma was still dry, we did not have liquor  stores, and Stillwater was a very dry town. There were three or four bars,  beer joints, and some of them were fairly nice. They were not really bad  places, but there were no liquor stores in Stillwater or that count   well,  there weren   t any liquor stores in the entire state, okay? So I was a  bootlegger (Laughs) part-time   wasn   t high volume. I visited my  hometown in Miami, Oklahoma two or three times or more during the  semester. I would be going home and I would take two suitcases and in  one of them I would go over to Seneca, Missouri where they had liquor  stores, and I   d fill it up with whiskey and vodka, and the other suitcase  would be my clothes and books and so forth. My parents never knew of  this. (Laughs) Very few people knew of this. And so then I   d go back  and I would sell the whiskey.  Those were the days when, believe me, and we were all in the same  boat   you didn   t have spending money. We weren   t conscious of it, but  extra money was hard to get. For instance, every summer you had to go  get a good summer job. Period. So I bootlegged out of the dorm, and it  was well known. It wasn   t that big of a deal, and there weren   t that many  of us on-campus bootleggers so I got by on the novelty of it and  obviously I kept a low profile. We had lots of veterans on campus  because we had gone through Korea. I was between Korea and Vietnam,  6  and we still were getting World War II veterans, so there were some  older gentlemen, veterans. I recall I had four, five or six customers, and  the dorm proctor on my floor knew what I was doing. He, if I recall, was  a veteran also. So that was my claim to fame. I was a bootlegger out of  North Murray. I had one incident where a guy came up who had been  drinking and was partially intoxicated, and when that happened I said,     I   m not gonna do this anymore.    It ceased to be fun and so I quit.  Incidentally, the way we got to school was interesting back in those days  since not everyone had cars. Cars were fairly rare, and if you had one or  two students from your hometown who had cars, suddenly you were  good friends with them. That   s how you got back and forth, but it was  quite common for us to hitchhike. Hitchhiking was fairly common in  those days, and it was not the dangerous hitchhiking like it is now. On  weekends, you would see on the major highways going out of Stillwater  students hitchhiking home. It was fairly common. I would hitchhike all  the way from Stillwater to Miami and vice versa hitchhike back.  Occasionally I had friends that had vehicles, but if I needed to make a  whiskey run and couldn   t find one, well I   d hitchhike up (laughs) and  everybody would think,    Well there   s a college student,    and I   d never  tell them what I had in the other suitcase. (Laughs) So I got a lot of  mileage out of that.  You asked me about some other activities. We occasionally had poker  games which, you know, I   m sure students still do. And, again, we  didn   t have TV and a lot of us never had radios even. I mean we were  lucky to go to school, and we studied and we worked. I   m not gonna say  we were a bunch of monks, but we didn   t have the other luxuries that we  have today. We played poker, not that often. Invariably there were poker  games going on during times of finals. And you would see some guy  that had really made failing grades, or close to failing grades, and then it  got to time for finals, and here would be a poker game. Suddenly, he just  stays in the game and he   d cut finals. But these were small. There was  no serious money involved in them.  Some other aspects, this again, when I was there from 1954 to 1957, was  the Cold War era. It was the pre-pill era, okay? And so we would have  the occasional couple of students and the key words were,    Oh, we just  decided to elope.    And then invariably the next thing you   d know was  that they had a very healthy, eight, nine pound premature baby. (Laughs)  Part of the pre-pill era.  Back to the alcohol aspect, there was not the drinking on the campuses     I don   t think I ever went to a real big beer bust or a big drinking party  on campus or near campus. It just wasn   t tolerated. What a lot of us  would do, maybe once a semester or so forth, we   d drive to Oklahoma  7  City. That was the place to go for a party. Now, the downside of that  was, we   re talking about pre-seatbelt days, okay? And if you look at the  traffic mortality rates, they were very, very bad. When I was making my  notes, I remembered two incidences where five guys were killed coming  back from partying over at Oklahoma City. We didn   t have seatbelts,  and safety wasn   t what it is today on driving. I   m sure in the fraternities,  I was not in a fraternity house, that there was a lot more partying going  on. I can   t say what the graduation rates were either, but I was in a hard  major, geology, and at that time we were there to study and we played  ping-pong, an occasional poker game, and movies. That was once a  week, boy if there was a good movie on. That was the outlet, you know,  to go to the movie and then during basketball season or wrestling season,  those were more dominant than football. You   ve got to realize that.  Incidentally, on football, my brother was going to school there  OAMC   and of all things he invited me up one weekend, and I went, and this was  in October of 1951, and I made a note here to make sure I   m right on  that date. October 1951 was the famous Johnny Bright incident. Have  you heard of this? You haven   t? Oh, gosh. The Johnny Bright, B-r-i-g-h-t,  incident. Johnny Bright was a black football player playing for Drake.  He played us, and I went to the game in 1951 where Wilbanks Smith  was instructed by the coach to go up and hit him illegally and broke his  jaw. It made national news and the newspaper reporters from Des  Moines, Iowa got photos of Wilbanks Smith going up and hitting Johnny  Bright after the play had already left him, and of all things I was sitting  in the temporary bleachers at the end zone and I was just looking right  down. I was young and I was watching Johnny Bright because he was  such a fantastic black football player   oh, an amazing man   and this  guy came up and hit him from the side and broke his jaw, and it made  national news. It was a major incident and so I happened to see that. He  was the first black player to play at OSU or A M, and matter of fact, it  was not until last year that Dr. Schmidly officially apologized to Drake  University over that incident. It was a terrible thing to happen. It caused  Drake to drop out of the football conference at that time. It caused  enormous repercussions. It was not indicative of the attitude toward  racism or color or anything on the campus. It was a shame that happened  because there were so many other things positive for racial integration  and understanding of all races, creeds, colors and ethnicity going on at  the campus. OSU or A M got a bad name for a long time over that  incident. I happened to see that incident.  I   m looking at my notes and again this was the Cold War time in the mid  to late fifties. Affluence had not hit the U.S. That didn   t really come on  until the sixties, so we were lucky to be there going to college. I knew it  and so there was a focus on academics and focus on learning, and so we  didn   t have a lot of polarizing off campus or outside of classroom  8  activities going on, either on campus or nationally. We didn   t have those  things that are divisive now like pro-choice, anti-abortion, National Rifle  Association, prayer in school or the big tribalism now of yay-OSU or  yay OU   and I don   t mean they   re divisive, but we just didn   t have  those. It was a little bit quieter and more focused.  Religion was not that important, it was rare but there. The Baptist  Student Union was there. Those components were there, but it was not  emphasized. It was not as important, and no one discussed,    What   s  your religion?    No one discussed your points of view on that, and I took  geology and we went through paleontology and so forth. I never will  forget the first time I ever heard it, the professor said something about  some people have problems with how we age the earth and so forth, and  he just said,    That   s their prerogative.    And I had to go up and ask him  later to see if he was talking about the Bible and etc., and he said,    Yes.     I remember that was not an issue. Science was taught as science. We had  a lot of veterans on the campus from Korea and still from World War II.  The veterans had married veteran   s housing. There was a large section,  fairly close to the campus, where they could live. I think that gave a  mature element to the campus, not that we were a dull life. Some of the  veterans were the biggest partiers of all.  We also were still greatly influenced by Dr. Bennett. Dr. Bennett   s  influence cannot be overlooked. When I was going to school there in  1957, he was no longer the president, but Harry Truman came down     then former President Harry Truman, came down out of respect to Dr.  Bennett who had died four or five years earlier to visit the campus and  tour some facilities there. Haile Selassie, the president of   maybe the  prime minister then   of Ethiopia, visited the campus before I was there.  So we had a constant flow of dignitaries in there out of respect for many  of the programs that Dr. Bennett started and were still going.  Back to the Johnny Bright story and I   ll give you an example. Most  people don   t realize, but OSU continued up until the 1970s to staff and  administrate a land grant college in Ethiopia, and that influence was on  campus. So we had Ethiopian exchange students and had a lot of  exchange students in Stillwater when I was going to school there from  Ethiopia, from Venezuela. We had geological students from Venezuela.  We had people from Pakistan, Iraq   a number of Iraqis. By the way,  they had an interesting program. OSU and Northeastern Oklahoma  A M Junior College had a program where the students from Iraq and  Iran would come to Miami, Oklahoma and go to the junior college their  first year in the U.S. to get acclimatized, learn the language. So they  would go to the junior college one year and then they would transfer and  go down to   I used the word transfer, (laughs) they would go to  Stillwater, and so I knew a number of the people from Iraq. There were  9  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  some, and they were usually older in their late twenties or early  thirties   people from Iraq, and a lot of them were married and they had  their wives with them and so forth. So we had a lot of early international  activities on the campus and it all radiated out from what Dr. Bennett  had started. It was very interesting going to school there then. There was  this flavor   matter of fact, a fella that I roomed with in geological camp  was from Venezuela.  We didn   t have the corporate sponsorships. It was not commercialized.  You know, people gave gifts, companies, etc. They just gave it. It wasn   t  expected to put a dang banner up saying, you know, here   s so and so.  (Laughs) They just gave it. It is interesting how that   s changed.  The draft was still in place. For all male students that had not been in the  service this was a big unknown for us because we had deferments to  finish college, and as soon as you finished college, you were either  going to get drafted in the Army or you could voluntarily enlist in the  Air Force or Marines or Navy. That was a big question mark on all  young men   s future,    What am I going to do when I get out of school?     That impacted us a lot more than people would realize. A lot of guys  obviously went to ROTC  Reserve Officer Training Corps . We had a  large ROTC element there   Army and Air Force, and a lot of guys went  ahead and got their commissions and went in that way. I ended up going  into the Air Force after I graduated. It   s underestimated as to how much  that influenced or what that meant to us. We were in a Cold War. We  were subject to draft, and so that put a certain amount of seriousness on  it. Also, if you flunked out, you went right in the Army (laughs) so that  helped.  Back to the commercialism   the only thing I could remember and, of  course I don   t remember all of them, but I do remember the tobacco  companies, the cigarettes companies coming around and they would  give out free samples. They had these little mini packs   packages of  cigarettes. They weren   t there all the time, but I remember they were  around giving those out.  Has anyone told you about the big dust storm in 1955?  In Stillwater?  Yes.  No.  Oh, I   m making history here for you. In April of 1955, I looked this up  on the internet by the way, and it   s there. I knew my memory was good.  10  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  I went and started looking for it, and it didn   t take long to find. The last  big dust storm in the southwest   and this was Oklahoma, Texas and part  of Kansas, was in April of 1955. We had a severe drought for two or  three years. We had a dust storm and it hit Stillwater and it was  frightening because we   re talking thirty, forty mile an hour winds   and  this is all of record. I was living off campus, and at noon it was so dark  you could not see across the street. And at noon they turned on all the  streetlights. The dust was that thick and it lasted for a couple of days.  It   s of record that the last major dust storm in Oklahoma was in April of  1955, and it hit Stillwater and it hit it hard. I mean, it was amazing. We  were just going,    What is this stuff?     Did you have to attend classes while it was going on?  Sure.     in the dust?  Sure. I mean, you could walk, and you got grimy but we went on to  classes. They didn   t shut the school down. And (laughs) so, that was a  piece of history and you can look it up on the internet.  Wardrobes   obviously I think the standard wardrobe for a lot of us non-fraternities  was like one or two pair of jeans and a pair of khakis, and  tee-shirts and three or four white tee-shirts. The tee-shirts with all the  logos and everything else, those hadn   t come out yet. You could always  put your entire wardrobe in one big suitcase for the year, literally. And  walk   oh my gosh. I lived off campus my first two years, and there  were, as I said, there were so many of us doing that   many, many. We  had no air conditioning, and heating wasn   t really sometimes the  greatest. There were three of us in a room the same size as this  10 x 12 ,  and we cooked ourselves. And this was very common because it was  called living off campus and batching, because you could live cheaper  than you could living in a dorm and paying for your dorm meals. And  the first year where I lived was about four or five blocks from the edge  of the campus, and you can imagine we walked and we walked and we  walked and we walked. And the second year I was a little bit closer, but  that was an interesting thing.  There were no drugs, drugs hadn   t hit this country. There were a few. I  went home and there was one guy that we all knew he was doing  amphetamines, but the drug problem had not hit. Don   t get me wrong,  there were guys who were obviously headed, and girls, headed toward  alcoholism, but that was not a component on campus at that time at all.  No drug problems. So we didn   t have a major law problem on campus. I  never heard of anyone   any students being killed or major violent  11  Finchum  Jackman  crimes. There was not a lot of crime because it was a little more of a  quieter time in a sense. There had been student walkouts. You probably  have heard those. And then the year before I went there, they had the  infamous student male panty raids. Have you heard of those?  No.  No? It was in, I   m gonna say 1952, 1953, 1954, somewhere in there,  before I was going to school there. It didn   t happen when I was, but after  they had the walkouts if they   d win a big football game. And then they  said,    No, we don   t want you to do that.    And then springtime, the  foliage came out and Theta Pond was more attractive as a place to hang  out. It started across the United States. It wasn   t just something that  happened at Stillwater, but all of a sudden in the springtime we had  these panty raids. A bunch of guys would go storm into the girls    dorms  and the game was you had to get one or two pair of panties. So they   d  run in the rooms, grab some panties and run outside, and it was a college  prank, and it was going on all over the United States, but we had the  panty raids at Stillwater for a short period of time.  Well, the administration took a dim view of that and the walkouts.  (Laughs) I don   t know why, but when I got there, it was pretty quiet.  You couldn   t, you know, the word was out and if you wanted to stay  here, you   d better behave. I don   t know whether to say this, but  obviously you know a lot of people drop out of school and I was  determined not to drop out. The library and the student union, there were  a couple of lounges up there on the second floor. I literally lived in those  places studying. I mean, I just spent so much time there. The college of  choice for people that couldn   t make it at Stillwater was to go to  Tahlequah when I was there, that was it. Okay, if you can   t make it here,  go over to Tahlequah. Be what it may.  Let me go back a little bit more on the Ethiopia-OSU contact because  that had a lot of influence on my life, and still does. It was something  that we were very proud of, and here we were getting these multi-cultural,  multi-national exposures in the heartland. And I   ve made  friends with a number of the professors who taught over there and it was  a major accomplishment. I think that it   s a shame that Oklahoma did not  build on it more. I later on, after time in the military, spent two years  working in Yemen. I   m also an expert on Somalia. I have been advisor  to the U.S. State Department on Somalia. What helped me so much was,  when I was in Yemen, I   d go over to Ethiopia and it was just amazing.  The Ethiopians would say,    Where are you from?    and I   d say,     Oklahoma,    and they made me at home.    Oh, from Stillwater,    or    We  know Oklahoma A M,    because the reputation of Oklahoma A M,  OSU, in Ethiopia in the 1960s and the 1970s. They shut that school  12  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  down, I think, in the early 1980s. It was amazing.  So we have a lot to be proud of about our accomplishments and Addis  Ababa, Ethiopia is the name of the place where they had the school, and  it was very, very impactive on that culture. There   s a doctor named  Yilma Tilahun  Tilahun Yilma  who is the foremost veterinary medicine  researcher in the world, and he came out of Ethiopia. He was a barefoot  boy in a primitive village, and he wandered into that school, and his  instructors recognized this kid was brilliant, and the rest is history. He   s  still teaching at the University of California in Davis, California. You  got any questions? I   ve been talking a lot here. (Laughs)  You   re on a roll. Keep going.  Let me look at my notes and see what I left out.  What about Homecoming?  College Homecoming football games were not that impactive. I didn   t  go to very many college football games. I only went to about three or  four games when I was there. The Homecomings were nice, but they  were not that big of an event you had to do or that much celebration  other than the alumni being greeted at a football game or introduced and  some alumni receptions. It was not that impactive on me. Incidentally,  from the Johnny Bright incident, I had played football one year at junior  college. But I realized later on in life how much that impacted me  because this man was targeted because he was black and he was hurt, his  jaw broke, and later on in life I realized what an injustice that was, so  back to the Johnny Bright story. Go ahead. You had another question?  At Homecoming, did they decorate the houses and have a parade, that  sort of thing too   or not so much     You know, I really don   t remember because, again, I had a learning  disability and I had to study. I mean, I really, really had to study and so  some of the festivities I did not participate in. I think there was a parade  of such. And usually for the fraternities, sororities and some of those  other groups, Homecoming was a bigger event for them, and for their  alumni   s also.  Incidentally, there was not any major rift between the fraternities and  sororities and us independents. You know, we were all going to school. I  was always amazed though that I   d be in classes and the fraternities     some of the fraternity guys   how they made such good grades on these  tests? Well, I learned that they would have a large collection of the tests,  and so they had an advantage, seemingly. Later on, I realized,    No, they  13  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Neurohr  don   t know how to,      you know, we had to just dig it out. I had friends  from high school in several of the fraternities and a lady that I dated was  over at one of the sororities, so there wasn   t any major difference.  Any tales to tell about the library?  Somebody was always pouring a bottle of detergent in the fountain.  (Laughs)  They still do.  They still do that?  Food coloring sometimes.  It was a new library then. It was opened like 1955. Other than literally  being in there up on the   I   ve forgot   I think the second or third floor  was where I was at, and it was like a treasure. Here   s all these books.  Here   s all these magazines, you know. I had a couple of corners where I  would stay. I would stay with some of the other people and study in the  stairwell, too. And there wasn   t any smoking in the library, but you  could get in the stairwell and smoke. So there was smoking in the  stairwells. And there were a few couples being very friendly in the  stairwells occasionally. Other than that, it was just a place where, you  know   that and then the student union where I really spent a lot of time.  Those are my best library stories for the thousands of hours I spent in it.  And they closed it at 10:30, I believe, 10:30 or 11:00. What time do they  close it now?  It   s early   I mean like 2:00 in the morning.  It seems to me like 11:00 they   d shut the doors because I was     During finals week, they stay open twenty-four hours.  Wow.  And there   s food in the library now. (Laughs) You said you lived off  campus. Do you remember where   in which direction, what street?  Water Street. There   s a Water Street.   Karen Neurohr, an O-STATE Stories project member, joins the  interview   I   ve only lived in Stillwater a year.  14  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  I lived north about four blocks toward town. There   s a main artery that  runs east and west of town, and I lived right next to it one year, and then  another year I lived, I think it was over, on Waters or Water Street, and  it was two or three blocks from campus.  A lot of the north housing units are being taken down for the Athletic  Village so you may have been over in that area?  Well, I said north. I meant south toward town. And, again, there was a  shortage of dorm space. So that and the price and so forth, a lot of us just  chose to live off campus.  And you cooked?  Yes. We walked to the Safeway, and each one of us would get two big  bags of groceries, and that would last us for about a week. And typical  bologna, lunchmeat, sandwiches, soup, weenies. My gosh, I still can   t  eat weenies. (Laughter) One time we went broke and we literally tried to  make weenie water soup. (Laughs) It didn   t work, but we tried it. We  went flat broke and didn   t have anything, you know, so we tried weenie  water soup.  You couldn   t phone home for money then either, could you?  Well, that   s an interesting point   phones. No one had phones where we  were living. It just wasn   t done. We didn   t have the money for it and you  didn   t have cell phones obviously. If you wanted to contact   you wrote  home. You needed money, you wrote home, etc., but you did not have  phones. And on the dorms, they usually had one, if I recall, they had one  phone for an entire floor. Somebody would want to talk to someone,  maybe it was one phone on each end of the floor, I think that was it. And  they were not pay phones. They were just regular phones, and so  somebody would call and ask to speak to so-and-so and the guys in the  rooms nearest the phone would go answer the phone, go down the hall  and get someone. And it was not that often. It just wasn   t done. So there  wasn   t the hours on the phone like there are today. You didn   t have the  communications home and we never thought about it, you know.  But we lived and cooked and most of us lost weight because of the  walking and doing our own cooking. We would go eat in the cafeteria at  the student union occasionally or occasionally we would get invited out.  You could buy a meal ticket at one of the   I can   t think of that     Willard Hall. Is it still there?  Willard   s still there.  15  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  And it was a girls    dorm then, and you could buy a meal ticket there  even though you didn   t live on campus. So we would go in there, but it  was kind of interesting to say the least. But, you know, that was it. I  mean everyone was in the same boat.  Can you describe a typical date?  Pardon?  A typical date.  Well, first of all you had to borrow somebody   s car. (Laughs) Well not  always, but that was really good if you could do that. Then you would  either go to the movies or there were some sororities, not the Greek  sororities, and they would have dances and we would go to one of those  functions.  I was in the geological society, and we had dances, so   get a car  hopefully. We were very fortunate because the school really brought in a  lot of outstanding entertainers for that day and age. Ella Fitzgerald was  there. Count Basie, Gene Krupa, the famous drummer, Buddy Rich,  drummer   they had a battle of the bands. There were a couple of jazz  combos that came in for a number of events like that. So a typical date  would be   you   d go to Willard Hall and go to that event and then you   d  have to walk back fairly fast because they closed those doors at the girls     dorms and that was it. And if the girl had to ring to get back in, she got  written up, and that was a big no-no. I think there was two or three  written-ups and they were out of the dorm or something. It was very,  very strict. During the week it seemed like to me it was like 9:30 or  10:00. It was amazing that they had to be in. The doors were closed. So  a typical date was you   d go get them. We would go to the event and then  hurry back. There would be a bunch of us with our dates standing  outside of Willard saying goodbye, you know   bright lights, and even  kissing was frowned upon, so... (Laughs)  And the men didn   t have to be back at a particular time?  No. The men   s dorm did not have   well, wait a minute. I think they did  have a 12:00 or something like that. But, you   ve got to realize, there  were a lot of veterans in there, so there wasn   t the sexist prejudice. It  was a fact of life that we had a lot of veterans and older men students  that,    I just came out of war and I   m not gonna put up with this,    you  know. So that would be a typical one. Co-dates to the student union or  one of the off-campus drug stores, that sort of thing, but you had to  borrow somebody   s car. (Laughs) And we went to Lake Blackwell a few  times and had some   I   m gonna say that word, we had some weenie  16  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  roasts. (Laughs)  Do you remember about how much tuition was?  Seemed like it was about twenty-five or thirty dollars a semester. It was  somewhere in that range because it was only like two or three dollars an  hour. It was thirty dollars or something like that, and compared to today,  it was very, very low.  You had to pay your own way to do that or did your parents help?  Parents helped, but again my mother was a schoolteacher and she had a  college degree, obviously, and my father worked for the phone  company. We had money, per se. They paid for sixty, seventy percent of  my expenses. But it was necessary to get a good job in the summertime,  consequently, to help. And again, the economy was not that good. We  had a recession in Oklahoma in 1955, 1956, 1957. The oil industry really  went down. We had a recession and the drought hit western Oklahoma.  So there wasn   t a large amount of money. There were no grants or aids  at all, period. GI Bill   those guys could barely   that GI Bill would  cover maybe seventy percent, so they had to work. We had to work, a lot  of us, and there wasn   t that many good jobs here in Oklahoma in the  summertime because here   s this huge workforce turned loose, college  students. A lot of us, we went to different places. I went to Idaho and  worked in the national forest as a firefighter one summer. I went to  Alaska one summer and worked in the gold mines, gold fields. Matter of  fact, I got a ride with a couple from Stillwater. We drove all the way up  to Fairbanks and I worked there all summer and made really good  money.  So there were things like that. There was more pressure on us to make  money. There are students now, I know, that have the same problems  with these high prices, but again there was a mass exodus out of the  state. A lot of guys would go work the wheat harvest. That was a very  common thing to do, work in the wheat harvest, try to get jobs in the oil  fields   so just wherever. If you could pick one up in your hometown,  but again there weren   t that many. There wasn   t that good of an  economy in the state so we had to figure out ways to do it. Of course, I  augmented my income my senior year  because of bootlegging .  (Laughs)  Did you have to hide it in your dorm?  No. I mean, I think we had a closet so I just put it in the closet and that  was it. I told the proctor what I was going to do.  17  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  What kind of profit were you making on it?  Oh, buying a bottle of Jim Beam, I think I was paying three dollars a  bottle, two fifty or three dollars a bottle. I was selling it for five dollars  so I was doubling my money. And then I would set a bottle aside in case  somebody got sick. (Laughs) But basically I made a few dollars off of it.  Well you had to save enough of that to buy the next batch, too, didn   t  you?  Yeah, I had inventory   pay for my own inventory     So you were learning skills that way, too.  Yeah, I was learning entrepreneurism. I think I learned entrepreneurism.  (Laughs) The Johnny Bright situation was also very impactive, even  though it happened when I was still in high school, just visiting there.  But the international experience and exposure was so good and we had a  great geology department. It was fairly new. It had only been going for  about four or five years when I got here and so I was very proud of that  and still am.  Wrestling and basketball were more favored sports in a sense than  football. We had the championship wrestling teams and basketball  teams   the Iba days. He was such a class act, and that   s why the  contradiction between the Johnny Bright incident, and then what was  happening over in the basketball   it sent the wrong signals about what  was happening there at the campus.  If you were to give advice to students today, what would you tell them     anything in particular?  Well, obviously, study. And you may not get another chance. There   s a  lot more lessons than just what   s in the books. You   ll learn, for instance,  I learned, and anybody who is going to school will learn, that it   s such  great confidence builders. Look beyond to the testing and so forth and  try to weigh your personal growth from semester to semester. Usually  that   s hard to do but I would encourage people to be reflective on what   s  happening to them on their own maturity, their own growth   whether  it   s mental, spiritual or their morals, how that   s changing. If they could,  they might keep a diary   which most people don   t do, but keeping a  personal diary of things that are impactive on them. If they   re closet  poets, write your poetry. Those are ways to keep track of what   s  happening to you. You don   t have to show it to anybody. Personal  records, diaries, etc. are not, to my knowledge, encouraged enough. And  do it yourself. Only you know what   s happening to you, really.  18  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Any favorite professors that still come to mind?  Oh yeah, John Naff , the man that changed me. He got me into geology  and maybe you   ve heard of his name before, but he was our guru of the  geology department. He wasn   t even a doctor   John Naff was so  brilliant, so personable and so impressive and yet he spent time with  each individual student, in a sense, or he made you feel that way. So  John Naff. I had a lady professor and I can   t even think of her name.  Not too many of those in the    50s.  Oh, Smith   Dr. Smith. She taught physics and I was so surprised. I took  physics and I liked it and I passed it. (Laughs) And so Naff and Smith  and   I   m trying to think   those are the two primary ones that really had  an impact. We had some sizeable classes and those two would be the  ones. Oh, a subject that just blew me away was   I hated it   we had to  take humanities. I just want to barf, you know. All this Plato and Greek  mythology and stuff. I would just cringe. What? This is worthless. Well,  guess who   s reading Greek mythology and really loves the stuff now?  Me. (Laughs) The literature that we were exposed to, and I guess maybe  that   s a backward thing to say to students is,    Just because you hate  something or don   t like it now doesn   t mean that in the future that seed  won   t grow and you will really, really enjoy or get a lot out of that  particular thing.    But I had to think,    What did I have, six hours, eight  hours of humanities.    I remember that. I was going,    Oh this is terrible,     (Laughs) reading all those books (Laughs) but it was good seeding. I just  didn   t know it.  Anything else come to mind that you want to share?  Oh, let me look at my notes and see if I left anything out. I   ve covered a  lot here.  Do you go back to campus very often?  Not that often, although I do visit with a professor over there who was  not a professor when I was there. He   s retired, Dr. Conrad Evans, he was  the head of the OSU campus in Ethiopia, so he and I stay in contact. We  still have some things going on over there.  Oh, I think I mentioned that there was not this enormous   I call it  tribalism of OU versus OSU or all the bumper stickers and the tee-shirts  and everything with A M and etc. By the way, there   s kind of a subtle  point here that, back then   oh, I know what   s a great story. I almost left  this out.  19  Neurohr  Jackman  Neurohr  Jackman  Neurohr  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Do you all remember the former U.S. Marshal who was a model for  Pistol Pete?  Frank Eaton.  He was there when I was there.  I read a book about him. They have it at the student union bookstore.  There   s a book called Campfire Stories.  Have I got a story about him.  Okay, good. We want to get that on tape.  Pistol Pete and the Cowboys. I was talking about how I hated humanities  because I   m sure you all just love the stuff.  Not necessarily. But you liked physics.  But then later on I turned into a fairly avid reader and do many other  things and so it was   Frank Eaton, Pistol Pete.  I   ll tell you my famous Pistol Pete story. It was about probably 1957, my  junior year, and he was around campus  Frank Eaton . He was the model  for Pistol Pete. His name was Frank Eaton. He was retired, genuine  retired U.S. Marshal, and he had long droopy moustaches and he was in  his late    80s. He still was an official U.S. Marshal and he wore his badge  and he wore his six-gun on campus. I mean, he was an elderly  gentleman. He was very erect. He was impressive. And who   s going to  tell him to take your badge off and put your gun up? Nobody did. And  he still was pretty bright, so he would come to the lower level of the  student union. There was a room down there, and he would tell some of  his stories, and the room was fairly sizeable. He was down there telling  his stories and a girl asked him to demonstrate his quick draw. So he  said,    Sure.    So he pulled the dang gun out, the gun went off, and he  blew a hole in the wall. (Laughs) He carried that thing with live  ammunition in it, all the time (Laughs) and the people in that room, they  all just froze because he said,    Sure,    and he pulled it out and it was an  accident. He didn   t mean to, but he pulled it out and luckily he was  pointing at a wall, and it was a big old .45 and it blew a big hole in that  wall, and it was old black powder. Smoke just gushered out of it, and  that sound just reverberated. I wasn   t in the room, but a number of  people I knew told me about it and they said,    Oh, you should   ve seen  that.    (Laughs) So that   s my Pistol Pete story   real story about what  really happened.  20  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  The point I was going to make, too   I was going to talk about cowboys  a little bit because back then there wasn   t this, let me say, pseudo-cowboyism  that we have now because at that time it was A M,  Agricultural and Mechanical. We had so many genuine cowboys that  nobody had to act like cowboys because they were. It   s a subtle  difference. And so we didn   t see this rah-rah cowboys. I mean we did,  but it was in a different, a little bit more subdued, way because there  were plenty of genuine, big-time cowboys on that campus. They were  always the nicest, most courteous students of all. There was none of the  cowboy swagger or anything like   I   m not implying that it   s that way  now, but it   s a subtle difference that I noticed, why do we have to strut,  sort of thing   interesting deal.  Other than that, I   ve enjoyed my time talking to you all about my days at  Stillwater. I was so lucky to be able to go to school there and get all the  exposures. The veterinary school   it   s reputation is worldwide. Most  people don   t realize that. You have some people over there that are  known worldwide, so I   m very lucky, and I think I   ve about run out of  stories, unless you have some questions to ask.  You said your brother went to OSU. Did anyone else in your family?  My mother went one summer. She did some graduate work over there,  and my brother went there. I had two uncles that went there in the late     30s and both graduated. Both then went into World War II, and so we  would go over there occasionally while they were going to school. I can  remember that as a little kid, going there.  That   s when the library was the one with turrets?  Yes. That   s right. I   d forgotten about it   yeah, that   s right. Because they  went to school there like 1938 through 1941 or 1937 through 1941. So I  had two uncles. One of them was killed in World War II, as I said. The  other one passed away here recently. It   s been in the family a long time  and I remember going to Stillwater even when I was a little kid, to visit  my uncles. And I had another relative who went to school there. He was  a second cousin, and he went there after World War II as a student. He  had married a German war bride, and they went to school and lived there  in Stillwater. So I remember going over there and meeting her. So, yeah,  the university   the school   s been in the family for a long time. We   ve  been in it and etc., and it   s all been very positive. I have no bad  recollections or incidences at all, so far. (Laughs)  Do you remember your room number when you lived at North Murray?  Just out of curiosity?  21  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  Finchum  Jackman  No.  Second floor?  Second floor. No, I don   t   because I was only there one year and I don   t  remember that. Did you want to buy some whiskey? (Laughter) Second  floor on the north end of North Murray, and it would be the room in the  far northeast corner, and that was it. (Laughs)  Well, thank you very much. It   s been very enjoyable. You have one more  story for us?  Well, I was talking about the   not poverty, but we just didn   t have the  affluence then and just to give another illustration was that I   ll bet that  fifty percent of the men going to school there in the period when I was  going to school there   that their standard bedding was army blankets.  The reason was we were still awash with army surplus material from  World War II and Korea, and you could buy good army blankets, wool  blankets, for like two for a dollar and a half or something like that. So I  know I had them, and my roommate had then, and it was out of  necessity and it was so practical.  Some guys, there was some farm boys and people there that just really  had minimal money, so I remember guys going to school there with  three blankets, no sheets. No mattress covers in the dorms. That was the  bedding. That was the standard bedding of a lot. Now there were a lot  that did not, you know   Sears and Roebuck as we called it then or J. C.  Penney   s, but that was a little facet that might give you an insight to the  standard of living. But it was no big deal. I mean, that was part of our  way of life back then, period.  ------- -------
