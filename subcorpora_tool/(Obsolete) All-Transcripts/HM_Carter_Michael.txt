Story_ID: 653082
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, and then your father's [Veledis Carter] side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then try to put 'em together; but, you know, I'm gonna start with your mother's side first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Lorraine [Lorraine Peters Carter], L-O-R-R-A-I-N-E, Peters, P-E-T-E-R-S, Carter, C-A-R-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: And what is, is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Omaha, Nebraska, July 5th, 1934, I believe, I almost wanna check that.  She was seventy-five when she passed, she passed in 19--in 2006.
Speaker 1: Oh, see it was probably in 1924.
Speaker 2: Twenty-four [1924].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I think I've got '24 [1924], yeah.  Okay.  So what do you know about, or how far back first of all can you trace your mother's side of the family?  How far back do they go?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that my grandmother is from Alabama, my grandfather was from New Orleans [Louisiana] that's as far as I can go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What are the stories about 'em?  Are they, so your grandmother is from Alabama, is there a story about how--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --she wound up in Omaha?
Speaker 2: No, I have no story about that.  But I have a story about how my grandfather got to, got, came from New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from what I understand he hoboed from New--from New Orleans to Nebraska.  And his name was Henry Peters.  And I don't know if you're familiar with, with New Orleans but there are, there is a street named Henry Peters [ph.].  So we are not sure whether the street, which came first, the name or the street, and I, probably the street came first and that he may have taken that name based on the fact that it was a name that he saw in New Orleans.  We are unclear as to why he left New Orleans, however it is speculated that he might have had some trouble with the law.  And--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --he left New Orleans and got to Nebraska and established himself, got a job at the packinghouse, so he worked as a meat packer and retired from there.  So he had what would be considered at that time a decent job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You know what house he worked for, what packinghouse?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could find that out at a later time but, no, I can't tell you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I used to know the ones, I can't think of the ones, well, at any rate, that's, okay.  So but that was a common--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --occupation in those days, in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, in Omaha--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --work for the meat packinghouse.  So you suspect he had another name originally--
Speaker 2: I suspect.
Speaker 1: --and not (unclear)--
Speaker 2: That's possible.
Speaker 1: --not Peters?
Speaker 2: Not, it's possible because--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --when my mother and I went to New Orleans together for an educational convention, and we saw the street we were flabbergasted because we knew that her father was from New Orleans and there his name was, right on a street sign.  So we started to speculate, you know.  And knowing that it was possible she speculated that he had some, some, some troubles with the law but we don't know for a fact.
Speaker 1: So was he mysterious about his past?  Did he talk about his other relatives at all or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, I, he passed while I, my mother was pregnant with me.  So I never had personal contact with, with him so no, I don't, I, I don't have any stories.
Speaker 1: Or did you ever meet any of his relatives named Peters?  I mean, I guess, that's a question if there's more Peters that might not be an issue.
Speaker 2: Well, no.  We never, I, I don't know any of my grandfather's side relatives.  My grandmother's, my grandmother had a sister that lived in, in, in Detroit [Michigan] and I met her, I met her and her descendants.  But I never, we never had much more contact with my grandfather's side.
Speaker 1: Now, who was your, well, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Harriett Peters.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Cole [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And you said there's not a, you don't know how she managed to get in, come up to Omaha from Alabama?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm trying to think now.  Wait a minute.  My grandmother's maiden name was Bonner [ph.], I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Bonner, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm tempted to think it had something to do with the railroad but I don't, I don't know, you know.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: I mean, there are so many railroad links out of Alabama.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: To other places in the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, again, you know, I have seen like you were referring to how the, how people migrated from the South and how they got to, you know, but beyond that I don't have any real information about my, my grandmother's ascent to the North.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what she did for a living?
Speaker 2: She, she cleaned houses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a housekeeper.
Story_ID: 653083
Speaker 1: Are there any stories that, that are passed down from your [maternal] grandparents [Harriett Peters and Henry Peters] about life in Omaha [Nebraska] and the days (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, there are a number of people that are famous that came from Omaha that were in my mother's [Lorraine Peters Carter] presence, Jackie Owens [sic.].
Speaker 1: Jesse Owens?
Speaker 2: Jesse Owens, yes (laughter).  We'll start over.  There are a number of people (laughter) that were in my mother's presence when she--
Speaker 1: Now, Jesse Owens is from Cleveland [Ohio] basically but--
Speaker 2: Is he?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But--
Speaker 2: Oh, she talked about him.
Speaker 1: (Unclear), okay.
Speaker 2: All right, well, maybe Jesse Owens--
Speaker 1: Well, he came, he could have lived there, for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I don't know but yeah, I know (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Malcolm X--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was in, was in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was born there.
Speaker 2: --he was in Omaha during the time she was there.  I understand that she, he, he dated my aunt at one point in time.  What was the man's name?
Speaker 1: Probably an aunt in Detroit [Michigan], I guess, probably right?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: No, no?
Speaker 2: No, this was in Omaha.
Speaker 1: Well, they left Omaha shortly after he was born.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: They weren't there that long, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was raised in Lansing [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, then maybe--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was a tale (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, but since you said you had a relative in Detroit--
Speaker 2: Well, see we do have relatives in Detroit.
Speaker 1: --I mean, he, he lived in Detroit--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did live in Detroit.
Speaker 2: Well, it could be.
Speaker 1: His brother [Wesley Little] still lives there now.
Speaker 2: It could be.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You could be correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It could be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's probably a true story just a different--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --part of the country.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And who, who else Malcolm X, Jesse Owens?
Speaker 2: The gentleman that Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] referred to as his economic advisor, you know, I'm drawing a blank now, you got the cameras on me.
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Buffett [Warren Buffett]?
Speaker 2: Buffett, Warren Buffett (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Warren Buffett, okay.
Speaker 2: Was one, my mother went to grade school with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  Let's see who else was around there.
Speaker 1: Now, I've heard that Reverend Joseph Jackson [Joseph H. Jackson] who became the president of the National Baptist Convention [National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.] had a church [Bethel Baptist Church] in Omaha--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --before he moved to Chicago [Illinois] and became a--
Speaker 2: He's never, he's never came up.
Speaker 1: Never mentioned it (unclear).
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Of course, there are a lot of great sports figures--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --out of Omaha--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: --my uncle played, my uncle played high school football with [HistoryMaker] Gale Sayers.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, he definitely was raised in Omaha.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] John Beasley the actor, I don't know if you, (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he's not one of, he's (unclear) come up, he didn't come up in conversation.
Speaker 1: Bob Gibson the pitcher.
Speaker 2: Bob Gibson, she--
Speaker 1: Bob Boozer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  Now, I've heard those names mentioned but I don't know what, you know, what context they knew them.  But Omaha, like Milwaukee [Wisconsin], is not a very big town.  So, and matter of fact it's smaller than Milwaukee so, you know, the black community was, people knew each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it they, they were in North Omaha [Omaha, Nebraska], you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in the black community there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So at a certain point, then, well, did your mother, now, now did she go to, she, she went to school in Omaha, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She went to University of Nebraska-Omaha [Omaha, Nebraska].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, so she not, not only graduated from high school but went to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --University of Nebraska at Omaha?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was, did she study education or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, okay.  And so she, did she always wanna be a teacher?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did.  (Unclear). From, from the time she was a young child she talked about that she wanted to be a teacher.  She, she was always, you know, a very smart, top of the class, she was very excited about learning.  And she wanted to, she wanted to make children feel that excitement about learning.  And when, you could see whenever she was in front of a classroom, in front of children, just the glow that she had when she was able to communicate with the children.  And she had a different relationship with children than most people that, that are teachers now.  I'm not saying that there's good, good, good, better or whatever but, but I could see a true connection, you know, with the children.  And it never, it, it was, it was always like that for some reason.  She could, she could be talking to people on the street, you know, some boys on, in the, in the, in the hood acting bad, and she had that, she had that way of being able to stop them at what they were doing and they would listen, you know.  They may continue after she left, but she at least could draw their attention.
Story_ID: 653084
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She [Carter's mother, Lorraine Peters Carter] had that inner authority.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: That, yeah.
Speaker 2: That respect.  She, she commanded that respect, all, all the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a gift, it's hard to decode, how, where it comes from--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but some people do have it.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I know, I know for a fact that part of it comes from, from knowing that you're a valued person.  She, she loved herself, she knew herself and respected herself so she could give that respect back.  And, and even when she was being a, you know, in an authority figure position, she was still given the respect, you know, even though she might be chastising.  So, you know, it was her inner strength, her inner, her inner being, knowing that she was a valued person which I credit my [maternal] grandmother [Harriett Peters] and grandfather [Henry Peters] with, you know, 'cause they, they, they were able to, to give her, her self value.  And I think that's one of the things that is difficult for a parent to give their children and, you know, in this environment that you are worthy and that you are valued.  And I, I know that she gave that, she got that from them because I got that from her.  And, you know, I am not really concerned about what people think other than hoping that they think that I'm, I'm, I'm a person that has strong moral value and, and character, okay.  Other than that, I'm not concerned about their specific opinion.  And that is the confidence that she was able to give me.  Now, I can accept help, I can accept advice, I can, I can, I can, and, and I can even accept a different opinion, however, I'm a confident person in myself and she was a, she gave that to me, my, she and my father [Veledis Carter] gave that to me.  So she had that and she was able to give that to me as well.  I don't know if I can, if I, if I present it as well as she did but I know I, I have the inner, the inner strength.
Speaker 1: Now, did she ever mention who inspired her when she was growing up?  If she, there were any special mentors or teachers for her?
Speaker 2: Well, I tell you, her father was like God, you know, to her.  And if daddy said something, it was law, okay.  So I would say she talked about him more than anybody else.  Obviously her mother had great influence on her but her father was, her father's word was law.  If he said it, it was the truth.  So, you know, I even, so now sometimes I even question some, some of, (laughter) some of her historical, his, her memories about things that he may have, may or may not have said because I recognize that parents don't always tell you the truth because it's not appropriate.  So as a child he may have said things to her that she, she believed to this day that were not necessarily the 100 percent truth.  However, you know, you know where I'm going with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was law.  Daddy said it, it was the truth.
Story_ID: 653085
Speaker 1: Now, let me turn to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Veledis [Veledis Carter], V-E-L-E-D-I-S, Edwin, E-D-W-I-N, Carter, C-A-R-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name of Veledis?  Is it, does it come from a classical reference or something or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he, he talked about the fact that it, he, he didn't really like his name at first 'cause it was so odd and people couldn't pronounce it.  He never really got into where it came from.  The closest name to him, to it, he said was Filedis [ph.], he met a person named Filedis, but he had never met another Veledis. And he had nicknames over a period of time, like when he was at college [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] and things, so people wouldn't have to trip over his name but by the time I was born, and I think he was thirty-eight when I was born, he, he was fully Veledis and, and he didn't use the nickname at all, so.  But again, he, he recognized that it was a, a very odd, different name.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and for period of time in his life it was, he struggled with it but then I think he, he, he started to own it once he, once he, you know, became a, a, a full fledged adult and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --got out on his own.
Speaker 1: So now, what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Pikeville, Kentucky, February 29, 1921, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, he was raised by his grandparents, his grandfather and his mother.  And to be honest, I don't think that he knew his father.  He, he called his grandfather Dad, and his name was Washington Carter [ph.].  So he did not have the surname of his father.
Speaker 1: So Washington Carter was his mother's father?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  So is there, so, his, his father, his birth father--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --disappeared or left at some time, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think, I have never, I never heard any real reference to him other than, "I was raised by my, my grandfather."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that was a point of shame to him 'cause as, as, you know, in that period of time it wasn't as commonplace to be, have a single, single, single parent family.  And it was a, a source of shame for folks.  So I think, you know, he didn't discuss that really because of that.  And that's unfortunate but, you know, that's, that's one of the things that he, the crosses he beared with the, in his own--
Speaker 1: Now, now, he's a man born in Pikeville, Kentucky, you said, in the hills.  Is it--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --like in central Kentucky, eastern Kentucky, or--
Speaker 2: It's, it's central, I, I think central eastern.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: I think, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the Appalachians [Appalachian Mountains], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so were, were there any other relatives of his in Omaha [Nebraska]?
Speaker 2: No, in Pikeville.
Speaker 1: No, in, I mean, did he, oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was in Pikeville.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, yeah.
Speaker 2: It's all right, right.
Speaker 1: So he's raised there and he didn't--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, he had, he had cousins.  And--
Speaker 1: But I knew, I, I figured he had some there but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but somehow, I, I thought he, I thought they got together in Omaha but they, they didn't (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] was in Omaha.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 2: No, my parents got together here [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They met here.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, all right.  So, well, well, tell us about, are there any stories about the, well, his father's side we don't know anything about but on the Washington side are there any stories about that--
Speaker 2: Ancestors?
Speaker 1: --that go back to their ancestors and what they were doing during slavery times or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I do recall him saying that he, that there, that they were, they were from further south than that and I believe it was Alabama as well.  And they got, they, they, they, they had a horse and carriage to start going north 'cause they felt there would have been, there was more opportunities north.  And they stopped in Kentucky and I don't know if it's because of the mountains became more difficult for them to, to, to, to, to navigate the terrain or what but he said, he always would say, you know, "Y'all went north, but y'all didn't really go too far north."  But that's, that's the story he would tell about getting to Pikeville.
Story_ID: 653086
Speaker 1: And that's before (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. So they came from further south somewhere?
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Maybe Virginia or some place, yeah, I think (unclear), okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: All right.  So did your father [Veledis Carter] have a chance to go to school too (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My father went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: After he went to World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was a, he was in the [U.S.] Army.  Was drafted to World War II at the age of seventeen.  And he said he was on, he was on the ship doing maneuvers and he said he heard Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] on the radio say, none of his boys under the age of nineteen will be going overseas.  Well, he said they got on that boat to go to maneuvers and the next land they saw was Africa.  So he went to, from Africa to Italy and spent, spent time in Europe.  And then after his, after his tour he came back and then he went to Tennessee State.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Did, did he have any stories about how he was treated during the war in the Army?
Speaker 1: Well, he, the only, a couple, one story I remember, now, I don't know why I remember this one specifically but he was, he had a German prisoner to make him a hole in the wall for an electrical outlet.  And the prisoner just kept making the hole bigger and bigger and bigger and by the time it was, by the time he finished it was an unusable hole so they had to patch it up.  But he learned, he said he also, he learned Italian while he was in Italy.  And he said that he was in a, a, a pub or a bar and these people were talking about each other and they were telling a story about how someone had passed in their family but he said for the first time he was listening to somebody speak Italian and he understood what they were saying and he start laughing.  And the people that were talking looked at him like, we're talking about death and you're laughing, and he said he couldn't explain it to him but he just, he, he understood what they said and that was the first time that he realized he could, he knew what they were saying.  So that was, that was a story that, that I remember about him being in Italy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So he kind of soaked up the language--
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --after being there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, and he could speak it still.  He would speak Italian every now and again, you know, when in my presence and he would always say, (speaking Italian), so, something like that.  But I, I, I, I, I got on him, I don't wanna quote him 'cause he, he was probably saying it correctly, I can't repeat him right (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he, yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.  So now was he in the Quartermaster Corps [U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps] or was he in a unit?  You know what kind of unit he was in?
Speaker 1: He was an, he was an electrician.
Speaker 2: Electrician, okay.
Speaker 1: So, no, I don't know what the, if there, you know, what special, what their, what their call number was or anything like that but I do know that he was an electrician and he--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --continued to use his electrical talents all over the house (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so when he came back from the war he was, he went to Tennessee State on the--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], I guess.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And he became a teacher also?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is that?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.  He was a special ed [special education] teacher.
Story_ID: 653087
Speaker 1: Now we come to the critical part.  Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well, I do know that they were both teachers at MPS, Milwaukee Public Schools.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that they taught, I believe, they taught at the same school.
Speaker 1: Now, how did they, well, this, this is a good question here is--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how did they get to Milwaukee [Wisconsin]?  I mean, one's from Omaha [Nebraska], one's from--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Kentucky, is going to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he's in Nashville [Tennessee], so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well--
Speaker 1: --when he gets out then how do they get--
Speaker 2: --my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] was teaching in Chicago [Illinois], okay, and I know that she taught there for at least five, five or, five or six years.  And I believe that the opportunity presented itself to teach in Milwaukee, potentially at a higher rate and so she came here.  He [Veledis Carter] came here, there were factory jobs that were hiring and I know that he worked for International Harvester [International Harvester Company; Navistar International Corporation] when he first arrived.  And then, was then found, you know, found his way into MPS.  But I believe that initially there was, you know, an open- opening of, of some, some factories that the announcements must have gone out all over the country because I know that's how quite a few black men got here from the South, that there was factory jobs available and he came and, and, and got that.  So he worked for International Harvester before he became, he became a worker, before he worked with MPS.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, now, how did your parents meet, is there a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, not, not, not more specific than they were, that they were working at the same school and they either, and they would see each other, you know, in passing.  They were on the same faculty and they cultivated a relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they were working at the same school and started dating, I guess and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, when did they get married (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nineteen sixty-one [1961].  June, I believe, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, that's, now they're pretty well along in their careers and stuff at this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they've been teaching for a while.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And like I said so '61 [1961] my father was, my father was, I think he was thirty-seven and my mother was--
Speaker 1: Was he born in, if he was born in '41 [1941] he'd be forty?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: He said, I mean, '21 [1921].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, twenty years later is 1961.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So he's, he's (unclear)
Speaker 2: He was born, he, I, see I believe he was born--
Speaker 1: I mean, forty, forty years later is 1961.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So what you say?
Speaker 1: I said forty years later is 1961.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: From 1921.  So I'm--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --thinking he's forty years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that, that could be true.  I, you know, my dates, my, my numbers based on, I'm thinking about how old he was when I first asked him the question, how old he was, he was forty four years old.  So, I think I was probably four or five when that, when I asked him that question.
Story_ID: 653088
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your parents were married in 1961?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Nope.  Only one (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're the only child?
Speaker 2: The only one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, when you look at your parents' personalities--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --their dispositions, their talents, and abilities, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Hm, good question.  Very good question.  I would say probably my father [Veledis Carter] mainly because my disposition is very similar to his, is what I understand.  And he was a pretty much no nonsense type of individual.  And I, he, but he had a great sense of humor.  But I think many people that worked with him never saw it and I get the feeling that most of the people that work with me don't ever see mine.  But, you know, I, I, I laugh a lot and I love to laugh, you know, and I think that a lot of the time when I am called upon to be the authority in a situation I'm kind of sort of laughing at myself inside in that, you know, I know me and that they don't so, you know, they will take my authority for what it's worth and they don't know that, you know, I could, we could be laughing about this tomorrow if we were at the park but right now I'm very serious about what we have to do, you know, to, to make things happen the way I see they should.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, okay.  Now, do you take anything after your mother [Lorraine Peters Carter]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I'd like to think that I can relate to people the way she did.  And that I don't really have what I would call enemies, people that don't like me that are, people that I grew up with or friends, you know, people in my circle.  I would not, I never had anyone that just straight up didn't like me.  Now, I could say that potentially there are people that don't like me because of decisions that I've made here [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin], you know, or situations we've been in and rules that I've had to make; but interpersonal setting, she always was able to connect and I think that's something that I, I was able to glean from her.
Story_ID: 653089
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an earliest memory in, in the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  We went to the World's Fair in New York [1964 New York World's Fair], I'm not sure what year it was but I'm--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure when it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: So I'm born in '62 [1962].  And I remember being at the World's Fair.  I remember seeing the globe and that I've seen since then in New York [New York].  I remember going down a slide that was like, you had a burlap sack and you go down this giant slide.  And I just, it, it, it's a very distinct vision in my mind.  They, they also let us get on TV.  It was, you know, this is when, you know, you couldn't get on TV, you don't ever see yourself on TV so the line was around the block just to stand in front of the camera so you could see yourself on television and I remember that so.  I guess I, like I said, I must have been three or four but I do remember that.  And that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was our first family trip.
Story_ID: 653090
Speaker 1: You grew up here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --what neighborhood did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: Well, originally we were on 17th and Congress [Congress Street], right by Rufus King [Rufus King High School; Rufus King International School, High School Campus, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And from my first memory to fourth grade we were on 17th Street, right down the street from Rufus King, which is a very beautiful neighborhood.  And when I was let's say in fourth grade, my parents [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] started looking for a house and I'll never forget 'cause, you know, I had no control over what house we, they were gonna pick but I was, I was always there looking with them and my father [Veledis Carter] liked to swim so he was thinking about getting a swimming pool.  And we would, we'd go to these houses that had pools and I'm getting really happy, you know, we gonna have a pool, we gonna have a pool (laughter) but they chose a house, they chose a design of a house in Brown Deer [Wisconsin] and it was, they, they, they built this house from the, from the, from the ground up and there was no pool in this house.  So I still live in that house today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is in Brown Deer which is a suburb?
Speaker 2: Suburb of Milwaukee.
Speaker 1: Milwaukee, okay.
Speaker 2: North, northern suburb.  So we moved in that house in '71 [1971].  And my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] lived there until she passed.  And my wife [Lori Carter (ph.)] and I and my daughter [Micah Carter (ph.)] when she was diagnosed with cancer, basically moved in to my mother's house and stayed there for the year, year and a half that she was going through that situation.  And I had always, I had always told my mother that I'd like to raise my family and my child, my children in that house and I didn't want her to sell it, so she never sold it.  And then, I probably, I said that years, years, and years ago and like when I was in high school and she never did.  And so we're still there.  We're there now.
Story_ID: 653091
Speaker 1: Now who is Rufus King?  You mentioned Rufus King a couple of times (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rufus King is a high school [Rufus King High School; Rufus King International High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  A high school, okay.
Speaker 2: Which is, which is at the end of the block on 17th and Congress [Congress Street].  That's where--it's located there and we lived in the middle of the block between Olive [Olive Street] and Congress on 17th Street which is, you know, just north of Capitol [Capitol Drive], you know, where Capitol is?  Okay.  It's about four blocks north of Capitol on 17th, that's where--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's where (unclear).
Speaker 1: It's funny like Rufus King, you know, was either a senator or a congressman--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't even know--
Speaker 1: --at some point.
Speaker 2: --it's interesting, I don't know who Rufus King was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He's, look there's a story, Rufus King was a senator or congressman from the South, I think--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --it's Georgia [sic. Alabama], he helped found Seattle [Washington] or he owned land where Seattle was founded on, the Puget Sound out in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Washington.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the county around Seattle was named after Rufus King, King County [Washington].
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: You know, the Kingdome [King County Multipurpose Domed Stadium, Seattle, Washington] and all that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: That's because of King County.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: They recently changed it, a brother named Larry [HistoryMaker Larry Gossett], I can't think of his last name now, but we interviewed him up there, he's the county commissioner--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for King County, they changed it officially to Martin Luther King County.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, with Martin Luther King's image as a logo--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --instead of Rufus King (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Rufus King.
Speaker 1: --the former slave owner.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: So, that's Rufus King [sic. William R. King].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, now that you mentioned that, I, I went to, this, this is, I don't know if this is in your order, but I went to a daycare center named E.B. Phillips [E.B. Phillips Day Care Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], okay.  And E.B. Phillips was the minister of Greater Galilee Church [Greater Galilee Missionary Baptist Church, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  And the daycare center was named after him.  But I realized at some, at one point that I never knew what E.B. Phillips stood for.  And I didn't as a child even know that he was a person.  And so the name of our agency is V.E. Carter Development Group [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I, I, I realize that I need to and I have been telling the children who V.E. Carter was because in my experience I had no idea who E.B. Phillips was until much later when I became an adult to look back and V.E. Carter was Veledis Edwin Carter [Veledis Carter], my father.  So I told the--I have to tell the children that and I tell them, I generally tell them at the beginning of the year, around Christmas, then we have a black history program and then right before graduation I, I mention it again so that they, they know who V.E. Carter was and, you know, that's who, that's who founded this school and where you go, what school you go to.
Speaker 1: Hm, okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause people do- kids don't realize it, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, you don't, you just don't know unless you're told.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 653092
Speaker 1: You all moved [to Brown Deer, Wisconsin] in '71 [1971], you were about ten years old then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in fourth grade, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --seventy-one [1971], I was born in '62 [1962] so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Nine, nine, nine, ten, yeah.
Speaker 1: Nine, nine years old, I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, nine years old.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But so part of the time you grew up on 6th, was it 16th?
Speaker 2: 17th [17th Street].
Speaker 1: 17th.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then the rest of the years on--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what were, tell us what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the block on 17th Street, it was a very nice neighborhood.  I, I, I remember trying to catch squirrels and my neighbor finally told me not to do that 'cause they'd bite me.  And I couldn't cross the street until I was about eight, nine without my parents' [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] permission.  I remember riding up and down the block on my bike.  And one year I got a bike that was a little bit too big for me and when I got, going south from our house is, is, is Congress [Congress Street].  And, is it Congress or, yeah, it's Congress or which, whichever street it is.  To go, to go back west, to go back east is a slight upgrade and on the corner of that block was a house that had a big gigantic Doberman [Doberman Pinscher] that when you ride passed it always just barked like it wanted to chew you up.  Well, on this particular day I was riding up this, this hill on a bike that was a little too heavy for me and the dog busted his chain, jumped over the fence, and grabbed a hold of my leg.  And all I remember is like going, the world going in a circle and I fell to the ground and then the owners got there and got the dog off of me and my, my buddy who was riding his bike with me, rode his bike down the alley to my house and ran in the house, told my father I got bit by a dog, so they came down.  And the next thing I know, my father was carrying me down the street, down the alley to the car and took me to the hospital.  And I had to get stitches and they had to pour this iodine stuff in my leg, which is more painful than the dog bite itself.  It's, the hole was about this deep (gestures) in my leg.  Anyway, so that's, that was a very distinctive memory of living on that block.  And I had a fear of dogs for quite some time after that.  But I could say that I, at the age of forty-seven I'm, I'm over that fear for the most part but, you know, you get a, you get a growling, growling pit bull, I think anybody could be a little nervous.  But it still, it still stays with me.  The scar is still on my leg, I showed my daughter [Micah Carter (ph.)] my scar.  So that's, that's one of those memories.  But actually aside from that very pleasant, very pleasant neighborhood, ride around the block, people would speak, there was children my age, I played with folks up and down the block.  We had, my parents had relationships with neighbors and I, I still have relationships with some of those people right now.  Matter of fact a couple of them worked with, with us here at the agency [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and one is a fireman now who actually responds to calls that come from here and he lived two doors down from me at, on 17th Street; so basically a very pleasant environment.
Story_ID: 653093
Speaker 1: Did you get a lot of individual educational help at home with two teacher parents [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] and, and being a single (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, did I, yeah, yeah.  I was in school when I was at home (laughter).  Yes, I did.  I, I, I had flash cards, I had work that I was assigned to do by my, my mother on a daily basis.  So I, I didn't just have homework, and if I didn't have homework I had homework.  And I just found myself telling my daughter [Micah Carter (ph.)] who is, who is eight, the same thing, I said, she said, "I don't have any homework, Daddy."  I said, "You always have homework, okay.  And if you don't have homework then I'm gonna write some problems down." And that's what my mother did, she'd write problems, she'd write math problems down, she'd give me spelling, spelling words, and we were always, yeah, always, always in school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said it was a pretty friendly neighborhood did you have a lot of friends your age?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Actually my cousin and his, his parents lived upstairs from us, we lived in a duplex so my mother's brother who came from Omaha [Nebraska], they lived in the flat upstairs.  And so he was, he is only about three years younger than I am so he was, he was my main playmate.  And then I had about five or six other guys on the block who I could go to their house and, and go inside and their mother would give me lunch and, you know, if I was there and I could, we'd ride bikes and, you know, play all the different games that that kids play.  So yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I had, I had quite a few friends.
Story_ID: 653094
Speaker 1: Now where did you start school, grade school?
Speaker 2: Where?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I went to University School, University School of Milwaukee [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I started that school right out of E.B. Phillips [E.B. Phillips Day Care Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which was my nursery school so I started going to University School in, from, in kindergarten.  And I went to University School through twelfth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to one school.
Speaker 1: Now, University School is it associated with University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: Or just, that's just a--
Speaker 2: --it's a, it's a private school that used to be Milwaukee-Downer Seminary [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and it also was the Milwaukee University School and the current name is University School of Milwaukee.  Those two schools combined to create University School of Milwaukee.  And it, it's a, it's, it, it was formerly a boarding school.  It's, it's, it's one of those upscale private schools that my parents [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] decided they would sacrifice to send me to because they also saw some of the flaws in the system that they had formerly worked for [Milwaukee Public Schools].
Story_ID: 653095
Speaker 1: Sounds a little scary to me that the brightest public school teachers send their children to other schools.  They (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, they [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] left the public school [Milwaukee Public Schools] and started their own school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you see, so they, they didn't just send me to a public school--I mean a private school while they were public school teachers, they started their, they, they were moving away from the public school and they also started their own educational institutional which we, we're sitting in today (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Now, now, now when did they start the school?
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How old were you when they--
Speaker 2: In 19--1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They, they incorporated Carter Child Development Center [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which was a nursery slash child development daycare, okay.  I would like to say that my parents were the ones that coined the phrase child development as opposed to daycare.  This, this, the, the agency was called Carter Child Development specifically because my father did not want to be babysitting.  He wanted to develop the child from the youngest age, with manipulation to actual classwork.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, so you already had, the family had already moved at this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --to Brown Deer [Wisconsin] in those--
Speaker 2: Well, actually it kind of happened in a, in a, and, and, and my, I can't really remember in my mind which came first, the center or moving.  But I say the center was started in '70 [1970], (unclear) '70 [1970], it's the '71 [1971], '72 [1972], end of the year time.  So it's either the beginning of, the beginning of seventy- '72 [1972] or the end of '71 [1971].  And so in my mind I don't have that completely clear so sometimes I say '71 [1971], sometimes I say '72 [1972] but it's December, January, I think we moved in the house in February and I'm not sure if we, if they opened the agency in December or some- you know, in that range or September maybe.
Story_ID: 653096
Speaker 1: So were you a pretty good student in school [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Well, I was fair, I'll put it like that, until I recognized that it was really up to me to be a good student as opposed to how it was presented or the excuses that kids give.  I was a C, C, low B student, you know, in high school and in grade school.  I, I compare myself to how Theo [Theo Huxtable] was on 'The Cosby Show.'  And when I got to college I had a, I had a different perspective on life.  I went to Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and--
Speaker 1: Now, I don't wanna get you there too fast.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: But, but the only thing, now did you have a favorite subject in school when you, before you--
Speaker 2: History, really, you know.  That that intrigued me the most.
Speaker 1: What, what aspect of it?  Was it ancient history, black history, American history?
Speaker 2: Just American history, really.  Because, and, and one of the things that that that sparked it was when I was in, I believe third or fourth grade we had a history book that said, it mentioned slavery and that the, the black Americans were a, a happy go lucky race, okay.  That's, that piqued my interests from that point on.  And so I did my own little history research.  I'm like how, everybody in the class laughed, you know, when, when it was said.  And they looked, they all looked at me, now this is a predominantly white school and there were probably no other black kids in my class at that time.  So here they said the black race is a happy go lucky race and the teacher kind of paused and the kids kind of chuckled and then they went, "Yeah, Mike [HistoryMaker Michael Evans Carter], you're happy go lucky," so.
Speaker 1: So the only, that, I take it, is one of the few references to black people in the course?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a happy go lucky (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, that's it.
Story_ID: 653097
Speaker 1: But this is a time now, you're in grade school when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did, were you keenly aware of what that was about during those days?
Speaker 2: Well, Dr. King was assassinated when we were still on 17th Street.  I was at University School [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] at the time.  I, I knew who he was, I knew what he was trying to do, okay.  I recognized, you know, I saw the, the, the riot, the riots that were going on, the, the, the, the water hoses--
Speaker 1: And it was right here in Milwaukee [Wisconsin], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And even, and even when we had a curfew that was put out and it said that everyone is supposed to be in at a certain time.  And, you know, as a child my full understanding what that meant was not, I didn't have it so we were in the car and we could see the National Guard standing on the corner and I thought we weren't supposed to be out so I'm, I hid, I hid underneath the backseat because I didn't, I thought if they saw me I'd be arrested 'cause, you know, it was a lot of stuff going down at that time.  I mean, there was riots and the National Guard and M16s, they weren't M16s then but whatever kind of guns they had that were big, you could see 'em.  And this was some serious stuff.  And for a seven year old, eight year old, whatever I was, you, you know, six year old, it's not, it's not a pretty picture and it really scared me.  And when his, Dr. King's funeral was on, I remember that there was a TV show that normally came on that I wanted to see and I asked my father [Veledis Carter] "Why are they, why, what is this, why isn't my, you know, my show on?"  And he said, "This is Dr. King's funeral and all the channels will be showing his funeral and you need to sit down right here and watch it, okay.  Because you may not be old enough right now to really understand what's going on, but you'll know, you'll know that you watched it."  And so I did.
Story_ID: 653098
Speaker 1: Did television play a big role now 'cause you later got involved in television--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --as a career.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, did you pay a lot of attention to television growing up--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --be- being a--
Speaker 2: Only child.
Speaker 1: --only child?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I, I, yeah, yes, I did, yeah.  I watched TV.  It was my companion to a certain degree.  Funny thing, you know, I liked 'Batman' and it conflicted I think with 'Star Trek' and my father [Veledis Carter] was a big 'Star Trek' fan when it was originally on.  And so we had a TV upstairs and we had one in the basement.  And the TV in the basement was black and white and we had a color TV upstairs and I was too scared to watch TV in the basement by myself so my father would have to go to the basement (laughter).  And then when 'Batman' was canceled I believe 'Star Trek' was still on and, and then I start watching 'Star Trek' with my father.  And we shared that until, until he passed.  And he actually got to see the first 'Star Trek' movie ['Star Trek: The Motion Picture'] but he passed in '84 [1984] so he didn't get to see any of the 'Next Generation' ['Star Trek: The Next Generation'] and any of that stuff.  And that was, I mean, it was, he was a Trekkie before they even called them, you know, that.
Speaker 1: Do, do you, do you have any idea of what it was about 'Star Trek' that attracted him?
Speaker 2: It was, I, I really believe it was the whole concept of the future and Mr. Spock and his logic.  And he, he talked about logic quite a bit and, and, and after watching the show over the years that I have, I can see that that he, his, his like of 'Star Trek' and my watching 'Star Trek' because of that, the whole concept of logic and how, how 'Star Trek' addresses it, it's become internalized.  So, yeah, TV was, TV had a great influence on me.  I learned quite a bit from TV as well I think.  I liked, I did like to watch public television too.  I always liked the nature shows and I like cooking shows.  And so I, I learned, I believe I, I learned how to cook innately from watching shows I couldn't even, and they come, and that stuffs come up in my mind, you know, I recall what I learned on those shows years ago.  But, yeah, it had great influence in, in, in, in my decision to go into television as a career, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were, you were a kid now, when you were coming along black people were starting to appear on the screen as never before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I don't know if you took it for granted in those days but--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --well the, but, you know, like Bill Cosby on 'I Spy.'
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Julia'--
Speaker 2: 'Julia'--
Speaker 1: --TV show.
Speaker 2: 'Julia' was a significant show because, you know, people actually thought I favored Corey Baker.  And we went to New York [New York], my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] and I went to New York and we're walking on the street and people were stopping me and talking about, "Corey Baker, what you doing here?  I thought you was in California."  And they actually, the people actually believed I was him.  So my mother and I, after that it became even more special 'cause we, we watched it together.  But no, it was significant to me that there was a show that featured, that had a black child, you know.  The fact that it had a black woman that, that didn't and then, and he was, she was a single mother, didn't really have as much impact on me but that there was someone that I could identify with and then people actually thought I was him at times so.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was, that's really significant in, in a sense that, no, there was no other, 'The Brady Bunch,' 'The Partridge Family,' they didn't have any black kids but I had 'Leave It to Beaver,' 'Andy Griffith' ['The Andy Griffith Show'] all great shows but they didn't have no black kids in 'em.  And it didn't really make any difference to me at first.  But then when I saw Corey Baker it, it, it had a great, it had a much greater significance, you know.  And I would, I, I, I really believe that the shows like 'Andy Griffith,' 'Leave It to Beaver,' even 'The Brady Bunch' had a much larger influence on people that are of my era than, than, as, as far as the way our moral values were created.  You know, our parents were the most significant in that factor but they were reemphasized in those shows.  'Leave It to Beaver' and 'Andy Griffith' and the, no, not 'The Partridge Family' so much as 'The Brady Bunch,' they were very wholesome shows.  I mean, they're so wholesome now that it's even, it's almost comical.  But as a child growing up watching that stuff, it, it, it was, it had a significant impact.  And I, I tell people all the time we had 'Leave It to Beaver,' they got 'The Simpsons,' you know.  I mean, you think about the difference in how that, how that actually becomes, you know, a process in a person's thinking pattern, you know.  Bart [Bart Simpson] says, you know, "Bite me," or have, "Eat, eat a cow," you know, we, if Beaver [Theodore "Beaver" Cleaver] said something like that, you know, their father was on her case, you know, quick, you know.  And 'Julia' still had the same, had the same, had the same perspective, you know, with, with how she, she disseminated her value system.  So I, I think we, I, I, everybody grows up in a unique time but, you know, to see Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination and Robert Kennedy's [Robert F. Kennedy] assassination, have these, have these other influences on television which were actually very significant to the point where, you know, I watched the shows every week or whatever so had a, had a significant, I think, influence on my, my, my, my moral makeup.

Speaker 1: What about movies and music?  Popular culture music did you listen to a lot of, you know, popular radio in those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Of course, my Jackson, The Jackson 5 was my, I mean, Michael Jackson was only a couple of years older than me so I looked at him like he was, you know, he was, he was somebody that I wanted to be, you know, until he got to be about eighteen.  But--
Speaker 1: When, when he started changing colors and stuff and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, when he, when he started metamorphosing, yeah, changed him a little bit.  But, you know, being, going to a school that was predominantly white and most of the, most of the boys didn't really care too much for the Jacksons.  Now, there was a, there was a couple other black kids in my class, we enjoyed them together but then, mostly all the girls enjoyed Michael.  So I had a, I had a, I had a connection there that the other, the other boys didn't have.  So I, I, I liked to listen to the, to the music with the girls and I danced with the girls and the other boys didn't really dance; and so that was, that was a, a nice little separation that I had.
Story_ID: 653100
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] did you get involved in high school activities like the newspaper and stuff like that, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was an athlete.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the things that I didn't mention earlier but I played hockey from the time that I was in third grade through high school.  And so I had, I had been in that sport for a number of years when I got to high school.  I also played soccer.  And then I did the, the, I threw the discus and the shot put in, in track.  Those were my main, my main extracurricular activities.
Story_ID: 653101
Speaker 1: They got all black hockey leagues in Detroit [Michigan] now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Ready?
Speaker 2: All right.  So you, you were a hockey player--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in, from the time you were eight years old to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so, yeah, I was--
Speaker 2: --so in high school did you play--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --on the hockey team?
Speaker 1: Yes, I did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: University School [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] had, had, had a hockey rink.  And so we had skating parties and I had my figure skates in third grade and all the kids, all the kids in my class were at this party and we're skating, you know.  And I didn't know anything about hockey at the time, but there were hockey players that had been playing, you know, for a couple of years in, in my class and they could see that I could skate and, you know, I really had no real skating experience, I, I, I skate, I skated naturally pretty much.  So they decided they were gonna play a game, knock Carter [HistoryMaker Michael Evans Carter] down, see if they could, you know, because they were hockey players.  Okay, well, they couldn't do it.  And so one of the coaches who was a father of one of our, you know, our group was watching and he said, "Why don't you ask Mike if he wants to play hockey?"  And that's how I, I got into the game.  But, yeah, it was about six or seven guys who decided they'd just, you know, you know how kids pick on each other, they was gonna, they was gonna knock me down, well, they couldn't do it.  And that's pretty much how I played the game and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I do know that there is a, an animal instinctive side of human nature that comes out when you're playing a game like that because it's very interesting.  I think, you know, in football it comes out as well, but you enjoy hitting and, and you enjoy playing hard and, and that becomes a very nice thrill to be skating fast, to be hitting somebody, to hit the puck hard, score a goal, you know.  But I also realized that the significance of a team sport gives you such a, a greater understanding of, of what winning and losing and being a part of a team is about and that the lessons I learned with hockey are probably as strong as I learned with anything else that as I've, you know, I've ever experienced.  And going through the discipline of deciding when I can and cannot say things or do things because as a younger player, you have a little more leeway to be a little reckless.  Now, I, I, I was never a person that got penalties.  I never, I never was a cheater or a dirty player, but I was always the subject of the fact that I was different and the N word was used quite a bit and I reacted like people that get called that react.  And that would be the only time that I'd sit in the penalty box is after someone said that.  And when I got to high school and we were playing for stakes so to speak, placement in, placement in tournament or placing in rankings, I learned that I couldn't do it because it, I'd sacrifice, I'd be sacrificing well, the, the positiveness from my teammates and so I would go back to the bench and tell my teammates what happened.  And we were in a tournament in Wild Pond [ph.] and I told them, "If this number thirteen," or whatever his number was, "calls me that again, you know what I'm gonna do."  And everybody on the bench was like, "Oh, no."  You know, we're a tie game, if I got a penalty, if I got a penalty, then, it, it could cost us the game.  So I didn't, they told the ref [referee] but after the game my team surrounded me and we stopped and they stopped the other team from moving and they told them what they thought about what they said and that, "We wouldn't be back to the tournament if you couldn't, if you can't play the sport in the proper way and if, we have always won the tournament, so we don't need to be here anyway," and this is what some of my teammates said.  So they also grew with that as well.
Story_ID: 653102
Speaker 1: All right.  So we were, we were talking about your experiences in hockey, on the hockey team (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was there any other black players on your team?
Speaker 2: Well, not on--yeah, actually, we had one other player, he was a younger, younger, younger than I, he was about two years younger but his knees were bad so he didn't end up getting to play, continue to play.  He was very, he was a very fast sprinter, I mean, he was an excellent athlete but his knees took him out before, you know, his time.  My cousin who actually works here, two of my cousins, they played hockey sort of following in my footsteps.  One who works here as our facilities manager, he played hockey until eighth grade, but to play passed the eighth grade you had to go to University School [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and he went to Dominican [Dominican High School, Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin], which is another high school in the area.  Then my other cousin who is one year younger than he is, he also played until eighth grade and then he went to Nicolet [Nicolet High School, Glendale, Wisconsin], another high school that didn't have hockey so they both ended their careers in the eighth grade and I was able to play through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  And that's significant, you're one of the few--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --hockey--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --players that, you know, who lettered in hockey in school.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean, that's, that's interesting.  So you said you were shot put, you did shot put and discus in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did, I, I threw, I threw the discus and the shot--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and in, in track.  I did okay with that.  We, you know, University School was in the private school conference.  I, I, I won most of the meets in the disc and then for some reason when it came to the state tournament I, I guess it was pressure, but I can't think of anything else, I just, I couldn't throw it.  And I, and it still to this day doesn't make any sense but I, I won most of the meets and the, all the people that were there were thinking that I was gonna win it and just, just threw it about ninety feet.  And I had thrown it as far as a 160, you know, 175 feet (laughter) and I threw it ninety feet, was the furthest throw in the state tournament.  And I have no explanation for it other than pressure but I didn't think I felt it, I don't know what happened but anyway.  It wasn't, but that was more, when I was out for track it was more of a social sport.  And it, it was, I, I didn't feel right not being in a sport.  I liked baseball but the way our diamond was setup, and but I liked to, but I, I wasn't really committed to it, obviously I quit.  They, our diamond was setup, I was playing first base, I'm left handed, every day at three o'clock the sun was in my eyes and they were throwing balls at me at a hundred miles an hour (laughter) and I said, "I don't, I don't wanna do this anymore" (laughter).  I don't wanna get hit in the head with a ball 'cause I can't see it.  And I was missing balls and I was like, "No, I'm not, I'm, I'm not gonna do this." So I went out for track and I enjoyed that.  It was fun.
Story_ID: 653103
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors in, in high school [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  One, one was my history, well, he was a history teacher and he was also my soccer coach.  And his name was Steve Bruemmer.  He, he, he, he was a young guy at the time, he's still, he's, as a matter of fact he's still at the school now and I think he's, I believe he's the head of the upper school.  But he, he did history from a different perspective and we talked about things like affirmative action and how that, how that affected things.  We talked about the Bakke case [Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 1978].  You know, so he, he, he kind of put a significant twist in and, you know, I can't be sure, I don't know, I don't, I have no idea, I know that that he taught this as his regular curriculum but I think that he, he made points that had to do with racial issues just to flush them out, you know, just to see where people stood.  And one of the reasons I knew that Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] could be president is because I realize that I'm almost fifty and the people that I went to high school, grade school with and high school with, even if they disagreed with him and didn't vote for him they wouldn't not vote for him because he was black, you know.  And so I, I, I, I, I, I, I got, I, when he, when he became a, a serious candidate I was like people were saying that they didn't think white America could vote for a, a black candidate, I was like, "No, I think, I think we're there."  I, I, I--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --here, here I am almost fifty years old, I'm forty-seven, forty-seven years old, and everybody that came behind me grew up in a, in the environment that I did to, to, you know, to a certain degree.  Race is not, race is not that issue anymore.  And, and the, and it, I don't, I think that, I think that black folks have not recognized, maybe we do now, had not recognized how far white folks had come, okay.  And I think that it's part of the bite me once, you know, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, so we, we, black folks is in the position that I don't wanna get, get burned again by, by believing in something that's, we're not ready for.  Well, I think that they showed us that we're actually a little bit further than we, we were given credit for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it kind of crept up on us?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: But there's a generation that, you know, that, you know, hadn't really been--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --tested, you know.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But again I would say, I, I, there are people that I know did not vote for him that were in my class but they did not, I know they didn't not vote for him because he was black, you know.  I think that if they, I think they would have voted for him if they agreed with him, you know.  But, you know, so I, I, I think that that's, at this point me being forty seven that's the majority of the, the folks that are eligible to vote.  And I, it, it, it happened.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I, I know I'm probably leaving your order, but go ahead (laughter).
Story_ID: 653104
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, so when you were in, a senior high school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did you, what did you wanna do career wise?  What was your goal (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I, I saw myself making movies and, and working in television.  And I, I, you know, and that's what I went to school for.  And I had some significant experiences working in television when I was at Howard.
Speaker 1: Now, now how did you choose Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, are you familiar with Jack and Jill of America [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.]?  Okay.  Now, going to University School [University School fo Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], predominantly white school, I had a class of eighty, and there were only three black people, black kids that graduated, myself, Lynda Jones [Lynda Jones Reyes] and Greg Johnson [ph.].  And I participated in Jack and Jill, we went to conventions and things of that nature.  And I had not really had the, other than Jack and Jill had the experience of being in a large group setting with black folks on a regular, black kids my age on a regular basis.  So I started looking at the historically black schools [HBCUs].  And my other choice outside of that was USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] but my parents was like, "You ain't, you're, you're not going to California," so that was out.  So I basically wanted to go to Howard or Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I was accepted at both.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I chose Howard.
Speaker 1: So when did you graduate from University School?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you started 1980 at, at--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --at Howard--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for the fall?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was it like?  Did you, did it meet your expectations in (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it, it surpassed my expectations.  I mean, I think, one of my, one of my friends who's, who's, who's in the Omega fraternity [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity] and I'm an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], he, he introduced me to some of his frat [fraternity] brothers here, okay.  He went to Howard as well.  We went to, we, we had our first class together and he end up working here [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], he's not from here, but he end up working here and he introduced me to some of his frat brothers here and he told them that Howard was actually stronger than a fraternity. My, he, he said his brotherhood to me, because we went to Howard, is stronger than his brotherhood to the fraternity.  So he said, "This is my brother and he's y'all brother too, but he's not a, he's not an Omega but y'all understand" (laughter).  I, I think Howard supersedes the frat--that's what he said.  So that's the kind of experience I felt like I had as well.
Story_ID: 653105
Speaker 1: We were put in a situation where we would see different political figures on a regular basis.  Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] frequently spoke at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And I think I saw several of, I saw at least four speeches of his during my time at Howard.  He even gave the speech where the controversial dirty religion comment was made. I was, I was in the audience for that speech.  And I know that whether he said dirty or gutter which is what, which is they say he said gutter and dirty whatever the case may be that he, he had referred to every religion in the same way but they chose to use that statement as the significant piece that came out in the press.  And before he talked about the Jewish, Jewish religion, he talked about the Muslims, the Christians, and anybody, and everybody else.  And he referred to all religions in the same way and he said we are all human dung, okay.  'Cause nobody is living up to God's expectations.  And it was significant to the point of how blown out of proportion that report became.  It became his defining moment in public that he was an anti-Semite and a hater, okay.  And I was present for the speech before all of this hoopla came out and I heard it in context and that is not what he said.  And I, I, I, I know that I'm not changing anybody's opinion by saying this in this, in this context, in this interview but I was there.  And he, he did not say that this religion was worse than others.  He referred to all of them so.  But, but my point, my point is, is that I learned a valuable lesson about how people are pigeonholed and treated in the media and can be created to be something that they're not based on statements that you can take out of context.
Speaker 2: Now, now, did he speak, and the, the other speakers speak for like a convocation or something or--
Speaker 1: No, this was--
Speaker 2: --what, what do they call it at Howard, the, the speaker series?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, they had convocation.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: They had convocation.  But no, he would, he came and it was just like speaking engagement, you know.  Just to speak to the students at Howard that wanted to come hear him, and we went.  I mean, I didn't, before I had gone I had no perception of Minister Farrakhan.  And I went to see him and I was thoroughly impressed with his intelligence and his delivery.  And everything that he said seemed coherent and sound and never sounded like he hated anybody to me.  So, you know, I have a different perspective and this is before anybody had publicly made opinions.  And like I said that that statement right there dirty, gutter, whatever, whatever, became a defining moment in, in how he is perceived by the entire world almost.  And it didn't happen like that (laughter).
Story_ID: 653106
Speaker 1: Now who else spoke there [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oh, Kwame Ture who was formerly Stokely Carmichael, he spoke.  Let's see, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], George Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] spoke at a graduation.
Speaker 1: George, the older George Bush?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the older.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And I'll never forget the, my dorm was right across the street from the football field where he was to speak and two days before they started bringing in the [U.S.] Secret Service and they, they were stationed on roofs in their military, the military gear, you know, SWAT [Special Weapons and Tactics] looking, all black, M16s just walking on roofs.  And they were, they were in fact in, in our hallways at the dorm and it's for two days.  And then the day of, the, they towed every car on the block and they moved, they, they, they towed 'em, but they didn't impound 'em.  They towed 'em to another lot and they let, they let the people know where they were but they cleared the entire block of cars so that when the, when the motorcade came down the street there was no cars.  You could not cross after a certain time the day, you couldn't cross the street because, you know, they had, they were, they were on lockdown or whatever.
Speaker 1: So, so he was just vice president at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that, so a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --all that was done to--
Speaker 2: All of that.
Speaker 1: --protect the vice president.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, you could say that there was, there was some, there was, it was warranted in the sense of security that, you know, he, he's going into quote unquote for, for the United States where some of those hostile territories are gonna be in.  This is a black school who, who is very pro-black and considered him to be not that but there was no, no one, no, there was no threat or anything of that.  However, there was a protest where people stood up and turned their backs to him; and that was very visible, although I'm sure it wasn't shown on any media.
Story_ID: 653107
Speaker 1: Yeah, now at the time I mean, well, [HistoryMaker] James Cheek was president, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he's a Republican?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--yeah, and was I, I think a very pragmatic Republican trying to get funds for the schools and--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) through his activities.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Cheek, he did an awesome job of get- garnering funds for the university.  And as many people don't know Howard University [Washington, D.C.] is a line item in the president's budget because it was created by an act of [U.S.] Congress for, for, for, for children of slaves and slave owners.  So this is the, the mixed children's university.  And so as an act of Congress they gave the president a, they issued him a, an edict to, to disseminate funds to the university.  So his number one, probably the, well the best, the best, the best place for the president of Howard University to be is sitting next to the president having a drink (laughter).  And I do know for a fact that he and Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], were, were good buddies.  And that he also knew George Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush] that's why we had him as our speaker.  And during that time Howard University purchased quite a bit of land and quite a bit of new equipment; and opened a new TV station [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.] and--
Story_ID: 653108
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well speaking of the TV station [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.], now--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --now you mentioned [HistoryMaker] Bill Duke earlier.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The, the, he was an actor and then became a director--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and director of movies and documentaries and such.  Well, tell us a little about, well, he was one of your teachers (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, Bill Duke--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) after that?
Speaker 2: --came long after me.  But--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, but when I had mentioned it I said that when I knew that he was there, he, he became chairman of the department that I went to school at and that's radio, TV, film.  And I had thought that with his, with his massive background and, and, you know, being a public figure in, in, in movies and such that his influence could potentially, you know, help one create a movie that was widely seen.  And I think that that was part of their goal, you know.  Spike Lee came out of Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and you still don't have, you still can't name a person that's making movies that came out of Howard.  Although I do know several but, but you couldn't, it's not a, you know, a household name.
Speaker 1: Now, who was in charge of the department when you were there?  Or who was the, the, the significant people in that (simulanteous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, see, see, Haile Gerima--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was one of my significant, one of my significant teachers during that time.  He was not the chairman of the department, however, he, he was at the forefront of trying, being a person that was actually out there making movies, you know.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and he's of Ethiopian descent, I know.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Started in California, he went to film school out at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and he, he taught me, he taught me script writing, he taught me film, one of the basic film classes, film I, film II.  And just was a significant character.  He, he thought I wasn't paying attention in class one time and he took a, he was teaching a format of scripting and a person came in and interrupted the class and asked him a question and then he responded and he left.  And he said, "I want somebody to tell me what just happened and this, this format.  You--." And he pointed to me.  And I repeated it back to him in almost exactly the format, yeah, in exactly the format he asked.  And, and in 100 percent correct format.  And he looked at me, he said, "Oh, I thought you weren't paying attention" (laughter), "but I'm gonna have to watch you 'cause you're good." (Laughter) Because I, I nailed it.  And again, you know, like I told you earlier, sometimes people think I'm, I'm, I'm not, I'm not paying attention or maybe not, maybe have no humor but no, no, that's not the case.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Haile Gerima was there.  And now, now did you study, I know other black filmmakers at, at Howard and, and--
Speaker 2: Well, not, not--
Speaker 1: --and how did they approach the class?
Speaker 2: --not really.  To be honest, I, I, my emphasis was more on television but at the same time I was, I was not propelled to me in the film world the way I would have liked to have been.  The experience of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] was awesome, okay.  And I think that it is one, one of the most significant things that's happened to me, you know, that I've experienced in my life.  However, I, I, I don't have the same gratitude about my experience specifically in that department.  I think I learned the basics, but I didn't, I, I wasn't, I didn't feel propelled to the next level.

Speaker 1: Did you work on a program, 'Evening Exchange' you mentioned that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: That's a, you know, pretty popular news--
Speaker 2: News, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --magazine show out of Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  It comes on public, you know, Howard, Howard's public TV station [WHUT-TV, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I, I, myself and I had a partner, we, we started a video production company and we also worked in a video production club that we, we functioned, we, we ran.  And so we went out and we would do interviews with various celebrities and political figures.  We actually did a interview with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] before he announced he was, he was still in the process of thinking about running for president.  And we, we got an interview with him in the, in a hotel room.  His father, his father, my partner's father worked for an oil company and he had connections and so Jesse consented to do this interview.  We did it, he talked about his potential of running and how excited he was.  And that that was used by the, the, the show 'Evening Exchange' and actually won an award, it was a CEBA award [Communications Excellence to Black Audiences] for being one of the first shows to have his, his announcement so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was, it was a program that's produced on Howard's--
Speaker 2: Howard's campus.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and, you know, a few--the, the comp- the company that I worked with that we started in, the club that we were a part of, we interviewed everyone from Eddie Murphy, Jesse Jackson, Bootsy Collins, Phyllis Hyman, oh, Teena Marie, Rick James, we did a lot of, we interviewed a lot of people that came to, we were at a black music convention and Black Music Association convention and we did some, some interviews.  So we got a chance, James Brown, (laughter) we got a chance to meet and, and, and talk to people who were movers and shakers at the time and it was a excellent experience.  I also got to learn that that, you know, sort of, sort of bust the bubble of, of, of putting celebrities on a pedestal, they're regular people, you know.  And we were able to learn that in this experience, yeah, they are very, very, very popular, very ambitious folks but they're still regular folks.  And I think at a, at a young age being able to, to internalize that it was significant that, you know, you don't, you don't have to walk on egg shells around people who have been on television, you know.  And that, that they're willing to, to be regular folks and talk to you just like anybody else.

Speaker 1: Now you graduated in 1984?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] in '85 [1985] with--
Speaker 1: Eighty-five [1985], okay.
Speaker 2: --with a degree in television production, and with a minor in business administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And from there I did come back to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and we, we began a project called Carter Educational Systems [Carter Educational Systems, Inc.].  We produced a series of videotapes teaching teachers how to teach math to young children.  That series consisted of five tapes and--
Speaker 1: You say we launched it, now was it, was it the, the school or, or, or your--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --your production company or was it a combination (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) it was, it was a production company that V.E. Carter Development Group [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] created.  It was a, a, a V.E. Carter Development Group was the parent company for Carter Educational Systems.  It's basically a brain child of my mother, Mrs. Carter [Lorraine Peters Carter].  She, she, she saw, she saw that using my talent and, and some of the things that we had established here.  We had a program called Family Math [ph.] and we had a professor of math, Dr. Gloria Gilmer working with us and we created a series of tapes that taught teachers how to teach math.  And so they were approximately a half hour each and we had five of those.  Then after that we, we, we produced a tape teaching young children how to speak Swahili.  And we had another tape teaching young children how to speak Yoruba.  And I went on the road to conventions and to various point of sale to sell these tapes.  And our sales were pretty marginal however, we did get quite a few libraries to buy them.  The main thing that I learned during this, this course of trying to sell these tapes was that it really cost too much to make 'em, to, for the amount of numbers that we had to sell, okay.  So here, here I was, I was on the road trying to sell these tapes, unless we were able to sell 'em for a much lower cost, you know, and the numbers that we had to sell were just too high to, to keep this, to keep the business going.  However, we do still have the tapes and we do refer to them.  So that was a, it was a venture that was marginally successful, although--
Speaker 1: How much did they sell for?  I'm just curious.
Speaker 2: Well, we were selling 'em for like seventy-five, eighty bucks [dollars].  And when we were in the special, we were, we were considered special interests to, to sell them to school systems and things of that nature, that would work.  However, it would, it, it, it took my personally being there to sell them.  It was difficult to sell them in, in, in a, in a catalog.  If I actually got to talk to someone I could sell it.  But we couldn't make enough sales, you know, by, through, through personal contact to, to, to, you know, to, to, to make the money back that we had put into it.  We got some good reviews, we got a review from Library, Library Magazine [ph.].  I actually met the editor and she reviewed our tape and then she, she recommended it to the libraries.  And we did get a significant number of library sales from that.  But at the end of the day we probably sold about, I'd say seventy-five series and to have made our money back we would have needed to sell about a hundred, I mean, five hundred.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You see what I'm saying so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it was, it was just, it was difficult.  I mean, you know, we're, we're in, we're in Milwaukee Public Library [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], we're in the Cleveland libraries [Cleveland Public Library, Cleveland, Ohio], we're in the, the New York Libraries [New York Public Library, New York, New York], but each one is only buying one, you know, or two.  Anyway, you see where I'm going.
Story_ID: 653111
Speaker 1: It was difficult; and so it was a good idea that really didn't have the market that we needed to--you know, or we didn't have the money we needed to--
Speaker 2: So on a product like that, only one library per, say New York City [New York, New York] has got--
Speaker 1: Hundreds of libraries (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) hundreds of libraries.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, they bought like--
Speaker 2: But they brought--
Speaker 1: --five tapes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Five series, you know.  Then--
Speaker 2: So you envisioned them buying hundreds of 'em, probably--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --yeah, we [Carter Educational Systems, Inc.] hoped, we had hoped.  I mean, there are individual libraries in California that bought 'em.  I mean, they never bought more than a couple, you know.  They didn't buy one for each library, you know, they bought like two or three, you know.  And I'm, I'm, at that time I was real happy that I had, I'd sold any, you know, what I mean.  And I wasn't talking them into buying more, I was still trying to get the, you know, some other folks to get 'em.  But bottom line, it was, it, it, it, it, it was, it would take, it was taking a lot more money to, to put into it and we weren't really seeing the sales.  And all the sales that I had were almost, almost all of them were personal contacts, we probably sold about maybe fifteen or twenty from the library, from the, from the review but everything else, I actually talked to the people at a convention.  And so I started to realize that if we, to, to, to make the sales, I'd have to be, I'd have to go, I'd have to go to, to the source to sell them.  And we didn't have the money to do that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We really didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, was it, that, were any of the videos broadcast on--
Speaker 1: No, they were never--
Speaker 2: --public television?
Speaker 1: --they were never broadcast.  This was all for, you know, it was all for sale.  And it was, it was made in a, in the, what format was it in?  It was beta [betamax], it was made in beta, so it was, it's, it was, you know, it was, the quality that could have been broadcast.  But it, no, it wasn't made in that format, it was more an, just an instructional, they were instructional tapes.  And, and you, you, you, you had a, you had an instructor, you had review, you know, we even had a workbook that went with it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, like you said the subject matter, like two African languages and--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --math--
Speaker 1: And math.
Speaker 2: --which is always a difficult subject--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --to teach in the, well, it has been like the, a subject that's not taught, taught effectively in the public schools let's put it that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, we, we felt our niche--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and this was, this is where we were going, our niche was that we were teaching teachers of young children, I'm talking preschool, techniques to teach math, okay.  And that our audience, our, our intended market was daycares, you know, (unclear) daycare centers, and, and preschools, you know, so.  And then the intended market for the, the language tapes was the same but we also recognized that libraries and, and, and, and, you know, resource, resource groups may, may want it.  But again, we, we learned our lesson and it was a good exercise and I think that people that that used them benefited but it wasn't, it really wasn't a money maker because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --it was, it was difficult to get to the market.
Story_ID: 653112
Speaker 1: We're talking about other aspects of the Carter Development [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin], that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.  No.
Speaker 1: --that you, that you worked on, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, now--
Speaker 1: So it's about what like 1980?
Speaker 2: It's about '87 [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], okay.
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986], '87 [1987].  But we can rewind to just, just for the significance of me, what I've, what, what, I started working here when we opened, okay.  My father [Veledis Carter] was the type of person who this is what puts food on your table so you gonna do whatever needs to be done.  And so I, I cleaned, I did whatever he told me to do, organize books, you know, whatever task he had me doing, from the day that we opened until I went to college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  Then when I, I left for college in, in '80 [1980], he passed in '84 [1984], so I was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] when he passed and then I graduated like maybe, oh, a year, a year 'cause like I was there for five years, I was at Howard from '80 [1980] to '85 [1985].  And I graduated about a year and a half, maybe, well, a little less than a year after he passed.  Now, yeah, that's right 'cause he passed in October and I graduated the following fall, spring.  So he, he graduated in October of '84 [1984] and then I graduated in the spring of '85 [1985].  So anyway, when I came back then I started, I started working with my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] who had taken over his position.  And so I say, when people ask me how long I've been working here, well, I've been working here since 1972, okay, except for the time that I was at Howard.  And then, then I actually worked during the time we were, we were doing the television, the, the, the, the video series [Carter Educational Systems, Inc.], I worked at the Bradley Center [BMO Harris Bradley Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I worked with a production company that that broadcast the Bucks [Milwaukee Bucks].  So I was a cameraman for the Bucks and for, for, for the, the scoreboard and for television.  And then I moved to Detroit [Michigan] 'cause one of my relatives is on the city council there [Detroit City Council] and--
Speaker 1: Who was that, which one?
Speaker 2: Alberta Tinsley Williams [Alberta Tinsley-Talabi].
Speaker 1: Okay. I've heard of her (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And she doesn't, she's not Williams anymore but that's who she was when I was there, but Alberta Tinsley.  And she, there was a job in the, in the city, the Cable Commission [City of Detroit Cable Commission], the City of Detroit had a cable commission and they, that department produced television for the City of Detroit and I got a job as a producer slash director with the City of Detroit.  And it was during the time that Dennis Archer was the mayor.  And so I, a lot of my job there was to follow the mayor and we broadcast his, his press conferences, significant events, I call it the city's propaganda wing.  And but I got to learn a lot about Detroit.  And I'm, I, I, I spent, I spent a significant time, time, significant amount of time with the mayor and saw what kind of person he was and very genuine, thoughtful person that ran the City of Detroit.  And about my third, my second year, really end of my second year of that job, I got a call from my mother and the chairman of the board, and this is about ninety--this is in the '90s [1990s], now, about '94 [1994] or '95 [1995], they called me to say they needed me to come back here and help my, help my mother run this business.  And they, they decided, they had decided that the job that they wanted me to do I was the only one that could do it.  Now, I know that wasn't true in the sense of what needed to be done but it was true for what my mother, how my mother envisioned this agency.  And knowing that she was in her sixties, that she wasn't, she didn't wanna entrust it to anybody else and so from that point on I was here and I was her executive assistant and worked in the facilities area and I dealt with all contractors and I basically was her assistant so I did whatever she asked me and did a lot of her detail work, you know.  So from that time, from that time until she passed I was her assistant, and did everything that she, you know, that she did or wanted me to do or decided that she wanted me to do.
Story_ID: 653113
Speaker 1: When did your mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] pass?
Speaker 2: She passed in, in '06 [2006].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --so you learned all the various aspects of how to run the place [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and, and what--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and to operate the facility.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  So I, yeah, I worked under, I worked under her for basically ten years in, in the, in, as her executive assistant and facilities manager.  I end up being building manager.  We had another building on 28th [Street] and Wisconsin [Avenue] that's around the corner from here and I managed that building for about five years.  And really did, like I said, whatever she asked me to do, which could be from anything from cleaning the floors to going to meet with representatives of our, that of agencies we contracted with.  And that's basically how my father [Veledis Carter] functioned as well because he and I, there is a room down the hall that that was when, when we brought the building it was missing some tile and he went and bought tile that was similar to it and, you know, you, he moved tile from one spot to another and he took a iron and laid this tile down and it is still there, okay.  And so when I say we, I have touched every, every crevice of this building, every corner--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I've touched it, I've painted every wall, I believe, and so, you know, I, my, my training is from the, I would say from the ground floor in how this building functions from the boilers to the shingles on the roof to dealing with our different, our different agency contacts.
Story_ID: 653114
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] envision this school [V.E. Carter Child Development Center; Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] to be that's different from the Milwaukee Public Schools, or, or the other private schools in the area?
Speaker 2: Well, to, to serve the whole family, okay, starting at the earliest age that we can get children, which is four weeks, to help the parents know how to raise children, to help them with the needs that they have in raising children so that the family structure is more intact based on their contact with us.  Now, obviously the agency [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] is not gonna replace a father but at the same time can we, can we provide things or at least show you how to get to things that, that you need.  Show you how to deal with an infant, teach you what infants' needs are, teach you about how significant you are in the child's life and what you do as a parents is as at least is, is more significant than what the school does.  And if you are the school's partner as a parent then we can help you develop a child that can, can hopefully be successfully and have, you know, good moral, good moral character and, and have a quality life.
Speaker 1: Now, now, that's sounds, it's like similar to the philosophy of James Comer [HistoryMaker Dr. James Comer] and the philosophy of Bob Moses and some--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --some of the other educators, talk about that too.  And you often hear today teachers in the public school system say that they, their major obstacle in teaching the students is that the parents are not involved and there's no discipline when the kid comes in the, and there's no provision for them to reach out to the--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --student.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So your parents envisioned like a, a holistic kind of--
Speaker 2: Like a wraparound concept.  I know that, that, that, that's a catch word now or it, it, it's, it's a word that has a definition outside of what my parents had because they were wraparound before wraparound existed as a, as, as a, as a term.  But, you know, the concept is really just trying to reach out and, and to, to, to keep the parent involved.  We, I don't know, when you walked in, I don't know if you saw we have bags in the hallway and we, we have a food pantry for the parents.  And we know that one way we can have contact is by giving away the food, okay.  And--
Speaker 1: And once again you hear teachers say today I'm not a social worker, I'm--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --a teacher.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I should only be able to just--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --teach and all that sort of thing but--
Speaker 2: --well, see but that's not true because you are, you, you have to talk to the parent, even in just in a parent teacher conference setting but, but you must talk to the parent about the behavior of the child in the classroom, you gotta talk to the parent about the child's attendance, about what, what time the child gets to school.  Social worker is, is really, it's, it's really part of the teacher's job.  Although, of course, you know, it is, it is an awesome job to do it, to teach every day, you know, and to deal with the problems that discipline, children that don't have discipline in their lives bring.  So that is one of the major challenges but, you know, we, we, we try, whatever we can to draw the parent in so we can have contact with them.  And, you know, we do have some good parents that that that come in on a regular basis and talk about their children.  But unfortunately it's the one, the two, the three kids that are in a classroom that disrupt the classroom that, that prevent learning for everybody.  Though we have tried many different things to, to take that influence out but it's, it's, it's always gone be there to a certain degree.  But, you know, we, we're, we're presently trying to, we have a, we have a, a room, a special classroom for our most distinctly problem children.  And they actually get more individual time for the learning situation but they also don't present the problems that they do in the classroom for other folks to learn.  So that's, that's something that we're, we're engaged in right now.  And it seems to be, it seems to be working.  And, and, we've, we've cleared up some of our, our problems that we've been having with, with getting the information, the education to the children.
Story_ID: 653115
Speaker 1: Now when a parent--when, when students enroll here [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], do the parents have to make a special commitment to be available to?
Speaker 2: Well, we have, we do have a agreement that they will participate in certain activities, okay.  And that when we have, when we call on them for parent teacher conference, they're supposed to attend.  When we call on them for various fundraising activities they're supposed to be participating.  But at the same time we, we aren't putting them out if they don't participate, you know.  But we like to have that, have that commitment and, and understanding when we first, when we first start, when they enroll, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you, you just keep trying to get--
Speaker 2: You, keep, keep trying.
Speaker 1: --to get them involved with the--
Speaker 2: Keep trying.
Speaker 1: You never had to put a parent out--
Speaker 2: We, we, no, we, I, I wanna say, we can't put 'em out, okay.  And what I mean by that is, you know, as, as much of a problem as children, we have never, I don't, we've never expelled a child, okay.  Now, there's a couple that we would have liked to have expelled but we never have.  And we still consider them to be in a better place here than if we were to put 'em out, okay.  And now we, we have children that we refer to agencies that can give them more help, but that doesn't take them out of our situation, okay.  We, we try to put them in situations that, that we, that we have determined will aid the child to, in the right direction.  But no, we're, we're, we're not in the, we don't put, we don't put parents out, we don't put children out.
Story_ID: 653116
Speaker 1: What would you say is your philosophy of education here [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I'll go out, I'll go back to what my father's [Veledis Carter], my father's favorite song was, George Benson's the, 'The Greatest Love' ['The Greatest Love of All'], I believe the children are the future, okay.  Well, it comes from that.  And that every child is smart, every child has potential, potential genius.  And here we work on our genius every day.  So the philosophy is that everyone can, everyone can be successful, everyone is smart.  We're all, we are all geniuses.  And it's, it's, it's up to you to discover your genius.
Story_ID: 653117
Speaker 1: What are the future plans, now you've got like how, how many facilities now [at V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Well, right now we just, we have this facility [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we, we, we had another facility, we sold it.  And it was, it was costing too much to keep it, just to keep it in operation and it needed a lot of work and things of that nature.  But this, right now we are, we are here from four weeks to fifth grade.  We would like to in the next three to five years expand to eighth grade.  And then I would say in the long range plan high school, okay.  But I can say before, within the next three years will be, will be the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So the break off point right now is middle school--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --I guess, you, or junior high school?  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're fifth, we go to fifth grade.
Story_ID: 653118
Speaker 1: I noticed today you had a visit from University School [University School of Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, the school that you (unclear).
Speaker 2: That was my alma mater.
Speaker 1: Your alma mater.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  They came and they toured the school [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  They also have participated in some giving to us.  They, they've, they have given Christmas gifts to at least four, we have about, we have five, we have, we go from, to fifth grade so they've given us enough Christmas presents to supply at least 40 percent of our children with a present.  And so we, and we have other partners as well that that donate gifts.  But they've also given us twenty-nine computers, okay.  That were computers they, that they donated to us that their, their university School children had used in the past year, and now we have a full fledged computer lab, thanks, thanks to the University School and their, their giving.  So we are very pleased with the partnership that has been developed.  And they've invited us to come and visit and bring our children to experience University School.  And I think it's significant for our children to see how their school is and how, how the order is.  But it also, it also have to be, I will also have to give them some perspective on the different types of monies that are involved with what they have versus what we have.  I think it's also significant for the University School children to see our school and, and, and how we function with our budgetary restraints versus the amounts of monies that they have.  So I think that the relationship can be very positive for both our children and them.
Story_ID: 653119
Speaker 1: Do you do a full range of activities?  Do, do you do arts and culture here [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] as well as math and science and reading (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we have, we have art, we have art class, we have art class.  We do, we have physical education.  We don't do any intramural sports but we're, we're, we're looking at doing the track, intramural track next year.  We've done intramural basketball.  And but we, we our art, our art class is, is, is significant in the respect that we have a teacher that is a very good artist, he works with the children to create projects that are very creative.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Cory Haywood.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  We give people their props while--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --they're around (laughter).
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So now currently, I mean, the school is a charter school now.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it started off as a, as a preschool--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --tuition, right and became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) well, no, we started off as a early childhood education center.  We went to preschool, just to preschool.  Then we partnered with Milwaukee Public Schools to do K4 [kindergarten to fourth grade] and K5 [kindergarten to fifth grade], okay.  And so at that time we, we started get, we're, we're receiving money, per pupil money for K4 and K5, okay.  So when our students, our students came they would, they would be referred by MPS and, and just, just in a, in a, in a general sense from, from, from word of mouth.  We went to first grade after, a year after having K4, K5, then we went to second grade the next year and then we went to third grade the following year.  Then and that, this is around 2003 where we got the third grade; and the following year we became a charter school, and we went to fifth grade.
Story_ID: 653120
Speaker 1: Okay, sir, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in your life, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: Well, now that I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm a more matured individual and hindsight, if hindsight were 20/20, I probably would have instead of going into television went into, straight into education.  My parents [Lorraine Peters Carter and Veledis Carter] created a significant business agency [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that, that I'm now the leader of.  And I think that if I had been a little more mature in making my decision, I would recognized what, what I was skipping by going into television.  However, I know that I, at the time, that was the only thing I wanted to do.  So and there was no way that I, there was no way that I would have, I could change and, you know, I would change the way my thinking was but, but if, if I had 20/20, if I could just go back and then, I think I would have done that as, as opposed to going into television.  I think that my, if I had been involved earlier that my influence could have been greater and that I don't know, maybe, maybe it would mean, have a more significant, I would have a more significant impact earlier than I, than in the last fifteen years that I've been involved.  So yeah, that, that--now, looking back that's what I'd a done different.

Speaker 1: Now when you look at education in the City of Milwaukee [Wisconsin], what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, my main concern is how do we get out of this, this hole that I think that our youth are in of discipline and just direction, okay.  And, you know, I think, I, I talked about earlier that, you know, we had, we had things that were just part of normal life that that that gave us discipline or at least showed us discipline and, and, and moral value.  When you are a child of a child of a child of a child, it's difficult to get out of that cycle.  And, you know, one of my, my, my thoughts is that, you know, and up until the late, the early '70s [1970s] or the middle '70s [1970s], we had a draft and every young man had a, had some time in the [U.S.] military.  And until recently I always thought negatively of that.  And I, I don't wanna send anybody to war, but at the same time the street life is not much safer than being in Iraq or a war.  And at the very least you get the discipline and the training that gives you discipline.  And I'm thinking that one of the, one of the things that might have to happen is that the, the draft may be the thing that saves, saves our kids, you know, because, and up until now, I don't know that we, I, I, that I would have ever had thought this but the discipline that people that I know that have been in the military and I never was in the military but that they got from that is, is still with them and they could, they could have been in there, you know, twenty years ago.  And so that to me is one of the biggest challenges right now is, is, is how to, I mean, we can here try and, and deal with each child that we have and that's all we can do is one child at a time, okay.  But as a nation how do we address what I see as a spiral, a downward spiral in, in moral value and discipline in, in, in, in the youth and in just in, in, in our society in general.  And I think that might be one of the ways out.  We'll see.

Speaker 1: Tell me this: when you look back on everything you've done to this point again, what today would you consider to be your legacy?  Even though you're, you're a young man still.
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that my, my vision for this agency [V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and this school [Carter School of Excellence, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], if we can, if we can achieve those things, that will be my legacy.  And the impact that I've had on children that have gone through these doors.  I find it amazing, one of my father's [Veledis Carter] students and he was a special education teacher, so this young man is mentally challenged, but he still calls about twice a year and, and asks me about my family and how I'm doing and he tells me that my father has been, how long my father has been gone, and when my mother [Lorraine Peters Carter] passed he called to say, 'Your mother passed and I'm sorry to hear."  So this gentleman was in my father's class, had to be fifty years ago, okay, and he still calls.  And so I say that if I can have any kind of impact similar to what my parents have had on children that that go through these doors that would be my legacy.  And if we can, if we can move forward and become a, go to eighth grade and, and even potentially high school, that we can shape some--we can help shape some children into being more, having moral character and, and, and good values.

Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  You're, you're married now and you--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I have a wife and my wife is Lori--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Lori Carter [ph.].  And I have a son, Courtney [Courtney Carter (ph.)], he's twenty-three years old.  And I have a daughter who is eight years old, Micah [Micah Carter (ph.)].  And Micah's in, Micah's in second grade.  And Courtney works at the Bradley Center [BMO Harris Bradley Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and is currently trying to get back into UWM [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Although I've put, I've put it out there he wants to stay here and go to school, but I've put it out there he can go, he can go to almost any school out of state 'cause I want him to have a different experience but he's been fighting me on that one but so he's, he's, he's, he's educationally mobile at this point but, (laughter) but we're still hoping for more.
Speaker 1: Is there anything I have not asked you that we need to cover before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Hm, hm, hm, I don't know, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: We can come back in forty years I guess and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, just, just tell you a little bit about my wife--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she, she has been working with me now for oh, we've been married for eight years and she's been working with me for about seven years, and right now she is our philanthropic, philanthropic person [at V.E. Carter Development Group, Inc., Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  So she, she helps us, she helps us with special events, helps us find our gifts for our children, she does, helps us with our promotions, our marketing promotions and things of that nature.  And I think that without her help I, I couldn't do this, you know.  So I'd just like, I just wanted to give her those, those, those props because she's significant in, in, in, in, in and, and my motivation and in moving us forward.

Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Hm.  I'd like to remembered as a person that was fair and honest that really, and that that that that would be enough.  Fair and honest because to me honesty is one of the number one goals of values of mine, to, to, to present myself as myself and if you accept me or reject me that's fine but it's, this is me and I think I'm a fair person and I look at both sides of the, both sides of the coin and I make an honest, honest decision.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: All right.  Thank you.
