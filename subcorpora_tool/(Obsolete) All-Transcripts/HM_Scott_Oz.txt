Story_ID: 325238
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight, warm-up questions we always ask and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: When I was a kid it was macaroni and cheese, right now, I don't know.  I love, I love my chicken, I love my salmon, I love, I love my wife's [Lynne Yearwood Scott] cooking, so--.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Don't know, I think either between blue or red.
Speaker 1: Okay, a, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Depends on where I am.  In New York [New York] it's spring and fall; here [California] it's probably summer. It depends, it depends on the season, it depends on the climate.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It's, I don't have a favorite vacation destination 'cause I find that I like to work so much, sometimes I feel my vacations are places I go to work.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I'm going to ask you about your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or I should say, I will take it from my father-in-law; his favorite, his favorite phrase was, go with the flow, so, dedicated to him, I would say that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 325239
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Osborne Scott] side, we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother's full name was Jean, J-E-A-N, Bernice, B-E-R-N-I-C-E, Sampson, S-A-M-P-S-O-N, Scott [Jean Sampson Scott].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth would be January 31st, 1926 and it would be Zanesville, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, it's fascinating.  My mother was a genealogist, quite a renowned genealogist.  She and a group started the African American, African American genealogical society [Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society] that's based, I think, first place was Washington, D.C. and they, they've named the Schomburg--the Harlem [New York, New York] chapter's named after her.  So, we have great stories of, of family history from her side, her and, and--I mean I've got great stories because she, she is, she had traced the--she died in 1992, she traced her family back to the early 1600s.  Some of the highlights she said she found, one of our ancestors was a cabin boy on the Mayflower. So I used to joke, I said, "Oh, you could be, you know, you could be a daughter, you could be a daughter of the Mayflower because he was there." And that same relative, in doing her research, she found that he had sailed with a captain named Jacques Cousteau, and as you know, Jacques Cousteau came from a long line of sea captains.  So, she had found the family name was Boone.  The spelling of it, as she said, was not important because people sounded out the spelling and it was B-O-O-N, B-O-O-N-E, B-O-U-N, and she found that the spellings, especially in African American genealogy and even, you know, wherever, changes to whoever is there at the time.  So, are we related to Daniel Boone?  There's probably an outside chance.  On my mother's side, her grandfather--she was from, there was a combination of Cherokee, Indian [Native American], Blackfoot and he's--they're both, both of my grandparents were African American, but with a lot of other things involved.
Story_ID: 325240
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother [Alyce Sampson], her--my great-grandmother was white and her father was black, though one of the great stories I have was, I got a phone call a couple of years after my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] died, from a guy in Las Vegas [Nevada] and, Dennis [ph.], and I, we were talking for a while and he said that he, when his father passed, he was looking for his genealogy and he had said that my aunt had directed me towards, directed him towards me because I had all my mother's work and my mother was constantly working with other people and helping them find their genealogy.  I mean, she was out in Salt Lake City [Utah] once a year at their library, their genealogical library.  So, and, she'd walk into white families in Iowa and say, "I'm your cousin," and she'd show them the proof and they'd say, "Come on in, let's talk."  So when this guy called, I was not surprised.  So we talked for a while and, and, it was the great, great, great moment when he said--I said, "How'd you find, did you come to me?"  He said, "Well, I was looking for my family, I found the picture in my father's possession with three gravestones and I found the church where these three gravestones were in Ohio and I called them up and they asked, they told me I should call a woman named Shirley." And he said it almost, he said, "Now, I could tell by the way she was talking that she was a colored lady and I could not figure out what I was saying to her to make her want to cry, but she was crying on the phone until she said she was my sister."  It turns out that he--his father was my grandmother's brother and that the family after my great-grandmother had passed had, and she had held them together as a unit, they had all decided to pass and that my grandmother had married my [maternal] grandfather [Theodore Sampson] who had that red Indian [Native American], like American Indian complexion, very light, but they felt that she had married too dark and there was a split in the family.  My cousin actually was finding all this information out himself, too.  There was a split in family and everybody went off except for my grandmother who was extremely light, very, very, very light but my grandmother said, "I'm black," and you know, doesn't care what color I am, I'm still black, and so they stopped talking for all those years.  So, I said to him, after the conversation I said, "So, how does it feel to finally, to know that your--what does your wife think about you being colored?"  That's, and he kind of said, "Well, she always said I tan pretty quickly," (laughter).  So, that was--. So my mother's side was very complex, very interesting.  She goes way back.  There was Adams, the families Adams and Male.  There's questions whether there were Prussian influences from the, from the Revolutionary War that came and settled with the Indians.  There was a strong Adams family in the Indians and strong Male family.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How do you spell Male?
Speaker 1: Male, M-A-L-E.
Speaker 2: M-A-L-E, okay.
Speaker 1: So, so that's where--that's my mother's side.  My father's [Osborne Scott] side, from Virginia--.
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, let's dwell on this for a second.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'll stay on my mother's side.
Speaker 2: I had a couple of questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, Boone, the name Boone, we've interviewed some Boones from Virgin- Dr. Rachel Boone [HistoryMaker Dr. Rachel Keith] in Detroit [Michigan] is related to a missionary named Boone [Clinton Boone], who went to Liberia and, you know, who came from Virginia--he sailed out of, I mean, Virginia as a missionary in 1890s, I think, you know, and then there's a Sylvia Ardyn Boone who I think is related to her, who wrote 'Travels in West'--'West African Travel Guide' ['West African Travels: A Guide to People and Places,' Sylvia Ardyn Boone], you know.  She's a black woman.  Are you related to those Boones?
Speaker 1: I, you know--if my mother was here she'd probably, she, she always, when she talks to people, is like, where's your, give me your family names, what--and could be.  My mother, so the Boones were probably--my mother's from, she was raised in Richmond, Indiana, Paducah, Kentucky, Zanesville [Ohio] and Xenia, Ohio.  So, that's--so it's that whole region.  When we--when I used to hang out with her sometimes, we'd drive up to Windsor, Ontario where there's a black, there was a black settlement there of, you know, where the Underground Railroad--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and, and she had relation, there was some relationships there too.  So that whole area, Detroit, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia, is very much tied in and my mother did have some connections to Virginia, too, so, she always said, you follow the train lines, you'll find out where you come from.
Story_ID: 325241
Speaker 1: Were any of your relatives part of Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My [maternal] grandfather taught at Wilberforce and Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], so once they split--.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Theodore [Theodore Sampson], Ted Sampson.  He taught auto mechanics.  He--I know he was a race car driver and a basketball player back in the, back in the '20s [1920s].  We're not sure he drove in Indianapolis 500 but we do know that he did work on some crews at the Indianapolis 500.  So, and he did drive, so he was a--and people from Central State know him and know my, my family.  He--they lived in the basement of the president's house, right there in the middle of campus for years.  So, when I used to go visit them, I would, in the basement apartment, it would be where my grandparents and my aunt, they lived.  My mother [Jean Sampson Scott] was supposed to go to Central State.  My grandfather said if you don't go to Central State, I won't pay and my mother said, fine.  She went to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] and that was it.  So my grandfather used to joke that, he used to tell me that he knew that my mother was stubborn so that he wouldn't have to pay anything so he used to put out barriers and knows that she would just hurdle them.  They had a wonderful relationship.  When, my father [Osborne Scott], I was told later that they eloped because of my grandfather said, "Ehhhh" and he told me that my grandmother, Alyce [Alyce Sampson], started to cry, "Why didn't you tell us, why didn't tell us?"  He said, I started kicking her under the table, saying, "Shut up.  We saved some money (laughter)."  So, but they, my grandfather and grandmother were great people.  They were a lot of fun, so--.
Speaker 1: So, was your mother raised in--so I take it she wasn't raised in Zanesville [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: She was raised in Richmond [Indiana].  She was actually, as a child raised in Paducah, Kentucky, and then I know high school, she ended up in Richmond, Indiana and I think one of the nicest stories that told was that my grandfather moved to Wilberforce when she was in her junior year of high school and my mother stayed behind to take care of her grandmother and so she spent her entire senior year by herself with her grandmother in Richmond, Indiana raising, you know, helping to take care of her.  My grandfather, or my grandfather, my great-grandfather was a big minister back in, I guess in Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, is that why the family traveled so much?  Were they, was he an--.
Speaker 2: I don't, my grand--I think it was just, my grandfather was, I think, it was because he was, you know, a mechanic and a, a racecar driver and a, you know, he did some, some barnstorming basketball playing.  So, and he stayed, he was going around teaching but his, his father was a minister and so--.
Speaker 1: What denomination was he?
Speaker 2: I want to say Baptist but, that I'm not sure.  I do have the picture of my great-grandfather, very dignified.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother went to Hampton?
Speaker 2: She went to Hampton (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--okay.
Story_ID: 325242
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Father's name, Osborne--Osborne, O-S-B-O-R-N-E, Ernest Scott.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind the name Osborne?  There's a--
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I'm not sure what that story is for them.
Speaker 1: I know there's a famous survivor, the only survivor in the John Brown raid was Osborne Perry Anderson who lived the balance of his life up in Canada, you know and came down Detroit [Michigan] and Canada, in the Windsor area, I mean, Chatham [Chatham-Kent, Canada], I guess, rather.
Speaker 2: Some people are always--constantly say, you have two first, two, two first names and they're always trying to call me Scott Osborne, you know what I'm saying.  Hey, it's on my driver's license, Osborne Scott.  It's Osborne Scott, but no, he--my father's family is interesting.  I guess, I never knew my grandmother because she passed away around 1948, right before I was born.  Her name was Elizabeth Evans [Elizabeth Evans Scott], she was an Evans, and my grandfather's name was Ernest Scott.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us this before we go further, what's your father's, your father's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Father's date of birth will probably be, I want to say it's--it'd be Hampton, Virginia, February 5th, 1917.  I think that's his date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he grow up in Hampton?
Speaker 2: Yes, he grew up in Hampton.  He has a very interesting story.  From the second grade on, there was a school, I think it was called Phenix [George P. Phenix Training School, Hampton, Virginia].  Phenix was a teaching school for Hampton Institute [Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  So, from the second grade through graduating college, my father went to Hampton, so, that was, he went to Hampton basically all his, all his school, school years.  At the age of fifteen, there's a church right there--right now, I was told it's across the highway at the national cemetery--that there was a very poor church, he was the student, he was the youth pastor at the age of fifteen.  The minister died, they could not afford a new minister, so while he was at Hampton, he was the minister for the church.  So, when he went into the [U.S.] military, it was the church that sort of sponsored him and so, so we always say that from fifteen years old, he was preaching.  He was, he was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] at Hampton.  He was the president's assistant, the president's aide at Hampton.
Speaker 1: Like a aide-de-camp, or something for the--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the president of the college, of Hampton Institute, where he would travel with the president and he met Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], and Eleanor Roosevelt and so, in which he stayed actually close to the Roosevelt family for years.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the president of Hampton in those days?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't, no I don't.
Speaker 1: That would have been in the--
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty [1930].
Speaker 1: --forties [1940s], early--
Speaker 2: No, '30 [1930], '35 [1935].
Speaker 1: Thirty-five [1935], okay.
Speaker 2: Thirty-five [1935], '36 [1936].  He graduated, I think, '38 [1938], then he went to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  He went to Oberlin and, there was a, he had a very illustrious group of ministers that came out with him.  He's--Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] was one of his, you know, that's one of the people he came up with.
Speaker 1: Right, that's the first person I ever interviewed is Gardner Taylor.
Speaker 2: Oh, Gardner Taylor's phenomenal.  Boy I wish, I mean, there was a poet, there's a poet.  Gardner Taylor gave his eulogy at the funeral and he said that, you know, my father and him were very close so he said I really can't speak long because it's just too hard, but I will say for the short amount of time he spoke, it was probably one of the most powerful, you know, speeches that I had ever heard.  It was just wonderful.  There was a Reverend William Hamilton, there was a number of those ministers.  My father--.
Speaker 1: Howard Thurman was there before them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --just as before that group.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 325243
Speaker 1: My father [Osborne Scott] was interesting because his job--not many--if you know the [U.S.] military, you usually cannot call your assignment, but every time we'd go to Japan and come back, my father was a teacher.  He taught most of the ministers through the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: So he was a chaplain in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 1: Chaplain, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he was able to call his assignments.  He said, I want to go back to Fort Slocum, New Rochelle [New York], which was the chaplain school at the time.  It moved to Fort Hamilton down in Brooklyn [New York] later but through the '50s [1950s] he would call and say I'm coming, I want to come back and they would send us back.  So, then when I say I was raised in Mount Vernon [New York], I can easily say that because we were there when I was a baby and then we were there when I was seven, eight and nine and we came back after that too, but he was rising, very, very well.  He retired as a lieutenant colonel.  The problem, you know, the problem with the black minister back then, the highest rank you can go is major general, which was chief of chaplains and the assistant chief of chaplains would be a brigadier general and they only had one major general, one brigadier general and he hit that ceiling which I always thought that really frustrated him. And when he died ninety--when he died in '97 [1997], they had just recently, earlier in the '90s [1990s] had their first African American chief of chaplains and you could see, you could see the pain, the hurt that he knew, he knew he was in line.  He knew he was, that was where he was supposed to be and to know that you could not get it back then but you have to give those guys a lot because they, they endured a lot.
Speaker 2: So he was a chaplain.  Did he, you say he went to Japan and--.
Speaker 1: He actually went to, he actually was stationed in Korea.  We went to Japan and so he traveled.  He traveled back and forth to Korea and his job for three years, right after the Korean, the Korean conflict [Korean War], was to set churches up.  So he set up all the, all these Christian churches in, in Korea.  So, of course, he, he knew Sun Myung Moon, he knew, you know, Billy Graham, he knew, he knew all those, those people.  So it was actually quite interesting that--and stayed in contact, stayed in contact with a lot of people but his job was, for three years, '54 [1954], '55 [1955], '56 [1956], somewhere in there, '57 [1957], was just to set up churches in Korea.
Story_ID: 325244
Speaker 1: Korea was like a, was like a real turning point in race relations in the [U.S.] Army, you know, Korean War--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --after the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the mess of World War II [WWII] as soldiers, just a lot of them just weren't going to take it anymore.  And so did he have stories about being a chaplain in that setting, with black soldiers and white soldiers?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  He [Scott's father, Osborne Scott] told me this before the movie 'Soldier Story' ['A Soldier's Story'] came out.  Well actually, he didn't tell me, my uncle told me.  It was a very interesting story.  Back--my father went into, he went into the [U.S.] military, he got his commission I think in '41 [1941] but he was in in '38 [1938] 'cause that's when he went to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and my grand--my uncle--my grand--my father-in-law said, oh, no, no black man would go into the military before the war started because there was no chance of promotion.  If you went in as a lieutenant in 1935, you were expecting to be a lieutenant in 1945, you know, it was just the war that got the promotions going.  And so my father was, was very, was one of the early ones to go in, and I even think my father looks back at it sometimes and says he wouldn't have been a chaplain if the war had started just because he knew as a chaplain he had chances of promotion.  As an infantryman, he knew he didn't have a chance.  And so he told me that story which I found interesting but I guess the story was in Louisiana--my father was stationed in Louisiana and he saw the racist, racism and the racial strife that was going on down there and because he had met Eleanor Roosevelt and President Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt], he wrote a letter to Eleanor Roosevelt telling her about, about the racial problems.  Now, this is my uncle telling me.  My father actually filled in some stuff later when I, when I finally confronted him but my uncle had been an enlisted man and an enlisted man that, it was interesting 'cause he looked up to his brother who was an officer but he sat there with tears in his eyes as he told me the story that General Davis, Benjamin Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.] was sent down by Eleanor Roosevelt to, in response to my father's letter and there was a whole, he got all of the black officers together in, in the room and he said, I'm here to investigate this but I want you to know that first I am an officer and then I'm colored and my uncle, I mean this is really interesting, with tears in his eyes, said your father raised his hand and said, "I beg to differ with you, first you're a negro and then you're an officer."  My uncle said after that meeting, all of the officers came right out and shook his hand and said it was nice knowing you 'cause they knew he was going to be--
Speaker 1: Said, nice knowing you.
Speaker 2: --being kicked out. And my uncle said, and he's sitting on the stoop in front of his house and he said, "Nothing happened to him."  He never could figure out how a black man could stand up and nothing happened--you know, and didn't get shot at or booted out and my father, you know, so, so that was an interesting story.  So my father was, was very much aware; very much, you know, part of the movement.
Story_ID: 325245
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Jean Sampson Scott and Osborne Scott] met?
Speaker 2: Oh, my, actually, my father had graduated Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], as I said, in probably '38 [1938], '39 [1939], somewhere in there and my mother was at Hampton--and this is a good story.  I got a great story.  I got a lot of stories.  My--there was a Reverend Boller [ph.] here in Los Angeles [California], Episcopalian minister and one day my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] and I--she's Episcopalian so we're always looking for churches and we--he has this small little brown church on Adams [Adams Boulevard] and we went to the church one day and we, it was very nice.  It was, it was a nice sermon, service, and as we're going, leaving, I introduce myself as [HistoryMaker] Oz Scott and he stopped me.  He says, "Is your father Reverend Osborne Scott?"  And I said, "Yes he is."  He said, "I want you to know that your father saved a whole group of students, theology students at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  He'd come back to speak and we were being, there was all this fire and brimstone in our training and a lot of us were becoming more soft-spoken.  We weren't into yelling and screaming right from the beginning and your father came in and gave a sermon that was in the style that we've, we were comfortable with that--." 'Cause my father had a way of starting way down here and then just, and it would grow and it would be very powerful and very, and very thoughtful.  You know, Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] and, and all those guys, those were students.  They weren't just into preaching, they were, they were theo- theology students.  They were really studying and he said, "Your father made us all stay after, after he left."  And so, and then, you know, and he said, I said, "Where'd you go to school?" He said he'd gone to Hampton.  I said, oh, you know my mother, I mentioned my mother's name.  It turns out, he did not know, but he knew them separately that my mother and him had washed dishes at Hampton.  So, that was, so that's, that's kind of, I guess they were in that circle.  My father had come back to Hampton.  As I said, my father's family is from Hampton [Virginia] and he'd come back and he met my mother and I don't know if he was stationed at Fort Monroe [Virginia] or if he was there, but he married my mother in Hampton and I was born at the base at Fort Monroe right there, Phoebus, Virginia, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, tell us, do you have a, so did you pick one, did your parents ever talk about how they met at Hampton or are there any stories associated?
Speaker 2: I mean, the only story I know is my mother said he took her roommate out on a date and when he came back, she came back, the girl's very upset, said 'cause all, all that man talked about was, "Tell me about your roommate.  Tell me about your roommate.  Tell me about your roommate."  So, my mother, my mother, that's about as much as I know about the meeting.
Story_ID: 325246
Speaker 1: My mother's [Jean Sampson Scott] very much in love with my father [Osborne Scott], so, it was, you know, through the ups and downs.  I was just telling this story.  My father was--the first five years of his life, and it was just five years, he was raised by his grandparents and his grandfather was an oyster man and as an oyster man he used to get up at two o'clock every morning, every single morning and my parents, for the rest of my father's life, he would get up at two o'clock in the morning and they would, they could, they could have bitter fights and battles through the day.  They could, bitter fights and battles when they went to bed at ten o'clock but at two o'clock every morning, I would hear my parents in their room calmly talking about the events of the day.  So, I, as I said, that was, that was for me intimacy.  That was their intimacy.  My parents were different in that when we didn't sit down at the dinner table and talk about what was going on in, in the individual's life, we talked about current events, we talked of philosophy.  I, I always said that--I remember one time I snuck in late 'cause I had my midnight curfew.  You have to be in by midnight.  My father-- it must have been 1:30 in the morning and my father was up, waiting for me, and, you know, this is a minister, you know, and I'm like coming in and I'm sneaking, sneaking in and he was actually half asleep so I was able to get by but I felt bad and when I came--so I got in my pajamas, came back down and I said, okay, I said, "Dad, what are you doing up?"  "What are you doing?"  "Oh, I was waiting for you."  So to throw him off, you know, I said, "You know, dad, I was talking to a friend tonight--." And I, and I told him that I realized that I was God and he said, and I said, no let me explain it to you, you know, and I went to this, "God knows all, right, and I know all that I know and the universe is ever expanding and God's knowledge is ever expanding and so therefore," you know, and, we got into this and he was like, that just took him.  He just said, oh, well there are, there are theories and there are philosophies that, that go along with that, the oneness and then that and, and the understanding and I mean, we started talking.  I mean, we'd get into it for about an hour at which point, you know, here I am like fifteen, sixteen years old saying, "I just want to go to bed, dad," (laughter) but it was a, but that's who my father was.  I mean, he was as, as strong a religious man as he was, he was also a thinker.  He was a, he just felt that let's look at religions, let's not just, it's not just this religion or that religion, you know, well what does God mean.  What is, what is love?  What is God?  What's in a name?  What's in an edifice?  You know, as far as he was concerned, churches, you know, the buildings did not need to exist.  People should be able to just go into their living room, the neighbors should just come by and that should be the worship service but as he said, if people need the edifice, then I am there.  So, we, those, that's what my parents, we talked.  That's how we talk.  It wouldn't be, so what'd you do today?  My parents didn't care about my grades.  They didn't care about, you know, I mean they cared, but that was, that was, that was my problem.  I remember I was, I was held back in the second grade and my father walked into the school and said, "If my son's not learning, you're not teaching him.  I want him to be moved onto the third grade." And they said, "Well, we'll give him, we'll give him a quarter and if he can't do it, we're putting him back." And he said, "Okay."  And that third grade, that first quarter, I worked my ass off and got my great grades and so I was set and then I let it go again but, you know, but again, he did not, it was, his concern was, I would say, more my spiritual growth, my, my thought process.  I, you know, some people, you know, I, I'd work with my kids and sometimes I try to leave my kids alone and let them work their school work out, but that's the way they were both, and both my father, now remember, my father was a professor.

Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968], my father [Osborne Scott], after the riots at City Coll--the demonstrations at City College [City College of New York (CCNY), New York, New York], he was brought in to start the urban and ethnic studies department at City College, at CCNY.  Dr. Copeland [Dr. Joseph J. Copeland], who was the president at that time, actually was a neighbor of ours in Mount Vernon [New York] and he brought my father in and I looked at my father and I said, dad, you haven't even, you know, I, I had done my first year of college [at Friends World Institute; Global College, Long Island University, Brookville, New York] and I had read more black, black history books than I think my father had read and, you know, I said, have you read, the only thing he had read, I think, was Booker T. Washington and I said, have you read Frederick Douglass?  Have you read this, have you done this?  And I said, you're supposed to come up with the curriculum?  This is like July.  I have to hand it to my father.  By the time September came around, he was as well-read as anybody and he went on to start the urban and ethnic studies.  It, he, it fell apart because everybody wanted their separate departments.  Jewish studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, Asian studies, they were all under urban and ethnic and then everybody wanted their, to go separately and then, was it Hamilton [Charles V. Hamilton] who came in and took over--.
Speaker 2: Was that Charles Hamilton?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Charles Hamilton came in at first and he--.
Speaker 2: About what year, what year was this?
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969], seventy-something, like that and then Charles went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and then Leonard Jeffries came in--.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And so my father worked with Leonard Jeffries for many years--
Story_ID: 325248
Speaker 1: I always say my father [Osborne Scott] was--it was actually my, it was most likely my mother [Jean Sampson Scott], sort of, kept Leonard [Leonard Jeffries] (laughter), sort of, kept him grounded 'cause Leonard came, and he actually, he spoke at my mother's funeral and here's my father sitting there, no, he actually spoke at my father's funeral, excuse me.  He spoke and my mother died in '92 [1992], my father died in '97 [1997].  Leonard Jeffries came to my father's funeral to speak and he must have spent more time talking about my mother.
Speaker 2: That sounds like Dr. Jeffries.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and it was just, you know, and I know that when Leonard Jeffries got into that big tiff over, when he--.
Speaker 2: What they thought was an anti-Semitic remark--
Speaker 1: Anti-Semitic, yeah.
Speaker 2: --about Hollywood or something, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, where he said, which, it was, it was, I looked at that moment and I said, "Oh, my God."  My father retired the year before so I said, there was my father, was always that person that said, was, you know, was grounding.  I always felt grounded Dr. Jeffries and all that.  Now, it was Dr. Jeffries and my mother and it was Dr. Jeffries, my mother and Jeffries tells a great story about my mother that it was, there's four of them, four or five of them who had sat down to start that Africa--and Alex Haley and--.
Speaker 2: Was his wife, Rosalind Jeffries, involved in that at all?
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: Was Rosalind Jeffries involved at all?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't--.
Speaker 2: I know John Henrik Clarke was in the department [urban and ethnic studies department, City College of New York, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Right, yes, so they, they, you know, but they all talked about that group.  There was this group that just sat down one day and, on this lake, you know, this, and just sort of talked the whole genealogy out 'cause it was--.
Speaker 2: Did you know Dr. Scobie [Edward Scobie] and, over there?
Speaker 1: I don't know, my fair--you know, I kind of started moving away from, you know, 'cause I was on my own at that point but, so that's, I mean, no, so, there's a great history there.  So, so my mother was, my mother was a school teacher in Larchmont, New York.  So, and she taught, she actually, they, she was really, you know, a real team teacher, second and third grades.  She loved that, that group of kids.  So she taught in Larchmont.  My father taught at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].  My father, when he left the [U.S.] military, he went into the, he went to the American Leprosy Mission, he was vice president there and he was on the council, the church, Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York] up there, the, Council of Churches.  He was on that board for a while.
Speaker 2: The National Council of Churches.
Speaker 1: The National Council of Churches, so, that's, they both actually went to Columbia Teachers College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York] where they both got their master's [degree] from.
Speaker 2: That's quite a history, I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 325249
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters or--?
Speaker 2: I've got one brother, Michael, Michael, M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Michael Scott.  He's teaching up at the University of Maine in Orono [Maine].  He does a lot of their desktop publishing.  He does a lot of the computer--he's got a master's [degree] in Internet engineering which is a fascinating master's.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, is he younger?
Speaker 2: Yes, baby brother.  He's two years younger.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 325250
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: You know it's hard to separate what you see in pictures from what you remember.  Part of me remembers being on a tricycle in Shanks Village [New York] up, I guess that was in just Pennsylvania, Upstate New York, Pennsylvania which was a military--where my father [Osborne Scott] was based but I, you know, I think that, I said, well are those the pictures of me riding that tricycle or was that my memory?  I think the real memory for me was, I swear that I remember, I mean, Mount Vernon [New York], when we first moved to Mount Vernon, I remember going upstairs onto the third floor where we had a third floor apartment, that turned into a third floor apartment, it's just Mount Vernon.  I think Mount Vernon was really the strongest memory as a child.  I was three, four years old.  Japan, it was strong memories in Japan.  I was raised, I was in Japan when I was five and six.  So I think it would probably be kindergarten and first grade were in Japan.  I remember gusts, I remember the red clay where my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] said where the, when Tokyo [Japan] had the Olympic village in the Olympic stadium, they built it right where we had been stationed.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, it was in 1960 when they--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or, no, I'm sorry in '64 [1964], I guess in Tokyo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I remember it as a huge sort of valley with sewage running through it and, you know, as kids, we'd play and we'd, you'd have to jump over, you know, and if you fell back, you'd fall right into the sewage and then you had to go home but, I remember it being, playing baseball and you'd just come in covered in that red clay that Japan has and my mother just, you know, we would just come in, baseball bats, you know, gloves and you'd play all day long.  I remember that very, very, very much so.  Mount Vernon, I remember seven, eight, nine year old, starting second, third, fourth grade, I had a third grade teacher, Ms. Armet [ph.] who was just, probably was the one teacher.  You know, you have your teacher just sort of says, the boy can't spell, I'm going to teach him how to spell and she sat me down and she taught me how to spell.  I think, think what, I think what got me was, I will say, I, there was one time I cheated in the third grade on my spelling test and I had written my, some of that down on my hand and I got like ninety on that test and it was actually quite, it was actually interesting.  She called my parents up and said, "See, he can spell and I'm like going, oh, I just cheated in spelling."  She said, "He can spell so I want to sit down and really work with him." And she sat there and took me through phonetics and I will say from that moment in third grade until now, I can sound out words, I can, you know, if I can't spell, it's going, I'll be pretty damn close.  So, it was just, she was very important to my, you know, childhood.  Ms. Scribner [ph.] in the fourth grade.  Went to Germany, fifth, sixth and seventh grade in Germany.  We, we were stationed in Baumholder [Germany] and Bad Kreuznach [Germany].
Story_ID: 325251
Speaker 1: Richard Pryor tells me the story that--we must, we actually may have been in Baumholder [Germany] at the same time.  Richard was stationed in Baumholder.  Baumholder, I guess, was, was Hitler's [Adolf Hitler], one of his bunker, bunker places where he would go and Richard tells the story about, Richard Pryor tells the story about, how he said that's where I, I went up to my CO [commanding officer] and said, "Okay, it's time for me to quit, I'm ready to leave the [U.S.] Army."  And they said, "But you can't leave the Army, you just can't leave." And he said, "Well, if I told you I'd kill you if I didn't, would that help?" And so the CO said, "Yeah, yeah, that'll help." And he said, he said, I said, "Did you get a dishonorable?"  And he said, "No, no, they let me go." But so, that was in '62 [1962], '61 [1961], '62 [1962], so I was in elementary school--.
Speaker 2: So you're about twelve or so?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was 12, 11, 12 and Richard, I guess he was, you know, twenty at the time, probably younger, 18, 19.  So then we moved to Bad Kreuznach [Germany].  We were there for two years and then we moved back to Mount Vernon [New York] in, actually Fort Dix [New Jersey].  We moved to Fort Dix 'cause my father [Osborne Scott] couldn't call his assignment date, he, he had to get a promotion so he, he became chief of chaplains for the 8th Division and so that was in Fort Dix.
Speaker 2: Fort Dix is in--?
Speaker 1: New Jersey.
Speaker 2: New Jersey, okay.
Speaker 1: So we kind of, we commuted to Mount Vernon.  I went to the seventh grade, eighth grade in, in Fort Dix and then I went, then--when we went back to Mount Vernon, and I did ninth and did high school in the brand new high school, Mount Vernon High School [Mount Vernon, New York].  I think it opened the year I went there.

Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  I know you went through some of them but--
Speaker 2: Well, sights and--
Speaker 1: --it might elicit, you know--
Speaker 2: --I mean for me, the sights and smells and tastes would be in Japan, rock candy.  I remember them selling rock candy on the streets in Japan, in Tokyo [Japan], when, you know, and very distinctive smells then.  The bakery in Germany.  Right by our baseball field was a bakery.  I mean, I mean a manufacturing plant of bread.  Not just a bakery but--and so that was the smells of, of that bakery when we were playing baseball and sometimes getting down to our apartment.  It was very distinctive.  I remember that very much.  You know, Japan has distinctive smells.  Germany has distinctive smells, you know, the German food was very distinctive.  I, you know, I remember the brat [bratwurst] and the sauerkraut and, and France, and the bread and I still remember the bread.  I, you know, every time I go there, it's a problem, walking down the street, they talk about low carbs and I don't know how the French people do low carbs 'cause the bread is just phenomenal.   Mustard, the mustard in--. We drove a lot.  We would do car trips a lot and my parents [Jean Sampson Scott and Osborne Scott], we'd sing, so there's sounds of, of 'We Are Climbing Jacob's Ladder' of, of many spirituals that we would sing in the cars.  We traveled around Europe.  We'd stop in a roadside store and get, I remember in France getting tubes, getting a tube of, of spicy Dijon mustard and cheese and bread and we'd just sit alongside the road and, and salami or some sort of meat and just sit there and eat.  I remember that.  I remember driving down to Virginia before that, the bridge tunnel that took you over and how you'd have to sit there and take that ferry.  I think that ferry must have been a four, five hour ferry, I don't know, that was a long ferry ride, going from Delaware, you know, from, going through Delaware into Virginia.  So, those are, those are the sights and sounds.
Story_ID: 325253
Speaker 1: I think I have to say that 'I Spy' not only because of Bill Cosby, but because of the sight, because of where 'I Spy' went, the locations.  I knew all the locations that 'I Spy' was shooting at.  As a child, I was in Egypt, I was in Rome [Italy], I was in, we traveled.  I mean I have to say, at 12, 11, 12 years old, it had to be very strong memories for me.  We did a trip that we flew to Egypt, we flew to Jordan, we walked across the border in '62 [1962], walked across the border into Israel and from, you know, when Jerusalem [Israel] was divided and we were told, don't tell anybody you're going to do this.  We can do it, don't tell them or else we won't be able to do it and we walked into Israel, we flew to Turkey, we, Greece, Rome, it was just a wonderful two, three week trip that we took.  I just, those are the things that I remember as a child.  You know, the great memories on the camels, you know, climbing the pyramids, that's--
Speaker 2: Now that's such a rich kind of--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Did you, did you realize it at the time that you were doing something that most people wouldn't, especially little black kids wouldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black kids--
Speaker 2: --have a chance to do?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.  It just seemed second nature.
Story_ID: 325254
Speaker 1: My grandfather, my father's father, I always tell the story, he came over on the S.S. America with, no, we flew over.  We flew to Germany, he flew in with us, we came back on, oh, that was an interesting, we flew over to Germany, my grandfather who had retired from the post office, came with us.  He must have been with us for one month.  We were there for three years and I think I saw my grandfather four times in three years.  He'd come around Christmas talking about he'd bring me, bring me my present the next time he saw us.  I don't think I ever saw a present, it didn't matter, he was my grandfather.  I was, and he, he moved, he just went out into Germany.  He ended up living in Germany and we came back on the S.S. America which is also an interesting period because I know exactly when we came back on the S.S. America, the ocean liner, because we were in Bremerhaven [Germany] getting ready to take off when, October 19--when was the Cuban Missile Crisis?
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: We were about to get on the ship when the Cuban missile, when the Atlantic Ocean was declared off limits.  So, we sat in Bremerhaven for a couple of days during the Cuban Missile Crisis and we were on the boat immediately after that crisis was alleviated.  So, my grandfather came back, he stayed for two months back in the United States, got on a plane, went back to Germany and died about three, four years later.  He must have had the time of his life.
Speaker 2: This is your father's father or--
Speaker 1: My father's father, yeah, and when my father [Osborne Scott] went to claim his body and to bring him back, he then, the minister called him up from Wiesbaden [Germany] and said, there's a, there's a woman here claiming to be your father's wife and wants his military benefits and my father said, well, first of all, he was married and he never got divorced in Virginia so, she can't be his wife and second of all, he was never in the military (laughter).  So--.
Speaker 2: I was going to ask if he was a World War I [WWI] vet or something--
Speaker 1: No, no, he wasn't.
Speaker 2: --but he was not.
Speaker 1: He kind of, I think sort of fell in between the Spanish American [Spanish American War], World War I.  He was a teacher.  He was a civil rights activist back in the day but then he had to figure out how to take care of his family, my father and his brother [Kenneth Scott], and back then, the best way to do it was the [U.S.] Postal Service.  And so, he was a letter carrier for, about forty years.
Speaker 2: Now what, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 1: Ernest.
Speaker 2: Ernest.
Speaker 1: Ernest Scott.
Speaker 2: Okay, Ernest Scott, and now you say he was a civil rights activist.  What, did you know much about his activities?
Speaker 1: I don't know much about it.  It was when he was younger, he was a school teacher, he really wanted to teach and when I say back in, back in the, it would have to be back in the early '20s [1920s] that he was active.  You've got to remember, Hampton [Virginia], you know as you know from being around Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], you know those college towns were so different and my father actually talked about, my father talked about how he was raised in a funny situation, he was not raised in the typical South.  He was not raised in the typical North, he was raised in an academic environment from, as I said, from the second grade all the way through college, where you basically do anything you want.  You could be a teacher, you could be, you know, either that, you were trained, you were raised.  So, he said it was very, it hit him hard when he left college [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], when he went out into the world and said, oh, you mean, I can't be a diplomat, I can't be this, I can't be that, I mean here I met the president of the United States, the first lady, you know, all these people, all these activists, he knew as a child, he knew as a college student, he knew, you know, as a young adult and all of a sudden he was sort of hit.
Story_ID: 325692
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself growing up?  What kind of a kid were you and what were you thinking about and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: You know, it's, it's--a story my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] told me once.  She said, "We were walking down the street and one of your friends yelled, 'Hey, Ozzie [HistoryMaker Oz Scott]',"--I was Ozzie when I was a kid, hey Ozzie, and we kept walking.  My mother said, you didn't say anything and she said, I just looked at her, I said, he saw me and it wasn't as if I was disrespecting him, I was, it was, I got, you know, I want to say sometimes I get caught, caught up, like I get caught up in my thoughts.  I think, as a child, I was very thoughtful.  I had a good time.  I played.  I look at my parents who I adore very, I adored very much but sometimes I felt like I was, I was the adult.  I remember my mother, when I was in college, or even, or I guess in grad school, called me up, my mother called me up and said, well, she was having some problems with my father [Osborne Scott] and she said, your, your grandfather told me that you're the adult now so I need to talk to you.  And she started to tell me, I said, wait a second mom, I don't want to know about all of that but I think as a child my mother held me in very high esteem.  She loved me.  She loves my brother [Michael Scott] a lot but I tell the story that when she was on her death bed, and she was going through the delirium that if my brother had told her she was crazy, she would have kept talking.  My father told her she was crazy, she would have kept talking.  If I come in there and say, ma, you're crazy, she would stop because if Oz said it, it must be right.  So, I was spoiled.  I was spoiled intellectually.  I was spoiled, I mean, it wasn't as if they gave me everything, absolutely did not.  I had a car accident when I was, my mother was driving, I think I was coming back from being tutored, it was, it was 1964, I lost my spleen in the accident.  They told me if I had been an hour away from the hospital, I may not have lived.
Story_ID: 325693
Speaker 1: Telling the story about when I was--so I was in a car accident but I remember, I remember getting up and making sure my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] was okay, stopping a car, another car, other cars were coming, and people said I went, I said I went over and I sat down.  They said I went over and I passed out but my mother, I don't even know why I was telling the story, how I started on this, but growing up, I mean having that accident was, I think very important to me.  Oh, I know why.  I think it was because I was awarded $2500 in insurance settlement and when I went to college, I turned to my mother and I said, where's that college money I got, that $2500 for college?  She laughed, she said, they gave it to your father [Osborne Scott], he spent that a long time ago.  I think my parents paid for the first two years of college and I ended up paying from scholarships, from work, from everything else, I paid for pretty much everything out.  I know I loaned my parents money.  So, you know, when I was in college, I, or graduate school, I, I had a job.  I loaned my father some money.  I mean it was just, I took care of myself.
Story_ID: 325694
Speaker 1: My mother [Jean Sampson Scott], this is a very important part of my childhood, was on cortisone in 1957, '58 [1958]--she had a--a growth, a tumor on her pituitary and at that time they did not have the surgical tools to operate on it so what they did was they cut out her adrenal glands and gave her Addison's disease and they used cortisone to, to keep her, keep her going.  Cortisone, most doctors will know, especially in those early days when she was maybe one of the first people to take it, she was, she was a major experiment.  Walter Reed [National Naval Medical Center; Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland], she had the operation at Walter Reed 'cause my father [Osborne Scott] was military.  Other people who she knew at the time had the same thing died from it, from that tumor, from that, whatever that, the growth but it gave her psychosis, it gives, you know, because they had to find out how much to give her.  So, if they give her too much, she'd have highs and lows and it was very, very traumatic on a child to see your mother going through, you know, ups and downs and that dramatic.  It was very hard on her relationship with my father.  A lot of times fights that would happen and other things were because of those ups and downs and I know as a child my brother [Michael Scott] being the youngest that I was the responsible person.  At ten o'clock at night when, you know, the fighting was too bad that I had to go in there and calm them down and I used to do that with a stomach ache.  That was, it was, my trick was, I have a stomach ache.  When I had a stomach ache, they would just like drop everything and, and look after, look after me and that way I knew that would calm them down and that would stop it.  And my father, when he went to Korea, was stationed, he was stationed in Korea a year before we went over there, I was having stomach aches and they put me in Governors Island [New York, New York], the hospital in Governors Island.  I was there for maybe a week under observations and they realized when my father showed up that stomach ache cleared up pretty quickly and I do remember them giving me some sugar pills, some placebos to placate me and I kind of knew that they were sugar pills and I said, "Oh please"--but, so, I mean that, that was my youth in a lot of ways, was--. It took my mother about, it took the hospi- the doctors, I want to say five or six years to, to find--regulate her medicine.  I have another friend who I talk to whose mother was on cortisone back in the early '60s [1960s] and she said her mother sat in a dark room for six months, every day.  So, I mean, that's, that's an example of what that cortisone was doing.  My mother proceeded to live, 68, 78, 88, almost thirty-five years on cortisone.  So every time we'd go back to--she did have to go to Walter Reed once a year just to check in and all the doctors from Bethesda [Maryland], all the doctors from Walter Reed would converge on, on her to see how she was, how she could live this long.
Speaker 2: So she was really an experiment in a lot of ways?
Speaker 1: She was definitely an experiment, yeah.
Speaker 2: They didn't know what they were doing, necessarily.  They had an idea but they--.
Speaker 1: They didn't have a clue.  I'd say about, I don't know if it was five to ten years later, they had the techniques to take the tumor off and so they don't, you know, taking someone's adrenal glands isn't that--because the pituitary stimulates the adrenal glands to produce too much adrenal, adrenaline so their solution was, well take the adrenal, adrenal glands out which puffed her up, the cortisone puffed her up, actually darkened her skin a little bit.  My mother, when she was in elementary school, was light enough to pass for white, tinted her, you know, the cortisone tinted her a little bit but that's, you know, that was my mother.  That was my, that was my childhood.  That was, that was some of the importance--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it sounds like a, quite a struggle to deal with and--.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was a struggle, it was a struggle but I somehow learned to let things ride over me so it wasn't that.  I didn't, you know, I didn't find it that traumatic though if I go back and tell the story, it's, there's some pretty traumatic moments, but as a kid I just seemed to figure out how to let it ride.
Story_ID: 325695
Speaker 1: --At the same time, she [Scott's mother, Jean Sampson Scott] was delving into genealogy and doing the other things, too.  So she was still had a lot of--?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah, I mean in that period when she was really just trying to get herself together, she started teaching right about that time, teaching elementary school.  Genealogy, I think she started like the early '70s [1970s].  I think she was, and she was, you know, she had those early computers, you know that first Apple, that first, you know, so, it was, she was always ahead of her time.  My mother took film classes at Columbia's Teachers College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York] back in the '50s [1950s] and she would tell me things, even as a kid, okay, they say you can't let a cut last for more than a certain amount of seconds.  You gotta do this, you gotta do that so she would tell me all these film techniques she would learn as a--my mother was a, she was a creative, very creative, she was an artist in her own way.  At school, if they needed, they needed a class in paper mache, my mother would spend a week learning paper mache, learning techniques.  Origamo, the Japanese--.
Speaker 1: Origami.
Speaker 2: Origami, yeah, she would learn that.  My mother just creatively was very adept at, at learning art and teaching arts and crafts and when I look at my wife [Lynne Scott] now, my wife is very--there's a lot of similarities.  My wife's an artist and they were very, there's some similarities.  They say you marry your mother. I, don't tell her that.  I guess it's on tape now (laughter).
Speaker 1: So were you, were you artistic kind of--were you involved in productions and all?
Speaker 2: Oh, theatre.  I was--music, theatre.  In high school [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York] I was General Bullmoose in 'Li'l Abner.'  I was, I did a lot of theatre in high school.  I did 'The Fantasticks.'  I played one of the fathers.  I did a number of plays and, and musicals in, in elementary--in, in junior high school, I played in the orchestra for 'Pirates of Penzance' ['The Pirates of Penzance']. I was in the band.  I was that utility guy, not played, didn't play anything well enough but could pretty much fake anything.  So we need a tuba player this week, we need a clarinet player next week and not that I was playing much, but I was blowing (laughter).  So, yeah, I think there was always an artistic bent and I think that came out of my mother.

Speaker 1: Did you like movies and television when you were growing up?  Did your parents [Jean Sampson Scott and Osborne Scott]--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  I think we all did.  I, I think, it was interesting.  When I did 'The Jeffersons' my, I felt like I was a student of comedy.  I knew 'The Three Stooges.'  I knew, I knew those old films.  When, what was great growing up in the [U.S.] military, especially in Germany, you know, for fifteen cents when you were a kid, you could go to the movies and, and the movies, before you see the movies, you'd see one of those old 1940s serials, you know, 'The Invisible Man.'  There was one, there was one Australian one, you know, the, it's sort of a 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' type of guy and you know when I, when I saw 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' I said, all Spielberg [Steven Spielberg] did was take some of those old serials that we grew up with--
Speaker 1: That's exactly what he--yeah.
Speaker 2: --and turned it into a movie.  The Hopalong Cassidys, the, you know, the Westerns, the comedy, Abbott and Costello [Bud Abbott and Lou Costello], so when I was doing 'The Jeffersons,' you know, I felt, "Oh, oh, oh, let me see.  Now, Abbott and Costello would do it this way, so and so would do it this way, Red Skelton would do it that way." And I remember one person saying to me, my assistant director said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], but that's old."  I said, "It will work, trust me." And it was just a little thing I'd done that was just a regular old comic routine and it turned out the next year was in the, it was in the title sequence of 'The Jeffersons' but I said, "You can't throw the baby out with the bath water.  I mean it's, it may be old but it still works.  Comedy is comedy."
Speaker 1: That's funny, a take is still funny no matter who.
Speaker 2: No matter who.  I mean I have great stories from, from, you know, talking to old comedians and talking to people who say "Hey, if it, if it works, if it works once, it's going to work again.  Why, why fix it."  Why, I think, a friend of mine was working for Richard Pryor and he said one day Richard Pryor, Flip Wilson and Redd Foxx were sitting in a hotel room trying to top each other by telling jokes.  They said it was just a phenomenal, it sounds like a phenomenal moment and he said, "You know who won?"  I said, "Who?"  He said, "Flip Wilson."  I said, "Really?"  He said because Richard and Redd were creating, they were creating brilliant jokes but they were creating jokes as they went along.  Everything was brand new at that moment and Flip sat there and just told every old joke he could think of and they still work.  So, so, no, so for me, I loved old movies.  I loved old television I just, you know, I, I, just--coming up I think I watched a lot of it.

Speaker 1: Do you remember the names of the schools you attended?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, the one in Japan I don't remember, actually I do have the yearbook.  I don't remember it.  Graham School in, in Mount Vernon [New York].  I went to there for kindergarten, for part of kindergarten, I went there for second, third, fourth grade, second, third, fourth and part of, yes, second, third and fourth.  Fifth grade I think I split between Graham and Baumholder [Germany].  And in--.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell Baumholder?
Speaker 2: B-A-U-M-H-O-L-D-E-R and then Bad Kreuznach [Germany], that military school--.
Speaker 1: Now, once again.
Speaker 2: Bad Kreuznach, oh, that's a good one.  B-A-D, second word, K-R-E-U-Z-N-A-C-H, I think that's it.  Kreuznach was fifth and sixth grade and then Pemberton, Pemberton in New Jersey, that was right there by Fort Dix [New Jersey], the public school there was Pemberton and then Mount Vernon High [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York].
Story_ID: 325698
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in grade school and high school or--?
Speaker 2: I would say, as hard as math was, I really enjoyed math.  I had a good time in math.  I mean, oh God, there's some great stories that I have about high school [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York], Mrs. Morgenstern [ph.].  She was my history teacher.  I think she was my English or history teacher, but Mrs. Morgenstern had a theatre appreciations class and she would take us to Broadway plays and I remember seeing some of the greatest Broadway plays.  I saw 'Marat/Sade' [Peter Weiss].  I saw, I told Hal Holbrook this, I saw 'Mark Twain' ['Mark Twain Tonight'] when he did it on Broadway back then.  I saw--.
Speaker 1: This is between '60 [1960], this is like '60 [1960]--.
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], '66 [1966], right in there.  I saw 'Royal Hunt of the Sun' ['The Royal Hunt of the Sun,' Peter Shaffer], which was a great one.  I saw, I saw 'Man of La Mancha' when it was at New York University [New York, New York] where the library is now in a Quonset style theatre.  It was sort of one of those Quonset hut-type theatres.
Speaker 1: Is that before it went to the big--.
Speaker 2: Before it went to Broadway.
Speaker 1: Okay, was Richard Kiley in it?
Speaker 2: Richard Kiley, yes.  I saw--my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] took me to the closing night--I tell [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne this all the time--of, of 'A Hand Is On The Gate' [Roscoe Lee Browne], which was, which, for me in a lot of ways led to 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange] because it was a series of poems that, that Roscoe had put together.  He had Gloria Foster, Cicely Tyson, Josephine Premice and Ellen Holly, four women and he had four men.  It was Roscoe Lee Browne, [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones, Leon Bibbs [sic. Leon Bibb] and Moses Gunn.  Can you imagine that?
Speaker 1: It's something, that's something.
Speaker 2: And closing night, on Broadway, I watched--they started the play in, in Central Park [New York, New York] for the Shakespeare, I think, for Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] and then they moved it to Broadway and closing night I was there and saw this production.  It just was fabulous, where they just were, they're all sitting there on the stage and doing poetry and so, and they, I, every time I found that album, for years I'd buy that album.  I think I still have that album that they put out and it's just, it's, it's, it was monumental in my, my growth.
Speaker 1: 'The Hand Is On The Gate.'
Speaker 2: 'A Hand'--'A Hand'--
Speaker 1: 'A Hand Is On The Gate' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) 'Is On The Gate.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, so, so, can you imagine just, you know, seeing all those plays.  'Marat'--'Marat/Sade' [Peter Weiss], I mean, 'Royal Hunt To The Sun.'  I want to say that was Richard Kiley too.  If it was not Richard Kiley it was--but it was, so anyway, so, no, I just, that's for me--I think it was very important.  Ms. Morgenstern, I remember one day in her class, she had a play, it was 'Romeo and Juliet' [William Shakespeare], one of those, and I was reading one part, I was reading Romeo, this girl was reading Juliet and it was actually interesting for me as a kid trying to read those plays and I started reading it in such a way, this girl and I, that it was, became very sexual, very sensual, very real, very regular and it made you realize what Shakespeare [William Shakespeare], how Shakespeare wrote.  I remember her just turning beet red as the two of us were just getting into this sexual reading of this play, this, this classic and the kids were falling on the floor laughing but it made me understand something very much about, about Shakespearean plays that they're about real people and if you break it down and don't--. And one of the things I always say to the actors when we did 'For Colored Girls,' don't do Ntozake's [HistoryMaker Ntozake Shange] rhythms.  I want to see your rhythms.  I want to see how you feel.  You know, when you look at "What light through yonder window breaks," you know, and people do it with such verve and vigor, but you really think about it, it's some young boy sitting there trying to catch a glimpse of this young girl and that's all it is.  It ain't much bigger than that.  And when you think about it like that, all of a sudden it becomes very real.  I remember on Broadway seeing a play with an Italian Brooklyn guy, actor, and he was playing Claudius in 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare] and Sam, I think it was Sam Waterston was playing Hamlet but he did it with that little Brooklynese accent but it was so real that I said, "Oh my God, that's all it is.  It's just very simple.  It's not complicated.  It's not, dah, dah dah, dah.  It's, dah, dah, dah dah."  So, so, no, that's--so that growing up, I was very much watching theatre, watching. I did--and I was very much and when I went to college, it was a lot of theatre.
Story_ID: 325699
Speaker 1: At any time during the high school period, did you decide that you, that you were going to pursue theatre or film or something like that or did you ever think that was a--
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all.  I had thought about environmental, I loved the environmental, not even biology but, but urban planning, environmental urban planning.  There was, I thought about, I don't want to say politics but political theory; I loved, I loved history.
Speaker 1: Now you said before you were reading a lot of black history before your father [Osborne Scott] even started.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you said you were reading Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Who inspired you to read those materials?
Speaker 2: I think back in the '60s [1960s] it was starting to happen.  I, I was reading--one of the things I remember as a kid in the fourth and fifth grade, I got into a huge reading bug and just read biographies.  I read biographies.  There was a series of books called, 'You Were There' and they would take you back and put you in the middle of the, whatever, you know, 'Thomas Edison, You Were There' [ph.].  I, and I was, I loved reading biographies.  Just loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, in terms of black history, was there a--?
Speaker 2: Anybody--helped that pushed me in that?  No, not really.  I think my parents always inspired me in terms of, you know, I was, we always joke, I'm sure you do too.  My mother [Jean Sampson Scott] always talked about our people, our people.  I thought, we had this huge family.  I thought cousins and aunts and uncles; our people, anytime something in the paper, our people, until I realized she was just talking about black people but it was very, very important to--it was important to the family.  It was not as if my father didn't read, he read a lot.  It's just, reading, quote, unquote what, you know was supposedly the instructional materials.  He, you know, but--theology.  He was, you know he read his religion.  He was always up on that.
Story_ID: 325700
Speaker 1: Did he [Scott's father, Osborne Scott] keep up with the Civil Rights Movement, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and, I know Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no, my father did.  I know my fa (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) was really involved in the Progressive National Baptist Convention [Progressive National Baptist Convention, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father, you know, Bayard Rustin was, you know, some, was a friend of my, you know, an acquaintance of my father's.  He knew a lot of those ministers.  So, we were, we were there, you know.  I--my father did not have a church because he was a chaplain and he was mostly administration during, during the [U.S.] military services but back in somewhere I'd say in 1968 when he went to City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], he actually got a church in Brooklyn [New York].  And so he was in Brooklyn, he had a church until he died, '68 [1968], '78 [1978], '88 [1988], almost, almost twenty-eight, twenty-nine years, he had a church in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: What denomination?
Speaker 2: Baptist.
Speaker 1: Baptist, okay.
Speaker 2: His, he was sort of I think he was more American Baptist Convention [American Baptist Churches USA].  He, that's where he was.  He, you know, when I said, "Dad, you know, I don't want to go to Brooklyn, I'm in Mount Vernon [New York], I don't want to go to Brooklyn to go to church."  He said, "I don't care where you go to church as long as you go to church.  You want to go to the synagogue around the corner, go to synagogue, just, you've got to go somewhere."  So I went to Congregational church in Mount Vernon 'cause that's where all my friends were going.  So the youth group was there.  So, I was very active with the youth group and I went to the church camps and actually those church camps were also very important to my growing up because a number of those people from those church camps, I am still very close to to this day.  It's amazing how one week in a summer, there are people I know to this day.  I think the funny story--my wife [Lynne Scott] calls up the gas company and she smelled gas and this, I'm like, I go home and there's this short bald white guy walking around checking for gas leaks and when we start talking as he's leaving and he said, "You look familiar."  I'm like, I don't know, he said.  He said, I said, "Where you from?"  He said, "Bayside, Queens [New York]."  I said, "I don't think I know anybody from Bayside, Queens, I'm from Mount Vernon."  He said, "I don't know anyone from Mount Vernon."  And we talked and as he was going, "I said, well, well, if you ever think of it, my name's [HistoryMaker] Oz Scott." And he said, "Ozzie, I'm Dougie [ph.]," and we had gone to a church camp for one week when we were like fifteen years old.  Here we were in our thirties and this guy remembered.  I mean, so, that was actually Dougie and I'm like going "Dougie," and he looked at me and he said, "We used to sing 'Wooly Bully' together." And I said, "Oh," (laughter "I remember singing 'Wooly Bully' (laughter) at that camp," so.
Story_ID: 325264
Speaker 1: Now were you involved in clubs and class offices and that sort of thing in high school?
Speaker 2: Actually, boy, got a, got a great story about that.  I ran for council, the student council and Mount Vernon High [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York] had two thousand kids in it and they, it was so big they had to have two auditoriums.  So, one day we had one thousand, the next day we had another one thousand and I'm looking at this, I'm looking at all these, you know, these people running against me and, because it was so many of us running, they read what we had to do and the president, running for president, vice president, treasurer, they, and secretary, they could speak but the council had to be, just stand up in the back row and they'd read.  Now, I'm sitting there going, wait a second.  Now I haven't done all that much.  So I can't stand really on my record.  I gotta, then I don't know what happened but when they called my name to stand up, I decided while they were starting to read my, my dinky little bio, I broke through the front chairs and went out to the front of the stage and started taking bows.  The, thousand kids in that audience fell out laughing.  I was getting applause.  I didn't hear a word that was being said about me and I was, get back, get back.  So I went back and sat down.  I won.  I won.  I, and I think the next day they, they, the word was out.  I was sort of handcuffed to the chair but by that time word was out.  I remember my mother [Jean Sampson Scott], I love my mother, and I, she had 'em for years and I don't know where they are but she made up posters, you know, took magazine articles and made posters for "Double your Pleasure, Double," you know, vote for, you know, and we put them up all over the school.  So I was on, I was on the student council.  I was a marshal.  You know, they had the marshals in the school and I know I had a reputation because one day I walked into a bathroom, no I was going there to just to pee and they were smoking in the bathroom and I walked in, they saw my badge and all of a sudden, you went, all the cigarettes were being doused and then all of a sudden somebody I did not know who it was, I never met, I'd probably seen him around, and somebody says, "Oh, man, it's only Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott]."  They started lighting it back up 'cause they knew that Oz was, you know, not going to bother.  So I ran for student council, I ran, I was doing that.  I, in my youth group, I remember Billy Lee [ph.] who actually went to NYU School of the Arts [Tisch School of the Arts, New York University, New York, New York], and I eventually ended up at, he was the actor.  Billy was, he was the playboy of the, of the school.  He was sort of, he was kind of, he was like my big brother but Billy was the vice president of the youth group the year before me and when it came time to elect the new officers for the following year and he was going, he came to me and said, "Oz, we're going to make you vice president that way you get, you get the title but you don't have to do the work."  And Michelle, Michelle Newsome [ph.] was the president, I was the vice president.  So, there was always, I guess, I, I joke, it was always, I want to say scheming and, and playing, playing the odds.  So, that's what I did.  Those are the clubs.  Oh, and then wait a second.  Then we had the Classics.  We had our high school fraternity and ours was the Classics.  We were the bougie fraternity.  It was, was, oh God, what was the other group?  The South Side Boys, they had their fraternity and we were the Heights, Mount Vernon, the Heights and that was, it started actually, mostly it was sports and wrestlers, the one that started, and so I was in the Classics for high school and where people had their letters or this or that, we were very cool, we had bracelets made up (laughter).  So, that was, so yeah, so that's, that's kind of, that's my high school.
Story_ID: 325265
Speaker 1: About how many black students were in Mount Vernon High [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York]?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, Mount Vernon was actually, I, I remember this, I remember, we had a sizable amount of black students but it was not, I always say, Mount Vernon was 33 percent Italian, 30--30 percent Jewish and 30 percent black and we always laugh because the blacks and the Jews would have a coalition, a political coalition to take over the city and they could never beat the Italians.  So we went from Vaccarello [Joseph P. Vaccarello], mayor, to Petrillo [August P. Petrillo].  I mean, there was just no way.  I think the word is that the mobs were kind of run out of Mount Vernon [New York].  The, you know, numbers were run out of Mount Vernon so the Italian influence in Mount Vernon was very strong.  The story goes on that years later, the first black mayor of a, of a city in New York, was Mount Vernon and somebody told me this story, I will go on record saying, I'm not sure how true it is but I'm sure it's pretty, pretty close, that what do Italian men hate more than black, black men, especially a black man married to an Italian woman?  It turns out a black man married to an Italian woman was running against an Italian woman and the town father said, "Ah, I guess the black guy is going to get this one."  They, so they, they put this black mayor into Mt. Vernon and he ran the city for a while, so, that was actually, I mean that was for me was very telling.
Story_ID: 325266
Speaker 1: Mount Vernon [New York] was a very big sports town.  I think what happened a lot of times is kids who were getting thrown out of the New York City [New York, New York] school system, they had to go outside of the city to go to school and so we got some of those people into Mount Vernon [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York].  Mount Vernon had a good reputation of a, I think we were state champions in wrestling one year.  State champions in basketball, multiple years.  State champions in football.
Speaker 2: Did you play high school sports 'cause you're pretty tall and a strong guy (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, as they say, I'm tall but I'm telling you, when I say we were state champions, we had, we had some serious ballplayers.  The story, I think the funny story is--I talked to, I saw this guy once, he was from the Bronx [New York] and he was coaching some young kids that I knew, some of my son's friends, and he was bragging about his basketball team.  "Oh, my basketball team, we were, we were the best, we were the greatest, we were this, we were that." And I said, "When did you graduate high school?"  And he told me, I said, "I went to Mount Vernon High." "Okay, okay, okay, yeah, there was that one time (laughter) that we got beat." But Mount Vernon High, you know, the story is--yeah, I played, I actually played soccer at Mount Vernon but the story is the track team.  The track team was purple and, purple and gold were the colors and people to this day tell me stories that when Mount Vernon High would show up at a track meet, they all walked on with their hoods up and walked out on there; they said everybody else was stretching and Mount Vernon High would just come out and stand there and it was pure intimidation and they would, all at once they'd take their hoods off and they'd start working out and somebody said, a couple of people told me, "You just kind of looked at Mount Vernon and go, 'Whoa, what is this about?' and said, not that they were any better than us, but there was an intimidation factor."  That, if you look around now is kind of the way people are.  They've taken that into what Mount Vernon was sort of ahead of its time.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the stars on those teams?  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: Well, a number of those guys, a number of them ended up being junkies and--but from Mount Vernon, the people that you would know, Kenny Singleton [Ken Singleton], baseball.  There was a Joyner, he went to St. John's [St. John's University, New York, New York].  I don't think he really went on, I think he became a minister.  Unfortunately, half those guys would end up in, you know, in jail or--. We looked back, there was a big fight.  We were told, it was a great story, at our twentieth high school reunion, it was, one Italian guy was on the basketball team, one Italian guy on the basketball team. And he told a story about how he--he said, "Remember that big fight in our senior year?"  I said, "Yeah."  Well, they were fighting.  He said, "I used the N word and fight broke out.  They beat me.  They, we fought, we fought." But after it was over, they, they picked him up and they took him home.  They said, "You're our boy but you can't use the N word."  It was a very interesting, there's an interesting dynamic between the blacks, you know, the blacks and the Italians, there would be always that fight at the end of the year, but we all sort of grew up together so, that was Mount Vernon High.
Story_ID: 325267
Speaker 1: How did you decide what college to go to (laughter)?  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, okay.  Now, I didn't decide, my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] decided or my mother--I applied to, I know these kids are applying to ten and twenty schools now, we applied back then to five schools, you know.  One you know, two safe schools, two over your head and then one school you knew you're going to get into.  I applied to Coe College [Cedar Rapids, Iowa] in Iowa.  I applied to Earlham [Earlham College, Richmond, Indiana] in Ohio 'cause my mother made me do that.
Speaker 1: The one in Richmond, Indiana, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, maybe that's where, Richmond, yeah.  I applied to Antioch [Antioch College] in Yellow Springs [Ohio].  I applied to, I'm trying to remember, that's strange, but then I also applied to a school called Friends World, at the time it was Friends World Institute [Global College, Long Island University, Brookville, New York], F-W-I, FWI, and, which was kind of a hippie school out in Long Island [New York] but it traveled all over the world.  You spent six months in different countries and my mother had seen it written up in The New York Times magazine section and I applied there, and for me it made sense.  I traveled a lot so I was used to traveling.  I found that very interesting.  So, I went--it was in Westbury [New York], Long Island and I went there, probably twenty-some, twenty-five, twenty-eight kids in my class in Long Island.
Speaker 1: This is 1967 I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], yes, '67 [1967], '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: This is, this is Friends, what's it called?  Friends--
Speaker 2: Friends World--
Speaker 1: --World.
Speaker 2: --at the time, Friends World Institute, it turned into Friends World College about a year later.
Speaker 1: Does it still exist?  Does it--
Speaker 2: Friends World College has been incorporated into Long Island Univ- LIU, Long Island University [Brookville, New York].  They have taken over but it's a Quaker-based school.  So I did six months in Westbury, Long Island, or five months in Westbury, and then we all got into--there was--we split up.  Half of our class went to Africa, to Kenya, and half of us went to Mexico.  I was not ready to go that far away from home yet.  I figured I'd get there.  So I went to Mexico and we got in two minivans, two VW [Volkswagen], those two old VW minivans.  We were all told you can bring one suitcase, one heavy coat and one sleeping bag, that was it, and we piled all that stuff onto the roof and onto the back of the car and it was sixteen of us, two full minivans that drove all the way down to Mexico.  We drove through Mississippi and it was, everything was an educational experience.  You, there was not grades, you kept a journal and we had actually driven up to Vermont, into Montreal [Canada] at times and we, and we had driven down to the TVA, to study, Tennessee Valley Authority.  And so we drove down to Mexico, taking our time, going through Knoxville [Tennessee], going through, in Knoxville, you know, staying at where the civil rights, you know, they had a civil rights headquarters there, going into, through Mississippi, Shreveport [Louisiana], going to Laredo, Texas, Nuevo Laredo [Mexico], we went over there.
Story_ID: 325268
Speaker 1: Went down to San Luis Potosi [Mexico] and somewhere, I think, San Luis, we were met by the guy who's going to run the program in, in Morelia [Mexico] where we were headed but he had come up to meet us.  So instead of sixteen people, we had seventeen people.  So one person had to take the bus the rest of the way and they said, "Who wants to go on their own?"  And I have never been one to be herded and I raised my hand.  I said, "I'll go."  I said, "But you got to do me two--I have to know two things," 'cause I didn't speak any Spanish.  I said, "I need to know how to count to ten and I need to know how do I ask where the bathroom is?"  Donde esta el bano?  So that was my, those are my first real Spanish words and uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, and so I was put on the bus that had to go through Guadalajara [Mexico], change in Guadalajara to the bus to go to Morelia.  So I mean it was not just get on a bus and go, you had to maneuver your way down there. And I think, which for me sort of, and people look at me, looked at me then and they look at me now and that defined me a lot, of saying I'm independent, I'm out, I'm doing this on my own, I will figure out how to get there. And I got to Morelia after they did but, you know, walking in the city with my one suitcase and my heavy coat.  I think I probably left my sleeping bag on, in the van.  So I got down there and moved in, we had a, we lived with a family, a Mexican family. Nobody spoke English in the house.  I, we lived there for five months.  We went to school at the University of Morelia [Morelia, Mexico].
Speaker 2: How do you spell Morelia?
Speaker 1: M-O-R-E-L-I-A, M-O-R-E-L-I-A, Morelia.  A number of those, a number of those people that went to the University of Michoacan, we went to the University of Michoacan [Universidad Michoacana de San Nicolas de Hidalgo, Morelia, Mexico] and studied--what?
Speaker 2: We probably need to spell that too.
Speaker 1: Michoacan, M-I--.
Speaker 2: People transcribe this, that's why I'm asking.
Speaker 1: Michoacan, M-I-C-H-O-A-C-A-N, Michoacan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, that's the state of Michoacan, Morelia is the capital of Michoacan, and so we studied history, Spanish and took, and again, took trips.  We got in those vans and took trips.  We went to Patzcuaro [Mexico] where I remember Patzcuaro is an island.  There's an island off Patzcuaro that you take a, fishing island that, 'I Spy' shot, shot one of their episodes there. And we went to a place, El Fi--El, now I can't, I'm not going to spell it, the fire, El Finero [ph.] which was, again, a developmental, they were going to, I'm not sure, it's between Acapulco [Mexico] and Puerto Vallarta [Mexico] and I don't know if it's Manzanillo [Mexico] or Man--it was some, one of the communities, they were getting ready to develop it but it was actually interesting because they took us on a bus through there and they had flooded, you know, flooded valleys, you know, trying to, you know, talk about environmental reclamation and, and building up the area, building and we slept on the beach on the, in this deserted place, I'm in the middle of nowhere, we slept on a beach.  That's kind of, you know, so that for me was my first year of, of college and I just, I kept a journal.  We got graded on our journals.  That was pass, fail on the journals we kept.  So, we did that.  I had a really fascinating time and then I came back and after that first year I said, okay, that was cool, now I need some more structure.  So, I transferred.  I went to the UNCF [United Negro College Fund], helped me find a college 'cause I said I'm going to transfer but I'm keeping all these journal credits somehow so I need to find a college that I feel that can give me more structure but will accept--I'm not going to start all over again.  A couple of my friends, they started all over again and so they ended up doing four, another four years in college.  I said, you know, I'm going to get out of college as soon as possible (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How many had you done?
Speaker 1: How many, what year?  I did one year.
Speaker 2: You did one year there [Friends World Institute; Global College, Long Island University, Brookville, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 325269
Speaker 1: So in '68 [1968] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I found this school in Vermont called Marlboro [Marlboro College, Marlboro, Vermont], Marlboro, Vermont, Marlboro College, where I went to for a year.  They accepted all my Friends World College [Friends World Institute; Global College, Long Island University, Brookville, New York] credits.  So I was in my second year, started doing theatre at Marlboro.  Marlboro had a very nice theatre program.  There's a Marlboro music festival up in Vermont where, although that's where they have it.  So I spent a year there.  It was cold, lot of snow, lot of ice.  I learned how to drive a stick shift on an icy road.  You know, kids wanting to go hang out.  Who can drive a car?  I can drive, I've got a driver's license.  Get in the car and don't realize it's a stick shift and the roads, I mean, I'm saying they're ice.  So, I, that was my lesson on driving 'cause nobody was going to say we don't want to go, so we went.  I went to Marlboro College for a year and then I said, okay, I'm tired, I got the structure I needed for the year.  I transferred to Antioch [Antioch College] where I actually had been rejected when I, when I applied from high school [Mount Vernon High School, Mount Vernon, New York].  Antioch was starting a spin-off program in Washington, D.C. and so I went there.  I mean, their first year doing it, that actually, that school moved from Washington, D.C. to Columbia, Maryland and ended up in Baltimore [Maryland] but my first year they really had no teachers.  So, they had Putney Graduate, Putney Graduate School [Putney Graduate School of Teacher Education, Putney, Vermont], which was an educational graduate school, Antioch had sort of taken over in Putney, Vermont and they had a division in Washington, D.C.  So, all my classes were graduate teaching classes, education classes, so that's where, I did that and I worked for Arena Stage [Washington, D.C.] as my work study because Antioch's work study. And that's a great story because I--so I was taking this, Tom Porter, who, you know--so that was actually interesting because Tom Porter, who's very political, they're very political people I start, I mean, and I don't mean just people talked, there was some real interesting--
Speaker 1: Antioch is probably one of the most activist schools in the country, if not the most.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, and think of something that's sort of a, that first satellite and if you know Antioch's got satellite programs all over.  This was really the first one and so you really had a whole bunch of activists who were running this program.
Story_ID: 325270
Speaker 1: So I went to Antioch [Antioch College] and I went to--and I started working in theatre.  I worked at a theatre called Back Alley Theatre [Washington, D.C.] and Jimmy Smith who was a friend of mine who he and I actually found, up on Kennedy Street on 14th Street, 15th [Street], 14th Street, we found their theatre.  So Back Alley Theatre, I was there, and then I moved over to Arena Stage [Washington, D.C.].  Took a year off to work for The Living Stage [The Living Stage Theatre Company], which was an improvisational theatre company that I spent two years at. And this is a very important moment in my life because I was the stage manager.  I actually came in sweeping up the floor.  That's all I was going to do.  I was going to sweep up, I was going to be there.  The stage manager, there was, had some problems and they needed a stage manager.  All of a sudden I got into Actors' Equity [Actors' Equity Association], I got this job.  I remember, I was making $192.50 a week and it was like let the revolution wait, I am making some money.  I remember a Baltimore Bullet was getting a penthouse right there in Southwest and asked me if I want to move in.  So I knew I was, I was going to be the new playboy.  I got some money, I had a job.  Yeah, it lasted sixteen weeks, you know, but I didn't know that at the time but, I mean, I was thrifty, anyway.  So, the Arena Stage, Living Stage is a children's improvisational theatre company that tours to all the schools and institutions and prisons and we do, they would do plays.  I was the stage manager and I ended up very much running--helping to run the theatre.  I was like, Bob Alexander who ran, who--we did eight weeks of improvisational rehearsals, eight weeks, six days a week.  I mean it was a wealth of information and I really think a lot of my directing comes from that.  They would start improvs out of nothing, just sort of looking, and then my job as stage manager, yeah, it was to help set up but it was also to help keep them sharp and talk about the improvs with the actors afterwards and, and so I did that for two years and we--took a year off and then I came back to Antioch.  I don't, I mean, this is, and I went to Antioch and I said, you know, I've done, those eight weeks of pure rehearsal, not just working, but rehearsing, sitting there, studying improvisational techniques, I said that's as strong a class as you give or anybody gives.  I think some of this should be looked upon as academic credits and the administrator there said, I think you're right.  I turned around and they turned all those work credits into academic credits.  So I went from--I got sixty academic credits for my, my working that year which all of a sudden, I went through Antioch which was a five-year college, I finished in three and a half years.  I didn't tell them, I didn't ask for all those credits to be academic credits but I wasn't going to, I wasn't going to give them back.  So, that for me was, again, is sort of how I got through college was I always said I sort of hustled my way through college.
Speaker 2: So, so when did you graduate?  Was it '71 [1971]?
Speaker 1: I graduated in '72 [1972]--
Speaker 2: Seventy-two [1972].
Speaker 1: --but I'd taken--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --remember I'd taken a year off, a full year off to, to just work at Arena Stage.
Story_ID: 325271
Speaker 1: And one of the people that I moved in with was, was Mark [Alan Mark Silbergeld] and Ellen Silbergeld.  I moved in with them one year and then I stayed with them for two years, at least two years, and Mark, they were both Raiders, Nader's Raiders.  They had worked for Ralph Nader and Mark was, at that time, I think he was, went to Federal, FTA, Federal, FTC, Federal Trade Commission, and Ellen was studying, she was studying for a Ph.D. at John Hopkins, Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] in environmental biology and she is now, I think one of our foremost environmental biologists in the world and like when Chernobyl [Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine] went, she's the person that they bring on.  Her, her, I think her big thing is heavy metals.  So I needed a science prob- I needed science credits to graduate and I went to Ellen.  I said, "Ellen, I need, you know, can you be my advisor on these science credits." And she said, "I just got a grant to go fishing in the Potomac River and to analyze the fish that come out of the Potomac River." And so it was our job to go fishing and we went fishing right off the Watergate [Watergate Complex; Watergate Hotel, Washington, D.C.] because that's where the sewage comes out and the carp come right there. We pulled all these fish out, then we went up to Johns Hopkins and she had a nuclear, nuclear, you know, one of those things that broke it down and told us what was in it and I did, did my report.  Part of my report was part of the reason that they banned fishing for a number of years in Washington, D.C. because the heavy metals that we pulled out of those fish were extremely high.  So, that was, that's, that was my college education.  So I got my science credits that way.  So it was always interesting the people I was hanging out with.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was an unusual college experience. I must say, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in my house in Sherman Oaks, California.
Speaker 1: And this is a continuation of an interview we started last spring, I believe it was, last June [sic. April 26, 2005].
Speaker 2: Yes it was, last June I think.
Story_ID: 417362
Speaker 1: Well, we left you in 1972--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you just graduated from Antioch College, you were living with the Silbergelds [Ellen Sibergeld and Alan Mark Sibergeld]--.
Speaker 2: Silbergelds. And I moved to, after that, I moved to New York City [New York, New York] and got into my second union after being in Actors' Equity [Actors' Equity Association], in the hack union for New York City cab drivers.  So for, I guess that next summer, and this is all starts to get a little foggy for me but I was a cab driver.  I drove in New York City, the daytime shift for about three months.  It was absolutely crazy, but it was enjoyable.  I learned a lot.  I watched people.  I--one of my great stories was this guy jumped into my cab and said, "Go, go, go."  Of course, you know, the classic and he was drunk and he had a kitchen knife about a foot long and he's like, go, and all of a sudden I turn in my rearview mirror and I see this guy picking up a garbage can getting ready to throw it at the cab and I stepped on the gas with the door open, he closed the door as we sped off.  Now, I was a little, of course weirded out with this guy in the back seat with a knife and my window open and he starts saying, I just hit the number and I am, everybody's trying to get my money from me and take me to this, he gave me an address and, of course, I got lost.  The first time I ever had gotten lost.  I was, it was a Bronx [New York] address but I was lost in Manhattan [New York] up on 138th Street and I just--but I have to say, he got out of the cab and gave me a big tip and that was fine.  My other great cab story was picking Sidney Poitier up on 34th Street coming across 34th Street in rush hour and Sidney said, "I need to get to the Americana up on 50th Street and Broadway as quickly as possible." And I said, "Mr. Poitier, if you need to get up there, I'd advise you to get out of my cab and get on a subway because that's the only way you're going to get there fast."  He sat back and actually Sidney and I've talked many times since, so that was fun, but here I was the, twenty, I guess twenty-two-year old cab driver in New York City.
Story_ID: 417363
Speaker 1: I worked for another group called Hospital Audiences Incorporated [Healing Arts Initiative, Inc.], where I booked shows to go into, into hospitals, in geriatric wards and prisons.  One of the acts I would book all the time-I was watching the Bob Dylan retrospective last night and Odetta [HistoryMaker Odetta Gordon] was one of the people he looked up to and he talked about and Odetta was one of our acts that I would take into prisons and we would do, I did that for a summer, which was actually quite interesting and then somewhere about, I guess the next year, I decided I, I decided to go to--. I was walking the streets, not having a thing to do, not knowing what I was doing and I said to myself, I got to do something.  So I was walking down the street on 7th Street and Sati Jamal, who's a friend of mine from Washington, D.C., was graduating NYU [New York University, New York, New York] in the directing program and he said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], what are you up to?  What are you doing?"  And I said, "Ah, I don't know what I'm doing."  He said, "Well, they're having auditions for the directing program at NYU, why don't you go in there?" And I said, "Oh, that sounds like a good idea, I'm not doing anything else."  So I went inside, I went upstairs, I said, "Okay, I want to audition for the directing program at NYU." And they said, "Okay, you need to have a scene that you've directed and we can give you an appointment this afternoon around three or four o'clock." And I said, "How about giving me twenty-four hours to get a scene together."  So, I had written a one-act play and that night I found some actors, two actors, gave them the script, we rehearsed it that night, we rehearsed it the next morning, I came in the next day, the next afternoon, I didn't know what I was doing.  I was just like hanging on and they, I remember they skipped a big part of the play while they were reading it, they got lost, but I survived it.  I got through it and Carl Weber, who was the directing teacher at the time, he accepted me.  So I decided, okay, I was going to go to NYU.  At the time I had a girlfriend who was in medical school and she was getting ready to go to medical school so she was going to go to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  I always tell this story, and I was always saying well, I'm the man of the, you know, the household so I'm going to NYU, you got accepted at NYU medical school [New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York], why don't you come to NYU medical school and she said, no.  Now it's probably the bigger reason why she was going to Yale.  So, she went to Yale, I went to NYU but when I was, was up at Yale dropping her off, I walked into the Yale Drama School [Yale School of Drama, New Haven, Connecticut] and I said to the Yale Drama School, this was in September, I said, "Okay, my name's Oz Scott, I'm a directing student, I've been accepted to NYU but you need me here." And they said, "Okay."  They said, "You can start in two weeks."  Then they went through this whole thing about what they weren't doing.  This was right after the whole black theatre movement and they said, we are not a, we are a Shakespearean, a European theatre, we do not do black theatre, we do not do agitprop, we do not do revolutionary theatre, we do not do--they kept telling me all the things they did not do.  I said, well, I guess you don't do Oz Scott [HistoryMaker Oz Scott] either, so I went to NYU.
Story_ID: 417364
Speaker 1: At NYU [New York University, New York, New York], I, I worked--I think the one person that I worked with at NYU that really sort of, that helped my career, was Edgar White.  Edgar White was very, very instrumental in starting me off.  I stage managed for Edgar White at NYU.  Edgar White, later that year, my first year at NYU, got a play at the Public Theater [New York, New York] and he told Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] that he wanted--he actually--was a very strange thing.  He had two directors, Dennis Tate and, oh, there was a woman.  It was like a three-hour play, two, two acts.  I think it was, it was probably 'La Gente' [Edgar White], L-A, G-E-N-T-E, 'La Gente' and it was two acts that, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Oz Scott I want to be my stage manager." So Joe said, "Okay."  So, and we were going to do it in the parks and one of those trucks.  So, I think I was making $150 a week plus $50 to drive the truck and we were going into the parks.  And I started working for Joe Papp at that point.  I did 'Crucificado' ['The Crucificado,' Edgar White] with, with Edgar there.  We did 'La Gente,' did a number of, of plays, stage managing.  I was stage managing.  I remember Edgar with his dark sunglasses and his flute.  He didn't really talk to directors but he talked to me to tell the director what he thought should be happening and so I sort of became the communications with Edgar.  So we, later on, years later, I had the pleasure of directing a play with Madge Sinclair and Vondie Curtis-Hall and a number of actors that we did at Henry Street [Henry Street Settlement; Henry Street Playhouse, New York, New York] many years later.  So, this is all very hard remembering way back then, but it's all quite interesting.  So, Edgar--so I worked for Joe Papp and I was going to NYU at the same time and NYU was real interesting because I, I went to NYU and I said, "Okay, I want to be, I want to take film, I want to take theatre." And NYU said, "Well, we really don't have a reciprocal with the film school but, if you can find a teacher in the film school that will let you audit a class, great, we'll do, you can do that."  I found the, it turns out a friend of mine was dating the, the first year advisor for the graduate film program for the incoming students and he told me, "Oz, you can audit the entire year."  So, I ended up, the first year at NYU doing all my theatre courses as my major in theatre.  I did all the film courses as my major in film and I looked at my theatre courses for film as my electives and I looked at my film courses for my theatre as the electives.  So I had an extremely full schedule.  I made a, I had to make a film.  I did everything the first year film students did.  I did everything the first year directing theatre students did.  I took my dance classes.  I took my design classes.  I took, I just took everything and it was great.  It was, for me, it was a wonderful way of merging a, a great institution, everything they had to offer, and I think for a long time I probably was the only person who had really managed to do it.
Story_ID: 417365
Speaker 1: I survived one year doing it, and the second year [at New York University (NYU), New York, New York] I went to my film teachers, Beta Baca [ph.] who was my camera teacher and Ian Maitland who was editing and I said, "Guys, I gotta make a choice," because they said, "Are you going to stay in film or you going to stay in theatre?" Everybody, both departments were wide open to me and both of them said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], get a good editor and get a good DP [director of photography].  They can help you learn the camera.  They can help you learn the techniques that you need." Beta said, "Come and take my color emulsion class, I do it five weeks, five, five seminars.  After that, he said, you can learn the camera within a year or two.  It's going to take you a lifetime to learn the actors so it's best to start now."  And so I stayed in theatre.  I mean, that and the fact that theatre program, to get a master's [degree], was a two-year program and film was a three-year program, I figured, two years, and I thought it was very good because I, it was learning the actors, it was working with actors which I still think is a very strong element to my directing.  So, so the second year I was doing a lot of stage managing for Joe Papp [Joseph Papp].  I did a play by Miguel Pinero called 'The Sun Always Shines for the Cool' which becomes a whole another story because I got a, I was hanging out with Ifa [Ifa Bayeza], guess what her name, at this, now her name is Ifa Bayeza, who's [HistoryMaker] Ntozake Shange's sister and Ifa introduced me to Ntozake and Ntozake, and Ifa said, "Why don't you take, why don't you give Oz your poems and let him make 'em into a play."  And so Ntozake gave me her poems and we set about making them into a play.  I said, "Zake, I will make them into a play but you have to get me a venue.  Get me a venue, I'll give you a award-winning play."  I was very cocky back then and she came back to me the next day and she had gotten a bar on the Lower East Side [New York, New York], a Puerto Rican bar on the Lower East Side without a door between the back room and the bar where they served the fried chicken and they, it was like a block up from where Slugs' [Slugs' Saloon] had been on--in Alphabet City [New York, New York] and we did--Del Monte's was the bar, and we proceeded to do 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange].  That December, we had two, she had gotten two Saturday nights--.
Speaker 2: Now, now what year is this?
Speaker 1: This is 1975.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I graduated NYU in 1974 and, I mean, so we ended up doing the first part of 'For Colored Girls' in 1975, December.
Story_ID: 417366
Speaker 1: I tell the story that in February, we were at Henry Street [Henry Street Settlement; Henry Street Playhouse, New York, New York] doing it ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] came to see it there, he actually, I did a reading for Joe Papp in the little theatre at the Public Theater [New York, New York].  Joe went to Woodie King [HistoryMaker Woodie King, Jr.] and said, "Okay, Woodie, I'll help you produce 'For Colored Girls'." And he was going to pay the women $100 a week.  Woodie, of course, paid very little.  He paid, I guess, $25 for bus fare and he said, "Oh, they can't pick that money up in my theatre.  I don't want anybody thinking that I pay actors."  So, they had, we had, everybody had to go to the Public Theater to pick up their checks but we did it at Henry Street.  One of the stories I tell, even in December, I was, when I was, I was stage managing, 'The Sun Always Shines For The Cool' [Miguel Pinero], it was really interesting because I would, once I get the actors out in 'The Sun Always Shines,' I'd get those actors out at eight o'clock, nine o'clock at night and then I'd bring, 'For Colored Girls' in and so we would rehearse for Del Monte's at, we would rehearse at the Public Theater.  They had a space across the street in a building that they were actually tearing down.  They were renovating this building so I used to sweep out the concrete and give us a space in the middle of this, this tear-down and we were rehearsing 'For Colored Girls' there.  One of the things when we were at Henry, before, well even at Henry Street, where we were really trying to get it together, we needed a, we never had a, we couldn't rehearse.  Everybody was working.  You had one person was a waitress, one person was a school teacher, everybody had different hours.  So I said to everybody, I need to see a run-through.  We gotta do a run-through and they said, I said, "When is everybody free for a five-hour block?"  The only time everybody was free for a five-hour block was from midnight 'til five in the morning.  So, for three nights, midnight to five in the morning, we rehearsed, we did run-throughs.  'For Colored Girls,' ended up running an hour and fifteen minutes, an hour and fourteen minutes, if it was fast, an hour and seventeen minutes if it was slow but it was a very tight hour and seventeen minutes.  The first time we ran 'For Colored Girls' I remember that night, that first night, it must have run two and a half to three hours.  They were trying to hit every single word and every single moment, they, everything we had talked about, everything I directed, everything was there.  They were trying to nail it and after that first run-through, I just looked at everybody, said, "Forget what I directed, forget--," you know, we, I said, "If they want to read the script, let them buy the book and take it home but we have to give them the emotion of this play." And 'For Colored Girls,' it was actually quite interesting.  I mean, I've got so many stories about 'For Colored Girls.'  I have the story about this guy who said, I came to see 'For Colored Girls' three times because I hated it that much.  I wanted to make sure I hated it as much as I did the first time and we proceeded to talk about it for hours.  For me that was great.  I enjoyed having somebody that passionate about the play.  Some people said 'For Colored Girls' was, the women were, you know, they were angry and I turned to the women, I'd always told the women, I said, you have to do this play out of love, a love for this, this man, a love for this relationship.  If you hate him, get up and walk away but if you love him, you stay and you talk.  And so we, and so that's kind of for me how 'For Colored Girls' came to be.  Ifa [Ifa Bayeza] and I sat down every day as we were putting 'For Colored Girls' together even in the bar and saying okay, okay.  Ifa knew all her sister's poems.  I said, I need a poem and I would describe the type of feeling, the type of thing and Ifa would go and she'd give me three poems and said, here, here's three poems to choose from.  I'd pick one of those poems and then Ifa would actually, you know, even, she even wrote a few incidental, you know, we'd do some improvs and Ifa would compile those together and, Ntozake [HistoryMaker Ntozake Shange] , we all, we all worked very hard and very, very closely on it.  Zake was in the play.  As she used to say, "You kept cutting my poems down to, where I only had one and a half poems."  I said, "What is the half poem?"  She said, "The one you put all that music over."  So, we did that and, oh, the 'For Colored Girls' stories, I can go on and probably do three hours just on that.
Story_ID: 417367
Speaker 1: Now you know, there was a big stir all around the country around 'Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange]--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when it finally hit, you know, and I remember when it came to Chicago [Illinois] in 1977, I think it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there was a forum held at Kuumba Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that included [HistoryMaker] Clarence Page, [HistoryMaker] Val Gray Ward was there, people, you know, debating whether or not it was bashing black men or not or, you know, it was so many ideas about it, so.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was, I remember not being there but that was, that was, I remember, I remember it was a big, big brouhaha in, in Chicago about that.  So, and, of course, one of the most important things that happened while I was doing 'For Colored Girls' was, when we brought it to the Mark Taper Forum [Los Angeles, California] out here, I met my wife, Lynne Scott, Lynne Yearwood [Lynne Yearwood Scott] at the time, and she became very much a part of my life.  As I said, we had been married twenty-seven years as of October 1st.  She, I was, so she was really there in the beginning when we were, I was taking 'For Colored Girls' to California.  I met her here.  She was living in Washington, D.C.  I told her, I'm cosmopolitan.  She said, I'm, she wasn't into long distance relationships.  I said, I live in New York [New York], you live in D.C.  I can get on a plane, I'm cosmopolitan, I can fly anywhere and that lasted 'til about March when I said, this is getting old, you need to move to New York or we're just going to have to call this thing off.  And she said, okay, and I said, wait, wait, wait and she said, but you got to get an apartment first.  Well, that's the other thing.  I hadn't had an apartment in two years (laughter).  I was getting a check for about two to four, between two and four thousand dollars a week back in 1977 so you can imagine, I was in heaven, and I guess when one girlfriend would throw me out, I always had my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] in Mount Vernon [New York] as backup but we ended up doing that.

Speaker 1: Boy, I even skipped the real important moment for me, which was back at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] when I graduated, I had to do the--my senior--my, my graduating thesis which was really, Reginald VelJohnson had written a play--we went to college together.  He wrote a play that was, I want to say it was three hundred pages long, it was three hundred pages long and I proceeded to make cuts, make trims, I had a fabulous cast.  I had, I had, oh, at the time it was Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, we had a number of--Carl Crudup, it was a wonderful group of actors.  It was really in being, to have your senior thesis and it was great because upstairs at NYU they had this big space and I set it up, set up the seating actually, two sides, like bleachers because I used the basketball court and it was a boys prison, it was called 'Section D, The Boys Prison' [ph.].  Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs about, I want to say three days before we opened, three or four days before we opened at NYU, got a call to do 'Cooley High' and he looked at me, he said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], I gotta go," and I just didn't want to stand in his way.  It's a major motion picture.  I said, "Good luck."  So here I am hanging my head trying to figure out how, and he had a huge part, a huge part.  I mean, yes, it started three hundred pages, we trimmed it down to about one hundred--I trimmed it, I trimmed it down to one hundred pages but it was still a huge part for this one actor and I was like, what do I do?  Woe is me, what do I do?  And somebody said, "There's this actor who just moved here from Baltimore [Maryland] and why don't you ask him?" And they said, "Howard Rollins." And I said, "Oh, I know Howard Rollins."  Back in Washington [D.C.], I had met Howard and Howard and I used to hang out a little bit.  We've known each other back in Washington.  So I called Howard and he said, "I'll do it." And Howard, in two to three days, memorized this entire script and he walked on and he was brilliant and it was that moment, for me, it was that moment that I knew I was a director because Howard was great, Carl Crudup, I mean, it was just a wonderful, it just, it just blew it through the roof for me, and at that moment I knew I was a director.

Speaker 1: So, getting back to 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], I was in, in New Orleans [Louisiana], a friend of mine who I had worked with as an assistant editor many, a couple of years earlier, Nancy Baker, whose boyfriend, Fred Arnano [ph.], who was my, who was the freshman advisor for, at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], who had let me take the film classes, was editing a film called, 'Dreamland' and it was a documentary that they had started about the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and halfway through shooting this film, they realized they had a lot of footage about Mardi Gras but they had no footage about, there was no point of view.  So they hired a woman called, whose name was Lady B.J.  Everybody knows her now as B.J. Crosby who was in the, a Broadway play, oh, it starred, the, yes, you know the play, who wrote 'Hound Dog,' who wrote all those--it was--oh, anyway, but B.J., so they had done all this shooting with B.J.  They shot some stuff with B.J.  They shot some stuff with B.J. after she was pregnant, while she was pregnant, before she was pregnant, no, no, they shot stuff with B.J. before she was pregnant, they shot stuff with B.J. when she was pregnant.  So now, all of a sudden, they realized they had a person to go around but they had no story.  So they called me up and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], would you come in and help us find a story, direct a story?"  So, they said, "And we only have four days to shoot."  So they send me to New Orleans, with a camera crew, and it was a couple wonderful, wonderful scenes in there and one of the wonderful people that was in there who was the piano player was Henry Butler.  He's a blind piano player out of New Orleans and he's a fabulous person, a fabulous piano player and B.J. and him were great together.  When they did the filming of it, they actually had fired Henry Butler and they had that on film, the firing of Henry Butler and I said, "Guys, the story is, I want to put Henry Butler and B.J. back together."  So I went down there and I said, "Okay, okay, okay, this is a documentary but we're going to make scenes up." And I would say to B.J., you and your manager, I want the scene in your house and I want you kind of talking about this and then I put B.J. with her, did you want to cut here for a second?  Sorry--
Speaker 2: You're too good at this.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: They, so we had B.J. and her mother.  This was, this was fabulous.  I said to B.J.'s mother--I mean we had the cameras there ready to shoot and I wanted some conflict and I said, "Okay, B.J. wants to go to Hollywood to be a star.  She wants to be a singer.  She wants to go off." B.J.'s a wonderful gospel singer.  B.J. was, B.J.'s fabulous and she's a brilliant singer.  So, so what happens, the mama says, "Well, if she wants to go off to, if she wants to be a singer, that's great.  If she wants to be, whatever B.J. wants, "Joanna, I probably shouldn't tell, but--whatever Joanna wants, Joanna can have."  And I said, "What about her taking your grandson to Hollywood?"  All of a sudden mama just went off and she said, "God gave you that voice to sing for Him.  He didn't give you that voice and you can't be taking the baby." And they got into it and it was wonderful.  I mean, it was really, it was very cathartic for B.J. and, of course, I was saying, roll, roll, roll the cameras and we got some wonderful stuff.  We did that film, it did the festival circuit, it did quite well.  They never put it out but it was actually, actually a pretty good film.  So we did that.
Story_ID: 325281
Speaker 1: My wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] and I, we're in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I get a call from Sean Daniels, who at the time was vice--one of the vice presidents in Universal [Universal Pictures] and Sean says, "We have a," I think it was Sean or Thom Mount or Ned Tanen, but I think it was Sean Daniels, but, "We have a film called 'Family Dreams' with Richard Pryor and Cicely Tyson, would you be interested in directing it?"  And I said, the one thing I learned in film school was the term, I have to read the script first.  Of course, when I hung up the phone, I started screaming, "I got a film, got a feature." I, they FedExed it to me, well I mean not a FedEx, there was no FedEx back then, they messengered it to me, I read the script, they flew me out to Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] and I called a friend of mine up, he came over to the hotel, we were sitting there drinking champagne, we had a limo downstairs, we were overlooking the valley in the governor's suite with Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], Reagan's picture over my window, over my bed and he put his arm around me and he looked out over Universal, over the valley, over the San Fernando Valley [California] and he said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], just remember, one day all this still won't be yours," and I remember that.  I also remember him saying to me, "Oz, just remember another thing, don't take it personally 'cause it really isn't about you." And that's something I always tell people, "It's not about you."  So, we, we did, so I took the film and 'Bustin' Loose' becomes an entire saga because Richard--Roger Simons [Roger L. Simon] was the first writer, then they brought Lonne Elder [Lonne Elder III] in to do a rewrite, then they didn't like that rewrite so Richard Pryor wanted, Richard and I were going to do a rewrite.  Richard and I had a little falling out and so he decided to do the rewrite himself.
Story_ID: 325282
Speaker 1: What was Richard Pryor like in those days?  Now, he was at pretty much the height of his public popularity I would think (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think he was.  Yeah, and as somebody said, but I think it was really the height because somebody said to me later, "Did you ever think that with every subsequent Richard Pryor movie, yours would become more and more a classic?" Because 'Bustin' Loose,' I think was, you know, right there at the top of the heap and also 'Bustin' Loose,' Richard Pryor said to me, said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], I have a problem with women.  I have a problem with children. And I really want to use this film to sort of explore those things," and I thought that was an interesting thing.  And so we had a good time working on it.  So, so 'Bustin' Loose,' we, we started to work on--I remember Thom Mount, we walked into Thom's office, Richard Pryor, after he had done his rewrite.  I think the pages stopped counting at 157 and all I remember is Thom Mount, who's I guess still the vice president [of Universal Pictures] at the time, Thom Mount sort of weighed the script, didn't even read it and handed it to me, and said, "Oz, cut out about thirty, forty pages," and I think--
Speaker 1: Weighed it?
Speaker 2: Just weighed.  I don't know if it was Thom or Ned Tanen who did it and Richard just like, he was, he was pissed.  So, I went into my office and I sat there and I started to do a rewrite and cleanup and cutting it down and trimming it and I remember the line producer at the time taking the script--I remember finishing, getting all the way through it and I got up to take a walk just to clear my head so that I could go back and look at it again and when I got back to my office, I found that he had taken it off my desk, had published it, sent it upstairs and they gave us a green light.  They said, "Okay, go ahead with it," and I said, "Guys, wait a second, stop, I haven't even read it over.  I haven't done a, you know, really thought it out." And they said, "Go for it."  So we started shooting, really with the script that I didn't think was complete.
Speaker 1: Now was this the one that Richard Pryor rewrote, basically, or was it the collaboration of everybody?
Speaker 2: This was everybody's.  I took everybody's rewrite and myself and I just--
Speaker 1: And you kind of--
Speaker 2: I just sort of merged it all together and put it together and--
Speaker 1: This is 1980?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979], okay, 'cause the movie was released in '81 [1981].
Speaker 2: It was 1980.
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981], yeah.
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981], something like--so Richard and I, so we, so we started.  We moved, we went up to Seattle, Washington, started shooting, shooting the film and the script that we ended up with, because Richard would do a different, he'd just do a different scene each take.  It was, he would, he would improvise.  He would do the script once and then he'd do something on top of that and then something on top of that and I remember the start-up script is about this big.  By the time we were through, we handed, the script supervisor handed in the script that big.  It was that thick of every take that Richard, and she had to sit there and write up what he was saying at the time.
Speaker 1: So is that the way you planned to do it?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I thought we had a gimme.  I thought, I mean I didn't think we had the perfect script but we had a script close enough.
Story_ID: 325283
Speaker 1: How did these things happen?  I mean, you're director and what most people think as a director, you know, he says, hey, this is the script--
Speaker 2: And they'll shoot it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --you do it like this and let's shoot it.
Speaker 2: You got, you've got Richard Pryor who was a great comedian and one of the great things about Richard is, his spontaneity. And the way I felt that I wanted to do it I wanted his spontaneity.  I wanted to see where he was going to take it.  I didn't want to lock him in or time it and I think Richard got mad at me, at times, for turning to him and saying sometimes, "I don't know where you're going to go."  "So, what do you mean, you don't know where--."  I said, "I don't know where you're going to go.  Try it.  Let's see what happens.  I know how to cut around.  I know how to make the scene work.  I've got enough material here, let's do it again."  And it was one time, and there were some scenes in the film where Richard did not tell me, even though he would sit there and say, you know, "I want structure, I want structure," all of a sudden Richard would come in and say, "The kid is burning up," he has-- one of the kids, is a pyromaniac.  It turns out Richard told me the story that he was a pyromaniac as a kid.  That he started a fire in his parents' front, in his, in the front yard of the house he was living in and he said, "Nobody knows that it was me that started it but I started it."  So that was, and there was, many of the kids that were facets of Richard Pryor in them.  So--
Speaker 1: So this is prior to him actually catching on fire himself, right?
Speaker 2: This is prior--
Speaker 1: Just before?
Speaker 2: This is right before, this is--actually, there are scenes in 'Bustin' Loose' shot after he burnt himself and the majority of the film is shot before he burnt himself.  So Richard took his, told this kid, oh, went to the prop guy, didn't tell me, so he is like, he runs in there, the kid's lighting matches, throwing them into a, into a haystack and he comes running in there and he said, "What are you doing?"  He grabs his hat and he starts beating, beating the flame out with his hat.  He puts the hat back on and he starts yelling at the kid and the hat is in flames and I'm like, "Stop, wait a second, cut, cut, cut." And Richard said, "No, no, no, I planned it."  He had gone to the prop guy and said, put some Sterno in my hat but he didn't tell anybody.  I said, "Richard, you got to tell me.  You don't have to tell everybody but tell me.  I'm the one who says, cut."  So I said, "Okay, let's do it again."  Then that's, it's in the film.  There were scenes, there was another scene where he turns to the kid, of course didn't tell me, and he says to the kid, to one of these other kids, he said, "Okay, I want you to--when I--I'm going to, I'm going to turn and I'm going to slap you and you're going to pretend like I hit you and you're going to just take the hit," and he didn't tell me.  Well, the kid got into the scene and the kid lunged at Richard when Richard had planned to hit and the kid came and took the hit squarely.  He did a 360 and flap, flat on his face, on the ground.  The kid's uncle who was standing there was ready to jump.  I'm like going, oh, I decided to like, to stay focused, keep the cameras rolling, don't stop, let everybody calm down before the whole place erupts.  Richard, we take, the camera takes him to the steps of the bus and I say, "Okay, cut."  Richard is freaked.  Richard's like, I never, you know, I, no, I don't hit kids, I didn't, you know, I didn't, this was not the way it was supposed to be and I said--and I remember this kid who's, Puerto Rican kid, coming over, 'cause I hired kids right off the street.  I, half those kids never acted before and they were just kids we just had gone to schools and brought in and the kid came over to Richard and said, "Richard, I'm a tough Puerto Rican, you got to be tough with me."  He said, "Now that was acting."  The kid actually, I think for the next two days had a back problem 'cause he did wrench himself pretty bad. But one of the girls in the film, I could never figure out how to make it funny and I didn't want to make it funny.  She was, we had found her, she was a gymnast and she had one leg, she had an amputated leg and she had a fake leg and if you look at it you'll see her limping but I never used it 'cause I, you know, we were going, "Oh, should Richard find her leg and freak out?"  And I just said, "No."  I never used it but then we had a blind kid who's really blind and I think he was taking--he was doing the job to get the eyelid sewed or whatever, whatever happens there and we had, we just had kids.
Story_ID: 325284
Speaker 1: I mean Gary Dourdan, who's on 'CSI' ['CSI: Crime Scene Investigation']; one of the kids, Alphonso [Alphonso Alexander], who played the black kid [in 'Bustin' Loose'], was his best friend growing up, and Gary tells the story, "I was so impressed that my friend had gone and done a movie that that's one of the reasons I wanted to be an actor 'cause I wanted to do that, too."
Speaker 2: But his friend never went on to do anything else.
Speaker 1: His friend never went on, no, no.  A bunch of the kids, I think--one of the kids played for football for Syracuse [Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York].  Alphonso, Gary tells me is in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] running a business.  There was two actors in there, oh God.  There was a young girl who played a Vietnamese child prostitute.  She was in that mix, and the great story was when she came in to audition for us she told, she signed in and told everybody she was twelve years old.  I want to say, she looked twelve years old and I looked at her and everybody said, oh, okay, and she auditioned, she was good, and I said to her, "How old are you really?"  And everybody stopped and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], why you saying that to her?"  I said, "I'm asking her." And they said--"Well, I'm actually fifteen."  I said, "What about high school?"  "I graduated early."  I said, "Okay."  Well, we hired her.  Fly her to Seattle [Washington] and she comes by herself.  And so I take her aside and I say, "Okay, I need to know how old you really are."  And she says, "I'm nineteen," and I said, "Okay, I want you to hang with the kids, be with the kids, don't hang with the adults 'cause I really want you to be one of the kids." And she said, "Okay."  I figured out, found out at the end of the movie, she was twenty-nine years old.  She had been on Broadway, in 'Chorus Line' ['A Chorus Line'] for three or four years at the time, so, we had stories.
Story_ID: 325285
Speaker 1: The best story for me was the night we were supposed to shoot the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] scene, which is actually classic and when 'Entertainment Tonight' started, there were two images that they used in their montage of film and television and theatre.  I had two images on 'Entertainment Tonight' for that first year, which was the Klan scene with Richard Pryor and the, and, 'For Colored Girls' [For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange].  So, the night we were supposed to shoot the Klan scene, everybody had tried to write, how do you make the Klan funny?  Nobody could figure out how to make the Klan funny.  What words do you put in their mouth to make them funny?  And I had a scene that just did not work.  I knew it didn't work.  We, everybody knew it didn't work.  So, I got out, I, everybody, the producer turned to me and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], you got to shoot the scene right now."  And I said, "Okay, everybody take ten minutes, I'll be back." And they said, "What do you mean, take ten minutes."  Well, what do you mean, I said take ten, take fifteen, I'll be back.  I walked off into the woods, trying to figure out how do I make the scene funny.  I come to a fork in the road, on a deserted road, and I said, I got it, I got it.  I run all the way back, I said, everybody bring the equipment here, come on, come on, come on.  I said, "Okay, Richard, you are walking down this road and you are the baddest mother, in the entire--." I said, "This is like you are on the worst street of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I want you to feel like that."  I said, you are, and he starts walking down the street, a road, and we had a, I'm on a western dolly and I'm pulling Richard, I'm pulling Richard and he's talking about, "Bitch going to send me to get a mother fucking piece of push." The bus is stuck in, in the mud, they can't get out, he's looking for help, he's walking down, cursing everybody out, but acting like he is the, he's making that swagger like he is, he's bad, and he's walking down and he's walking down, I bring up the Klan with the torches and the flags and the hoods and they're walking, they're walking and this is, and what you see in the movie--in 'Bustin' Loose'--the first take was the take we used with Richard.  It just timed out so perfectly.  Richard falls right into it and just turns to the Klan and says, "Bitch is going to send me to get a piece of push," and all of a sudden he looks and he realizes he is leading the Klan down the road and he just pulls his hat over his face and he walks off and we had just run out of room right then, he walked right off camera with the Klan following him.
Story_ID: 325286
Speaker 1: Cut to the bus.  Again, this is all made up.  I don't have a clue what, what's going on.  I don't know what I'm doing.  I'm just saying, okay, let's try this.  The words Richard [Richard Pryor] is coming up with on the spot.  I'm just--again, this is sort of like 'Dreamland' back in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I'm coming up with, "Here's the situation, I don't know what you're going to say, but here's the situation."  So, it turns out, I had the blind kid sitting in the front seat and Richard pulls the, has the Klansman come on with the hood and the Klansman comes on, Richard comes on behind, and I said, "Okay, oh, I got it, I got it, I got it."  I told the blind kid to reach up and grab the sheet off the Klansman and pull it off, de- defrock him; and I said, "Richard," and then I said, "all the kids, you're all blind."  And so, so Richard started, he said, "Okay," he, he's like, they start, and he said, "They're blind, they're all blind, they're all blind," and he gets the Klansman off, you know, off the bus and at this point I, I was lost.  I said, "Richard, I don't have a clue what you're going to say now.  Say something to him, but we've got the scene.  I can cut the scene this way," and Richard right there, on the spot, without, was not the night before, we just, I just created that scene right there on the spot.  He said, "We're on our way to the Ray Charles Institute for the Blind to get that miracle operation.  They've been running it on the Oral Roberts show, and I know they run it in your area," (laughter) and I had this old stuntman as playing the Klansman and he said, "Okay, get back on the bus, get on the bus; we'll give you a push."  And Richard looks at him, and this is Richard, and he just says, "You're a great American and great human being.  Thank you," and he gets on the bus.  The place falls out.  The crew is just rolling.  I mean it's just a brilliant, brilliant moment and I said to Richard, "Do it again."  Richard goes off.  "Oh, Mr. Director wants me to do it again.  Oh, I'm going to do it again because Mr. Director wants me to do it."  And he was furious because he had got it.  He knew he had nailed it.  So he gets on there, he does the same line, "You're a great American and a great human being," and then he grabs the Klansman by the head and he pulls him to him and gives him a mouth-to-mouth kiss; and the poor Klansman you could just see him, the actor went (makes sound) (laughter) and Richard gets on the bus and the place just, I mean, it erupted with applause.  It was just, and Richard turned to me as he walked off the bus and said, "So you knew, fuck you," and he walked to his (gesture)--what I knew was he had to top himself.  I didn't know how he was going to top what he had done, which was already brilliant, but he, he did it, he topped it.  There are scenes in the film where I have told Richard, when he's walking off the back of the bus, I said, "Oh, Richard, I got this idea, this is great.  When you go to get the, I want you to go off the back of the bus," and I said, "somebody give me a shovel, give me a shovel."  So I started digging a ditch and I poured water in it and mud and I said, "Richard, when you jump down, you're going to go down into this water and you're going to fall and you're going to flop around and you're going to be all--." "Oh, and you think that's funny.  The, I'm going to fall in the mud.  You think that's funny."  Richard walked, he's walking down the bus talking about, "F him, F you, F you," (makes sounds) and he was talking about me.  I kept it in the film.  I'm like, and he goes off and he does the whole flopping around and he's great.  He's just, you know, so, 'Bustin' Loose' we did that.  Richard burnt himself up.  Scenes were shot after they were in the film; and that's 'Bustin' Loose.'
Story_ID: 325287
Speaker 1: Was it tough working with Richard Pryor in those days and apparently he was, he was using drugs heavily, and was he--
Speaker 2: Well the word, the word is, and I never witnessed anything, was that, I guess--
Speaker 1: He's like written about it himself, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah I think, I think he started, I think he is free basing while we were shooting the film ['Bustin' Loose'].  There was a lot of paranoia, there was a lot of stuff.  I think the other, there was another great story, was Vincent Price came down to do--to play a bum in the film, and one thing I had told Richard, and Vincent's only going to be there for two days, and I told Vincent, Vincent, don't read the script.  Please do not read the script 'cause it's not going to be what we do. And we were shooting the scene and Vincent was like, sat there during the first take, and Richard just was talking, talking, talking, and Vincent just--and after, you know, I said, "Cut."  And I went to, and what Richard was trying to do was he was just trying to do his lines but Vincent came over and says, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], I didn't listen to you.  I memorized my lines.  If you could just give me the cue line, I could say my line."  So, I said, I went to Richard, I said, "Richard, come on, you got to help the guy out, come on, at least give him the cue line."  So, the next take, they're sitting on this, on one of the bus, this is in the bus where the bus is being stored in one of these warehouses and they're sitting there.  So Richard starts doing all his lines and Richard starts going and going and he, and you would see Richard trying to find a cue line to give him but he can't remember any cue lines.  So he keeps going and Vincent decides, well, if he's not going to give me my cue lines, I'm just going to do all my lines as a monologue.  So Vincent's doing a monologue here, Richard's doing his, his thing, that has, they're not talking to each other at all.  I mean, we finally got it, the scene worked, it never made it in the film but it was hysterical but, so we just, I mean, so we had a good time.
Story_ID: 325288
Speaker 1: Cicely Tyson was in that movie, too.  How was it to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cicely Tyson was wonderful in there.  We had a great time.  I remember I was, there were some scenes that were cut out that Cicely was funny and the studio said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], no, Cicely's not supposed to be funny, Richard's [Richard Pryor] supposed to be funny."  I said, "Guys, come on."  They said, "Oz," this is a phrase I always remember, "Cut to the money."  "Richard's the money, Cicely's not the money, Richard's the money," and I said "But, I got Cicely being funny."  They said, "We don't care, we want Richard to be funny."  So, we did that and then--.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of people said, I just want to throw this out 'cause I know, I've had this discussion with a lot of people and I've heard, I've read it in magazines and stuff that Richard Pryor never really seemed to reach his standup, you know, funniness in a movie and, I know, 'Bustin' Loose' he came, he did some decent stuff in 'Bustin' Loose' and there's another one called 'Which Way Is Up?'--
Speaker 2: 'Which Way Is Up?'
Speaker 1: --where he did some things.
Speaker 2: He was fabulous, yeah.
Speaker 1: But do you have any, any thoughts about why he, you know, the movie stuff never reached the--.
Speaker 2: I think it, I really think that when he did his standup movies, they were, they were fabulous, they're brilliant but Richard, in what I tried to do in 'Bustin' Loose' was allow Richard the room to be himself because a lot of that is, that's what Richard is and when you start to box Richard in, you lose that spontaneity and you lose the essence of Richard.  So, I really do feel that why people--and Cicely Tyson called me about a year ago and she said, "Oz," I said, "Yes," she said, "I just want you to, I just wanted to call you to tell you this--." I mean she called me out of limb, I haven't talked to her in about ten, fifteen years. She said, "When I ask people, when people ask me what my favorite movie is, I ask them, you tell me what your favorite movie of mine is."  And she says, "I'm waiting for them to say 'Miss Jane Pittman' ['The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman'].  I'm waiting for them to say 'Sounder' and they, more than often say, 'Bustin' Loose'." And she said, "I just had to tell you that."  I think, for me, with, with the standup, you got to, you got to open it up.  You got to give them the room to maneuver.  Richard did not like that room because he felt, you know, I'm an actor now and being, but, I think you look at Bernie Mac, you look at some of these guys, what they do is off the cuff.  Chris Rock is great and you can't just sit there and, you can't write a joke.  It's like jazz.  I mean, to try to write down every note, there's a feeling in it.  It's got to go where it goes and I think that for me was always the thing about Richard.  I didn't, I didn't feel a lot of movies allowed him to go wherever he wanted to go.  They were very structured.

Speaker 1: After 'Bustin' Loose,' I had some downtime because there was an actor strike and so there was a period of about, you know--I just didn't work right away.  We ended up--Norman Lear had invited me to come develop a black soap opera and so I was working on developing a black soap opera with Norman Lear which we, it was actually some really good stuff that happened there.  Years later, there was that black soap opera called 'Generations' and I remember looking and saying, Sally Sussman.  She was my secretary when I was putting together the black soap opera and Sally Sussman, seven, eight years later, develops a black soap opera.  I said, hey you know, let's move on.  So, we moved onto--so then I think my television career started up.  Oh, with 'Bustin' Loose,' I have to say--when I married my wife, Lynne [Lynne Yearwoood Scott], she had a son who was about seven, eight years old, and that's Robert, Robert Scott who was, so that was the family that we formed.  When 'Bustin' Loose' happened, we, I always said, I gave, with each contract, I said, let's get a--so we had a baby, Ozzie Scott [Osborne Yearwood Scott], who's now twenty-five years old, just graduated from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] two years ago.  He was born off of 'Bustin' Loose,' after 'Bustin' Loose,' we ended up--so then I think that's on my personal side.
Story_ID: 325290
Speaker 1: Then I ended up going to do television.  One of my deals was with, with Norman Lear.  They gave me 'Archie Bunker's Place.'  That was the spinoff of Carroll O'Connor's of 'All In The Family.'
Speaker 2: 'All In The Family,' right.
Speaker 1: So, I was assigned to do an 'Archie Bunker's Place' and I had tried, I was trying to figure, how do I get into, to the hour television shows and my agent could not get me a meeting on anything. And I knew Mike Warren [Michael Warren], who was on 'Hill Street Blues.'  Mike got me a meeting with Greg Hoblit and I, after--now I've done a major motion picture, and I said, okay, and Greg Hoblit allowed me to watch the shooting of 'Hill Street.'  So I stayed on the set, off and on, for about a month or two--on my own time, being there watching the directors, watching what was going on, and after about, being around for two months, I remember Steven Bochco saw me in the hall one day and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], would you like to do an episode of 'Hill Street,' directing an episode of 'Hill Street'?"  I said, "Yeah, I would."  So, Steven Bochco gave me an episode of 'Hill Street,' I did an episode of 'Hill Street' and 'Archie Bunker's Place' within a week of each other.  So I was doing half hour, an hour, at the same time.
Story_ID: 325291
Speaker 1: I was just asking you about the pace of, you know, directing a show.  How long it takes to do a half hour show.
Speaker 2: A half hour show, it takes five days.  Five days you do--rehearse two days, Mondays, say on a five-day schedule, Monday, Tuesday you rehearse, Wednesday--Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday you rehearse, Thursday camera block and Friday you shoot.  With Bill Cosby on 'The Cosby Show,' Cosby would like to, Cosby wanted his three day weekend.  He said, "If you can't do this in four days, you don't need to be doing it."  So, we come in Monday morning, we'd sit down, ten o'clock, read through the script, by eleven o'clock, Bill was sitting there talking about what was wrong with the script, where it'd need to critique, he would critique the script and then we would sit there for an hour while he critiqued the script and sent the writers off to do a rewrite and that would be about noon.  And one week I wanted to, I was doing, I was directing a play in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So, I would, I told my actors, I said, "I will be on a train by 12:30, I will be here by whatever, two o'clock, we would rehearse from two o'clock on 'til about ten o'clock at night."  So I did a full rehearsal on Monday.  I came back Monday night, got my script waiting for me at my hotel.  Tuesday we rehearsed, Wednesday we camera blocked, Thursday we shot.  I had given my actors three days off, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, which was their normal, you know, I said, instead of the weekend, you're going to take off in the middle of the week.  Friday morning, I read--I went to cut the, cut the footage and Friday afternoon I was back rehearsing with my cast.  So, it was actually fun doing 'The Cosby Show' and those shows were good and the shows were great.  So, and then with, with hour, with an hour show, we'll take seven days to prep it.  It used to be seven days prep, seven days shoot and four days edit.  With 'Hill Street' ['Hill Street Blues'], they had moved to eight days of shooting because we, they wanted more fancy shooting.  They wanted it to look, they wanted more filming.  They wanted more style and shows from 'Hill Street' on, have moved onto eight days, so, seven days prep, eight days shoot and four days edit.
Story_ID: 325292
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from 'The Cosby Show'?  Do you have a favorite episode or a good story from one of the--
Speaker 2: I really only did two, two 'Cosby Shows.'  I was doing a bunch of other things.  Well, let's get to 'The Cosby Show' 'cause I have, this is a couple of years before I get to 'The Cosby Show.'  After doing 'Hill Street' ['Hill Street Blues'] and 'Archie Bunker's Place,' I was sort of in this, I could do hour, I could do half hour, which was a pretty unique position back then.  People were doing it more and more now but back in 1981, that was not done that much.  You were either an hour episodic director or half hour director.  So, I was doing, so a lot of half hours. I did 'Gimme a Break!', I did 'Alice,' I did, I was doing a number of, of half hours and I remember getting a phone call from Norman Lear's company saying, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], we're going to put a new director onto 'The Jeffersons' next year, would you like that job?"  And I said, "Yeah, I'd like it."  And so, I ended up directing 'The Jeffersons' but one of the things I did when I directed 'Jeffersons,' it was a twenty-four episode year.  I said I want to do twenty episodes.  I would like four weeks for myself to do whatever I want to do and a lot of times those four weeks, with, with half hours you do maybe three weeks on, one week off, four weeks on, one week off.  And so I would say, I want a week.  So I might have two weeks off or I'd take three, take two episodes and a week hiatus and I might have three weeks off so I can go off and do another show.  So, I was going off to do 'Alice.'  I was going off to do other different half hour shows and I went off to do--Ralph Waite was doing a series called 'The Mississippi.'  A lawyer going down, it's sort of a 'Matlock,' you know, precursor to 'Matlock.'  A lawyer going down the Mississippi in a steamboat, stopping at ports and being sort of a family lawyer.  So I did, so I did an episode of that and took a couple weeks off to do an episode of that.  For me it was just to keep refreshed.  I didn't want to get stale.  I didn't want to get stuck just doing one show over and over and over again and for me what was great was when I'd come back, I, I mean I worked with Linda Lavin, I worked with, with all these, you know, these, these great actors, great comedians and so I'd come back, I thought I'd come back really fresh and saying, "Well, well, on, on 'The Jeffersons,' on, on 'Alice' we'd do it this way." We'd make that joke work on this, we would this, we do this, we'd do this pratfall.  You know, Martha Raye was on 'Alice' and, you know, Martha Raye would do this and it was just, and I remember one time somebody saying to me, "But, Oz, Oz, that's, that's, you know, that's old."  I said, "It's not about old, it's about what works and this works.  This is comedy." And I remember one thing, one scene I did, I remember my associate director saying, "Oz, that's old, it's, why you doing that?"  I said, "Trust me, it's going to work."  And the following year, that scene was in the credits because it worked.  Yes, it had been done a hundred times or a thousand times, ten thousand times, it doesn't matter, in comedy, when something works, it works, why fix it.
Speaker 1: That's right, they would work over and over again, the same thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: But it's, in the timing really for these things to--
Speaker 2: So I did, I did 'The Jeffersons' for two years.  I did the tenth and eleventh season.  People look at me sometimes, say, you did 'The Jeffersons,' I was in grade school when 'The Jeffersons'--'cause 'The Jeffersons' started like 1975 or '74 [1974], '75 [1975], '76 [1976] and went for eleven years.  It was a long-running show.  I said, guys, you know, I was just getting out of college so don't you know, I was actually in college when 'The Jeffersons' was on so, so that was, you know, so I went on and did that and then after 'The Jeffersons' was over, boy I'm trying to remember what I did after that.  I, I was going around, I did some, I did 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King'.  I was doing hour shows, I was doing half hour shows.
Story_ID: 325293
Speaker 1: I did two movies.  It was funny.  I'm just, I'm just doing 'Just Legal' and one of the young actors in 'Just Legal' who was, [HistoryMaker] Oz Scott, Oz Scott, who's Oz Scott?  Graduated from NYU [New York University, New York, New York] theatre school and she came in one day and said, "Oz Scott."  I said--. "You did one of my favorite films." And I said, "Oh, was it 'Bustin' Loose,' was it this, was it, you know--." And she said, "No, it was 'Mr. Boogedy'." I had done a Disney channel, a Disney, it was a Disney Sunday Night Movie [Disney Sunday Movie], horror film for kids, and actually we did two films.  Richard Masur, Mimi Kennedy, John Astin was in 'Mr. Boogedy.'  We had--Eugene Levy was in the book; 'Bride of Boogedy.'  It was just these, these kids, it was just, they were just these great kid films that, I remember a lot of kids saying, wow, this was a horror film for a kid, though Michael Eisner, when I had one of the kids rising out of a coffin, Michael Eisner says, "Okay, Oz, let's, let's, you know, let's cut it, let's bring it back down."  I had to take part of that scene out but that's what we did.  So, it was, so, so some of the kids look back and say, they talked about 'Mr. Boogedy,' they talked about stuff that I had forgotten about.  I did a couple of movies for NBC that did very well.  I remember Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC, I did a film called, 'Crash Course' with Jackee [HistoryMaker Jackee Harry] and Charlie Robinson [Charles Robinson] and all the kids.  Alyssa Milano, a number of, a number of young actors from all the different shows that they had stuck in and I had thought it was okay, I didn't think it was great and I was kind of embarrassed and I went up to, to--I saw Brandon Tartikoff because the ratings just went through the roof.  It was like a twenty-nine share of, if you know what that's like.  I mean, that's just fabulous and I went to Brandon Tartikoff and I said, "Brandon, you know, I know the film wasn't great."  He said, "Oz, the film was brilliant."  "So, what do you mean it was brilliant?" He said, "Did you see the ratings?"  I said, "Yeah, I saw the ratings."  I said "But, Brandon, you put us on after the All-Star game, you pushed us all week long, you did all this publicity, you just, I mean, how could we not get those numbers?"  And he said, "Oz, no.  Did you watch it from half hour to half hour to half hour to half hour?"  He said, "My job is to get the people in, to tune in.  Your job is to keep 'em there.  Every half hour, those numbers went up.  You did a brilliant job."  And it always reminded me, that's what television's about.  It's about those numbers.  Is it about being good?  Is it about being bad?  No. It's about the numbers.  I did a series--I did a series called 'He's the Mayor' that Kevin Hooks starred in and we were showing the pilot to one of the, one of, you know, where the testing, where they test, and one of the, one of the guys who was Universal's [Universal Pictures] henchman who sat there, well he would sit in the auditions, he would sit, he'd sit in rehearsals, he'd sit and watch it being shot, nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing, and I finally had to say, "Guys, put him in the back row.  You can't put him in the front row.  He's sitting there watching it, not laughing, not smiling."  My actors, I said, "Keep him away."  We went into preview house at the time and preview house is where they'll show a 'Mr. Magoo' cartoon to get the laughter, to get the needles where they want them to be, that's there, that's there sort of the, whatever they call it, their test, and then they will show, show a show. And I watched this man and when the show came on and the needles went up, he was not watching the audience, he was not watching the show, he sat there and watched the needles, those, and as the needles went up, I saw the first smile.  He started to smile, that's for me, a lot of times what Hollywood is.  It's not about whether it's good or bad, it's about those dials; those dials show that people like it.  If people like it, they're happy.
Story_ID: 325294
Speaker 1: So, I did a number of television shows, 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King.'  We did--I did 'The Boogedy' series, I did a bunch of movies.  There was a time that I did have a hard time.  Oh, with 'The Jeffersons,' that was my daughter, Brittany Alessandra Yearwood Scott.  She is a Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] senior this year.  She's graduating from Spelman.  So, those are my three children.  Robert Scott, Ozzie Scott [Osborne Yearwood Scott] and Brittany Scott.  So, I had a slow period because I was beginning to just get into half hour shows and I really wanted, I liked half hours but I wanted more.  I wanted to do hour shows.  I wanted to do films.  I wanted to keep working.  I mean, I still wanted to experiment and see what things were like.  We ended up with--so for about two years, I didn't work, nothing.  I mean when I say nothing, I mean nothing.
Speaker 2: Nothing?  What period of time was this from?
Speaker 1: It was probably from 1989, 1990 to nineteen ninety--maybe 1990 to 1992.  Steven Bochco, after 'Hill Street' ['Hill Street Blues'], we had a bit of a falling out so, but so, it became, it was actually quite interesting.  Richard Wesley, who we partnered up on a series idea, who we took to 20th Century Fox, Fox gave us a two-year deal.  One of their things they said, while you're on the lot, find a producer to, to hook up with and that's a good way of getting your shows on.  So, Steven Bochco was on the Fox lot and I started talking to Steven Bochco about a bunch of things and Steven and I started developing.  We actually were going to, we developed, we did develop a show but I went to David Kelley, who was just starting up his production which was to become 'Picket Fences.'  Steven Bochco gave me an 'L.A.'--he suggested I do an 'L.A. Law' which he really wasn't running at the time, and so I was all of a sudden back in the Bochco camp.  So I did an 'L.A. Law,' I did a 'Civil Wars' and I did a 'Picket Fences' all right, bang, bang, bang.  'Civil Wars' was his, a lost show that Steven Bochco was doing and 'Civil Wars,' after two years, and not having done an hour in a while, all of a sudden I was, it was the fifth episode, I said, okay, it's a safe episode, just to get my feet wet again and get back in the system and about two or three days into it, one of the producers came to me and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], we haven't liked the first one or two episodes, and they're all tied together so we're going to take this fifth episode and it will be the premier of the second season, so make it good."  So I said, "Okay." Excuse me. So I said, "Okay," and I said, "If I'm going to get my feet wet, let's go for it."  It was a, and I will say the reviews were very good.  It was like, they said, if this is what the second season is going to be, we like it.  So, I did 'Civil Wars,' I did 'L.A. Law' and I did 'Picket Fences'--
Story_ID: 325295
Speaker 1: And 'Picket Fences,' I will say, is also--was a wonderful episode I did.  David Kelley--it was the Christmas episode, and David Kelley had written it and in writing this episode he, he trashed it and I'm sitting here waiting for the script and they said, "He's rewriting it as we speak."  So they took the script, which was the father, Tom Skerritt, finding a condom in his daughter's night table, that's the premise he wrote it on and he said, "A condom in the night table?"  So he rewrote it with Tom Skerritt, Kathy Baker and the kids busting in the room on Christmas Eve, singing Christmas carols with their, the daughter in bed with her boyfriend and both buck naked.  Now that's the way to start a (laughter)--and I remember Tom Skerritt looking at me saying, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], I got this one." And that's, that episode, it gets, when--I know 'Picket Fences' gets played, it gets played a lot.  It was a really, really sound, really good episode.  So we did, so I did 'Picket Fences,' I did a number of 'Picket Fences,' I started doing a lot of hour shows.
Story_ID: 325296
Speaker 1: I think the one thing that I wanted to go back over was my theatre, 1977, '78 [1978], somewhere in there, I'd gone to the Eugene O'Neill Playwriting Conf--Playwrights Conference [National Playwrights Conference, Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center] up in Waterford, Connecticut.  [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards at the, was running it.  Lloyd ran it for almost thirty-five years up until 2000, and one of the things that I found in my career was when you start getting familiar with people, where they say familiarity breeds contempt, oh, he's a hour episodic director, oh, he's a half hour episodic director, oh, he's, we know him, we know him, let's get somebody different, somebody new.  So, in those periods when I said like I didn't work, I'd go back to doing theatre.  I would go back to doing theatre and in doing theatre what I would do, I went back during--let me see, which period was it when I wasn't, when I stopped doing half hour and I wanted to make a transition and I did two plays.  I did 'Fences' [August Wilson] at the Asolo Theatre [Asolo Repertory Theatre, Sarasota, Florida] in Florida with a wonderful cast with, with [HistoryMaker] Charles Weldon, Earl Billings.  We did a wonderful production down there and I did 'Mississippi Delta' ['From the Mississippi Delta'] with and, Dr. Endesha Holland [Endesha Ida Mae Holland], her, her piece in Cincinnati [Ohio] at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park and it would, for me it was a revitalization.  It got my, got me going and at the same time where the second year, when I was going to go back to do, I was going back to the O'Neill, back in the 1978, '79 [1979], that's when I got 'Bustin' Loose' and so I had actually left and Lloyd, and I remember a wonderful, wonderful moment from Edith Oliver who was the critic for The New Yorker who said to me years later, she said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], Lloyd might sound mad at you but he was very proud that you went on to do, go to Hollywood and do your theatre and so don't, don't pay him any mind." But I think between Edith Oliver, Skip Mercier [G.W. Mercier], my agent Helen Merrill, they pushed Lloyd to bring me back to the O'Neills so, 1990, 1991, when I was in my transition, I went and I started doing theatre again and started doing the O'Neill Playwrights Conference.  I had actually, during another transition, years before, back in 1980, when I was not working for a couple of months, I went to Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and directed a play there, Michael Abbensetts' play, 'Sweet Talk' and Carl Lumbly, I took Carl Lumbly there and it was just, for me, it's always a revitalization.  So, I started doing theatre, I keep, so I keep my hand in both theatre and, and in film and television.  I try to do it all.
Story_ID: 325297
Speaker 1: The other thing that I was also doing, 1988, I worked for Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] on his campaign for the president of the United States.  I worked here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and about a week or two, about two weeks before the convention, there was a need to do a--Jesse was going to speak at the convention and they needed to do a video introduction.  So I directed a video with, with a partner, Ben Goddard who was a political consultant.  Ben and I produced and directed a, directed the introduction of Jesse Jackson to the 1988 convention and that was actually fun because at the convention in '88 [1988], the group that was, the producers who were doing it, they were trying something new in that, with that Democratic convention where they were bringing the lights down on the delegates and the spotlight on the speaker and as I was watching from backstage Jesse's speech, I started hearing that the networks were very upset because every time there'd be an applause, the lights would start to come up and as the lights were coming up, the applause would die down and as they would die down, then they'd bring the lights down so they could not get any audience reactions because there was, the lights were down.  So, I literally, I mean you couldn't do it now, but I had literally crawled on my hands and knees out onto the podium, where the stage manager was here, Jesse Jackson was here, I sat under the stage manager's desk on the podium, of the Democratic National Convention with Jesse Jackson speaking and I said to the stage manager, tell them in the booth I am going to call when they bring the lights up from here.  So, I'm up there, underneath Jesse Jackson, sitting there listening, listening, feeling the, feeling the crescendo coming, I said, lights, bring the lights up and as the lights would come up, they, the audience would start to applaud.  And so for the whole thing I was out there on the podium, under Jesse, controlling the lights.  And when Jesse was finished, I crawled off the stage and I let the rest of the people have whatever but, I made sure that with Jesse's speech that they got their, they got that applause and their reaction.  So, this, Jesse and I have talked about that.  I need to get him, he doesn't know where that videotape is, but it's a great videotape that we did for him.  So I, so I tried to, I started finding my politics--
Story_ID: 325298
Speaker 1: Mandela [Nelson Mandela] came to the Coliseum [Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum] here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I got a phone call from [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters that, I guess Quincy [HistoryMaker Quincy Jones] was going to do the Coliseum and the armory.  He was going to do a dinner at the armory and do the Coliseum, Quincy pulled out, so they needed somebody to direct the L.A. Coliseum.  So, I said okay, I'll do it.  So, Quincy had gotten a few of the acts together.  We got a bunch of acts together but we were told that we had seventy thousand people in the L.A. Coliseum just to hear Mandela but Quincy was having across the way, Quincy Jones was having a dinner for Mandela.  So they would do the dinner and then Mandela would walk across the road and he'd come and he'd talk to the seventy thousand people.  We were not told exactly what time he would get there.  I made a phone call to [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne, I said Roscoe, I would need, I need you to be the host, to be the narrator, be whatever, I just need you and when I need a poem, I need you to do a poem.  We did a three-hour program, three hours and fifteen minutes before Mandela came in.  We had the acts going, we had this, it was about two and a half hours into it, I was running thin on, on material.  Not one break and it was great.  I had two guys, Richard Gant, who's a wonderful actor, he did 'Rocky IV' [sic. 'Rocky V'] and he played the Don King character.  Richard Gant was on one side, Ron Abbott, was another friend who was a stage manager who I had worked for back at the Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  So I had these two guys, two big guys behind me when the reggae group started to complain, we should be leading in Mandela, we should be playing when Mandela comes on and I was, I was in control.  I was definitely saying, no, and making sure that I had my two guys standing there with me when I, when we'd have our little spats but we kept it running for three hours and fifteen minutes without a break and around two hours and fifteen minutes, two hours, two and a half hours into it, I was really low and I said, I said, I turned to Maxine Waters, I said, get Jesse over here quick.  I know Jesse, he can get me a, he can get me twenty minutes, a half an hour easy, get him over here, get him to speak and I heard Jesse didn't want to come because he wanted to stay at the, with the Armory and I said, Maxine, if you have to literally go over there and grab him, go over there and grab him, and get him over here.  Jesse got over there, Jesse kept it going, but it was fabulous.  We had a wonderful time and I think people will remember the L.A. Coliseum, will remember that.  It was non-stop and then Mandela came, he did his piece and then he left, so.
Story_ID: 325299
Speaker 1: So I started to get into a lot of community, a lot of politics.  I worked with [HistoryMaker] Maxine Waters, I worked with Mark Ridley-Thomas, I worked with a number of the people around.  We ended up, at which point, I got a phone call from a friend of mine who was chairman of the board of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science [Los Angeles, California] and I joined the board of Charles R. Drew and that was actually good fun because I ended up being, it helped me get into the community, stay in the community.  I know they're going through a lot of problems now.
Speaker 2: Where is the Charles R. Drew school?
Speaker 1: Charles R. Drew is in Compton [California], Inglewood [California], right there, on the border of Los Angeles [California].  It was a hospital.  It was--King/Drew Medical Center [Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center; Martin Luther King Jr. Outpatient Center, Los Angeles, California] was formed; this whole thing was formed out of the fact that one of the things that started the conflict in Watts [California] was the fact they had no, there was no hospital.  I mean, people were trying to get to USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], get to Harbor [Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, California] and so Watts needed a hospital and they created King/Drew Medical Center in Watts and the Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science was founded back, in I think, in 1967 to create jobs to educate doctors for community service.
Story_ID: 325300
Speaker 1: It's hard to--for you to be pigeon-holed; you're writing, directing, producing, you've done all those things.
Speaker 2: I've done it all.  I've done it all.
Speaker 1: Television, movies and stage.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I just found that you've got to reinvent yourself all the time.  You've got to do something a little different to keep people off-balance, to make them look at you.  In 1994, '95 [1995], '95 [1995], the Eugene O'Neill [Eugene O' Neill Theatre Center, Waterford, Connecticut] invited--the Playwrights Conference [National Playwrights Conference] invited me to go to Russia to do an exchange program and take a play which was 'The Old Settler' by John Henry Redwood to Russia.  So, I don't know if I talked about this but this was fun and, again, it's reinventing, it's reinventing.  I want, and also refreshing yourself.
Speaker 1: I think, we interviewed [HistoryMaker] Lorraine Toussaint.  She was in there.
Speaker 2: Lorraine Toussaint, C.C.H. Pounder, Jeffrey Sams, T'Keyah Keymah [HistoryMaker T'Keyah Crystal Keymah] and we went to Russia and when I landed in Russia with this fabulous cast, I mean, I'm telling you, the cast was to die for.  I was handed a Russian translation of the same script and I had two translators and I was given a Russian cast and if you know 'The Old Settler,' I'd say it takes place in 1940s Harlem [New York, New York], and all of a sudden I had a white cast to do, 1940s Harlem and we did, I rehearsed the first scene with the American cast, then I'd do the first scene with the Russian cast.  And so, so they would not start imitating each other, I would do the second scene with the Russian cast and then I'd do the second scene with the American cast and I would just alternate this all the way through.  And one of the great moments was when I took C.C.H. Pounder out of the American cast and I dropped her into the Russian cast and I said, okay, we're going to do a scene and everybody said, how are we going to do this?  How are we going to do this?  We don't know, we don't know what they're saying.  They're speaking Russian, we're speaking American, I said, but you got the script in your hand.  When they stop talking, that means you start talking.  I said, take it as a gibberish exercise and they said, okay.  It was brilliant.  The tears, the emotion was just as real as if they were, I mean, as if they were speaking the same language.  It, they understood.  They did not need to know exactly what the other person was saying.  The feelings were there.  We really wanted to perform that.  We only did it as a rehearsal but it, but it was great.  One of the things that happened when I came back to the United States, people would look at me and say, so, Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], what have you been up to?  Well, I went to Russia and I did a play and I'd tell them the story and it was great.  Oh, wow, you're a real director.  I didn't tell them I got 100, we got $100 to do it.  I mean, I got a plane ticket, we were fed, we were housed in some very-- we were with the Russian people.  We were not in hotels.  We were in the commissars housing.  I took a picture of the toilet seat.  My wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] said, "Why did you take a picture?"  I said, "'Cause I wanted you to see how I was living for the past five weeks and it was pretty, pretty bad."  The, the rust, Russia's falling and somebody said about Russia, it's a third world country with a great space program and they meant it.  It is a third world country that's getting better but it's got a long way to go.  The roads, whoever has the concession to fix the roads in Russia is going to be a millionaire for years to come because the roads are so bad.

Speaker 1: For me, one of the things I always felt that part of what I do as a director and part of what I love about directing is, is working with people and find that theatre, going back to the O'Neill [Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center, Waterford, Connecticut] was really refreshing for me.  I'd go back and I might do one reading, two readings.  One summer, Lloyd [HistoryMaker Lloyd Richards] had me do four plays over four weeks and we did, we did them and we did them well and we did them, they were fabulous and for me, it was just revitalization.  It was finding a way to really hone, hone my craft.  Always wanted to hone your craft, always wanting to reinvent yourself, find something new, that's why the politics or the community service, I, a lot of my friends are doctors and lawyers and, and people who--businessmen.  I'm in the fraternal organizations where I'm with these people who I find give me a new way of looking at, at things.  I, when I'm on doing a play, doing a film, doing anything, when I'm working with people, I say, oh, oh, oh, this, this moment reminds me of a story.  This, and I will be giving stories.  I will talk about things.  That, that for me is what, what my art is about, is finding ways to communicate, finding ways to get something over.  A friend of mine once said to me, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], you're not a religious person," and then he came to see a play that I, I'd done, and he said, "Oz, there's religion all over your play."  I said, I said, "My--I don't believe in hitting you over the head with a sledge hammer but I do have my lessons and my parables and my--I was raised in a religious family.  I was raised, it's around me.  It's part of me.  I don't feel I have to go advertise it.  I don't feel I have to go proselytize.  I just, it's just who I am.  This is the way I feel. Is God love?  Is one religion good, one religion bad?" I said, I said, "It's about people."  I think one of the nicest, one of the most great moments for me was my father [Osborne Scott] allowing me to do the Father's Day sermon at his church in Brooklyn [New York] and I said, which, which pulpit, you know, the layman's pulpit or the big one?  He said, go up to the, and I was like, oh, you know, 'cause as a kid, that was, that was the big pulpit, that was the place and I was kind of scared but I did my, I did my sermon.  I did my talk.  I did what I did and I remember my father said before I got up, as I was getting up there, he said, "I know some of you wanted to have a real minister for this Father's Day sermon but my son is going to do it.  Now for those of you who want a real minister, I will give you two minutes after he talks."  And it was actually great because my father was a wonderful preacher and because he could take what I said and my thoughts and my feelings and he could sort of bring them together within that last two minutes.  After I finished speaking, he just took those few little things I said and just tied them together in a great way, so, I find that I sometimes say who are the great writers in television?  Who are the great writers in film?  They are people who, this business, film business was not built on film people, they were built on artists, painters, plumbers, mechanics, insurance salesmen, businessmen, doctors, lawyers that came to this business with something to talk about and when I talk to kids and I said, when kids say to me, what should I be doing, I say to them, don't go to film school, not yet.  Why would you go to film school, why not get something to talk about?  And you can go to graduate film school.  You can go to graduate theatre programs, you can do all that, but find something to talk about before you go.  Understand business 'cause this business is a business.  It's an entertainment business.  It's about the dollars and cents.  You, in order to do a movie, you've got to have the money.  It's, it's, once you have the money, you can get the equipment.  Once you get the equipment, you can get the, you can get the scripts and you get the actors, you can buy all these things but learn all these things, know them, feel them.

Speaker 1: So that when I do a law show, and a friend of mine who's a, is a big defense attorney here, I just did an episode of 'Just Legal,' it's a Don Johnson new series, Bruckheimer [Jerry Bruckheimer Television], and in it they have to defend a guilty man which is the lesson of this episode and I call this friend of mine up who is a defense attorney and I said, what happens when you know that your client is guilty?  He said, well then you defend the constitution, and it was great to be able to have contact with real people because make-believe, Hollywood is make-believe and it's based on reality but it's make-believe on top and you need that reality, I need that reality shot once in a while.  So my friends who are businessmen or lawyers or doctors, I talk to them.  I talk about physics.  I talk to them about medicine.  I talk to them about, I do these medical shows.  I do 'Chicago Hope.'  We had to do an open heart surgery because an elevator gets stuck between floors and the guy's too heavy to move off so they just decide to do it there and I was actually having dinner, one night, my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] was out of town, with a bunch of cardiologists, bunch of doctors, it was like seven doctors had called me up and said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], why don't you come and have dinner." And I walk in there, there's seven doctors and their spouses and we're all sitting there having dinner and I told them about this episode I was doing and they said, "Oz, an elevator's got to be one of the most unsanitary places in, in the entire hospital because it's got, it's updrafts and you've got all the air, you know, you got all that machinery, you got that dirt, you've got all of that." And I said, and, "What happens if you're stuck going from one procedure room to surgery onto the OR [operating room] on another floor, what happens?  What do you do?"  And somebody said, "Well, if you've got to do the surgery, you've got to do it." And so for me it's always interesting to hear how people, how doctors sometimes see my shows.  How lawyers see when I do 'Boston Legal,' do David Kelley, they say, some lawyers say, some people say, "Ah, is it real?"  And some lawyers said, "You know, it really doesn't matter because it's something that I have always wanted to do or say.  Then no, I can't say it but, have I ever wanted to throw a brief at a judge?  Yeah." And did I do it in one of my episodes?  Yeah.  Did that get everyone excited?  Yeah.  So, for me, and when I go and I'm working on those shows, I try to find the reality, I try not to make it, some people say, ah, it's just TV, it doesn't matter.  It does matter to me.  It matters because I want people to see who these, who people are.  I--
Speaker 2: Trying to balance the sensational with the real.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 325303
Speaker 1: What would you do if you had the means to do anything you wanted to do or the time, the means or the time to do what you, where do you want to do it?  Would it be theatre, TV, or movies or--?
Speaker 2: For me, it's always going to be all three.  Theatre, TV, movies.  I was asked--Paul Allen, Microsoft guy, I was hired to do a motion-based platform ride, one of those films, you know, the 65 millimeter films where you get on and your seats are moving and you're flying, like you're flying through whatever.  I was asked to do it on 'Funk' which is actually fun and, of course, my agent said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], that's not what you do.  You do, don't do motion, those are amusement park rides, you don't do those type of films."  I said, "Yeah, I know, won't it be fun.  Let's give it a shot."  And I wrote the script, guys, I was able to fly to Augusta, Georgia to shoot James Brown doing 'Sex Machine.'  I got Bobby Byrd and James Brown back together after, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, I forget how long they, and we had them performing and James Brown was fabulous.  Here is Bobby Byrd and James Brown.  Hey, Bobby, you know.  They were just, and, and we were on that stage and I had two EPK [electronic press kit] crews there and here they had the video machines and Bobby Byrd and James Brown started to improvise between, while we're shooting, and I'm like going, and the cameramen were sitting there watching and I yelled and I jumped up on the, I grabbed one of the cameras and I said, come on guys, this is what we're here for.  Yes, I had three cameras, 65 millimeter camera and two super, super 35 millimeter cameras and I was shooting them doing three, three songs.  I mean, it had everybody up there.  His dancers, his backup singers, his entire band, James Brown and Bobby Byrd, and I said, but--.
Speaker 1: And this is for a--.
Speaker 2: A motion-based platform ride on 'Funk.'  Gehry [Frank Gehry], you know Gehry who did the Walt Disney [Walt Disney Concert Hall, Los Angeles, California], the Disney, he, he's an architect, the architect.  He designed a, it's called, Experience Music Project [Museum of Pop Culture] up in, it was supposed to be the Jimi Hendrix museum--music museum up in Seattle [Washington], it's right under the Space Needle, and they built a motion-based platform theatre in that space and they wanted to do it on 'Funk.' I didn't stay with the project that long.  I mean, the word is that, I told them, it was a five-minute video that I could do it for $7 million if they hired me in June for a May opening.  I said, but if you hire me in July, it can't be done for $7 million.  When I got the contract in August, I said, you guys are crazy and everybody said "But, Oz, you gotta do it, we gotta do it, you gotta do it, you gotta do it."  I said, "Understand, it can't be done for $7 million."  "Don't worry about it."  I lasted until November.  I got to shoot James Brown.  I got to, you know, I did a lot to get it going and thank God I got off it because when it finally was done, it was done for $20 million, a five-minute video and a lot of, and it was, I think it was done for more than that; I think twenty is all they're taking credit for.
Story_ID: 325304
Speaker 1: For me, it's, what else is out there?  I don't know.  I think if I had the means to do anything, meaning if I had millions of dollars, I'd like to produce shows, television.  I would love, you know, I mean, I would love, I would hope TV One makes it.  I would love to see BET [Black Entertainment Television] blossom even more.  I know Reggie Hudlin [HistoryMaker Reginald Hudlin] is doing, taking over production for BET.  I hope it, they do a lot, TV One, I hope they do more.  I just, I think there's a lot, a lot of black product, projects that can be done.  I'd love to do some film.  I feel that, I tell people, be careful about just coming to Hollywood to be in the film business I said because you have so many people coming here to be in the film business.  I said, there's a Romero in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] who did 'Night of the Living Dead'--
Speaker 2: George Romero.
Speaker 1: George Romero.  When he did those, I said, there's a lot of money outside of Hollywood that really wants to be in the business.  Why not exploit that money and do those films there, come to Hollywood with something under your arm.  I'd love for, for, I'd love to find the city, find the place that says, we want to really dedicate to doing film 'cause there's a whole lot of us who would be there in a minute saying let's just do it.  I know that New Orleans [Louisiana], some friends of mine are down in New Orleans, they, 'cause New Orleans was really trying very hard.  I know Atlanta [Georgia] is trying hard to, to really--. I think that, because of where, where the equipment is going, that it's much easier.  You don't have to shoot film, you don't have to spend as much money to do projects.  I would love to, there's stories that need to be told, just what The HistoryMakers are doing.  There's stories in all of our lives that we need to see.  I, I've seen, I love history.  I mean, I used to, as a kid, I loved the biographies on Madame Curie [Marie Curie].  I love the biographies on Abraham Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln].  I love the biographies on all these people but where are those real biographies on George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington?  Where are those biographies on Frederick Douglass and, and on Sojourner Truth.  There's some great stories and they're not stories just about preaching a, a political opinion, a diatribe on something, there's stories about human beings, about people, those are the things that, that we want to know that, that those human beings made these accomplishments out of who they were.  They didn't make their accomplishments because they were necessarily special or perfect.  Sometimes they made them out of desperation.  They made them out of certain ways.  I mean, yes, it's been great to see, they did it on Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.].  They did it on A. Philip Randolph.  There's just so many, we have so many stories.  We have so many writers and so many books.  There's Zora Neale Hurston.  There's Langston Hughes that have stories and books and poems.  [HistoryMaker] Ntozake Shange.  We just have a wealth of, of writers and material that just are begging to grow and television and film and theatre are ways to grow in.  I just think that the Jubilee Singers [Fisk Jubilee Singers], there's, there's all sorts of things that we can, we can come around, that's just from a historical point of view.  We, as a people, we as, as part of this society and it's not just about being black, it's about being people.  There's just so many stories that I feel like I want to tell.  I, I turn to my son graduating in business management.  I turned to my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott], I said, "Business management.  What does he know about business?  Why is he taking business?"  She said, "Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], what do you always say to these kids.  Know their business.  Know what that's about so that they can, when they do become artists, when they do become directors or producers or whatever, that they have some, some background in, in it."  I would love to do a lot of these things.
Story_ID: 325305
Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there any major, major move or major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Wow, it's a hard, that's a hard thing.  I think the question is, who am I, what have I done?  I feel that, for instance, with 'The Cheetah Girls,' the Raven-Symone, what we did for Disney Channel, we created a franchise that Disney Channel owns.  There's a lot of things I feel like you create that you don't own.  I think, if I look back at it, you want to figure out how I own it.  How I have control of it.  How, that's what I want.  It's not about being black or white or anything else, it's just about ownership.  How do we start, how do I, how do you, how do we all start to own things so that we can, we can benefit, we can profit and we can say what it is that we want to say without, I mean, I think the biggest concern sometimes with networks and the studios and the producers and for me as a black director, it's funny I had on one show I was doing, I hired a black actress to play a community worker and on the next episode I happened to read the script and I noticed that, and I had her as a very strong community worker.  And the next, she was going to bed with one of the white male characters and, and she had like a scene, it was not much, and all of a sudden she was in bed, he was coming to work late.  And I said, no, no.  I said, if I got to work for it, he's got to work for it.  I said, she ain't going to give it up that easy and they were like, Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], Oz.  I said, no, come on, let's give the girl some respect.  Just because you want him to come to work late, I mean that's not a reason to have a scene and that's not a reason to, and I remember the actress calling up, said, Ozzie, you're the producer on this show?  You were able to change, change the scene?  I said, no, but I gave them reasons and I have my passions.  For me, the one thing I won't change about myself is I'm passionate about what I do.  I don't want to just do it, that's why, with 'Bustin' Loose' or with 'The Cheetah Girls,' anything that I'm doing, where are the actors?  Where are you?  What are you feeling like?  When I went to Russia with the Russian actors, I said to them, I said to them, they, I watched the other directors 'cause it was a whole series of plays being done at the same time and I watched the other directors go and they would take a actor's arm and they'd hold it, posed, they posed them and then they'd say, now say the line like that.  And then, they were like puppets and now say the line, the next line like this and I said no wonder you guys do three months of rehearsals to justify these moves, not that they are wrong but they're not coming out of you.  So when my actors, my Russian actors saying, Oz, what is it that you want us to do?  I said, guys, I got no time to tell you what I want.  I want to see what you want to do and then let me take it and that's the way I work.  I want to work with, when I work with writers.  I look at the writer and say, I want to find out who they are.  What are they doing?  What are, how do they feel, then it makes me understand what they've written but sometimes just to read something, you're like going, whoa, what is this?  And then when you start talking, working with the writer, then you begin to say, oh, I got it.  And I remember one, one writer and I got into a big fight in front of the crew over a scene.  I had my passions, he had his passions, we fought, but we came to an understanding and for me that was a wonderful fight and he was saying, Oz, we can't fight in front of the crew.  I said, why?  Everybody was fascinated (laughter) because it was something coming out of it.  It wasn't just a fight to fight, it was a creative battle.
Story_ID: 325306
Speaker 1: That leads to a question we always ask and that's like, when you look back at everything you've done to this point today, what would you see as your contribution, your legacy?
Speaker 2: Whoa.  I think my legacy would be that I am a director first, that I'm still a black director but I'm a director first and it's, I guess, I don't know if I said in the beginning of this interview about my father [Osborne Scott] when he was down in Louisiana--.
Speaker 1: I know the story, the story with Benjamin O. Davis [Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you talked about that story.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well, you can re-iterate it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, which my father said that Benjamin Davis said, first I am a general and then I am a negro and my father said, I beg to differ with you.  First you're a negro, then you are a general.  I am a black man.  I am a very proud African American but I'm a director and I'm, and they are not separate, they are together, but I am a director that directs.  I was, I was up for a movie, a writer put me up for a movie and said, the studio said, but what does Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott] know about a white middle class family 'cause that's what this is about.  And I said to him, why don't you bring him over to my house for lunch one day with my kids.  It's not about--I understand a myriad of, of people.  Somebody said to me about 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], "Oz, I watch 'For Colored Girls' and I was fascinated to know that you don't know anything about women but you directed this wonderful play about women. And then I realized, you understand people and then I said, 'Yeah, that's where Oz gets it from.'"  I, I feel my legacy is allowing people to know that I, as a black man, can direct whoever, whatever and I can be very effective and very open, very caring, very loving, very, but very strong, very firm and very passionate and I am a black director that can do anything.
Story_ID: 325307
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: This is, that's a, I've been really thinking about, this is, oh, boy, how do I say this?  I feel that we need to keep moving.  We need, and it's funny because there's a balance here that I feel is missing because I went to see, I don't know if you've seen 'Radio Golf,' August Wilson's play--there's something, the community was built on the shoulders of entrepreneurs and when people feel that these young new entrepreneurs are changing the face of the community, I want to be real careful that we don't see that as a negative because what is it that we are trying to uphold.  Are we trying to uphold a community that exists now or are we trying to hold up a tradition that was created before and that tradition that was created before was a tradition built on the preachers, on the insurance salesmen, on the shop owners, on all those people that built their businesses off the black community and they grew.  I feel that the new entrepreneurs have to find a way of doing the same thing of building upon the black community and the white community and, but growing in such a way that we can, do you want to stop it here for a second 'cause--.
Speaker 1: Finish your sentence.
Speaker 2: I want to, I want us to keep growing.  I want us to find a way of, of melding and blending and understanding that the business and the social need to find ways of merging.  One of my big things is the Negro Ensemble Company is talking about starting up again and in starting up you have to find how to merge the creativity with the business.
Story_ID: 325308
Speaker 1: One of the great moments in my life was when we were at Henry Street [Henry Street Settlement; Henry Street Playhouse, New York, New York] with 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange], the National Endowment for the Arts, there was so much money for the arts that we were able to bring in an audience.  We were able to open up our doors for free and have the community come into that theatre.  There were lines around the corner to get in to see 'For Colored Girls' those first--in the beginning.  That does not exist anymore and with that not existing, with the National Endowment for the Arts being, talked about being cut to the bare bones, of grants being cut, of money going to Iraq, to, you know, money, monies going everywhere else but to the arts.  The arts has to find a business way of surviving and there is a way of merging business and the arts, in finding a way where the film community and the theatre community and the business community, everybody's trying to--television's constantly trying to find a way of, of business opportunities.  They're talking about commercials are dying.  What do we do?  Right now, CBS just sent to us a, a test where they're taking a, they will take a beer can and they will take a product that is pertinent to the scene and if there's a table in the scene, they would digitally put that can of beer, that cereal box right on that table for the scene and then they will take it out and when it goes into syndication and they will advertise, we got a slot right here that you can put your thing in.  Yeah, it's mercenary in a lot of ways but people, a lot of our theatres are saying, give us money, give us money, give us money to help us make, after a while, people want to say, how are you going to make money?  Because if I just keep giving you money, I'm just, I'm just throwing money away and then you've got to keep going to new pockets and new pockets and new pockets, pocket stores are starting to dry up.  One of the things that I would love to do is find out how to keep the creativity.  I would love to, I'd love for the kids to understand that excitement that I had with the opening up 'For Colored Girls.'  Having that audience be at 'For Colored Girls' found, we found the show.  We found the show when one of, one of the poems, three of us like a pyramid was being done and about two women and one guy and one of the actresses looked out in the audience and saw a woman that she had this experience with and from that moment on, that poem sang because she cried that night because she said that poem to that person.  We've got to find a way of blending business in the arts.

Speaker 1: Tell us about, well, tell us about your family.  That's, that's the next thing we usually talk about, you know.  You've told us something about 'em and--
Speaker 2: About my children, about my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My wife is a wonderful sculpturess and those are some of her works.  She paints.  She, she's artistic.  She, for me, my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] was very artistic and I married somebody who's kept that alive in our family.  We, she works on her art all the time.  My son [Osborne Yearwood Scott] is working now for MTV for his, as a, he's working as a set PA [production assistant].  He's really into the business.  He's been doing, he did a film called, 'Yours-', was it, 'Yours, Mine and Ours' which was an old Henry Fonda, Lucille Ball film.  He worked as the assistant to the ex-producer and we're very, and that film should be coming out with Rene Russo and Dennis Quaid.  My daughter, Brittany Scott, is now at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and she's becoming a drama major and I got great stories about her.  She was reading a play that she was told to, 'White Chocolate' ['White Chocolate for My Father,' Laurie Carlos] was the play.  She was reading it and she got to the back of it and she closed the book and she saw this picture on the back cover and saying, I know that person.  Daddy, there's this writer that I know, and it was Laurie Carlos who was in the original cast of 'For Colored Girls' ['For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When The Rainbow Is Enuf,' Ntozake Shange] and I found Laurie's e-mail and I hooked her and my daughter up and it's for me was great is, when I came into the business, I did not have a parent who was in the business.  I did not, I mean, yes I had friends but did I have anybody who had attained what I had, other than, I mean, Sidney Poitier, I will say, I did talk to Sidney and Sidney gave me great advice.  He was, he was there.  Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] was there for me.  When I came out to Hollywood, Joe Papp, I remember him calling me one day and saying, Oz [HistoryMaker Oz Scott], remember, you have a family here.  If they ever mess with you, you have a place to come home to.  Having people like that was great but I loved my friends' kids who are trying to go into the business.  I love being able to let them know that I'm here for them.  I always say, I'm not going to give you a job but I will give you an opportunity.  You have to take the job.  I will try to open doors.  I will try to at least crack the doors open for you.  So my daughter's in drama and she seems to be doing very well.  She told me that phone call with Laurie Carlos went very, she said Laurie Carlos started crying because of the very personal script, a very personal play and she was able to go into class and say, I talked to the writer about this play that we're doing.  Those things are important to me to be able to give that to my kids.  My oldest, Robert [Robert Scott], the oldest son is now in conflict counseling.  He's getting a master's [degree] in conflict counseling for mediation and arbitration and he's, he's working well.  He went to the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington] and he's doing great.  So, those, that's coming along.

Speaker 1: My parents--my mother [Jean Sampson Scott] died in '92 [1992], my father [Osborne Scott] died in '97 [1997].  Those are great losses.  My mother and I, we talked all the time.  My father and I talked all the time.  I, 'til the day he died, we talked religion, we talked philosophy, we would talk all sorts of things.  We'd talk about people.  We'd talk about humanity, philosophy.  I'd call him up and say, I read this article on this theological premise and he said, oh, yeah, yeah, and we'd talk about, we'd talk for hours about all sorts of things.  I miss those conversations.  I hope I give those conversations to my children that my parents were able to give.  I always talk about my mother talking about our people when I was growing up.  Our people, our people, our, that's our boy, that's our girl, that's our, and for years I said, we've got a big family but my parents felt very close to being, being, felt very close to their people, to our people, to black people.  I think the great story recently is that about three or four years ago I got a phone call from a guy in Las Vegas [Nevada] who said to me, your aunt says that your--my mother I said is a genealogist, I don't know if I told you this story, but, I'll say it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, early on I think you talked about--
Speaker 1: Did I tell you this story about--
Speaker 2: --you talked about this, I don't know if this specific story--
Speaker 1: About, well, it's just about him finding two gravesites and finding out that he was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --where he told about that story.  I mean, so, I think the legacy of my parents goes on and it goes on in my children.  So, I think those are the things.  Right now I just was in Hampton, Virginia where I was born and I'm fixing the house my father grew up in, trying to put it back together 'cause it's a mess right now and that's a way also of keeping, for me to keep in contact with my family because being on, in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] we're a lot, there's a lot of us separated from our family.  There's, my friends who are from Mississippi, from Washington, D.C., from New York [New York], from Boston [Massachusetts], from the East Coast, from Ohio, and we're all out here and, yes, we have formed a bond and a community and it's something wonderful and great but we miss our families and one of the things we're also doing with this whole Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] mess, we realize, my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] said to me, do you know all our friends, if anything happened, would we be able to call up their parents, their brother, their sister and we realized we don't have those phone numbers.
Speaker 2: You're talking about Hurricane Katrina, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, with Hurricane Katrina--
Speaker 2: Of this year, yeah, of this past year.
Speaker 1: --what Katrina did.  I think that we're starting to reach out to our friends and saying, what is it that we have that we can, how can we share and make sure that we stay together and that the family is a bigger family than that?  My wife and I are in a couple of groups, one, we're in a couples group where we all get together as couples to talk about relationships which keeps our, keeps us on our toes and I know the men of the group get to listen to the women and the women get to listen to the men so that we can sit there and discuss relationships and try to keep, again, our, our relationships healthy and growing.  There's a lot of friends of mine that have come out from New York who are in theatre that we try to stay in touch with.  So that, so we have a very extensive family we feel here in Los Angeles but we don't want to lose our ties to our cousins, our uncles, our aunts.  My wife's from Montclair, New Jersey where her parents, and their--her grandparents are from.  Her mother went to school with the, the writer of 'Cheaper By The Dozen' [Frank Bunker Gilbreth, Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey], which is based out of Montclair and she has a big tradition in Montclair.  Her local church, Trinity Episcopal Church in Montclair, is a church that she tries to help out as much as she can and stay in contact.  So we try to keep our tradition, trying to keep our contacts up.

Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as somebody who brought joy, brought understanding to the films and television that I, that I've done.  I would love to be remembered for, I guess who I am, and keep it very simple.  I--when September 11th [September 11, 2001; 9/11] went, that weekend was, September 16th is my birthday, and my wife [Lynne Yearwood Scott] said to me, what do you want for your birthday?  Not knowing that she had started on doing a surprise birthday party for me.  She didn't call anybody else after September 11th but I said to her, I would like some friends over because I'd like to feel the bond and the closeness and I was doing, I guess I was doing 'Ally McBeal' at the time and I said that night, in this room, when we were talking about September 11th, about the tragedy, I questioned what it is that I do.  I questioned the comedies that I worked on.  I questioned all of that that I consider, is this my legacy?  Is this what I'm doing?  Why am I doing this when there's so much tragedy in the world?  And then I thought of 'Gulliver's'--'Sullivan's Travels' which was a film that was done many, many years ago with, it was a Preston Sturges film where it was about an actor who, was it, was it Gordon MacRae?  I forget who it was but who decided that, who was an actor and he decided, I want to go and find what the people really want.  I'm tired of doing comedies.  I'm tired of doing silliness and he goes off and it starts as fun and hijinks and he ends up getting arrested and getting put into a chain gang and the film just gets more depressing and more depressing and he can't get out and at the end of the movie he looks around, they take, they walk him in to watch a film and in watching the film people are laughing, people are smiling, he sees these old, these hardened criminals who've been depressed all day, all week and they're having this moment of joy and I just said, this is what we do.  We try to bring a certain amount of joy, a certain amount of understanding.  Yeah, I have a mission in this life and the mission is to, is to communicate.  I'm a communicator.  It's to communicate ideas.  Communicate thoughts.  Communicate feelings.  Communicate something about people that other people can look at and say, oh, that's what they do to get out of this situation, maybe I can try that or that's what makes them happy, that's what makes them, I said, making, I love in what I do to be able to show people, other people, and if I want my legacy to be anything, I want to be able for people to sit there and learn something from who I am, learn something from what I've done.  No, am I religious?  I don't, I don't feel I am but I do have a sense of morality, a sense of, of faith, a sense of love that I do want to give and hopefully my work will give that to people.
