Speaker 1: I'm now going to ask five, what we call "People Magazine" type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My wife will kill if I said that one.  Actually, I'm from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], as I said.  And one of the staples that Philadelphia is famous for is the Philadelphia Hoagie.  And every opportunity I have, I make it back to Philadelphia so I can have a Philadelphia Hoagie (laughter).  They don't make them anywhere else like Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year actually is springtime because nature is just getting over the roughages of winter.  And grass starts to turn green and trees start to turn green and the foliage comes out, and it just becomes beautiful all over again.  So, my favorite time would be spring.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is blue, and I guess that's because I spent so much time in the Navy [United States Navy] and it's a Navy blue color.  And one of the colors here at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] is blue as well.  It's blue and orange, but it's blue, nevertheless.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination.  [Sigh] I guess I would have to say Curacao, the Island of Curacao.  I went to visit the Island of Curacao, and they have this structure down there called the "Queen Emma Pontoon Bridge".  And I was kind of fascinated with that.  And the people there are very friendly, and very beautiful.  I say that kind of tongue-in-cheek because when I was there, I was still on active duty in the military.  And some of my friends who were there were my Navy friends.  And we all put money in a pool and the idea was, the first person to spot an ugly woman would win the pot (laughter).  Got, you know, we had something like about fifty bucks in the pool.  But nobody won because you couldn't find anybody ugly (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: My favorite phrase or saying comes from my grandmother [Annie Golden Thomas, maternal grandmother] who used to instill in us, me and my brothers [Clement, Arthur, and Gary Lupton] all the time, "It is better to have and not need, than to need and not have."
Story_ID: 29891
Speaker 1: That's a perfect introduction to our next segment.  How far back can you go in terms of your family history?
Speaker 2: Oh, just right off the top of my head, I can go back to my grandparents.  I never knew my great grands, they were all expired before I came along, but I have very fond memories of my grandparents on both sides, on my mother's side [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] and my father's [Clement M. Lupton, Sr.] side.  In fact, I used to think that we had an "in" on the Fountain of Youth because I had great aunts, great uncles, grandparents on both sides.  I thought the family was gonna live forever.
Speaker 1: So tell me about your grandmother [Annie Golden Thomas, maternal grandmother]?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, sage, sage woman.  She (chuckle), she came from Mineral, Virginia, which is right outside of a place called Gum Springs, that I've heard about, in Virginia.  And she married my grandfather [William James Thomas] and they moved to Philadelphia.  And my grandfather worked for the Philadelphia Gas Company for thirty-five years before he retired and passed.  My grandmother was the matriarch of the family, and she saw to it that everyone was cared for.  And she was the one that provided all of the needs, whether it's psychological or physical or whatever kind of support you need, including Sunday dinners after church.  Grandma was there.  And later when she was not in such good health, my mother sent me around to stay with her and to look out for her and do things for her.  And while there, I picked up a lot of things myself with her.  I learned how to clean house, how to shovel coal (laughter), to keep the place warm.  I remember she had an old washing machine that kind of broke down.  And she called a repairman to come and, to repair it.  And I was looking over this guy's shoulder and watching what he was doing when he repaired the machine.  And then after he left, and he charged my grandmother.  And, of course, she paid.  So I said, Gran, you don't ever have to, ever have to worry about paying for a washing machine repair again.  If it's breaks down anymore, I can fix it.  So she said, okay.  And sure enough, it did break down again.  And I went down in the basement and took it apart, found a broken part and replaced it, put it back together; worked fine.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was your grandmother on your?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Mother's side.
Speaker 2: What about your grandmother on your father's side?
Speaker 1: My grandmother [Carrie Mann] on my father's side [Clement M. Lupton, Sr.] lived in Trenton, New Jersey.  She worked for this family who was a doctor.  And I used to go visit with her, and we used to go to Trenton to pick her up and bring her back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when she had some time off.  And what I recall mostly, we went to this home where she worked.  And they had this furniture in there that was French Provincial.  And to me, it was the ugliest, gaudiest furniture I had ever seen (laughter).  And I shared that with my mother [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] at the time.  And she said, "Hush, boy, you know what this stuff cost?"  And I said, "Mom, it does not matter what it cost, it is ugly."  But that's what my grandmother did.  She cooked and kept house for the--
Speaker 2: Did you grow to like it?
Speaker 1: The furniture?  No. (laughter) I never, never did, never did, never did.  But--
Speaker 2: What about your grandfather on your father's side?
Speaker 1: My grandfather on my father's side, I only knew, a very short period of time.  He passed while I was still very young, and in fact, as I recall, I think he was a salesman or something.  I'd have to go back and look at the archives to find out for sure.  But my grandfather on my mother's side [William James Thomas], again, like I said, she--he worked for the Philadelphia Gas Company.  And he used to wear this uniform to go around and check gas in people's houses and stuff.  And he worked there for thirty-five years.  It's the only job he had.  He did do a tour, a bit in the Army [United States Army] before he went to the gas company.  And I think that's the job he got when he came out.  I think he was an infantryman, something like that.  I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 29892
Speaker 1: Do you know whether your ancestors were slaves or free?
Speaker 2: From, the research that I've done to this point in tracking my family tree, I have come across names of my great, great-grandparents.  I don't know yet what they did because I haven't been able to research that.  But on the one [mother's, Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] side, I've been able to identify nine generations of my family.  And on my father's [Clement M. Lupton] side, just four.
Speaker 1: Okay, so about what year can you go back to, if you remember?
Speaker 2: About 1850s.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was before, that was pre-Civil War [American Civil War].
Speaker 2: Yeah, about that.
Speaker 1: And what do you know about that group of people?
Speaker 2: They did a fine job in keeping the family going 'cause I came along (laughter).  I don't know about their professions and what they did.  As I look at obituaries and in the Bible--my mother kept a Bible with every name and something.  And all it had really was names and dates of births and deaths.  And it said nothing to occupations and all so I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, or status in terms of slave or free?
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, do--
Speaker 2: Sorry, that's an ongoing research project for me, and I will continue to try to find that out because I'd like to know.
Story_ID: 29893
Speaker 1: What are your favorite stories coming out of that [grandparents'] generation?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Favorite story?
Speaker 1: Or events?
Speaker 2: My favorite story (laughter).  This was a story that was told by my great--I guess he was my uncle.  My grandfather's cousin was, his name was Bo.  Actually, his name was Ellis Daniels, but no one knew him by Ellis Daniels.  His nickname was Bo Weevil.  And it was Bo was short.  And he and my grandfather used to be men about town, so to speak.  And one of the stories was that they used to have a lot hucksters come around selling fruit and vegetables on these wagons pulled by horses.  And what my grandfather used to do (laughter), was to get a watermelon and look over to see it was good and give it to Bo and tell Bo to go ahead and take it to the house while he paid the man.  And as soon as Bo got far enough away, my grandfather used to break and run (laughter) (unclear) and steal watermelons.  I guess, I don't know if they were actual thieves or they were just telling us that, us, the kids at the time for a laugh.  But those are the things that stick with you and you remember those things.  So I remember eating watermelon very good (laughter), and that's how it came about that we got them.  At least we believed what my grandfather and his cousin, Bo, would say.
Story_ID: 29894
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your mother.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary, yeah, Mary Katherine Thomas was her maiden name, and, of course, she married my father who was Clement Merrill Lupton.  And she had four sons, well, which I'm the youngest of my three older brothers.  My oldest brother, Clement, Jr. is deceased.  My next oldest brother, Arthur, is in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], still living in Philadelphia.  And my next brother, Gary, who is a retired Naval officer, is living in New Jersey.  And, of course, I'm a retired Naval officer slash college professor now here in Baltimore [Maryland].  My mother used to come visit my brother when he was deployed, and she'd come visit me.  I was stationed in Panama at one in time, and my mother came to visit in Panama.  My brother was stationed in Spain, and, of course, my mother went over to Spain to visit.  So we provided opportunities for her to get around and see the world.  Otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten very far outside of Philadelphia, which is what I find in the case of most of my family, which I find somewhat depressing.  Most of them have never traveled beyond a hundred miles of Philadelphia.  And since I've been in the military, I've been on every continent on the globe with the exception of Australia.  And I plan to go to Australia on a vacation next year.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's the date and place of birth of your mom?
Speaker 2: Oh, gee, 1918 in Philadelphia as I recall.  Now, the date was February 23 'cause my second oldest brother's birth is February 25, so it was three days from, between him and my mom.
Speaker 1: What kind of stories did she [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] tell you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, about her growing up?  They, they spent a lot of time in Virginia.  Although she was born here, the family came from, as I said, Mineral, Virginia.  Actually, it was the town of Gum Springs [Virginia], which is right outside of Mineral.  Most people never heard of Gum Springs.  But Mineral was the first recognizable or the closest recognizable name of the town to where they were.  And she used to talk about--it was a big family, so she had a lot of interactions with my cousins, or her cousins at the time, and going back and forth.  One of the most colorful of her cousins was a set of twins named Levi Yancy, and his sister who were paternal twins.  And since they were very close in age, they were more like brother and sisters rather than cousins, which is very close to what my situation was growing up.
Story_ID: 29895
Speaker 1: My cousin, Arthur Thomas, who was the son of my mother's [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] brother, I was born in May.  He was born in July.  So we just kind of, two or three months difference in our ages.  And we grew up together.  He was "the fifth" Lupton, and we did all kinds of things together, things I can talk about and some things I can't (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, they won't mind.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) They won't mind?  Oh geez.  We had, like I said, it was a '53 [1953] Pontiac that we called Clyde that was our car.  And so we got around Philadelphia [Philadelphia].  And we were coming from Grants High School in Philadelphia, around 17th Street, 17th and Tioga [West Tioga Street].  And in Philadelphia, there are a lot of streets that are cobblestones and trolley car tracks.  And we were coming around this curve that had cobblestones and trolley car tracks.  And it was wet.  It had rained a little earlier.  And the car skidded and landed, broad-siding another car that was parked on the side.  It did a fair amount of damage to the car.  It didn't look like very much damage to ours.  So we backed up and pulled in front and got out to see who's car it was and, you know, exchange information, etc.  So, as he and I, his name is Arthur, we called him Mope, that was his nickname.  Mope and I were looking over the damage and stuff.  And I looked around and there wasn't anybody around, nobody noticed it.  So I took this piece of paper and wrote on it, "bogus note" (laughter).  And I said, Mope, get in the car.  He said, what?  I said, get in the car.  I'm gonna leave this information.  And I put this in the windshield wiper (laughter) hooked to the car, looked around, got in the car and took off (laughter).  I shouldn't say that.  The person may see this and bring charges.  I don't know.  Anyhow, those are the sort of things that we kind of got into, mischief, but no, nothing really--
Story_ID: 29896
Speaker 1: Let's go back to your father.  Can you tell me--first, what was his name and date of birth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad, Clement Merrill Lupton, Jr. [sic, Sr.] was his name.  And he, his birthday was October 9, 1916.  Yeah, he was two years older than my mom [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton].  He was an auto mechanic.  And he worked at various garages there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And we had, we had a good life, good living.  My dad and mom, we never thought of ourselves as being poor.  He was, you know, we always had everything we needed.  And every once and a while I had to put some cardboard in my sneakers to keep the water out (laughter), because they wore out, they wear out.  But when payday rolled around I usually got a new pair of sneakers.  So we had a good relationship, the family.
Speaker 1: Did he also grow up in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yes, grew up right there in Philadelphia, North Philadelphia.  That's where we lived.  And the gas stations he used to work for, Merit was the gas station [Merit Service Station].  I don't think they have them anymore, Merit gas stations anymore.  And he had a partner named Joe.  Joe's last name escapes me, and they did automobile repair and storage and sold gas on the side in their own business (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did he tell stories about his childhood bringing up?
Speaker 2: Childhood, you want to know.  He grew up in, he's from New York, upstate New York, not New York City.  And he had one brother.  His brother's name was Lloyd [Lupton], where my middle name came from.  And Lloyd, what I remember most about him is that he used to make his own wine (laughter) there in Jersey [New Jersey] where he lived.  And I didn't see very much of him, only when he came to visit or we went over there to visit.  As far as stories that my dad used to tell with them, were stories about horses.  They had had, either he used to ride horses or used to stable horses.  I don't recall him owning any horses so it must have been owned by someone else and he was the keeper or the trainer or whatever it was.  And we used to argue with him about whether or not a jockey was an athlete.  And he used to say, oh, yeah, and he'd talk about how much it took to be a horse--I said, well, it seems to me like the horse would be the athlete rather than the jockey (laughter) (unclear) 'cause the horse is doing all of the running.  Well, my dad didn't like that too much.  He was defending jockeys--talked about all the time was how much skill it took to be a good horseman.  Well, anyway.
Story_ID: 29897
Speaker 1: Did you like to challenge your father?
Speaker 2: Not so much as challenge, but to verify (laughter), to verify.  I know when stereos first came out, my dad bought us a stereo.  And, oh, we loved it.  We used to play it all the time.  In fact, my favorite artist back then was a singer named Dakota Staton.  You probably--most people never even heard of Dakota Staton, but she, she was a jazz singer; loved her.  One day, the stereo broke, and I said, oh, wow.  And I asked Dad [Clement M. Lupton] to fix it.  Dad didn't have any money to fix it.  His position was, you shouldn't have broke it in the first place (laughter).  So I said, okay.  One day when I got just tired of waiting, I took the stereo apart.  My brother came in, and he said, what are you doing?  I said, I'm fixing the stereo.  He said, you'd better get that back together before Dad gets (laughter).  Okay, he's gonna kill you.  So, sure enough I found the piece that was broken on it, and I didn't have any way to replace it so I glued it and glued it and put some scotch tape on it and put it back together.  The thing worked.  Dad came home.  The stereo was working.  He noticed the music, but he didn't ask how it got repaired.  So I never told him (laughter).
Story_ID: 29898
Speaker 1: Other than what you've said, are there favorite stories of recollections of your parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when, we always had a good time around Christmastime.  And things, they just seemed like the cares of the world were kind of relaxed and we could just relax and enjoy each other's company, which is good.  My mother [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] made this big pot of lima beans.  It was still good, they weren't the dried yellowish (unclear) but the green beans, fresh made.  And she had ham hocks that she used to flavor them with and all that stuff.  Oh, it was good.  And my dad [Clement Merrill Lupton] who had, I guess he was working on Christmas Eve, and he didn't work Christmas Day.  Anyway, when he left, the pot was full of these lima beans.  (Laughter) When he came back (laughter), the lima beans were gone.  The rolls my mom made were gone (laughter).  And my dad was livid.  He was, oh.  We swore off, swore us off of eating when he wasn't around anymore.  It worked out fine.  He made my mother do another pot though. (unclear)
Story_ID: 29899
Speaker 1: What drove your family to the Navy [United States Navy]?
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you.  My uncle, my cousin, Mope's father, was in the Navy.  He was a Boatswain's Mate, which was unusual at the time because usually, if you were in the Navy, you were a Steward, and that was it.
Speaker 1: The Navy had a history.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Mope wanted to follow in his father's footsteps and join the Navy.  So he went down to take the test to get into the Navy and failed it.  He came back, so I said, look, the test can't be that bad.  I will tutor you.  I tutored him.  And he went down, took the test again, failed it the second time.  And he came back, and I said, look, let's try a different focus here.  He studied, studied again.  The third time he went down to take the test, he failed it.  I said, there's no test that is that tough that you can't pass it after a third time even when you were tutored by me.  Let me see this test.  I went down and took the test, passed the thing.  The next thing I knew I had my hand up in the air (laughter), was being sworn in.  This was about May, and I was scheduled to go in August.  And I kind of, that's how I got started.
Story_ID: 29900
Speaker 1: We stopped with your getting in the Navy [United States Navy].  But I wanna go back if I can.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember this guy smacking me on the butt when I came out, and I'm still looking for him (laughter).  But beyond that, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], we lived at 1929 Ridge Avenue in Philadelphia.  My grandparents lived around the corner on 19th Street, 1312 North 19th Street.  And the elementary school that I went to, I don't recall kindergarten.  That's, we're talking sixty years ago.
Speaker 1: Did they have kindergarten back in those days?
Speaker 2: They probably didn't which is probably (laughter) why I don't remember.  But anyhow, I went to General George G. Meade Elementary School, I remember that, at 18th [Street] and Oxford [Street] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I started in 1953, was it '53 [1953]?  Yeah.  No, I came out of Central [High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] in '59 [1959], '56 [1956], '53 [1953], finished in '53 [1953].  I had a lot of good friends there in high school.  Some of them are still my friends.  They're still around, I mean we remain in contact still, one of which is Marvin Height who is still living in Philadelphia, one of my friends from day one, as I recall.  I finished George G. Meade Elementary School, and I went to Vaux, Robert Vaux Jr. High School at 19th [Street] and Masters [Master Street], not 19th and Masters, it's 24th [Street] and Master in Philadelphia, North Philadelphia.  It was a good experience in junior high school because you're more mature and meeting people.  And they had this section for achieving students.  Mr. Lum (ph.) was the teacher who handled the advanced teachers, as they were, and I was part of that.  We were in the B-1 section, 7-B-1 and 8-B-1 and 9-B-1, etc.  And Height, it was Marvin Height, Booker Farier (ph.) and William Lupton.  We used to compete with each other for grades and for just about everything in school.  And that's how we got through school.  When I got to the ninth grade, I had an opportunity to go to Central High School.  They wanted me to do my ninth year at Central.  But I said, no, because if I had done that I wouldn't be able to go to the Vaux Junior Prom or senior prom.  And I wanted to go to the prom because I had this little girlfriend that I wanted to (laughter) to take to my prom with me.  So I stayed at Vaux until I graduated from Vaux.  And I graduated from Vaults in 1956 and I went to Central High School.  Central High School class of 211 in North Philadelphia.  Central High School was a good experience for me.  It was an advanced high school.  In fact, there were 2,300 students in the student body of Central High School of which two thousand of them were Jewish.  The remaining three hundred were maybe forty or fifty Italians, maybe thirty or forty African Americans and the rest just kind of Americans.  And whenever there was a Jewish holiday, you could hear echoes in the school (laughter) because everybody was gone.  And the class of 211, I made a lot of friends when I got there.  And we just last year celebrated our fiftieth anniversary at Central High School.  And some of the guys, most of them that I started in high school with were still around.  In fact, I was commenting that at Central High School, [Reverend] Dr. Jeremiah Wright was one of my classmates in the class of 211.  Bill Cosby is a graduate of Central High School, and he was in the class of 207.  As I was looking through some of the materials I received from your organization [The HistoryMakers], whenever I saw someone from Philadelphia, I check and see if they were from Central High School.  And more often than not, they were.  So, it was very rewarding in that regard.  The thing I remember most about Central High School, my first year at college was a piece of cake because it was a repeat of what I had done at Central High School.  Central High School had this thing, if you did well at Central High School, when you graduated, instead of getting a diploma, you could earn an Associates Degree from Central High School.  I wasn't aware of that at the time.
Story_ID: 29901
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna take you back though, just if I could.  Do you know how your parents [Clement Merrill Lupton, Sr. and Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton] met?
Speaker 2: How they met?  As I recall, they met in school because my grandparents [Annie Golden Thomas and William James Thomas] had migrated from Virginia up to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And my father who grew up in New York had migrated to Philadelphia, and I think they met at school.  But, I'm pretty sure that's where it was.
Story_ID: 29902
Speaker 1: Okay, I also wanna take you back to elementary school.  What memory do you have of that experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, elementary school?  Elementary school [Gen. George G. Meade Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was Vivian Roy, Marvin Height, Herbie Gilbert.  These are all people, I guess I was more impressed with the people.  And there was a Huckster who had a stand out in the yard, the playground area for the school.  And he used to sell mustard pretzels.  That was the big staple in Philadelphia at the time.  And we used to call him Mustard Pretzel Joe.  He had this stand there.  And whenever we went out for recess, we all used to run over to the stand and get mustard pretzels.  And I could still hear Mustard Pretzel Joe saying, "come a next, come a next, come a next, the bell, the bell" (laughter), trying to get all that he could from us before the bell rang, and we had to go back inside the school.
Speaker 1: What about your, do you have favorite teachers or mentors from that period of time?
Speaker 2: From Meade, the only, no, that there.  From [Robert] Vaux [Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I do.  But from Meade, their names are still a blur.  In fact, I've got, I brought one of my class books from Meade School and from Vaux that I can share.
Story_ID: 29903
Speaker 1: What about your early childhood and the street you lived on?  Were there people there outside of your family that had a significant influence on you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a whole group of people.  We lived on this street, we originally lived on 1929 Ridge Avenue.  And we moved up to 2316 North Beachwood Street which is further north in North Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And there we had, oh, all kind of neighbors on both sides.  On Ridge Avenue, we didn't neighbors on the other side of the street because the other side of the street was Girard College [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And at that time, they didn't allow us in the Girard College.  And we used to, over on the left side playing, every once and a while, either a baseball or a soccer ball or something would come over the wall of Girard College.  And whenever we saw that, we'd grab it and run and hide because we knew that they'd be up on the wall looking for it.  We weren't able to go to this at the time, but they supplied us with the balls that we needed for either baseball or football or (laughter) or whatever it was when it came over the fence.  Anyhow, when we went to 2316 North Beachwood Street, we had neighbors on both sides and across the street.  It was a small street.  And they were doing--there was, a variety of people.  I guess it was just a microcosm of the city there in that we had one guy who was a former military guy who had been injured and he had a prosthesis on his leg.  And he used to walk (unclear).  We had school teachers across from us and next door to us.  We had some factory workers.  We had, there were no entrepreneurs.  At that time, there wasn't very much opportunity for entrepreneurship, at least not in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: So how did living around these people shape your life and the person that you became?
Speaker 2: Well, it shaped me in learning how to interact with people on different situations when I was able to recognize when a situation was hostile and it's time to get out of there, at times when things are compatible and helpful.  And we used to have block parties and stuff, and you'd see women put out their food and stuff, and we'd see who the greedy people were (laughter) and who were playing the games and having a good time.  There were a couple of, there wasn't much of a drug problem in the neighborhood, but there were gangs.  Gangs then weren't like gangs today in that what it meant to be in a gang, there in Philly at that time was your ability to fight, to use your fists and things.  And if you couldn't defend yourself, then you were a punk.  But what usually happens is, if you were accosted by a bully or something and you fought him, even though you may not have won the fight, but you fought back.  So you got respect for that.  And that was usually the extent of it, none of this stuff that they have today.

Speaker 1: Talk about the sights and sounds and smells that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Alright, the sights.  I mean people, we used to walk down to the market, Ridge Avenue [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was one of the commercial thoroughfares there.  And we used to go down there, and there was a farmer's market there at Ridge and Girard Avenue.  And we used to go over to the Farmer's Market and we'd see all kinds of veggies and fruits and people selling stuff.  And right across from the farmer's market was this place called, "Hoagie Haven", which, you know, when you're making hoagies and the spices and the meats and stuff just permeate the place.  And there was a record store called Paramount Record Shop.  We used to go in there to buy our records at the time.  Of course, we used to buy, we were buying 33s [long-playing record album with 33 1/3 rotations per minute], and most people don't know what a 33 or 78 [long-playing record album with 78 rotations per minute] is nowadays.  But, you know, it was 78s and then they migrated to the 45s [long-playing record album with 45 rotations per minute] and buying 45s, records.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite music?
Speaker 2: Oh, Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes (laughter).  And then Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.  There was Shep and the Limelights.  There was Harvey and the Moonglows (laughter), those kind of, those guys.
Speaker 1: All the old (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah (unclear) for the most part (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29905
Speaker 1: Let's talk about--go back to school again.  What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I started off being a good, conscientious student and ended up being kind of self-centered and cocky.  Now, (laughter) let me explain what I mean by that.  If I applied myself, schoolwork came easy, math, history, English, all of it, no problem.  So I finally got to the point where I recognized that, you know, if it wasn't too challenging then I could explore other things.  And at [Robert] Vaux Junior High, particularly, they used to bring in these guest speakers at assembly.  And they used to tell us about, you know, what's available as far as occupations and things that we ought to be thinking about doing.  And I recall sitting there thinking to myself, who's the bum of month, coming in.  Now, where did I get that expression from?  Well, that's what Joe Louis [Joseph Louis Barrow, boxer] used to call his opponents when he used to knock 'em out, he'd say the bum of the month (laughter).  So I used to sit there, saying, ah, who is the bum of the month this week and what does he have to tell me that I don't know?  And true enough, he'd come in and say something, and I'd sit there and listen to what he's saying and become very critical.  And I'm saying, you really can't do this or that's not for us and that sort of thing.  So in that regard, that's how I referred to cockiness.
Speaker 1: So you liked to challenge your teachers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a critical thinker.  I'll put it that way.
Story_ID: 29906
Speaker 1: So what would you say was your earliest encounter with science?
Speaker 2: My earliest encounter with science was kind of an accident.  We had--I don't know what had happened.  We were in the house and either the hot water heater wasn't working or it had broken down or something.  Anyhow, we had no hot water.  And it was bath time so I was boiling some water on the stove and I was gonna pour it in the bathtub.  And I recall when the water was boiling, I got some mits and I lifted this pot up off the stove, and I was gonna take it into the bathroom.  And my brother came behind me and bumped me and I spilled the whole pot of boiling water on my chest which as I recall felt like ice cold.  And I put the pot down and I was calling my mother [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton], oh, oh, look what he did.  And I was concerned about spilling the water on the floor.  And then I took my shirt to pull it up to show my mother how wet it was, and I looked down, and I had no skin (laughter) to about my waist because it had all boiled off.  My mother grabbed me and took me out the house and around to this hospital which is on the other side of the wall there that was Girard College [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And this doctor was putting this salve and stuff on me, and I'm looking, saying what is this he's doing?  And he was explaining what he was doing 'cause I was, between tears I was trying to listen to find out what he was doing because I was always conscious of what was happening to me.  And I made the connection and said, hum, this guy's a doctor and I see what the doctor is doing, putting this salve, it looked like salve on me.  And that was supposed to have some kind of reaction with the skin and the blood and the stuff and then he wrapped it.  And I got to thinking about that, and I thought well,--
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Oh, I guess I was about ten [years old], maybe eleven, somewhere around there.
Story_ID: 29907
Speaker 1: Now, this critical thinking that you were doing and this challenging of your teachers, this way of thought, did you bring that with you or did you learn that through connection with science and other things?
Speaker 2: Well, I never, I never did critical thinking maliciously.  It was out of a thirst for knowledge, wanting to know, well, why is this?  And it wasn't enough to just say "because I said so."  That didn't fly with me.  I wanted to know why.  And if I had the facts, then I was happy, I was satisfied with that.  And I found out through the years, whenever I was trying to make a decision, whether or not to do something or not, I'd ask myself, well, what's the effect of this?  If I do this, what's gonna happen?  If I don't do it, what will the offshoot be?  And then I'd consider it and then make what I considered the best choice at the time.
Speaker 1: Was there anyone that you were emulating when you were going through that kind of thinking process?
Speaker 2: Well, I kind of had an advantage here.  I had three older brothers [Clement Lupton, Jr., Arthur Lupton, and Gary Lupton], and I used to watch what they did.  And if I saw them do something that caused them a problem, I'd say, ah, well, I'm not gonna do that.  I said, I've learned from that.  And I had these three brothers, and I used to watch them and probably learn from them.
Story_ID: 29908
Speaker 1: And now, I'm gonna move on to your high school experience.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You get to high school [Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and you've now made the jump from elementary school there.  What was the value of education in your family and what did you see as the purpose of high school for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, my parents [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton and Clement Merrill Lupton, Sr.] insisted that all of us, my four [sic, three] brothers [Clement Lupton, Jr., Arthur Lupton, Gary Lupton] and I, finish high school.  That wasn't a choice we had.  That was the house rule.  So that never even crossed our minds not to finish.  And all four of us did finish high school.  I finished at Central and my one brother who was the hardest finished at Dobbins [later Murrell Dobbins Area Vocational High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and the other two finished at North, pardon me, Northeast High School.  But we all finished, all in different areas, but, you know, finished.  I was in the academic track.  They had vocation--in fact, Dobbins was a vocational high school as opposed to an academic high school.  And my brother who was studying art at the time, he eventually went into the Air Force [United States Air Force] and stayed there for about three years and then came out doing other things. But anyhow, high school I found out that it's very rewarding if you have the support that you need.  I met this guy named Jack Oshkosh (ph.).  Jack Oshkosh (ph.) was struggling in high school, and I used to help him once in a while.  Jack, in his junior year, got a "C", a "C".  And his parents bought him a brand new 1958 Impala convertible with the continental kit on the back--I'll never forget this, for earning a "C" in English (laughter), not even the hard subjects, you know.  And I thought, man, what is this?  Of course, most of the, my classmates in Central turned out to be either doctors or lawyers, preachers.  And of that mix, the overwhelming majority were doctors, followed very closely by lawyers.  Of course, these were mostly Jewish kids, and they had the support.  There was maybe a dozen African Americans in Central High School in my class.  There was [Rev.] Jeremiah [Wright] who became a preacher.  There was Jesse Tripp.  Jesse Tripp joined the Navy [United States Navy] for a while, and then he, what does Jesse do?  Jesse was an entertainer or a singer or something like that.  There was John Long or Wade Long who is a retired teacher.  And he's in Kentucky.  And one was a photographer.  That was Jay Lloyd and the reason I'm kind of half way familiar with this is that we just had, last year our fiftieth reunion.  And I went back there and met all those guys.  In fact, I've got the book to show you where we first started at Central, and fifty years later, what we've been doing and what we look like (unclear).  Most of them were unrecognizable (laughter), including myself.  I'll put that in there.
Story_ID: 29909
Speaker 1: But the, now just quickly, did this--what drove you to go in the direction that you went into in terms of what is your vision of where you were going to end up and your parents' vision of where you're going to end up?  Did they coincide?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew, I knew I didn't wanna get caught up in what I characterized as the Philadelphia syndrome.  Okay, and what is that?  In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], if you go to high school and you're not about anything, if you finish high school, that's incidental, but then you drop out and you make it off the streets, hustling or you get a part-time job making minimum wage and you kind of drop out from society and just become--there's no kind way to put this, you become a bum.  And unfortunately, that was the fate of far too many of the friends of mine that either finished or didn't finish school.
Story_ID: 29910
Speaker 1: Did you have what you'd call "good white friends," Jewish friends?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, sure did.  Shelly Lasenhoff (ph.) was one of my good friends.  In fact, I was lieutenant commander out in California at the Naval Force Graduate School when I was walking down the hallway, and I had my nametag on, of course, I was in uniform at this time.  And this guy stopped me and says, "Hey, I know you."  And I said, "Nah, I don't think so," because he didn't look familiar to me at all.  He said, "Your name is Bill Lupton."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You went to Central High school [Philadlephia, Pennsylvania]."  I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You were in Ms. Armbruster's (ph.) homeroom class."  I said, "Yeah."  So, he says, "I used to sit right behind you."  I said, "No, you didn't."  I said, "I knew the guy who sat behind me.  He was Shelly Lasenhoff."  He said, "That's me (laughter)!"
Story_ID: 29911
Speaker 1: We were talking about your Jewish friends in high school and their aspirations, and could you remind me of when was it that you started--and you also talked about what you called the Philadelphia experience [sic, "Philadelphia Syndrome"].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For you, when did that transition come?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned that the world is a very accommodating place.  If you choose to sit on the wayside and let the world pass you by, it will most certainly do just that.  And I didn't want to be passed by, and I looked at what my classmates [at Central High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] were doing and what they--where they were gonna go to school.  And back in '59 [1959], there weren't any counselors coming to talk to black students about, you know, you need to be going to this college, you think about this college or whatever.  So I didn't get any of that.  In fact, I didn't even know what an HBCU [Historically Black College or University] was until I was an adult.  But I knew that I wanted to do more than what was programmed in the "Philadelphia Syndrome."  And to punctuate that, I went and got me a sweat shirt, a little sweat shirt, and I put "Lupton University" on it.  And I used to come back to Central [High School] and walk around with this shirt that said Lupton University on it.  And my classmates, hey, where is that school?  I said, oh, that's one of my family's schools.  Oh, I never heard of that.  I said, well, you will (laughter).  And it was my way of identifying at the time because they had already, they were gonna go to Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or La Salle [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvnia]  or Saint Joe's [Saint Joseph's University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvnia], all the colleges around there.  No one was recruiting me.  So I recruited myself, put Lupton University on it.  When I went to this fiftieth reunion of the class of 211, Philadelphia, I was reminded of that (laughter).  A guy said, "Oh, I remember you.  You had that Lupton University sweat shirt on."  I said, "Yeah, that was me."  And they, I just knew I wanted to be successful.  And I didn't wanna be bypassed by my classmates.
Speaker 1: For your friends and family, what did they see as the role of education in your life?
Speaker 2: They all saw it as an essential item, but no one saw it as critical enough to go into debt for.  My parents [Mary Katherine Thomas Lupton and William Merrill Lupton, Sr.], were--as they made enough to provide for this family of six, they did not have discretionary money where they could just, you know, and I don't know what their credit rating was at the time 'cause they were buying the house that we were in.  I knew that, but they couldn't afford to send me to college.  I asked my grandparents, and my grandparents, he didn't think that it was important enough to go into debt for and they didn't have the cash.
Story_ID: 29912
Speaker 1: Did your parents finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had that history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, had that history, and they wanted to make sure that all of their sons did likewise.
Speaker 1: Did you read a lot during that period?
Speaker 2: I was around my neighborhood known as a bookworm, yeah (laughter).  In fact, I used to enjoy reading.  Well, I had my uncle tell me one time that, boy, you need to give your brain a rest (laughter).  So I used to--
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you like to read?
Speaker 2: History books.  I say that because what got me through school even at all levels was math and computer science.  Now, why is that?  When I do heavy reading, it's like a sedative to me.  I'll read for ten or fifteen minutes and my eyelids will slam shut.  And I'll snooze for a half hour or forty-five minutes.  Then I'll wake up and read another two or three lines, doze off again.  And I'd sit there for hours and only read one or two pages.  So I used to try to make a concerted effort to keep my eyes open in trying to read the stuff and get some benefit from the time that I was investing.  But on the other hand, for math, a math problem, do a math problem, I'm working with my hands, and that's boom, knock it out and do another one, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And that worked out well.  Computer science the same way.  You'll write a program, [making fast movement sounds], you put it in the computer and you get sudden service, you know, there it is.  And if you did something wrong, you go back and troubleshoot it [making fast movement sounds], correct it and put it in and you get the result.  It's not like reading about the War of 1812 or reading about the history of Napoleon and what happened in France or wherever.  So that's what sustained me.  And I was, the way I survived, well, I would do my math and computing stuff.  It wouldn't take me long to do that at all.  And then I used the rest of the time, the bulk of the time doing my reading because I'd read and sleep and read and sleep until I finally got through it.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about sports?  Did you, were you active in sports?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've always been a big sports buff, and I used to, in high school at least, used to run low hurdles.  They don't have low hurdles any more (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was distance (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What distance?
Speaker 2: A hundred and ten yards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used to be able to run fast enough to avoid embarrassment, but never fast enough to win anything.  And even when I got to grad[uate] school when I was out in Monterrey [Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, California], I said, well, maybe I'll try distance running.  And I used to run distance.  They had this meet at Monterrey.  It was, I think the course was something like eight miles is what it was.  And it must have been, oh, twenty five, thirty runners that day, including myself.  We took off, and I'm running [making sounds of fast strides] went around this cross country kind of track.  When I got back I thought, something's wrong 'cause when I got back, there was no crowd.  There was no tape across the finish line or anything.  And the place where the race started I saw what was the timekeeper coming out there buttoning his coat.  So I said, "What happened?"  He said, "Oh, we thought you had finished, thought you had gone (laughter)."  I had run this course, and I was so bad, everybody had finished ahead of me.  They had gone to their lockers and taken a shower and I was still out there running.  So I said, well, maybe cross country is not my cup of tea either.  But I've always enjoyed.  I'm a big football fan now.  I have tickets for the [Baltimore] Ravens [National Football League].
Story_ID: 29913
Speaker 1: Okay, another side question before I move on.  What was the role that religion played in your life, in your family's life?
Speaker 2: Oh, a big part, big part, particularly, when I was staying with my grandmother [Annie Golden Thomas].  She was one of the ushers, and every Sunday we had to get up and we'd go down to National Temple Baptist Church [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And either we went ahead of her or we were in tow with her.  We liked to go ahead of her though because right across the street from the church was this pharmacy, and they had a little candy shop in there.  And I used to take her money and go over there and buy some bubble gum or candy or something so we'd have something to keep us company while we were in church (laughter).  But every Sunday, without fail, we were going.  It wasn't a choice that we had.  It was expected and we went, my brother and I and my cousins.  It was an enjoyable experience.  Of course, I didn't see myself as a sinner so I didn't figure I needed to stay there much more than Sundays.  We kind of balked at going there on Wednesdays or to prayer meetings and the Whosoever Will Club and, oh, what are these other--they had several different organizations within the church that are actually fundraisers as I saw it.
Speaker 1: Now, by this time you were a critical thinker.  Did you ever question the religion, the teachings that were prevalent or did you go that way?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  My grandmother would have my hide if I (laughter) (unclear).  No, the way it was presented, when you compare the, Darwin's Theory with the Big Bang Theory, you know, which is more plausible about--I'd have to err on the side of religion because that's the way I was brought up.  And all of the things that happened were governed by some higher being.  And I recognize this and therefore, I believe.
Story_ID: 29914
Speaker 1: Before I move from high school to after, do you remember your high school graduation?  What were the things that stand out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember, I remember being relieved.  I remember standing on the steps of Central High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and swearing an oath that I would never set foot in another educational institution as long as I lived (laughter) because I had had education up to here, and that was it.  Oh, boy, and nothing was further from the truth.  I think every year since I've been out of Central High School, I've been in some school of some type doing something, either in the military [United States Navy] or with the military or out of the military.
Speaker 1: So, now there's graduation, and you've gone through the graduation exercises and you're now a man.  What was the first thing you did?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I did, it wasn't planned.  You know, I--I'll tell you what the first thing I did was.  Before I took this oath, I had gone, there was, Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, Pennsylvnia] has an Ogontz campus [later renamed Penn State Abington] which is right up from Central High School.  Now, in my experience, once you finished elementary school, you showed up and went to junior high school.  When you finished junior high school, the natural progression is to go to high school.  So I thought the natural progression once you finish high school is to go to college.  And here was Penn State's campus right up the street, so I went up there.  And I sat down and was registering for classes.  And then they started sounding ugly and asking me about things like tuition and where my funding was.  I had no idea what they were talking about.  So I was kindly escorted to the door and out, and that's when I got with my cousin [Arthur "Mope" Thomas].  And he was trying to get into the Navy and I took his test (laughter), trying to get him in.  It didn't work.  So I went down there and took the test, boom, boom, boom and I said, I do, and that was it.  That wasn't planned at all.  That was--
Speaker 1: Well, describe, I'm sorry, go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying that wasn't planned at all.  In fact, my cousin never did come into the Navy.  He did do a tour in the [United States] Army, but he didn't make a career out of it.
Story_ID: 29915
Speaker 1: So describe your early [United States] Naval experience?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I was a seaman--I went to boot camp out at, in [Naval Station] Great Lakes [North Chicago, Illinois] and finished boot camp.  And my first assignment was aboard the USS Forestall.  And I remember Christmas of 1959, I was a fantail sentry on board the Forestall.  It was in port at Norfolk [Virginia].  And my job, I had this M-16 rifle on my shoulder and I used to pace back and forth on the fantail of the ship, making sure nobody came aboard.  Nobody came aboard.  It was Christmas.  Everybody was gone off the ship.  The only thing I had to worry about was the, they had the big rat guards out there, and make sure that no rats came (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: There were some big rats down there?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, some big rats.  So that was my first duty station.  And while there I, I was stationed during general quarters which is when they fight the ship.  My general quarters station was five decks below the water level in a magazine [a store for arms, ammunition, explosives and provisions for use in military operations], a magazine that was filled from floor to ceiling with 250-pound bombs.  I couldn't count them all.  And our job, there must have been about twelve or fifteen of us down there.  Our job was to take these bombs, load them on the elevator so they could be transported up to the flight deck.  And while we're down there, we got to talking back and forth, and I was asking around to see who was all down there with me so I'd know what kind of plan of action to take in case it was necessary, okay.  None of the guys I was down there with had any college at all.  Most of them had dropped out of high school, and the Navy was their refuge in a significant way.  And whereas that's not a bad thing, the Navy salvaged a lot of people--the military is good for that. I got to thinking, when we fight this ship, when we're at sea, the enemy we're fighting mostly at that time at least were the Russians.  And the Russians had these things called submarines.  And submarines have these things called torpedoes.  And I was saying to myself, this critical thinking again, what happens if we go to war and the submarine shoots a torpedo, where is it gonna hit?  It's gonna come right to these magazines.  And these magazines are gonna go up in a big ball of fire, and I could just see myself on the top of this big ball of fire, right down there.  That's not the place to be.  And then I asked myself, well, what about these guys up on the flight deck?  What happens to them?  Well, they're in the airplanes.  They fly off to safety (laughter), fly off somewhere and don't have to worry about it.  So I said, hum, that's what I need to do.  I need to get up and get into an airplane so I can be more effective.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: Well, it became obvious the only persons that flew airplanes for the Navy were those who had college educations, college degrees.  So I immediately enrolled, and I was onboard the ship, so I enrolled into this correspondence college program that The Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] had aboard ship.  And I was doing math and computers and all kind of stuff to get to two years of college credits.
Speaker 1: Did anybody give you advice on how to do this?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: How did you learn?
Speaker 2: I went to the ship's library to see what was available.  And they had these flyers advertising this program.  So I just took one and applied, and they started sending me books and lessons.  And I did them and sent them back and I got graded for them.  And I got college credit for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29916
Speaker 1: (unclear) Now, you get, all of this college credit.  Did you get a degree out of it?
Speaker 2: Well, I accumulated two years worth of college credits.  In the meantime, I had gone from seaman apprentice to seaman, and then I took this test for, a placement test, if you will.  And the chief petty officer who gave me the test said, "Oh, you qualify for fire control technician."  Well, now, I'm from the Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] ghetto.  When you talk to me about fire control, I get an image of a fire truck with a siren wailing and this guy is hanging off the back of it flying down the street and then going into smoky buildings.  So I said, "Nah, nah, no, that's not for me."  He said, "Well, then there is electronic technician."  I says, "Okay, I'll take that 'cause that had a little more meaning to me."  It never dawned on me that the fire control he's talking about was fire control for the weapons (laughter).  Like I said, I'm from the Philadelphia ghetto.  I didn't know what he was talking about.  So I decided to go with the electronics technician.  And they sent me to what the Navy calls E-N-E-P [sic, ETA school, electrical technical "A"] schools, a preparation tactic school and back in [Naval Station] Great Lakes [North Chicago, Illinois] again.  And I learned how to become an electronics technician.  Then I came back to the Forestall [USS Forestall] as a third-class petty officer.  So all this time, I'm still accumulating credits for my extension course.  Then when I got two years of college credit, the Navy had this program called "The Seaman to Admiral Program."  And I applied for that.  And I got picked up for it.
Speaker 1: How did you find out about that program?
Speaker 2: Again, digging through what was available in the--they didn't call it a public affairs office.  It's, oh, it's the education and training, education and training office.  And they have all these programs listed.  It was a matter of, nobody was coming out saying, hey, this is available, you need to try this, that and the other.  If you got it, you had to go dig it out for yourself.  So that's what I did.
Story_ID: 29917
Speaker 1: How many African Americans were on the ship [USS Forrestal] with you and who were senior to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, everybody was senior to me (laughter) on that ship.  I really don't know what the breakdown was, except for in my division, there was one.  That was me.  And I think they probably signed off on my request to go to the Seaman Admiral Program to kind of get rid of me, which was fine by me (laughter).  I didn't have any problem with that.  When I got selected, there were fifty [United States] Navy-wide selectees for the program of which there was one African American.  When I went to Newport, Rhode Island which is where the Navy boot camp was for officers, there was one in my program.  There was two others that I saw there.  I don't know which program they were in.  But anyhow, they had, when I finished the program, they had sent me orders to go to Galveston, Texas to go aboard a ship, a destroyer.  Before commissioning, the aviation road show came through, and they started talking about flying airplanes and what flight pay was all about.  And I thought, hum, I can do that.  So I signed up for that.
Speaker 1: You (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 29918
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you go from the [USS] Forrestal to Newport [Rhode Island, Navy boot camp for officers]?
Speaker 2: Yes, but there was one intermediate station because it took me a little over, about three years to accumulate the college credits.  In the meantime, I had left the Forestall and I was, I had to--got stationed in Panama.  And I was in Panama.  And I made E5 which was, yeah, Forestall and it was the, pardon me, [USS] Northampton which was the cruiser, and then from the Northampton, I went to Panama.  And while I was in Panama was when my approval came through.  And I left from Panama as an E5 to the second class petty officer.  And I went from there to Newport, Rhode Island.
Speaker 1: And how long was Newport?
Speaker 2: Newport was almost a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I opted for aviation, I left Newport and went to Pensacola, Florida, which is where I went to flight school.  Flight school was another year and a half, but I was the top dog down there because I had got commissioned in Newport.  So when I came to flight school, I was already an ensign, and my classmates were still cadets--I wouldn't call them cadets, mid-shipmen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what year was this?
Speaker 2: This was in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].  So the Vietnam War is getting hot and heavy?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, when I finished flight school, I went from there to San Diego, California where I joined the RAG, which is Replacement Air Group.  And I was in the RAG for, oh, six months, getting ready.  And then I went to my first duty station which was the AW-112, the AW-115, deployed aboard USS Ranger.  And that's when I went to Vietnam aboard the Ranger.  And we were supposed to be on six-months cruises.  I never had a six-month cruise, nine-month was the smallest cruise I had.  And it was almost a year, eleven-month cruise was the other cruise.  But I was flying off the Ranger, and I became a Centurion.  A Centurion is an aviator that gets a hundred traps on board a carrier.  It's a hundred landings.
Speaker 1: Okay, we call them modified crashes.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Modified crashes.  Then I learned that any landing that you walk away from is a good landing.
Story_ID: 29919
Speaker 1: So when did you get to Monterrey [Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, California]?
Speaker 2: I went to Monterrey after I had finished my combat cruise.  And after the combat cruise, I was in Vietnam from '66 [1966], '67 [1967], '68 [1968], came back in '69 [1969], and I went to Monterrey in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I finished the baccalaureate program in '71 [1971], stayed on for the master's program, and finished that in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: So this is when you decided that computer science was the thing for you?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I had gone to electronic technician "A" school while I was enlisted.  And this seemed like a good follow-on to that.  So they were complimentary, so I went to computer science at Monterrey and finished in two years for my undergraduate program because I had already accumulated the two years.  And then I stayed on for the master's, earned another master's in computer science.

Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pick up.  I'm Jim Stith, James Stith.  I'm the interviewer.  We have Steve [Scott] Stearns who is the videographer and Larry Crowe who is observing, and we're interview Dr. [William Lloyd] Lupton.  Today's date is the 14th of July, 19-2010 [July 14, 2010].  Okay, when we finished last, you were beginning to talk about Vietnam.  And, so this is about 1965 when you went to Vietnam?
Speaker 2: '67 [1967].
Speaker 1: '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're now going to Vietnam in 1967.  Would you please talk about that experience?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was aboard the USS Ranger which is an aircraft carrier.  And I was with the [VMF]AW-115 [Marine Fighting Squadron] which is the AW squadron of E-2's.  That was the aircraft that I flew, the E-2 Hawkeye.  And we conducted cyclic opts over there.  What that means is we have the air wing launching, and we have either attack aircraft or fighter aircraft under our control.  And we would, vector them to targets in whatever our mission happened to be.  For example, we had a mission called the Skimmer-Scrapper mission which we'd have a small attack aircraft like an A-4 and would have them fly along the coast looking for "blistics" (ph.).  What is that?  That's water-borne logistics craft.  In order words, barges (laughter).  The [United States] Air Force interdicted during the daylight because they could see what kind of traffic the Viet Cong had going up the coast.  At night, if they couldn't move anything during the day because of the Air Force's intervention, then they would try to move it at night along the coast on barges.  And they would have these barges connected and going up the coast.  Well, our "skimmer" would be flying over looking for these barges.  And then as soon as he spotted something, we've got an ID on [identify] them, okay.  We ventured the "skimmer" off and bring the "scrapper" in.  The "scrapper" is an A-6 or an aircraft with lots of 250-pound bombs and maybe even some 500-pound bombs and they come in and drop the bombs on these water-borne logistics crafts.  And we would, after we decked-ed them in, look out the window and see the big fire ball (laughter).  And we would do that until there were no more targets out there.
Speaker 1: What was the relationship between the Navy and the Air Force on these kinds of missions?
Speaker 2: Well, we considered that the Air Force was out there playing decoys for us, (laughter) so the Navy came in to do the job, nah I'm just (unclear).  We, actually, we rarely ever saw the Air Force because they were operating from land or from some farm base.  And they'd come in and fly over the target, drop their ordinance in and fly back.  And we would rarely, rarely see them.
Story_ID: 29921
Speaker 1: Okay, were you married at this time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what did your family think of what you were doing?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't have a problem with it.  They were supportive of what I was doing, and everything was going fine except for one night I spent ten years of my life in Vietnam (laughter).  And what was that about?  We were out flying a mission and things were going well.  And we must have taken a hit or something.  We don't know for sure.  But the result was that we couldn't get the landing gear down.  It was hung up on the aircraft.  We called back to the ship and told the ship what our situation was.  They had us do a fly-by where we fly over the ship and they put a big spot light on there and said, "Okay, Liberty"--that was our call sign.  "Yeah, Liberty your starboard gear is hung up and your signal is 'Bingo.'"  Bingo means that you fly off the ship and go to a land base and land because you can't land aboard the ship.  You can't land aboard a ship if you have hung ordinance.  You can't land aboard the ship if you have landing gear that's inoperative.  And, or you can't land aboard a ship if you're a wet wing.  That means it's, you've got a leak, and it's, you've got fluid, fuel flying all over the place.  So we had to "Bingo" to Da Nang [Vietnam].  Well, none of us, us on our crew had ever been to Da Nang, so we did a little computer to see if we had enough fuel to get there.  And we had enough just to make it.  Okay, we took off for Da Nang.  At Da Nang, what they had was a piece of land, maybe, maybe twelve, fifteen hundred feet that they had dug out.  And it was just dirt, and they had some pots or something that they used for lighting.  When we got there, of course, we were sending transmissions back to the ship about what our status was.  And we finally saw this landing strip, so we did a fly over to get oriented.  And we came back around to make a pass to come down to land.  And as we did--and this is about, you know, 2:30, 3:00 o'clock in the morning, no stars.  It's overcast.  You can't see your hand in front of your face.  As we were making our approach, we had just gotten over the threshold which is the end of the runway, then it looked like the Fourth of July. Boom, boom, mortars going off (laughter).  And as we touched down, the gear kind of--it was still hung, but it was enough wheel down that we didn't scrape the wing.  So we kind of held it with the other two gears we had.  This [United States] Air Force guy that was waving us on and directing us, when these mortars started coming in, he threw down the wands and took off (laughter).  Well, our job was how to get this thing stopped so we can get the heck out of there.  We finally got it stopped.  We didn't have any fuel left.  Once we crossed the threshold, the prop stopped.  So we just kind of dead stick for landing it, yes.  And when we got the thing stopped and we saw in which direction this Air Force guy had started running, we got out of the aircraft, unstrapped and took off right behind him (laughter).  The ground was still shaking from these mortars and things going off.  At the end of this, it seemed like we were running a mile, but it was probably only maybe thirty to forty feet (unclear), they had these sandbags stacked up from about three feet.  And this guy took a leap and just went over the sandbags down into this chute.  We didn't know any better, saw what he was doing, and he was there on the ground.  So we hit that sandbag (laughter), over and down in the chute.  And as we were tumbling down, these Air Force guys who were there were sitting there with their guns trained on this chute watching who was coming down there.  And here we came, boom, boom, boom.  My crew, we were in an A-2.  We had four officers and one enlisted guy so it was five of us in there.  And here we came, boom, boom, boom.  And we sat down there, and he saw that it was us.  And then for the rest of the evening, that night rather and the next morning, we sat there and about every two or three minutes, the ground would shake, the ground would shake.  And they kept the guns pointed at this chute just in case somebody that didn't look like us came down there (laughter).
Story_ID: 29922
Speaker 1: So at about--once the aircraft stopped, you know, particularly, when the engine stopped, it automatically sends an SOS [distress signal] back to the ship.  And when the ship saw that, and they had no way to communicate with us, so they thought they thought we had gone and they had drafted telegrams to send back to my family.  You had asked about my wife [Cecilia Lupton].  She had a telegram sent to her that we were KIA, killed in action.  Fortunately, they were in EMCON condition.  EMCON is an acronym for emission control.  And the ships go into EMCON when they're trying to hide so nobody can pick up their signals and locate them.  That was the only reason this telegram wasn't sent back home.  When we finally came out of the pit that we were in, it was about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon the next day.  And the whole area looked like the surface of the moon, no foliage, just craters.  The aircraft looked like it had polka dots and the holes in it.  It didn't burn and explode because the tanks were empty.  There was no fuel in it, but there was no way the aircraft was flyable.  But the Air Force finally got us to a radio where we could communicate with the ship, and we called the ship and told them what our situation was.  And they sent a helicopter out and picked us up and took us back.  But, like I said, I spent ten years of my life one night (laughter), ducking and dodging and running and hiding.
Speaker 2: Now, you didn't sign up for the end of the mission?
Speaker 1: No (laughter), no.
Speaker 2: So, how long was that tour in Vietnam?
Speaker 1: These, on board the ship, when you deploy, it's supposed to be for six months, for six months and you come back for six months and for six months again.  I have never had a six-month deployment (laughter).  This cruise, which was our first cruise, was about nine and a half months.  And when we finally returned, we returned for a month and a half, and we were back out there again.  That time we were out there for eleven months, so it was continuous operations during that time.
Speaker 2: So how many flights did you have?  You guys keep track of those things?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, we keep track of it in flight hours.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: And in my career, I finished up with five thousand flight hours in flying.
Speaker 2: All right, is there anything that stands out, anything else that stands out about Vietnam that you would like to share with us?
Speaker 1: You know, well, during that tour, I became a Centurion.  A Centurion means he's a hundred traps on the carrier which is good.  You wanna try to get as many landings as you had launches, so keep that number--
Speaker 2: Yes, keep that number (unclear) (simultaneous) (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's about right.
Speaker 2: Now, but this was a launch that was not a landing.  How did that count?  How did that one count?
Speaker 1: Well, for the mission, again.  Now, like I said, I earned five air medals for different missions and the "Skimmer-Scrapper" was one of the missions that we got rewarded for.  We have a lot of things that we could talk about and things that we couldn't--
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 29923
Speaker 1: Well, let's move beyond Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Once you came off of that series of tours, what happened next in your life?
Speaker 2: When I finished with Vietnam, I came back to the RAG which is a Replacement Air Group.  And I was there for about a year when I went to Monterrey [Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, California].
Speaker 1: Monterrey, okay.
Speaker 2: In Monterrey, that's where I finished my baccalaureate degree, my master's--
Speaker 1: So you went there and got your baccalaureate degree?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And there were, what?  I think you said seven of--
Speaker 2: Yes, there were seven African Americans there.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the relationship between you and those seven African Americans and the rest of your classmates?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, we had a good relationship going.  We were glad to see each other, for sure.  And we used to joke all the time about who the new guys coming in were relieving because whenever, one of us came in, one guy left.  When I came in I relieved Paul Reason (ph.).  Paul Reason became Admiral Reason.  He was three-stars, three-star Admiral when he retired.
Speaker 1: Now, but Monterrey was a place where, it was both known for its graduate program.  But you were doing an undergraduate program?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you notice any difference between, when you made a transition to the master's program?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was hard (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm thinking in terms of the culture, in terms of the surroundings?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that didn't change because we were all in the same buildings.  You were taking courses just at different levels.  We were taking three and four hundred level courses as undergraduates, and you'd five and six hundred level courses graduates.  And most of the, let's see, of the seven of us, there was at the time, there were, one, two, three--there were three of us that were in the baccalaureate program.  And the other four were in the master's program.
Speaker 1: I see.  All right, okay.  So this is when you start becoming a computer scientist?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And would you remind us why you went that route?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, as I say, when I came in, I took this placement test, and the chief that was administering the test said that I qualified for fire control (laughter).  And as I said earlier, when he said that to me all I had a mental image of was a fire engine running down the street and firemen guys hanging off of it and going into burning buildings.  So I said that wasn't my cup of tea.  I didn't wanna have anything to do with that.  So he said also that I qualified for electronics technician school.  So I says, okay, I'll take that because that had a little more meaning to me.  And I found myself going out to [Naval Station] Great Lakes [North Chicago, Illinois] again to ETA [Electronic Technician "A"] school which is a Navy, in-house training program for that school.  And that's how I got interested in electronics-slash-computers then.  And then when I went to Monterrey, I continued in that vein.
Story_ID: 29924
Speaker 1: So you leave Monterrey and your next assignment was?
Speaker 2: Next assignment after Monterrey was, I was in California.  I was on my way to, let's see, where was I in '75 [1975]?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when did you get to the [United States] Naval Academy?
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to, I went to another squadron.  I had went to a squadron.  I went to VW-112.
Speaker 1: You went back to another squadron, okay.
Speaker 2: And then from that squadron, I went to Annapolis [Maryland, United States Naval Academy] after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to the Naval Academy?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's where I was trying get you.
Speaker 2: Now, when I got to the academy, I had a master's [degree] in computer science.  And they didn't have a computer science program per se.  It was part of the math major, and my job there was to create a computer science program.  In fact, that's one of the things that kind of was a hallmark of why I was there, I created it.
Speaker 1: What was your rank then?
Speaker 2: I was lieutenant commander.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were a lieutenant commander, and this is what year?
Speaker 2: And this was in '79 [1979], '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Okay, '79 [1979], '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then, let's see.  While I was at the academy, I was the chairman of what became the computer science department, okay.  And, in fact, that's where I met Sam Massie [Samuel P. Massie, 1919-2005, first African American to teach at the United States Naval Academy].  He was the chair of chemistry, and he kind of took me under his wing and showed me the ropes there.  And to this day I think my son [Michael F. Lupton] and I are the first father and son team for African Americans that was at the academy.  I think that still holds today.
Speaker 1: So your son became a plebe while you were there?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you there, had you moved out when you graduated or were you there full time?
Speaker 2: No, I was there until '84 [1984].  He was in the class of '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what was that like, being there with your son?
Speaker 2: Oh, I thought it was great (laughter).
Speaker 1: What did he think of it?
Speaker 2: He was happy with it too 'cause he enjoyed a little more status around there because his dad was the chair of the department.  And I didn't act, I didn't get involved in what he was doing or anything.  I tried to stay aloof and apart from it because I didn't want to prejudice--
Story_ID: 29925
Speaker 1: What was the size of the computer science department while you were--it was being built [at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh, we had, I guess, sort of we had like a dozen faculty and, oh, about 200, 250 students.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But the, and in terms of the faculty, what was the civilian-military mix?
Speaker 2: Okay, I had one, two, four, six, I had four civilians and the rest were military.  I had four Marines, Marine officers and, including myself, I had four Naval officers.
Speaker 1: Now, my experience says it was unusual for a military person to be a department chair during that time frame.  So how did, what circumstances led to your being the department chair?
Speaker 2: They didn't have anyone there who was knowledgeable in computer science, and they wanted to create a computer science department.  And I was freshly minted from Monterrey [Naval Postgraduate School, Monterrey, California], having done that.  So I became the chairman, and my assistant was Fred Skove [Frederick A. Skove], who was a civilian, and we worked well in that department (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 29926
Speaker 1: This was during a time when the [United States] Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland] was really working trying to get African Americans as cadets to come there.  Could you talk about the social atmosphere for the cadets during that timeframe, and any unique problems you had trying to ensure that they, you know, got through, got their degree, commission, etc.
Speaker 2: Well, there weren't any unique problems, at least I didn't single them out as unique problems because they happened to be African Americans.  There were some problems that were just a part of being a mid-shipman and, you know, adjusting sort of thing.  My son [Michael Lupton, graduated from United States Naval Academy in 1986], for example, had an advantage.  One of the things that they get on mid-shipmen about are the, this book with all of the different [United States] Navy jargon and Navy ships and aircraft and the aircraft carriers and the like.  And the plebes have to memorize this.  They have to know these things.  Well, when they came to talking to my son about it, he says--and they asked him about "Fightertown [USA]", for example.  He said, "Oh, yeah, that's at Miramar, and it's right across from the commissary," 'cause he used to live right there on the base (laughter).  So those sorts of things were just second nature to him.  And because of that, they couldn't ask him anything that he didn't know because he had lived it all his life being the son of a career Naval officer.  And I was stationed Miramar, in fact.
Speaker 1: Was there any special support group that was formed for the students, the African American students while you were there?
Speaker 2: Not while I was there, at least not associated with the academy.  I don't recall them.  Now, you might ask my son that, and he may say something different.  I wasn't (laughter) aware of anything.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Overall, how would you rate your experience at Naval Academy?
Speaker 2: I thought the--it was a great experience in that it helped me solidify in my own mind what I wanted to do once I got out of the military, okay.  It was the first time I've had really a formal teaching experience where I was on the downside--or the upside of the podium rather than the downside of the podium.  And I took a liking to it.  It was an opportunity to share knowledge, to transfer knowledge and to help mold young minds, and it worked out well.  Plus, when you're a lieutenant commander at Annapolis, [Maryland, United States Naval Academy] to these mid-shipmen, you're a god (laughter).  So that sort of thing, I had to keep myself grounded in that regard also.  And, but I thought that the experience of being able to share knowledge, particularly in the computer science area because there wasn't very many of us in the field at the time.  In fact, when I got my Ph.D., I was looking at this Toby report for that year.  There were only two Ph.D.s awarded in computer science that year totally.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And for several years, it was either one or two, and in a good year, maybe three, and then years where there were none.  So I kind of, you know, the bug kind of bit me there.  Well, here's an opportunity to transfer some knowledge and get rewarded for it.  That's right (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 29927
Speaker 1: So now you're leaving the [United States] Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland].  And is that when you go to, you get your PNS [Professor of Naval Science] job?
Speaker 2: No, a PNS job was my last tour.  And that was, that came after I had gone to the [USS] Nimitz, which is another carrier.  And I was with the squadron VW-112 at that time, and my experience with there, with 112, we--I had an aircraft fall apart on me in that, you know, we were coming aboard the ship.  The tail hook caught, and when, the way that aircraft came down, the whole back end of the aircraft fell off on the deck.  And fortunately, we had caught a wire and we weren't going anywhere.  Of course, if we hadn't caught a wire, we weren't gonna go anywhere anyway, we were gonna go swimming.  But as it turns out, I looked out the window and I saw the crash and salvage crew running towards the aircraft.  So I'm saying, something's wrong, and I looked further.  I looked in the back and the tail end of the aircraft was laying on the deck, and there was hydraulic fuel and stuff just spewing all over the place.  And the crash and salvage crew just opened the aircraft and pulled us out of there, and we were watching this, when we were back in the ready room, we were watching this on the PLAT [Pilot Landing Aid Television] which is the TV station on the ship--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29928
Speaker 1: Could have been interesting.  Okay, when we stopped you were talking about this aircraft landing where you lost the tail of your airplane [while Lupton was aboard the USS Nimitz]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the aircraft.
Speaker 1: And is there anything you want to--more to say about that?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't know what had caused it because we hadn't, we didn't experience any hits or anything, at least none that we were aware of.  So we had to wait until they examined the aircraft to find out what the story was.  It seems like there was some stress failure because they had grounded the rest of the aircraft pending this investigation to find out.  And as it turns out, it was a stress failure, and it just happened.  We were at the right angle and the right speed and the right weight, and it just--
Speaker 1: So this--
Speaker 2: Broke and go boom (unclear).
Speaker 1: --so this happened when the guy, when your hook grabbed the guideline?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Story_ID: 29929
Speaker 1: Let's move on to when you leave the squadron and you now go to LSU [Louisiana State University, Eunice, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Okay, I took over the job as the commanding officer of the Navy ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] unit at Southern University [and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and LSU.  It was a--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: --combined unit.  Huh?
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  This is, I retired in '87 [1987].  This was '81' [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's right.  No,--
Speaker 1: Eighty four [1984].
Speaker 2: Eighty-four [1984], four through seven, '84 [1984], yeah, '84 [1984].  And I, and it was a unit that had I guess maybe one, well, two thirds of the mid-shipmen were from Southern and one third was from LSU.  We had the office and the building was on Southern's campus, and all we had was a desk over at LSU because the [United States] Navy was looked at as kind of an interloper coming down there because it was heavily [United States] Army and [United States] Air Force.  And I guess they needed some units too (laughter).  That's another story (laughter).  As it turns out, my executive officer was, my crew only had one, two, two minority officers.  And my executive officer was not [a minority].  And there was a lot of things, well, this is the South, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and it was a lot of resentment from, not so much the other services, but for--I guess they just weren't familiar with the Navy.  And a lot of things that the Army unit which was right next door to me, and it seemed like, you know, they had a lot more support than what the Navy unit had because the Army CO [Commanding Officer], and Roosevelt was his name.  Roosevelt, we became good friends.  In fact, he retired from that position also.
Speaker 1: Now, did you retire from that position?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, I was there, the first thing I did was enroll in the Ph.D. program at LSU.  I, Southern didn't have a Ph.D. program in computer science at that time, and LSU did.  And as a part of that Ph.D. program, I had to do some teaching over there.  And so I used to come over to LSU in one role as a teacher and then after the class is over, I'd change back to my uniform and I was the PNS and I had to deal with the PNS [Professor of Naval Science] problems over there.
Story_ID: 29930
Speaker 1: And it was interesting.  I had, we had combined commissioning ceremonies, and as the midshipmen finished the program, you know, we'd send them off and they'd have good orders.  One thing that sticks in my mind, I had one midshipman who I commissioned and he had his mother and his grandmother there.  And he had gotten orders to Naples, Italy.  So after the commissioning ceremony, everybody was congratulating him, and his mother and his grandmother came up to me and asked me, was I packed?  I said, "Packed?"  I said, "No."  She said, "Well, aren't you going to Italy with him?"  (Laughter) I says, "No."  She said, well, you're not sending him over there by himself, are you?  I said, (laughter) "Yes (laughter)."  "Oh, you can't do that.  You can't do that.  My son isn't ready for this," and she was all concerned.  And so I had to (unclear) sit down and explain to her what the program was and that the Navy didn't just send people off into the wilderness.  We, there was a Naval base there.  There would be a ship there and then all of the things that he'll need would be provided.  And it took me almost an hour, an hour and a half to console them to the point where they would stop worrying about me shipping their son out of the country (laughter) somewhere as an ensign.  An ensign, what is that, you know?  Gee, you know, but that was the sort of thing. He was--

Speaker 1: Talk about the, did you notice cultural differences between the LSU [Louisiana State University, Eunice, Louisiana] campus and the Southern [University and A&M College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] campus?
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) There were cultural differences to the extent that the LSU campus seemed kind of sterile and the Southern campus was where it all happened (laughter).  I know how that may sound, but--there was more socializing going on, on the Southern campus.  At, and when you go to a Southern football game, oh, man, 'cause that's a big--the big thing down there was the game between Southern and Grambling [State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], the Bayou Classic it's called there at the [Louisiana] Superdome.  And we used to say if you, if someone wanted to wipe out half of the black population of the United States, all they had to do was bomb the Superdome during the Bayou Classic (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this your first experience with an HBCU [Historically Black College and University]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said I, for the longest period of time, I had no idea what an HBCU was, 'cause growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and going to Central High School, there was no talk or mention of HBCUs.
Story_ID: 29932
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, you spent some time at LSU [Louisiana State University, Eunice, Louisiana], and your tour as PNS [Professor of Naval Science] is over.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Is this when you go to Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But I went to Jackson State as a civilian--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --not as a Navy commander.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, because you retired from the military, yes.
Speaker 2: I retired from the military, and I retired, my retirement ceremony was on Friday.  Once I retired, I got in the car and I drove down to Jackson, and I started at Jackson that following Monday as the chair of their computer science department.  And I had to rebuild the computer science department there.  It seemed like every institution I went to, my job was to create or build or recreate their computer science department.  That became my hallmark.
Speaker 1: Right, because they didn't have, I mean there were very few computer science departments at minority-serving institutions.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Yes, it's almost none.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: But that's--so why did you go to Jackson?
Speaker 2: Prior to my retiring I had run into a couple of my classmates from the Naval Postgraduate School [Monterrey, California], one of whom was at Jackson and he kind of recruited me.  He says, "Hey, you're getting ready to retire?"  I said, yeah."  He says, "Well, why don't you consider coming to Jackson?  What's in Jackson?"  "Jackson State."  "Ah, I don't know."  So he invited me to come down to see the campus.  And I went down and I was happy to be in uniform at that time I was down there.  And, oh, man, they treated me like royalty.  I said, okay, I'll consider this.  And sure enough, they made me an offer.
Story_ID: 29933
Speaker 1: All right, and so you stayed at Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi] for how long?
Speaker 2: For four years.
Speaker 1: For four years.  And--
Speaker 2: And while I was there my youngest son [Scott A. Lupton] matriculated at Jackson and he became one of the Heron Head scholars which is one of the, the program that they had down there for exceptional students.  And in fact, I ran into the then-president of Jackson State was Dr. [James A.] Hefner.  And I ran into him at a Boule conference, in fact, this past June [June 2010] and sat there reminisced about this thing.  Anyhow, I would have, my wife [Cecilia Lupton] was on the verge of this, what turned out to be a critical illness.  She was contracting cancer.  And we were at Jackson State, and we wanted to get back closer to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] which is both of our hometowns.  So as I, I was at another conference and I ran into George [Piper], what's George's last name, an Air Force Lieutenant Colonel who was at the academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] at the time I was at the academy.  He chaired the electrical engineering department.  I had the computer science department.  [Samuel P.] Massie had the Chemistry Department and who had, somebody else had English.  But anyhow, I ran into George, and he was telling me that there was a vacancy, an opening here at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  So I said, okay, I would consider that.  I went back down to Jackson and talked to the wife, and said well, Morgan is close to Philadelphia.  That's probably as close as I'm gonna get at this point in time.  So I resigned from Jackson State and we packed up and drove up here to Morgan.
Speaker 1: Now, how does this coincide with when you got your Ph.D?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I got my Ph.D. before I left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did what was required before I left--
Speaker 1: LSU.
Speaker 2: LSU.  Now, LSU had a residency requirement for the Ph.D. which I could not fulfill because I was on active duty.  So they had a, kind of a memorandum of understanding with the Columbia Pacific University.  And it was Columbia Pacific University [a distance-learning school based in California] that awarded the degree, even though the work I did and I did my qualifications and stuff all at LSU.  So that's why I put LSU/CPU, Columbia Pacific.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, that's why I, that was what I was getting up to.
Speaker 2: Well, the reason for that was that I could not do a residency while I was on active duty.  And CPU didn't require one.
Speaker 1: Is CPU still in existence?
Speaker 2: It was up until maybe, what, four, five years ago.  I think it's now defunct.
Speaker 1: All right, so--
Speaker 2: --and I don't know if it's because they issued me a degree or not (laughter), but you know.
Speaker 1: Oh, I doubt that very seriously.
Story_ID: 29934
Speaker 1: So you now leave Jackson [State University, Jackson, Mississippi] and you arrive at Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Morgan State.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: I left Jackson in '87 [1987].  I arrived at Morgan in '91 [1991] while I'm--I was at Jackson from '87 [1987] through '91 [1991] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I arrived at Morgan--
Speaker 1: That was a long drive (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) in '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: And now you come to Morgan and you have to grow a department?
Speaker 2: Morgan did not have a computer science department at the time I arrived.  That was my task, and I came here to create a computer science department, which is what I did.
Speaker 1: So talk to me about the kinds of things you did to grow your department?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I had to do was to hire some faculty.  When the transition was made--I got here in '91 [1991], and we brought the department on board I think in '92 [1992].  It was just four of us, myself, Dr. [Vojislav] Stojkovic, Dr. [Samir] Tannouri and who else was there, oh, Sheila Wiggins, the four of us.  And we started advertising, we put a curriculum together.  As students started to gravitate towards the major, we had to hire more faculty.  I guess that, at our highest point, we had ten faculty and about 350 undergraduate computer science majors.  I had acquired a grant from NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] to bring a super computer here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and get us involved in super computing.  And then a follow on grant for the NRTS which was the Network Research Training Site program.  That was a $3 million grant.  And what it did was allow me to interface with the public school system in Baltimore [Maryland] and for those schools that didn't have computing facilities.  The thought was if they had computing facilities then they could participate in some of these NASA programs.  So through this NRTS project, I identified ten schools that we installed twenty-four work-station computers, plus the electrical connections for them, plus air conditioning units if they didn't have air conditioning units, created the environment for these labs so that these schools could participate in future NASA projects.
Speaker 1: The name was interesting, the Nurse project.
Speaker 2: NRTS, N-R-T-S.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. Good.  N-R-T-S.  Yes, I was trying to put that together.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, Network Research Training Site.
Speaker 1: Okay, very good.  Thank you.  All right.
Speaker 2: One of the greatest challenges that one faces in starting a new department on a campus is the fight for space.
Speaker 1: Well, that became a problem until I started getting these grants.  And I've accounted for over $6 million in grants coming to this university [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And as such, as I said, if I needed some space, then space appeared here.  And that's, this is one of those spaces that we're in now, and then the office spaces.  Here's a funny thing.  My office used to be at the end of the hall here until--we used to be a part of a College of Arts and Sciences.  They had something like twenty-seven different departments, and it was too big and unwieldy.  So they separated the sciences from arts and created a liberal arts college and the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Scientices, which is where we are now.  When they did that, that created a new dean's position.  Well, and I wasn't slated for the dean slot, but my office was.  So they kicked me out of my office and put the dean in there (laugher).  And I went down the hall, which is where I am now.  And I--
Story_ID: 29935
Speaker 1: I want to go back because we've been following your career, but we haven't looked at the research output.  And as a Naval officer, that's not what you did.
Speaker 2: Right, as a Naval officer I did very little research.  I did a lot of research on weaponry and, you know, what the Russian armed forces were, you know, what potential targets.
Speaker 1: But you weren't publishing that?
Speaker 2: But I wasn't publishing that, no.
Speaker 1: And so now you move into a culture where you are ready based upon your research productivity.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you, well, talk about that transition for me?
Speaker 2: That's the thing.  I've noticed some things about coming in academia.  One, you have to have the Ph.D.  That's the union card.  If you don't have a Ph.D., you're going nowhere in academia, okay.  So you got the Ph.D.  You've got to publish.  You, "publish or perish" is alive and well.  And schools now kind of shy away from it and say, ah, nah, nah, no, no, that's not the case.  It is the case, okay.  Coming into this from the military, I had no appreciation for just what kind of balance you need between research, between publications and grants and the like.  So I saw a need for equipment, a need for interacting with the students.  So I went for the grants, and I was very successful in that regard.  Like I said, I got over $6 million worth of grants coming in.  But my, but the research I had to--I've got, oh, maybe a half dozen or more so publications.  I really don't have any other than my dissertation and my master's thesis, any that just bears my name.  The rest of them I did in conjunction with my other faculty members around here, okay.  But there is a need for research and continued research, and as much as I could, I found that researching and chairing a department are at odds with one another.  You can't serve two masters and serve them both well.  So I had to make a choice.  Do I wanna be a department chair or do I wanna be a researcher.  Well, I did as much research as I could as the department chair.  And that still didn't stop me from being successful in other regards.  I don't have as many publications as a lot of my colleagues do, but I have enough to be respectable, and I have, the other things that I brought to the university [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] was I became the president of two national organizations, one being the ADMI organization, which was the Association of Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics at Minority Institutions.  And that's shortened to ADMI which is ADMI, okay.  And I became the national president of ADMI.  In fact, I was their president for almost ten years, and they, I got a little plague and a reward doing that.  And I also became the president, the national president of the National Technical Association, NTA.  I was national president from '04 [2004] to '06 [2006], yeah, 2004 to 2006.
Speaker 1: And what about ADMI?
Speaker 2: ADMI, I was the national president for, I came--it must have been '86 [1986] through '96 [1996], that ten-year span.
Story_ID: 29936
Speaker 1: Okay. Let's talk about NTA [National Technical Association] first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's the relative size of that organization?
Speaker 2: Oh, NTA has been around for, well, it was seventy-five years when I was president.  So it's now an eighty-year organization.  It's the first African American organization to recognize minorities in science and engineering, all right.  And, in fact, our charge is to try to encourage youngsters to seek science and engineering as a career.
Speaker 1: And so the national office is about how large?
Speaker 2: Well, it varies.  The national office consisted of the president and the committee.  I guess it was about maybe eight to ten.
Speaker 1: And where is the national office located?
Speaker 2: In D.C. [Washington, D.C]
Speaker 1: In D.C., okay.  And your goal is to encourage--
Speaker 2: Minority youth.
Speaker 1: --minorities to enter into science and to recognize the consequences of that?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us, just shortly, how the organization goes about doing that?
Speaker 2: Well, there's, there're several things.  They have a program called the Three-T Mentor Program.  And that is "Technicians Teaching Teachers to Teach."  (Laughter) Well, let me explain that a bit.  What we do is provide for those teachers in elementary schools or middle schools or even high schools that teach sciences.  We would have an NTA member assist them either in doing lectures or experiments or whatever is necessary to support their science program.  And then the organization funded it.  They have monthly meetings and they would bring the teachers in and provide training for them and the like.  And that worked very well.  During the summers we had summer camps where we have computer camps, where we have computing mathematics and science.  And the kids would come in at 8:00 o'clock [A.M.], and we'd rotate them through these three experiences, feed them lunch and then they went home at about 1:00 [P.M.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 29937
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your work as a computer scientist.  And you are talking to a great high school kid or lay person, how would you describe what a computer scientist is?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What a computer scientist is?  Well, I would say this, I'd start off with asking them what is our timeframe as humans?  And well, the answer to that is the second, the second.  Well, what is the time base for a computer?  Well, the time base for a computer is a micro second.  It's a millionth of a second or a billionth of a second, I'm sorry.  What does that mean?  That means anything that took us as humans one second to do, the computer will have done it a billion times in that same timeframe.  So how does that relate to the humans?  Well, what we do, we take this machine which is a tool and show you how to use that tool to amplify or magnify whatever your productivity is, it magnifies it to use a computer to do that.  My job as a computer scientist is to create an environment for you where you can access this tool and be able to benefit from it by, again, multiplying your productivity.  And then there are several ways, and one of the things, one of the powerful things that a computer does for you is that speed thing.  It happens so fast.  People say, well, how long does it take you to blink your eye?  Well, you know a second.  No, it takes probably like a millisecond.  Well, what's a millisecond?  It's a thousandth of a second.  So just think those things that, if you were doing something that took you a second, during that second you could have blinked your eyes a thousand times (laughter).  Okay, and if you could relate that to some task that you're performing, maybe trying to add some numbers or maybe you're trying to calculate some distance or something, that's how fast the computer can do it for you, faster than you can do it yourself, that sort of thing.
Story_ID: 29938
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are some of the favorite applications that you have for the use of the computer?
Speaker 2: Favorite applications?  Well, I get to see a computer do so many things.  One of the things that reminds of how things evolve in this computer thing, when I was in Monterrey and I was doing my master's [program], I had to create a program that had a fist.  And there was a coin on the fist, and the program picked the coin up and tracked the coin up coming back down and to see whether it was heads or tails.  Well, it took me hours, blood, sweat and tears (laughter) to write that program thinking they're going to do that in a hand flip.  My son [Scott Lupton] is also a computer science major.  That project that I did that took me so long to get my master's, it was an example exercise in his book that was (laughter) was just something, an example of some minor (laughter)--I said, wait a minute, what is this?  They didn't call it my thumb flip coin thing, but that's exactly what it was.  And it was talked about as one of the little minor things that you can get a computer to do.  Okay, well--
Speaker 1: Time has a way of marching on.  Let's take a break.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 29939
Speaker 1: You were just talking about, you know, some of the things you did with computers.  Let's move on with that, keep along that vein.  We wanna look at the changes in technology and how it has had an impact upon your field.  And we'll start out with parallel computing.
Speaker 2: Okay, parallel computing.  You know, I tell my students-I teach software engineering, I tell my students in my software engineering class, I can guarantee you overnight success.  You can make a million dollars overnight.  All you have to do is design a parallel language.  They say, oh, a parallel language.  So what we have now is a simulation of parallelism.  We don't have true parallelism yet.  It's kind of like neural networks when we were studying neural networks.  Well, what's that all about?  We try to simulate with the computer what the brain does as a human.  Now, as we sit here and talk, we are processing light.  We're processing heat.  We're processing our sitting.  We're processing the thoughts that we're talking about and we're processing the discussion.  You have a feeling for, you know, what color trousers and shirt and jacket and stuff, all being processed simultaneously.  And we haven't talked about the voice communication yet.  That's all being processed.  Well, this brain is such a magnificent computer that it can do all of that simultaneously.  We try to simulate that with a computer.  We haven't gotten there yet.  We can do these things, some of them as fast as the brain can do it.  But we haven't gotten to the point where we can do all of these things, all of the time, all at the same time.  And that's what the goal is, that was your--and that's what parallel computing will do for us, or allow us to do multi-processing in a true multi-processing fashion rather than a timesharing fashion which is what we do today.  Because we're able to have such great speeds in the computer, we can simulate this, but it's not true parallelism.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are we, do you think, approaching the upper limit to the speeds of our computers?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think we are.  I think for the particular medium that we're using, we may be approaching the limits of that.  But once we get past the silicon, maybe the next medium is gonna be light or the next medium might be helium or oxygen or something.  I think as we reach the maximum of one medium, we venture off and see where the next medium is.  I think this is unlimited.
Speaker 1: So you think Moore's law is still there for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, that's where we get to this quantum computer business from.  Well, what is quantum computing?  It's processing the things simultaneously in some other base, something--we're not transmitting through wires anymore.  Now, we're doing it through gas or through some other medium.  And that's in its infancy as far as the studying is concerned.  The, that and, what's this other new thing called?  Quantum computing and--well, I'll think of it in a moment.
Speaker 1: We'll come back to that one.  But then I just realized that I had said something, Moore's Law.  It has to do with the rate at which the computing power would change in time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What did Moore say? It would be four years, something--
Speaker 1: Yes, the computer power will double.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll keep going there.
Speaker 2: All right, and you mentioned briefly quantum computing and cloud computing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, cloud (simultaneous). That's the next frontier--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Any prognostication in terms of when we're gonna get there?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's the next frontier.  This quantum and cloud computing, once this cloud clears (laughter), we can see where we're going from here.  I think there's a lot of fertile research area in there to be done.  And--
Story_ID: 29940
Speaker 1: Let's move to a national scale in terms of support for what it is that you do from the various funding agencies, National Science Foundation [NSF], you know, NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], etc., do you think it's adequate or what's your--
Speaker 2: Well, prior to the turndown in the economy, these dollars were abundant and I enjoyed the benefit of those.  As I said, I had over $6 million worth of grants.  And that's from NASA, from NSF, mainly, those two.  But once the two wars [War in Iraq and War in Afghanistan] started heating up and the economy started on the downturn, we have to fund those things as a matter of priority.  The funds for research dried up considerably.  And it's become more difficult to get research dollars because of that.  And quite frankly, I don't see that changing very much until the wars stop, at least one of them, of the two wars.  And there is some, some quantum change in the way we do business as far as the economy is concerned to get this turned around.  Now, I know some of the things that the administration [Obama administration] is doing is trying to do just that, but these--there's two ways to look at this thing.  We've been around here for almost three hundred years.  And these things, it can be shown that they are cyclic in nature, and swing back and forth depending on whether you have Republicans in or Democrats (laughter).  And the natural order of things, the economy is gonna start getting better because of the awareness of the public in their spending habits and the way things change from an evolutionary point of view.  It's gonna improve.  There are catalysts that will help this, and these catalysts are the War in Afghanistan or the War in Iraq.  Once we can draw down from those, then we can put that money back into the economy and agencies like NIH and NSF and the like will have more funds available to indulge in research.
Story_ID: 29941
Speaker 1: Okay, the--. In terms of your faculty, how active are they in going after the research dollars through grants and those--is this a culture where there's something that's beginning to happen or is it something that really needs some improvement?
Speaker 2: My faculty has been more focused on publications rather than grants.  In fact--
Speaker 1: Well, how do they get the funds to do the publications?  Who supports that?
Speaker 2: Well, if you're, if you're writing a publication, I mean there's no outflow of funds except for what your salary is as an instructor or professor or whatever.  But the reason the publications take precedence is because of job security.  If you wanna be secure in your position, you have to publish.  It's no guarantee that if you publish that you'll get promoted and you'll have tenure.  But it is certainly the fact that if you don't publish, that you won't get promoted or tenured.  I've got two Ph.D.s and three masters on my faculty, I've only five faculty members.  There's two Ph.D.s.  One is probably the most prolific publishers in the country.  He's got something like eighty-something publications.  He's written books.  He's been all over the country, making presentations and the like.  In fact, I've accompanied him on a couple of them and we have jointly researched and published in that regard.  And the other is a new, relatively new, he's only been here, what, three years, faculty member who is involved in research in bioinformatics.  And that's the extent of the research that goes on for those, from those two individuals.  Now, I've been trying to increase the number of people I have, but, you know, I'm told by the provost [T. Joan Robinson] that we're still under a hiring freeze here in the state of Maryland and that I cannot bring onboard anybody but that I can bring on a contractual person to do the regular teaching while freeing up my regular faculty so that they have more time to do the research.
Speaker 1: Do you have any adjunct faculty at all now?
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Story_ID: 29942
Speaker 1: (Laughter) When you think about computer science, what gives you the most satisfaction about being a practicing member of that field?
Speaker 2: Well, I get to see it from both sides.  I was a computer scientist when I was in the military.  And instead of writing about it and publishing, I was doing it, living it and getting the results of it, making sure that this $20 million aircraft that I'm flying, the navigation works, the communication works and all the other things that go on the back of it.  We have a Naval tactical data system on board the E2 and that was my job as an electronics officer to see that those things worked.  Coming on the academic side, initially I wasn't aware that we had to be publishing and we had to do all of these things that make for a well-rounded academician.  I came from an environment where you had a job to do.  You did your job and, you know, whatever that mission was, you saw that you accomplished that mission.  Well, there are a lot of in's and out's that I wasn't aware of which is why for the first four or five years of my career as an academician, I didn't do any research because I didn't realize it was required.  It wasn't until I came here and started getting involved that I realized that just doing your job and doing it well wasn't enough.  You had to do other things, and those other things consisted of publishing and grant writing.  So that's what I do.
Speaker 1: What about the service requirement?
Speaker 2: The service department?
Speaker 1: Service requirement.
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, oh, there.  Yeah, well, I served on the, maybe three or four different committees as far as service, plus part of what I was doing with my NASA grant was service.
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: And I think that that's a very essential and necessary part, and I'm really disappointed that it doesn't carry as much weight as publishing does.  You hear the term "publish or perish", but you never hear the term "service or perish".
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: So I think it's a little inequity.  It probably won't be solved in my timeframe here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland] but for those individuals that I work with, I try to impress upon them the necessity of doing well in each of these categories.  You must do some publishing to satisfy the university.  You must do teaching well to satisfy yourself and you must provide service so you can satisfy others.  The whole business of being a teacher, I think, is an honorable profession.
Story_ID: 29943
Speaker 1: Do you think that mix is right at Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Hum, you're gonna get me fired here (laughter).  I don't think there is the mix here at Morgan as you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Morgan, when--to be fair, Morgan was transitioning from being a teacher's college to a Ph.D.-granting, comprehensive institution.  And in that regard, they were changing the rules as they were kind of overnight.  And for those individuals who were still under the teaching frame of mind and they weren't able to make the transition as rapidly as the administration was making it, then they got kind of left behind.  And I didn't think that was fair.  I still don't think it's fair.  When you're transitioning from one theater of operations to another, there has to be time for the logistics to catch up or all the supporting things, and I don't think that was made available here.  But then that's a question of leadership.
Story_ID: 29944
Speaker 1: Of all the things you do, what gives you the most satisfaction?
Speaker 2: Going home and resting after this day is over (laughter).  Geez, at the risk of sounding kind of phony, I enjoy what I do here [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I enjoy getting in front of the class and teaching.  I enjoy teaching more than I do researching, and I enjoy teaching more than I do the committee thing because at the teaching, I have all of this knowledge that I like to share.  And this is, you know, you have a direct one-to-one thing and when you have the opportunity to see the eyes light up from some little bit of knowledge that I just shared with them, it's very satisfying, very satisfying.
Story_ID: 29945
Speaker 1: Talk briefly about the awards that you have gotten.
Speaker 2: Oh, awards.  Well, in the military I've gotten a fair share of awards.  I got air metals for flying and I got, I was on the Navy pistol team, and I became an expert at shooting.  I got awards for participating in Vietnam in the National Defense.  I got the, eighteen different awards.  On the civilian side, I received the, I received the Dean's award here at Morgan, the Dean's award for writing, for grantsmanship--
Speaker 1: For bringing in $6 million?
Speaker 2: --for bringing in $6 million, right (laughter).  These awards.  I've got awards from virtually every high school and middle school that we've dealt with because they give me awards for putting in the computers and providing the support for them like there's one school I go to each year, and I don't talk about computer science there because they're already familiar with computer science.  So I talk about aviation.  And there, they don't have anyone to talk about aviation and getting minority youth interested in aviation.  So, since I have both-- two careers, one in aviation and one in academia, I use the aviation thing whenever I see that the particular area that I'm--the school that I'm at doesn't have that kind of exposure in there.  So I get some satisfaction from that.  And there are several awards in there that--I can't remember the names of them all, but they're in there on my shelf in the office, it must be a dozen of them or so.

Speaker 1: We're coming toward the end, and I'm gonna ask you some philosophical questions.  But before I do that, are there things in your career that you would like for us to know about that I have missed?
Speaker 2: You mean other than what a great guy I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, geez, I don't know.  I am a rich man, rich in the sense that I had three sons, three fine sons.  My oldest son [Micahel Lupton] graduated from the [United States Naval] Academy [Annapolis, Maryland].  He followed in my footsteps to some extent in that he went into aviation when he came out of college.  But he opted for the Marine Corps rather than the [United States] Navy.  I don't know where I failed him in that regard, but he was flying helicopters for the Marine Corp for five years, and then he resigned, went to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and got his master's [degree] in business administration.  And now he's a Wall Street banker.  So I'm very proud of that.  My middle son [Steven Lupton] who graduated from Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] is now in Florida, Orlando, Florida, and he is a regional manager for Michelin Tires.  And he majored in Business Administration here at Morgan and it served him well.  He's had several promotions, and he's doing his thing there in Florida, which I'm very proud of.  My youngest son [Scott Lupton] graduated from Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi], he went through when I was at there.  He also got his master's [degree] from Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland] when I was here [Morgan State University].  And I was trying to talk him into staying on and getting his Ph.D. but I was overruled by this young lady that he met and married (laughter).  But he, he's doing well.  He's working for a computer science firm here in Laurel, Maryland.  And they've given me five grandkids, four granddaughters and one grandson.  And I'm very pleased and happy with that.  They're doing well, they're healthy, and they're doing fine, and I'm a rich, happy grandfather and father as a result of that.

Speaker 1: Okay, if you had a young person walk into your office today, you had a number of them in there, what kind of advice would you give them about going into a STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering and Math] field?
Speaker 2: I just shared that with this group that I was addressing today.  I told them that it's important that they keep up with what's going on because it's easier to keep up than it is to catch up.  And I tell them that their studies require their undivided attention.  They have to be serious about studying.  And the last thing I tell them is "RTB".  What's that?  "Read the book (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That is the key to success.  You have to be able to read and understand what you read in the book.  And if you don't understand the book, that's what you have the professor standing up there in front of you for.  You ask him those questions.  You ask him to explain it.  Don't let anything slide by.  Pursue it, get an understanding of it because the better you understand the basics, the easier those things that are added on will come.  And I made that statement to this group of freshmen that I was just registering this morning.
Speaker 1: That's why I asked that question.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).

Speaker 1: If you weren't doing computer science, what do you imagine yourself doing?
Speaker 2: I've asked myself that too.  And I would probably, I would probably be an M.D. [medical doctor].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would probably be an M.D.
Speaker 1: (unclear) to elaborate?
Speaker 2: Well, you're still involved with people.  You're in the helping mode, but it's more personal.  If I can help cure cancer, for example, I would feel really great about that, and I think I would probably feel better about that than if I were to develop a program, a parallel language (laughter).

Speaker 1: (Laughter) What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Here is an individual who started out without a plan but was able to absorb what was going on in his surroundings to be able to discern what was necessary and what was needed and by considering that, found a direction to go and then pursued that direction relentlessly.
Speaker 1: And my last question.  Do you have any people that you think we should be interviewing for The HistoryMakers' program?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, and I think you probably already have them on your list.  One is George McKinney.  George McKinney was a marshal in D.C., and he was the one who issued the papers and arrested Nixon for the Watergate thing.  He was a black man, former Army captain, and former Maryland, Marshal for Maryland, and was appointed Marshal for Washington, D.C., the first Marshal of color to do that sort of thing.  And his father is Richard I. McKinney who is an academician and I think he's already in your archives.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much.  That's the end.
Speaker 2: You're very welcome.  The pleasure was mine (laughter).
