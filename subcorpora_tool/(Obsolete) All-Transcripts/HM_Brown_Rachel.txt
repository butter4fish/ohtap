Story_ID: 4217
Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, if you would first, please tell me a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born, where she grew up and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: My husband [Philip Brown] says I always brag when I talk about my family, but it's with love.  It's not bragging because we had such a loving family life. And all my journals about my family, I dedicate them to--we call our family the Hall Brown--family tree.  And I always dedicated it to my mother and my father.  My mother was Camsa Burley, C-A-M-S-A. Camsa Henson Burley.
Speaker 1: Could you spell Burley for us?
Speaker 2: B-U-R-L-E-Y,  Burley.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?  And where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) She was-- (pause) I really can't-I--isn't that something?  I never just asked her of the house that she was born in. But I know she wasn't born in the house that I knew from my grandfather.  Because they lived as I told you, I lived on Marley Creek.  Marley Creek divides Glen Burnie [Maryland].  And on the South Side we live on now on the Marley Neck Road [sic, Boulevard].  But my grandfather and mother--I imagine she was born on the other side.  And it was called the Benson Farm.  And, of course, those were people in Anne Arundel County [Maryland] with well-known names.  And the Benson.  And the Har--Bensons and the Hammonds.  And my grandfather worked for one of the Bensons.  He said it was the poorer Benson.  And my mother, I know she was born there because she said that they always kept the big black pot with hominy grits in it.  And the other barrel with the fish in it.  And she said from a little girl that whenever she got a house, she wasn't ever gonna have any hominy grits nor any fish. They put it in brine, B-R-I-N-E.  And sure enough, she didn't.  And as the children grew up and we moved into our lives and the people that we came in contact with say you know you have to know what hominy is with a big family like that.  So I went home ask mama, "Why didn't I know hominy was?"  So she say, "Go back and tell her that your mother said she wasn't ever gonna have any hominy (laughs) in her house."  But we loved the grits. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Did you mother ever share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, get back to Camsa and Rudolph.  And Rudolphus Hall was Rudolphus Gaither Turner Hall.
Speaker 1: Is that your father?
Speaker 2: That's my father.
Speaker 1: We'll talk about him in one second
Speaker 2: Oh all right. And a song goes with my mother, 'Be Not Dismayed'.  She sang it to all of us.  "Whate 'er betide, God will take care of you."  And that--We call that our family hymn.  A hymn of praise and joy.
Story_ID: 4218
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother [Camsa Henson Burley]?
Speaker 2: Well I, my mother and my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] were very much like [husband] Philip [Brown] and Rachel.  They lived together so long.  And my father was much older than my mother.  So he treated her just like she was one of the children. (laughs)
Speaker 1: How so, Mrs. Brown?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: How so?  Can you give us some examples?
Speaker 2: Well he--we say he stole my mother out of the classroom, which he almost did.  And she was all of thirteen.  And he was twenty-six, twice as old.  And only reason my grandfather didn't sho--put the shotgun on him, was that my grandfather was a saint.  We always called him saint.
Speaker 1: And do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: My father was a--called 'Dolly' because he was reared by his grandparents.  His father died and left his mother with two sons.  And, she went back to her home.  And then she married and had another name.  And so my father stayed with his grandparents. And he was their Dolly.  And so he stayed in school until, well until he was married.  But then he knew when he had a big family, he had to get out there and go to work.  And so he treated my mother like he did in school. He stayed on with the teacher.  And I told you that the--we were--all knew of all of the old teachers in those old school houses that brought education to Anne Arundel County [Maryland].  And it was seven in all.  And my father just stayed in that school.  And some of the students, you know, when they got to the sixth grade or whatever grade they went to, they stayed there until they went to work.  They didn't stay in school long anyway.  And so he stayed there.  And he used to help with the younger children.  So that's how he met my mother.
Story_ID: 4219
Speaker 1: And what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Father was Rudolphus Marvin Hall, R-U-D-O-L-P-H-U-S.  He spelled it Rudolphus.  But everybody called him Rodolphus.  And his nickname was 'Dolly'.
Speaker 1: And did your father ever share any stories with you about growing up--his growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Rudolphus and Dolly guided and reared their family.  And note that word reared.  He didn't say raise.  He always said reared his family with song and love and prayer.  And most of all, with pride.  He told us stories.
Speaker 1: What kinds of stories did he tell you?
Speaker 2: I have that here too. (Pause)  He told us stories, part from the Bible.  Part from stories that he had read.  And parts from just plain that he made up.  And whenever he ran out of what he didn't know, he made the stories.  And most of all, his stories were with love.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us some of the stories that he told you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  '[The Tale of] Peter Rabbit [sic, 'Brer Rabbit']' was one of his famous. And that--is that the one that had little tar baby in it?  And how Peter Rabbit--how the fox wanted to catch Peter Rabbit and how Peter Rabbit always got away.  And oh we were amazed.  And when he ran out of the real Peter Rabbit stories, then he made up the other stories.  And that was a famous thing.  Don't throw him in the briar patch.  'Cause that's where he wanted to be. (laughs)

Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, how far back can you trace your ancestors?  Do you know if you came from slaves or free people?  How far back can you trace your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well you see in Glen Burnie [Maryland], you don't know that part of Anne Arundel County [Maryland].  We had what you call Freetown.  And Freetown was mostly non-slaves and slaves.  And people from the other counties and from the Eastern Shore just loved to get to Freetown.  And we think that there was, you know, some parts of the Underground Railroad up there.  And we're not too sure of that.  So don't say it.  But we do think that Harriet Tubman went through there.
Speaker 1: And can you tell me a little bit about your grandparents, your--starting with your--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) As I told you my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] was reared by his grandparents.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Do you remember their names?
Speaker 2: So that made them three--Oh yes, that was Grandpa Josephine and Samuel Gaither.  And they owned their property.  And that's how my father got his mother's three acres.  Because she had married and gone to another farm where they really had acres.  And that was in Freetown.  And so with my grandfather, my grandmother, my father and Rachel, that's make it four.  And Earl and the fifth and their children, the sixth and the seventh generation.
Speaker 1: And what about your maternal grandparents, your mother's [Camsa Henson Burley] parents?
Speaker 2: Mother was the same thing.  Because the Hensons came from Charles County [Maryland].  And we think that we were related to Matt Henson [African American who co-discovered the North Pole].  And don't have the proof.  But we had the noses. And they say if you had the nose, you are a Henson.  And my mother's mother was Rachel Henson Burley.  And she died just a little before I was born.  So I was named for Rachel Henson Burley.  And all of my mother's and father's--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Off-camera discussion) You were talking about--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) About the Henson family.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: They came from Charles County where Matthew Henson came from.  And we think that we are the Anne Arundel County branch of the Hensons.  And some people have looked it up. And, but I don't have any proof of that.  But I am named for Rachel Henson.  And I don't have the Henson in my name.  But I have Rachel.  And that's who I was named for.  And so that made my mother's brothers and sisters just adore me because I was born soon after their mother died. And we just had a loving family from both sides of our family.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about your earliest memory.  What's your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: Don't ask me that because I declare that I knew my grandmother. And I told her my--really knew her.  Because she gave me a piece of cake.  But knowing full well that she died before I was born. (laughs)  So you see what kind of memory I have.
Story_ID: 4221
Speaker 1: Describe what your family life was like?  What was a typical day like in your house?
Speaker 2: A typical day in my house--,
Speaker 1: As a child growing up?
Speaker 2: --was beautiful to behold because my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] got up early.  And the children were not to touch any fires.  So he had to make the fire.  You know, we--and that was 1912.  And we didn't have any furnace.  And we didn't have any coal.  And we didn't have any lights.  We had the kerosene and the lamplight and the stove, old wooden stove.  And we had done our chores the day before to bring in the wood and keep the wood box filled.  But we don't touch the fire.  And he would lay it at night before he went to bed.  And he would come down in the morning.  And in 1912, as you remember, he called it Hall's Palace because those old homes, the staircase divided when they went up.  But ours was one of the first that went straight up.  And you had a hall at the top and a hall down the bottom.  And that's why he named it Hall's Palace.  Well he would get downstairs and then call the children to come down.  And my mother [Camsa Henson Burley] would go down and take the baby. And she was an expert with children.  She reared all of her children till they got grown.  And you know, back then in those days, most of the children died at childbirth, so many of them.  But she reared hers and from a young person to do that.  We told them at [Johns] Hopkins [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland] that we were going to take our children home to our mother.  And they say, "How you know what she's gonna do with them?"  We say, "We know.  We have proof, (laughs) what she can do with them."  One of the sisters had a baby born in the incubator over there.  And when they got ready to leave and we were talking about the care that they gave you at Hopkins back in those days.  And they told Myrtle, "Oh I hate--We hate to give you this baby. Because you're not going to keep it living."  She say, "Yes, I am."  They say, "How?"  Say, "Because I'm not even taking it to my house, I'm stopping it off to my mother. (laughs)" They say, "Well how you know what your mother can do with it?"  Say, "Well she reared fourteen.  And I know what she can do with it."  And look, she left him there at my mother's house.  And Allan was--grew up with my baby brother.  And we call him 'Mama's baby'. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Can you share some other memories with us about--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh. And after he--they made the fire, then he made the breakfast.  We had pancakes and oatmeal for our breakfast every morning.  All right, we had pancakes, because he mixed the meal and he mixed the eggs and the milk.  And all of it went into the pancakes.  And you got your share from your pancakes.  And we never went out of that house without our breakfast.  And I just can't understand why parents today can't give their children something hot before they leave home.  Because it depends on that as to how you spend that day.  And to this day, my husband [Philip Brown] and I, we have our breakfast together and we don't let anything come in between that.  All the organizations you want, if you gone have it earlier Saturday morning, Rachel won't be there cause she's gone have her breakfast with her husband.  Gone too far to turn back.  Well when my mother came down, she had a pillow on the kitchen cabinet for the baby.  And she laid the baby there and her famous words, "Don't touch the baby."  Then she got us ready.  And you saw the braids on my hair.  She combed every one of those girls' hair in the morning before they went to school.  She saw to it that we got washed up.  And she would tell you, "If you don't wash your neck, I'm gonna wash it."  And the boys would say, "I'm gonna wash it, mama."  And they didn't want Mama to wash it.  Then, she would make us a sandwich.  And my father, as I told you, worked in produce.  He had stalls in Lafayette Market.  So we always had plenty of food and vegetables.  And all of the people in Baltimore [Maryland] like the bakery, they knew that he was trying to rear that family.  The ice cream plant knew it.  The people in the market that had the meat stalls knew it.  And a Greek family was a famous friend of ours and they saw to it--don't care the coldest day in the winter, you didn't go to the market, he could go, and they would bring and give him the food for his family.  But he gave them the vegetables back. (laughs)  And then we would go off to school.  Walk to Marley Neck [Rosenwald] School [Glen Burnie, Maryland].  And it's a picture of it in the Philip's [husband, Philip Brown], 'A Century of Separate But Equal [Education in Anne Arundel County]'.  It's a picture of--not the one that I attended.  Because the picture in there  is the Rosenwald School [Galesville, Maryland] that was built later.  And I went to the hall, H-A-L-L one of the organizations had built it.  Good Samaritans had built--that was their hall.  So it was a good hall.  And they came and saw to it that we were quiet and had our lessons and obeyed the teacher.  And we had a good time in that school.  We learned--one room school.  And the first teachers were teachers like my father.  My father didn't stay and teach them, 'cause he had to go to work but some of the women did.  Some of the men did.  And they taught us, and from those secondhand books.  I got one upstairs,  I'll show you.  But we didn't mind the backs.  We learned what was in the book.  And we really learned it.  And we had a love for learning in our house.  And in our school.  And in our community.

Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, if you will, please tell me the names of your siblings in their birth order, including yourself.  So each person's name, including yourself in the birth order, starting with the oldest.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.  Pauline, dear Dean of all of us.  Think of her the same today.  She is not dead, she's just away.  And she taught all of us. (laughs)  When I--I was fourth in the family.  And I remember when I first start eating, I couldn't sit on a chair.  I always had to sit on somebody's lap.  So I sat on Pauline's lap.  And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And who's after Pauline?
Speaker 2: Pauline and she was born the 19th of June in 1907.
Speaker 1: And who's next after Pauline?
Speaker 2: Waverly, our big brother.  And he took care of us all.  And he would tell us, "I'm just telling you, because you're young."  And he was so old. (laughs)  And that's all I have of Waverly. Waverly grew up to go into the [U.S.] Marine Corps and he was one of the first marines from our area.  They took one look at him and said, "You look like you are athletic."  And he was.  He played baseball.  And say, "We're gonna put you in the Marine Corp."  Then we have Ethel.  And Ethel everlasting wisdom, true love, healing, eternal joy and loving kindness. And we gave her a family Ph.D.  So we call her Dr. Ethel.
Speaker 1: And who's after Ethel?
Speaker 2: Ethel, Ethel Hall Warden Brooks.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: And then come Rachel.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.  And after you?
Speaker 2: That's Rachel. And Rachel had the good fortune and the good sense enough to grow to be born into that family. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And who's after you, Mrs. Brown?
Speaker 2: After Rachel comes Gravelle (ph.).  And he was next to me.  The only one that it was only a year apart.  In the olden days, those men respected their women.  And they did not have those children a year apart.  And all of them were three years apart, except Gravelle.  Right on top of Rachel.  So that was why the aunts came over to pick up Rachel all the time because when I was six months old, she [mother, Camsa Henson Burley] became pregnant with Gravelle.  And my Aunt Agnes who lived across the field from us, say she could hear us--hear me la-ing.  They said I didn't yell.  I just la-ed, L-A, L-A, la-ed.  And that was my Aunt Agnes.  That picture I said I found up there.  Not Uncle Earl, but Aunt Agnes who was in that--dressed up in the Halloween. And that was just her own Halloween.  She was just as serious as I don't know what.
Speaker 1: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: And next--.
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Ready?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Did you get Rudolphus?
Speaker 1: No.  Rudolphus.
Speaker 2: Rudolphus Marvin Hall, Jr., Daisy Hall Brooks.  Keith, who died at childbirth.  And remember the beautiful rainbow.  And Jenny, our beauty spot.  She died too long, too young.  Lois Hall, Lois Hall Carol Stewart. And then Joseph Burley, named for grandpa.  Roland Hall, Myrtle Hall, my love. June Hall, the youngest girl and the eighth girl.  Myrtle was the seventh daughter.  And the baby boy, Virgil Hall.  And he's the one that keeps the home fires burning.
Story_ID: 4223
Speaker 1: Can you describe your street in your community?  Do you remember the name of the street that you lived on?
Speaker 2: And please don't call it a street.  That was 1912.  It was a sandy road. (laughs)  It has graduated to Howard Road [Glen Burnie, Maryland].  Paved with all of everything and costing about a bundle.
Speaker 1: What was it like when you were growing up there in 1912?
Speaker 2: Oh it was so pretty.  Only thing, it was sandy.  And my mother [Camsa Henson Burley] had a hate-love affair with sand.  And I can't stand the crumbs on my kitchen floor but she could not stand the sand.  "You cannot bring the sand in my house.  Wash your feet off, outside the door.  Don't take your sandy feet to bed." (laughs)  And when you got up in the morning, your sheet had to be taken off, and shake the sheet.  And we lived in a great big space, as I told you that grandfather gave her.  It--he had about forty acres and two plots of ground.  And the other people up there had the acres too.  Some of them had gotten the ground from the Civil War.  We think that some of the Howards did.  And I'm checking that out now to see which Howards fought in the Civil War.
Speaker 1: What was your community like?
Speaker 2: The community was nothing but relatives.  We were all cousins in the school.  We had--they were all our cousins.  Very few that were not our cousins.  And it was just a loving community.  And like we had a loving home.  Our whole community was like that.  And they were either their uncles or their cousins or somebody.  And I had one of my journals, I call it 'Cousins by the Dozens'.  And I can write on one of our trips.  One of the first trips that we took.  And we were the only blacks--only colored on there.  And they say, "Oh, you're so different."  And I said, "No, dear.  I'm not any different.  I can name you two hundred people just like me."  I said, "And you know why?  They're all my cousins.  And I know them well." (laughs)  And we have that picture upstairs.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh my.  The magnolia.  The woods, magnolias.  And I can hear my cousin, Frisbee now, "Sweet magnolias, ten cents a bunch."  And he would go get them and bring them.  And we would find ten cent to give him and then go find our own.  And the poplar tree.  We had a span of poplars.  And I can smell those in my sleep now.  I look out my window and look at my chestnuts and oaks out here and think about those poplars and those smells.  And the blackberries in the summer in that field that we were around on each side.  And I mean it was a big field.  And it was planted with blackberries, wild blackberries.  And we could pick all those we wanted.
Speaker 1: And what sounds?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What sounds remind you of growing up?  What sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: What, what?
Speaker 1: What sounds?
Speaker 2: Sounds.  Of the birds.  Of the birds.  And the Killdeers.  And the chickens clucking.  And everybody had their little chicken coop and their chickens and their eggs.  And we'd watch the hens lay their eggs.  And it was just a beautiful growing up.
Story_ID: 4224
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about your elementary school.  Do you remember the name of the school and your teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh yes. And--oh that I was teaching in?
Speaker 1: No, no and your teachers who taught you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh. In my elementary school, I had a variety.  Because see, my Aunt Agnes went to Baltimore [Maryland] to live.  And several times I went to her house to live with her.  And I went to school in Baltimore also and school [Marley Neck Rosenwald School, Glen Burnie, Maryland] in the country.  And that's how come I would get out so early because I got skipped so much.  When I would go to Baltimore, you know, they would say that the country children, they had to put them back in the kindergarten.  And I kept telling the lady I was in the second grade.  And so I went to the kindergarten in the morning and they had first primer and the second primer.  They didn't call it kindergarten then, it was primer.  So I stayed there a half a morning.  She moved me to the second primer.  Stayed in there.  Next day I went, she moved me to the low first.  Next day I went back, she moved me to the high first.  Next day I went back  I moved to the low second.  Next day I went back I moved to the--I don't know whether I--yeah I stopped in the high second and it was a beautiful teacher.  Her name was Wharton and they were teachers--that these teachers stand on their shoulders.  And they knew how to teach.  And she just loved me and I just loved her.  She was so pretty.  And--.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I must have been a good student, moving up like that.  Because my mother [Camsa Henson Burley]--when you got--when [sisters] Pauline and Ethel and [brother] Waverly went to school, I followed them to school.  You know, they didn't watch to see if you were six.  If you were pretty bright, and you would sit there and then behave yourself, they'd let you sit there.  And that's what I did.  And I followed them to school.  And I knew how to read.  And I knew how to write.  And when I went to Baltimore that shocked them because we weren't any country children.  My father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] as I said, taught everybody.  And he said that he could carry you through the eighth grade.  And he called it from the low primer up to square root.  They didn't call it algebra.  They called it square root.  And he could take anybody to that far.  And we did.  We had school at school and then we had school at home.  My father was forever saying, "Clear the dishes and wash the table.  You don't eat--you don't study with no dishes on the table."  And we had turns washing the dishes.  And we'd hurry up and wash them.  And he would set at the table and hear everybody's lesson.  And if you told him that you didn't have any homework, didn't make any difference.  He just gave you the Bible and said, "Learn this verse while I'm listening to the rest of them."  So we found some homework real quick.  And we learned a lot of Bible verses.  We learned that.  And he had little games.  And we had story hour at home.  We had our library.  No books,  but we read the books over and over.  And that's what I tell the children now.  And I said, "I read as many as you did.  But I read that one over."  I think 'The Mill on the Floss' [by George Eliot] I must've read it a hundred times.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what type of child you were in the early years?  What kind of child were you?  Were you mischievous, obedient?  What kind of child were you?
Speaker 2: I think I was obedient.  Only thing my mother said, "Don't go skating on the pond."  And I went skating on the pond. (laughs)  That was the only thing I knew that I did.  But we didn't have any bad children.  And we had one that was in our whole school.  And as I got older, I knew it was something wrong with him.  And he would take everybody's pencils, and do that.  And just sit there and be devilish.  And that's the only one I knew. But we knew that he was different.  And he was.  And he grew up and he acted different.  And--but in school--and as I said, the Henson--we had the trustees in the school.  And the trustees took care of the school.  And they would come to school every once in a while, look in.  And we had our lunch on the church steps.  And in all of my teaching, all I had to do was tell them about how I went to school.  And our lunchroom was the church steps.  And Uncle Thomas was the trustee for the school and the church.  And he'd come out and see if you left any crumbs.  Wasn't any crumbs because we ate everything we had.  And the few birds would come eat up the crumbs.  And he wanted to know if we kept those steps and things clean.  The Good Samaritans come in there and wanted to know if we kept the hall clean.  We kept that clean. (laughs)
Story_ID: 4225
Speaker 1: Did you and your family attend church?  And if so, what were those experiences like?
Speaker 2: Oh my, the church was the schools--almost all the schools were on the church grounds.  You will find that out in there.  And you will find where all the churches were.  And all of the churches--and back in 1912, so many of them were on a circuit.  Like the minister would have two.  Our minister had two, Marley Neck and Magothy, where you see Marley Neck and Magothy in there.  They were together.  So we were all together.  Some of the--then we had Freetown School [Glen Burnie, Maryland].  That was in the community. Freetown School.  They had a hall.  And they all got the [Julius] Rosenwald Schools, but that was later.  I was in school before the Rosenwald Schools.  When my husband [Philip Brown] went up there to teach, he taught in our Rosenwald School [Marley Neck Rosenwald School, Glen Burnie, Maryland].  But I didn't meet him while I was there.  I was in Baltimore [Maryland], going to school.  He went up there Monday and stayed till Friday.  And he would come back to Annapolis [Maryland].  And I would stay in Baltimore till Friday or Saturday.  Then I'd come home.  I'd be going back on Sunday.

Speaker 1: And you went to high school in Baltimore at Douglass High School--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Douglass High School. Frederick Douglass High School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: And with a very famous class who many of those students went on to--.
Speaker 2: Famous class and that 1928 class oh my,  we can name them.  Now Thurgood Marshall was in the '26 [1926] class.  I was a-not a classmate of his.  I was a schoolmate of his. And he graduated in '26 [1926].  I graduated in '28 [1928].  So I was in school with him too.  But we had the same teachers.  And we did have teachers.  For instance, Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois's daughter [Yolande DuBois] taught us English.  And the only thing you see, I always got on the pictures with everybody.  I got everybody's book.  I got everybody's signature.  But I wasn't old enough to get his signature.  And I will never forge--I will ever remember him standing at the door and shaking hands with each of us that left his daughter's class.  And just looked down on us.  And I could look--he was saying, "Poor children."  I could just imagine him saying that.  But he was thinking about us.
Speaker 1: Why do you think he was saying to himself, "Poor children?"
Speaker 2: Well have you read his books?  Are you familiar with Dubois's books?  And he knew that we had talented children.  And he knew that we were not getting the education that we were supposed to be getting.  And he knew that--about discrimination.  Now my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] never used the word discrimination in our house.  In fact, I didn't know it.  He's always said, "It's hard out there children.  But it's so much love in this house that you'll never know about it."  And we grew up with the ones that the parents sheltered us. You see.  And they kept us from that.  We didn't learn it in school.  We were sheltered and nurtured and kept from it.  All he said, "It's hard out there.  But it's so much love in this house, you'll never know about it."  And that was my father.  And I didn't tell you, at home, we had our own chorus.  Seven of us could sing.  Seven of us couldn't sing a lick.  But we read the hymns with my mother [Camsa Henson Burley].  My mother couldn't sing.  But she sang all the time.  They laughed at us.  But we would read the hymn books.  And we read all four verses.  And somebody was speaking this week and saying, "Read those four verses because they tell you something."  And they did.  I read those with my mother.  And my--we learned orations.  My mother could recite a poem that long.  She knew all of '[The Song of] Hiawatha' [by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow].  She knew all of 'Spellbound' [by Emily Brontë].  And, of course, we learned it too.  And our children, we took all of the orations.  And we came to Annapolis [Maryland] for commencement, little six-grade commencement for recitations and for readings.  But my mother knew them.  And we learned them at home.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: We played baseball.  We had our field.  We had our team right out in our yard.  Mama had the girls.  Papa had the boys.  And so that was the kind of family that I grew up in.
Story_ID: 4227
Speaker 1: And when you were a high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland] student, did you have dreams and aspirations, at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I knew I was going to be a teacher because oh we were ordained to be teachers.  You see I went through those eight girls.  My father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] wanted eight teachers.  And he didn't pull any punches.  And you know, it took us to the grandchildren and the great-grandchildren and now in report to him we have ten or twelve.  It took us, that long. (laughs)  And we were excellent teachers.  Philip [husband, Philip Brown] say I brag, but that's the truth.
Speaker 1: So what were you thinking about college when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Well I really wanted to go to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  But we didn't have any money.  My father had his money in his bag.  And he would have change.  He would give us five cents on Sunday.  And we were supposed--no, six cents.  We suppose to put five cents in church and spend the penny on candy.  And oh you asked me was I mischievous.  But all of us put a penny in church and spent the five cent on candy. (laughs)  I think he knew it.  And--.
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to go to Morgan?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In high school--see I went to high school the four older--in fact down to [sisters] Jenny--down to Lois went to Baltimore to school.  And I graduated from---my sister Ethel graduated from high school before me, a year before me.  I graduated from her. The boys went to Hill Street to the eighth grade.  And we went on to high school. I have to have my water now.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: No.  So tell me a little bit about, you wanted to go to Morgan, but couldn't--?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go to Morgan.  And I was a pretty good student.  I was always in the top third.  I wasn't no valedictorian.  Wasn't no salutatorian.  But I was a good B plus student.  And I did all my work.  And did all my assignments.  And did what the teachers told me to do.  And learned what they told me to learn.  And so when I went to the--we didn't have guidance counsel then.  We had a Dean--they called them the Dean of Women--Dean of the high school.  And that was a Miss Good.  I saw her name of Good in a book this week.  And I am trying to check if that was her relatives.  And she had graduated from schools up North.  A lot of our teachers had graduated from the schools up North.  And see we had--[Dr. Mason A.] Hawkins was one of the first graduates from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he was our Principal.  And [Frederick Douglass High School President] Ralph Reckling and all those people had gone to school up in New England.  And we had those people for our teachers.  And [William] Cato Anderson for the history.  And Miss--oh Lord.  I got to think of her name.
Speaker 1: While you're thinking tell me a little bit about you--instead of going to Morgan--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well wait there just a minute.  Then when I went to the coun--not to the counselor, to the Dean of Women and she, "Where you want to go to school?"  "Oh I'm going to Morgan."  "No, you're not going to Morgan.  You're going to Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  I have already sent your name there.  And all you have to do is go there in September  and just say your name Rachel Brown.  And they will know you.  Your father does not have any money to send you to Morgan. (laughs)"  And I'm so thankful for that. (laughs)  It just made him feel bad and my mother that they couldn't send us.  And that's what she said.  Talking about when I tell them we don't have any guidance counselors today.  Now that was back in 1928, I graduated.  And that's the way she talked to me.  "No, you're going to Coppin.  I have already sent your name.  It's already there.  All you have to do is go and report."
Story_ID: 4228
Speaker 1: What were your years [1928-1930] like at Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Oh they were beautiful because when I--you want to know how when I entered Coppin.  And Coppin was--had four rooms in the, in the junior high school.  And when I went--got to Coppin that morning, sure enough, [President] Dr. Miles Connor was standing on the step.  And he said, "Good morning, Miss Hall."  That was the Principal, Miles W. Connor.  "Good morning, Miss Hall."  Well I was amazed.  I went on in and I said to--you know, well I knew everybody because it was just only about thirty-five or forty of us in the class.  And we all had come from [Frederick] Douglass [High School, Baltimore, Maryland], most of us except the few that came from surrounding counties.  And there were plenty of those.  So I said to [educator] Victorine Quill Adams, my lifelong friend in high school, I said, "I know I got to behave here, 'cause he knows my name."  She says, "He knows mine too, Rachel."  And as everybody came in, they were amazed.  He had--she had sent our names all right and sent our pictures too cause he knew everyone of us.  And we had a beautiful time at Coppin.  Because the few teachers that we had there, most of them had come from different places.  And they nurtured us.  And as I said I fell in love with black history from Marley Neck [Rosenwald School, Glen Burnie, Maryland] because we grew--we--our book, we didn't have 'Dick and Jane'.  We had [Booker T. Washington's] 'Up From Slavery [An Autobiography]'.  And that's what we read, that book in Marley Neck.  And we had it in our house.  The people came around selling books in the country.  And most of them were the undertakers.  Whenever they came around--or the society men.  And they would come with books.  And they sold them to those people and they bought them.  And as Philip [husband, Philip Brown] said his father had a library on his kitchen table.  We had a library.  And we had the black books.  And we learned from those black books.  And then when we went to high school, we had [William] Cato Anderson and the old world background.  And he taught it to us like you are going to put this on here.  I'm so sorry you don't have his life on there.  Because those people knew how to teach.  And they taught just like the television and the TV.  And you had to sit there and listen.  You were spellbound.  And so at Coppin--at Douglass, I was stored--filled with Fred Douglass--in  love with him.  Had his book at home.  In love with one of the teachers there that introduced us to [writer and civil rights activist, Mary Church] Terrell.  That was her, mentor.  And so from that day on, she became my mentor.  She wrote a book on Terrell.  I got that book here.  And I just got that book from over Highland Beach [Maryland].  And they say they gonna let me have the one that's in the library, because I loved it so. (laughs)
Story_ID: 4229
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]  in 1930, you got your first teaching job.  Tell me a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well that's when I--when I graduated from Coppin, you see, they taught you to teach in the city.  All right,  I was--and we took the national exam and I passed it. And I was fourteen on that national exam of those children from our class.  Number fourteen.  They didn't hire but seven children. Seven of ours got jobs.  And I didn't have a job by Labor Day.  So my mother [Camsa Henson Burley] brought me down to Annapolis [Maryland] to Anne Arundel County [Maryland] where I belonged.  And told the man that I had graduated and brought my diploma and everything with it.  And it says in that book, "We didn't know we had children in Anne Arundel County finishing high school in Baltimore at Coppin."  'Cause they were suppose to pay for us, this county, if they didn't have adequate high school for us to go to.  So that's what he said.  "And--and you're so late."  My mother said, "Well she didn't get hired.  So I brought her home to get hired."  And--my mother only went out when she went to take care of her children. (laughs)
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school where you got your first teaching job?
Speaker 2: At Skidmore [Elementary School, Skidmore, Maryland] and that's the picture in there you said you couldn't take.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for you, your first teaching job?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well I thought I--I thought I knew how to teach.  And I went in and started teaching the children.  And they loved me.  And I loved them.  And got the little first grade boy.  He's on that picture over there in the corner, Benjamin.  Trying to teach him one plus one.  I put one plus one equal on the board.  And he couldn't learn that.  And I say, "What's the matter with me?"  And I stood up there and cried.  Benjamin cried.  The whole class cried. (laughs)  Philip [husband, Philip Brown] was in the other room with the older children.  So he came in.  And he say--I said, "Oh I am having trouble with this arithmetic."  So he just patted me on the back and said, "Well let's go have some lunch and then come back and try it again." (laughs)  So when I went home.  And my mother and father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] had helped me to write my plan now, before I went to school.  And went back home and told them.  So Papa say, "Rachel, what you do, put the one and the one on the board?"  Say, "Didn't you have some pencils?  Did you put one pencil and another pencil?"  And that's what I--that's when I learned what a concrete example was.  I had finished Coppin.  I had told them on the test what concrete example--I didn't know what a concrete example was.  So papa say, "Now tomorrow--is it sandy down there or stony--or clay?"  I said, "It's stone."  Well next--tomorrow you can go out there and get two stones. (laughs)
Speaker 1: And did Benjamin learn arithmetic?
Speaker 2: Sure.  But Benjamin had a lot of trouble learning.  But he learned.  And he finally--guess what he got me?  He--one day he came in.  I was on I guess four and five.  And he came in with four baby rabbits and the mother rabbit.  "Here's five, Miss Brown."  So he learned what concrete example was before I did. (laughs)
Story_ID: 4230
Speaker 1: What were some of your other experiences at Skidmore [Elementary] School [Skidmore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) at Skidmore.  Well you were--I can make you know where Skidmore is because you've been across the [Chesapeake] Bay Bridge.  Well Skidmore is a little area over there that has rich people and poor people.  Of course, when I say I was poor, I've told the teachers when I went into the white schools, I didn't know what they were talking about was poor because if my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] could build a house and we were-I was born in a brand new house.  It was little,  just four rooms.  But those four rooms were big enough to divide to make eight rooms.  And I wasn't born--as one of my aunt's say, "I wasn't born in a chicken coop.  I was born in a house." And the same thing over Skidmore.  Most of them had their little houses.  But it was a community that was over there with the Labreaux (ph.) farm.  And the Labreauxs were plantation people from Louisiana.  And they had bought up all of Sandy Point.  You know where the park [Sandy Point State Park] is?  They owned all of that.  And a lot of the families worked for Mrs. Labreaux.  Mrs. Labreaux was a very, very rich woman.  And she loved that little school.  And she, she really adopted it.  And she sent us milk to that school.  She sent us summer school to that school. She sent a music teacher; we didn't have any music teacher.  She put a piano in there.  And we were her protégés.  She loved Philip [husband, Philip Brown].  And she loved Rachel. And she loved all of those children.  And those children came to school, like I told you, with their hair done up, late.  Ma getting them ready.  Everybody had a piece of cake for the teacher and for Mr. Brown.  And a tin to put it in, put the tin there.  And flowers, bouquets from the Labreaux garden.  And that's why we love flowers out here.  And that's the kind of school it was.  The children were sickly.  There was a lot of tuberculosis over there.  And a lot of sickle cell anemia.  Mrs. Labreaux had a clinic over there.  And we closed the school two days a month.  And those [Johns] Hopkins [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland] people ran down there and waited on us like they waited on I don't know who.  And that was the kind of school it was.  And that--from that experience, I learned how to help people.  And I knew that.  And that's one thing that I wanted the children and the people to know, the history of our communities and the history of those schools because we learned things in there.  We learned how to be as citizens.  And they tell us that our children don't know how to be citizens. That our parents don't care.  When I know they do care.  But, of course, they put on that I don't care.  They put it on.  But if you nurture them, you can get it out of them.
Speaker 1: And also at Skidmore, you met your husband?
Speaker 2: And also, I met my husband.
Speaker 1: So another good thing there. Oh. And then I was appointed in Baltimore.  But see, me having a country address and my aunt's [Agnes] address, the aunt where it went to moved.  And I did not get the notice.  When I went back to Baltimore for the state teacher's meeting, which you have every year, which it still goes on.  And we had our colored one.  And they had their white ones.  And we went.  I went to Baltimore.  I went to the board of education.  And they said, "It's certainly funny.  We been looking for you.  'Cause you were appointed to a certain school in Baltimore."
Speaker 2: What do you think your life would have been like had you taken that job instead of the job at Skidmore?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's what--and that's the big question and I haven't been able to answer.  But I wouldn't exchange it for the world. Because I didn't even tell my mother [Camsa Henson Burley].  I didn't tell my aunt.  Because I had met Philip two months.  And I came on back to my one room school and I did not go to that school and didn't report it.  And I tell them--I tell everybody,  I said, "I'm about the only person that you ever knew that was appointed in Baltimore, and they just ignored the job."
Speaker 2: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 1: So Mrs. Brown, when you left Skidmore--?
Speaker 2: When I left Skidmore, see that was 1930--,
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: --when I came to teach--,
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --and my future husband and I, well we became very, very good friends.  And the whole two years that I was over there, we were friends.  And I didn't go to Baltimore.  One of my friends in Baltimore said he had given me his ring.  And I had forgotten that. (laughs)  He was angry with me.  And--.
Speaker 1: So where did you go when you left Skidmore?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So wait a minute, that's a story.  Because someone told them that we were going together.  So the supervisor said we couldn't be in the same school, going together.  And we were very, very religious about going together.  Very, very serious about our teaching jobs.  We took school in on time.  We let it out on time.  We did our homework.  We did our seat work.  We did everything we were supposed to do.  So Philip told her, "Well we're going to get married in September."  She said, "Well you can't stay in the same school married."  So one of us would have to move.  So they sent me up to Jones's [Jones Elementary School, Severna Park, Maryland], closer to my home.  And that's why I went to Jones's in 1932, the fall of 1932.  I had just gotten married September the 4th and went to school on Tuesday. And the children from Skidmore, how I can tell now when I know them, they call me Miss Hall still.  Skidmore, they call me Miss Brown.  Stanton [School, Annapolis, Maryland], I was--taught next to Charlie Brown--they call me Miss Rachel Brown.  So I can tell everywhere I taught.
Story_ID: 4231
Speaker 1: And let's talk a little bit about integration, after Brown vs. the Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas, 1954].
Speaker 2: Well I will tell you it was a long hard road.  And we walked that road.  We walked it.  And it had curves in it.  And--what Cullin (ph.) said, "It wasn't easy climbing those stairs."  That's Earl's [uncle, Earl Burley] favorite.  And we--that's why everybody's been calling and talking to us because we were teaching in the '30s [1930s].  Philip [husband, Philip Brown] was teaching in the '28s--see '28 [1928], I was teaching in the '30s [1930s].  So in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s], we were really teaching.  And we were teaching in those schools.  Now in the '30s [1930s], they started to get the [Julius] Rosenwald Schools.  But we were still teaching with old books and not enough.  And they would put up the schools and wouldn't hardly put the curtains in there.  Put a few hand-me-down desks all written on.  And, and we stuck it out.  And Gibson says we're survivors.  And I--we  are survivors.  And I tell Philip that every day.  And just be thankful that we could live to see we--and most of them are gone.  Poor Mr. Mills gone.  And--but we can live to see that we walked that road.  And we walked it with grace.  And we--as I told you from Skidmore [Elementary School, Skidmore, Maryland], I knew I had to get in summer school.  And I was back learning.  Next year, back learning, back learning.  Didn't get my certificates out. I should've gotten them out so you could put them on.  'Cause these teachers need to see them.  'Cause their teaching with not the right certificates.  You understand?  And teaching is a technique.  And it's a art.  And you have to learn it.  And you have to teach it.  And you can't get in there and tell children something.  And we knew that.  And we went to school.  And we kept on going to school.  We went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].  We went to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  We went to--took summer classes back at Bowie [State College, Bowie, Maryland].  We went to reading clinics at Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And we took public speaking from this legislator head.  Got the certificates to show it.  And we know how to teach those children.  But in the integration, when they integrate, they didn't ask us.  And I still hold it against them.  And I will tell it out loud and tell it proud.  Because if they had asked us, it would have gone easier.  And we had gone.  And Maryland--I'm glad we went.  Because the--even the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], they weren't a teaching, teaching school.  They were a sports school.  And we'd learned how to teach.  And we know how to teach.  And they did not ask us.  They told us where to go.  But--and we had walked it in Anne Arundel County [Maryland].  We had this [law] suit.  They paid us what they wanted to pay us.  And the checks were different colors, yellow checks and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yellow checks for black teachers?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  Colored teachers.  And I use the word colored, because that's what we used then.  And I still think we should use it.  Black was a fighting word. (laughs)  And I know we're beautiful.  I knew that and--because the ones that came from Africa, the ones in our family.  We have some black princesses.  We always called them our black princesses. (laughs)
Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, let me ask you so, when Anne Arundel schools finally integrated in 1966, do you remember that first year when you taught in an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like, tell me a little bit about it?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) How was I going to forget it?  I won't ever forget it.  Because in their rush to not integrate--you see that case was 1954.  And that was 1966.  And they used from 1954 to 1966 improving black schools.  And for the first time, see I was in Stanton School [Annapolis, Maryland] in that Stanton story.  And my story's in there.  And my picture's in there.  And in Stanton School with the run down desk and the basement filled with what is it?  That poisonous stuff?
Speaker 1: Asbestos.
Speaker 2: Asbestos and desks all written over.  And bad books, and not enough, and all of that.  But by that time, oh I knew, I knew all the book companies.  I'm telling you.  When I left school, I was about to get a job in one of those book companies like Thelma Sparks.  She started writing books.  And I was up with them.  And I would send for the books--"Tell them I need these books.  I need the workbooks."  They'd send them to you gratefully.  Send people down there to your class, show you how to teach.  We did all that.  So then they gave us the [James A.] Adams Park [Elementary] School [Annapolis, Maryland].
Speaker 1: The first year of integration?
Speaker 2: No, before.  And we went into Adams Park in '55 [1955] after '54 [1954].  Still a black school and it was beautiful.  Built for us.  And I had--I'm on the building community.  They put plaques over there in the school with my name on it.  I went over there every day, talked to the workmen.  Knew what was in the school.  Even then they didn't put the P.A. [public address] system in.  And that builder told me, "It's a shame."  He said, "But while I got these grounds open, Mrs. Brown, I'm gonna pull these wires through.  And whenever they get ready to pull them through, you just tell them all they have to do is pull them through."  They didn't even know that down to the [Maryland] Board of Education.  Another man down there.  But I knew it.  And when I told, they wanted to know how did I know it.  I told them cause I went over there every day and talked to the workmen.  And they gave me fifty thousand dollars that I was suppose to get things for Adams Park.  And that winter I ordered them.  They gave me two weeks out of school to work with my supervisor and a white supervisor.  And I ordered that stuff.  And I ordered it for different children.  I didn't have no Benjamin [learning disabled student in her first grade class at Skidmore School], then.  But whoever was my Benjamin then, what he needed, he was going to get.  And we got that.
Story_ID: 4232
Speaker 1: And don't you know in the spring of '66 [1966], before that material had started to come in and that's when they said we've got to integrate in Anne Arundel County [Maryland].  And they had to integrate because they were not going to send them that money in the fall.  And so they came in the school [James A. Adams Park Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland] and told us where we were going.  Now Philip [husband, Philip Brown], they allowed Philip to say that he wanted to stay in his school.  But now remember, Philip was in the only black high school [Wiley H. Bates High School, Annapolis, Maryland].  I was in an elementary school with a plenty of elementary teachers.  I was the assistant principal.  And so when they brought me in there and said, "Well, where--where do--what--either Mr. Nowell (ph.) will have to go or you have to go. 'Cause they're not gone have two black and white, blacks."  So Nowell looked at me and I looked at Nowell.  Now he was the Principal.  So he said, "Well I'm gonna stay."  Well I said, "Well I'm not going anyplace unless I go down to Tyler Heights [Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]."  And that was down this way, next school to this.  Not the Hillsmere [Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland] was not built.  And Georgetown East [Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland]  was not built.  But Tyler Heights did this whole area, all the white children. And it was a Blue Ribbon School [U.S. Department of Education's award for academic excellence] because it had all the [U.S.] Navy people.  And they wanted to go to that school.  And so I went down.  They told me what day to go down to interview the principal--or the Principal interviewed me.  He interviewed me like I was a brand new teacher.  And he did not want a white--a black Assistant Principal.  And you could see it on his face.
Speaker 2: What was it like for the parents and the students?
Speaker 1: Well as I told you, most of those people were Navy people.  And most of them were educated.  And really in the schools, my first job there was to get books for them to tutor their own children at home.  These were white children.  And our poor black children.  Oh Lord!  You talking about walking the road.  We were still walking the road.  And that was '66 [1966] after that.
Speaker 2: How were the black children faring?
Speaker 1: Well everybody was told that they couldn't do.  They'd keep telling us--if they tell anybody else on TV, "I'm going through the TV.  I don't want them to tell our children they can't learn.  I don't want anybody."  And I've told them that.  And I've been on the TV.  I've been to the schools.  And I've been everywhere and told them.  Been up to Jones [Elementary School, Severna Park, Maryland].  Jones is all--mostly white now.  And they got a blue ribbon.  And I told them it was blue ribbon when I went into the school.  And they told them it always was a Blue Ribbon School.  And they got our books and my pictures up there, on the wall. (laughs)

Speaker 1: So do you think that integration has benefited us as blacks? Or do you think that it wasn't necessarily beneficial?  What are your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well I have thoughts. And my thoughts don't go with--I know it was good.  We had to have it.  And I knew--cause I told Mr. [Larry] Gibson [civil rights attorney].  I knew that it was coming.  I knew we were gonna win that salary because I have always been positive.  And I knew that it had to happen.  Now when, I didn't know that.  And I knew that now.  And I just got the 'Jet' [magazine] just came today.  And [Alphonse] Fletcher [Jr., Wall Street money manager] has given fifty million dollars to work on this.  That's in that new 'Jet'.  Just came out the other day.  And I got to check my book to see who that Fletcher is.  And you have the book or the chronicles?
Speaker 1: But tell me what your thoughts on integration--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh--.
Speaker 1: About integration--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My thoughts.  We had to have integration.  And it was going to come.  Because it was just plain wrong to have two sets of schools. It plain wrong.  But our children--and I didn't have to catch up cause I was up with them.  I was in front of them. And it was a lot of them that were in front of them.  As I told that person on that trip, I could name her two hundred of them that were in front of them. And we started off in front of them because our mother [Camsa Henson Burley] taught us like [clergyman] John Wesley's mother taught him.  You know his story.  She had all of those children.  And when they were six, she sat them at her knee and taught them how to read.  And that's how we learned, at our mother's and father's knees. And they taught us.  And they taught us to be good.  They got the Bible stories out.  And we learned about black people who were up there.  We knew there were some people up there.  And we knew there were some down.  And why would they think that with two hundred years of slavery and daring you to own a book?  When that lady wrote--what was--?  That you couldn't have that book.  That man had the book in his house.  And he went to jail.  You were not suppose to read.  But some of those white people taught those children to read.  My grandfather had a--he had a degree almost as good as Thomas Jefferson's.  And we asked him, "Where did you learn?"  He said, "I learned from the books that was--the books that was sent to Enoch Pratt [Free Library, Baltimore, Maryland]."  He read those books.  And he lived in a house with--before the Civil War.  That's on my mother's side.  And lived in the house on the Hopkins farm.  And he lived with the Clarks.  And his father is a Clark.  And we told Clark that.  And he can get red face like that [son] Earl [Brown].  Look just like him. (laughs)  And he said, "I learned from those books."  And he was smarter than we were.  And he always told us--Came over every Sunday morning.  With my father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] teaching and mother teaching.  He didn't want any dumb grandchildren.  They wanted them to be smart.  And he would sit there and teach us how to read the paper.  And you start from outside--it had the weather out there then.  And you read every word, every page till you get to the end.  And I still read like that today.  My husband [Philip Brown] get so sick and tired of me reading. And when a book come, he say, "She'll never get out of here. (laughs)"  And so how do they expect our children to be up with them?  They--most of them weren't like my grandfather.  He lived in a house with this--he didn't have a wife.  He lived in a house and my grandfather said he had a calendar.  And he kept track of the black women that he had to come there that he had children by.  And when he left that place and started walking, I told you, over to Bensons.  And he said he never wanted to see or hear of him again because he knew how he treated the women.  And some of his half sisters went back down there to that farm.  And that man helped them out.  And we always wanted Pap to go down there and get some money.  Pap (shakes head no)--but he learned.  He got something from him.  He learned from it.  He said he wanted to see how far Pap could go.  And he was afraid to stay in the house by himself.  So he kept my grandfather in the house with him.
Speaker 1: Mrs. Brown, tell me a little bit--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And so I knew we had to have integration.  I'm for integration.  But I knew Thurgood [Marshall] well.  And he told us, sitting right in my house on Kirby Lane--sitting when he came down, "It's the economics that we should be fighting but we can't fight the economics because they give money to education.  And you got to make the money for the economics."  And it opened the door. You understand?  And now we have got to open the door to the economics which you all are doing.  You understand that?  But it takes time.  I got to find out who that Fletcher is that's got that fifty million [dollars].  I know the other Brown--man head a BBT and don't care what we get.  It don't take them long.  They gonna find a way to get it.  You understand that?  All right.  And the--Thurgood opened the door.  That was the best that he could do.  And he did it well.
Story_ID: 4234
Speaker 1: What would you like to see happen now?  What needs to happen now?
Speaker 2: I want our teachers, black and white to be taught.  And I mean taught to teach.  And I don't want them to go and get somebody out of business education to come in there and teach our little kindergarten children.  They're ruining our children in the kindergarten because they're making them sit there too long.  I went to the--I told you I met the young man who teaches the fourth grade.  You might know him in Prince George's County [Maryland].  And he has written a book on the fourth grade experience.  So I told him--and he's gonna write a series from the kindergarten.  So I told him, "You keep in touch with me cause I got something to tell you to put in that kindergarten teacher's book."  Because they're making them stay in school too long.  They're making them sit in the seat too long.  They're ruining their bodies.  And they're not learning.  I learned in the kindergarten from Caroline Cook, who was one of the first kindergarten teachers in the state of Maryland.  She graduated from up in New England.  And she was a twin.  Caroline Cook and her sister.  Her sister worked her feet to the bones and fingers to bones to send her to school.  She taught me how to teach the kindergarten.  And I can write a book on it.  And first thing with child todevelopment, you got to learn child development.  The teachers who are teaching, they've got to learn the child development.  How children develop.  You understand?  Now they got them in the kindergarten.  Mrs. Cook, "Miss Hall, you got those children sitting down there too long.  Clap, clap, clap.  Stand up children and we'll play a little game.  Tell them Miss Hall gets on sometime.  We--you have seven things to do with these children in 140 minutes.  And they've got to have their rest period.  They've got to have their standing up period."  And she had a bell.  And at the end of nine minutes, if you didn't have them standing up, she'd have them standing up.  You're ruining their little bones.  They're just developing.  Same thing for the junior high school where they say they don't sit still.  Junior high school children don't ever sit still.  I went to Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] in the junior high school building.  And that's the first thing that [Coppin State University President] Mr. Miles Connor told us.  "Don't get in the way of junior high school cause they're developing themselves.  And they run all day long.  Don't get in their way."  We didn't get in their way.
Story_ID: 4235
Speaker 1: So tell me about the White House Conference on Children and Youth initiative in 1970?
Speaker 2: Well you see the [U.S.] President's [Richard Milhous Nixon] aide came to the school [Tyler Heights Elementary School, Annapolis, Maryland] with my invitation because I wasn't on the list when they mailed them out.  And oh my--but that limousine and him coming in there.  And oh they ran to get me.  "Mrs. Brown, it's the President's aide is in here for you."  So I went there.  And I didn't know that Dr. Allen was going to get it to--worked out.  And I was suppose to go.  Of course, my principal, he had to get permission from the [Maryland] Board of Education.  So I called the--our board of education person who was in charge of the black school.  "Oh yes indeed, Mrs. Brown.  You can go."  And I didn't ask her to pay my way.  I had to pay my own hotel.  And we went over there [Washington, D.C.] for that week.  And we were promised--oh we were promised so much.  And get back to the integration.  If I could get for all of our children, what they promised us at that conference, oh I wish you could have been--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What kinds of thing did they--,
Speaker 2: --to those lectures.
Speaker 1: --promise?
Speaker 2: Oh they promised us that they were going to put the money into it.  They were going to put the schools in shape.  They were going to teach every child--that was what it was, the right to read.  And every child has a right to read.  And that when they tell us that all of our children can't read, you know right well that that's a lie right there.  Because if you get so many thousand, even with this dyslexia that they're talking about--I didn't know anything about it.  But we sat there and we got those children doing something.  Even Benjamin [learning disabled student in her first grade class at Skidmore School, Skidmore, Maryland] got to do something.  And he--oh he'd love to tell everybody.  "What class you in?"  "I'm in the opportunity class.  Mrs. Brown is going to give me the opportunity to learn all the stuff."  And that's what they promised.  They promised us that at that White House conference.  And I got the tapes in there, the story.
Speaker 1: Do you feel like the promises were fulfilled?
Speaker 2: No.  And they haven't--they really didn't fulfill what they really promised to give us because, you see, when they say, "With all deliberate speed," that was just like saying, "Take your time.  Don't do it."  And some of them took that, took that.
Story_ID: 4236
Speaker 1: And when you think about some of the things that are happening in education now, I want to ask you about a few things and just get your thoughts on them.  The Leave No Child Behind [sic, No Child Left Behind] legislation. What are some of your thoughts on that?  And what impact do you think it's having on schools?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think it is fine.  But I don't like the wording of it. Leave No Child Behind.  I think it should be teach all children.  You understand?  And I want the teachers to learn and to tell them.  Don't tell that child you're behind.
Speaker 1: And do you think more pressure needs to be put on teachers now a days?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes. In Anne Arundel County [Maryland], we're putting it on them.  We're reporting them to the--to the--.
Speaker 1: To the [Maryland] Board of Education?
Speaker 2: No.  They're reporting them to the higher education [U.S. Department of Education].
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.  What do you think should happen to teachers who aren't performing well?
Speaker 2: I think they should be given a turn--a time to really learn.  It takes time.  But they don't have a whole lot of time.  With all deliberate speed.  And then I want them to--even if they have to hire me.  I will go back in a classroom and stay there. I've threatened to leave out here.  Philip [husband, Philip Brown] say, "Rachel, you know you can't work."  And some of my students, you know, they're grown up now.  One of them Thomas Perry, a bright boy said, "Well Mrs. Brown, let me know when you're going.  'Cause I'm going with you. (laughs)  So those children won't bother you."
Speaker 1: What do you think about vouchers? Public school children being able to--public schools that aren't performing well, the children there being able to take vouchers to private schools?
Speaker 2: You know, I think we should bring the voucher and the money there.  And bring those teachers there.
Speaker 1: Do you think that--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I'm serious about that.  I know.  And I'm willing and ready to share.  But I want to take care of our own first, before you get to them.  And let them bring them to the public schools.
Speaker 1: And--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And if we got any left over, give it to them.  But give us ours here now.  And I want it now.  Not tomorrow, "With all deliberate speed."  And I don't want them--even with the astronaut, I don't want to bring him in the school to teach little kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because I don't think he's had child development.  And child development goes with teaching, right on through.  And our big boys like [son] Earl grew up.  When he was fourteen, he was big as a man.  But he couldn't think a bit like no man.  And we have those children now.  They're fourteen.  The girls are fourteen.  They don't know anything about eighteen year olds.  They don't know anything about twenty-one year olds.
Story_ID: 4237
Speaker 1: And we need our mothers.  We need the economics so that mothers can be in their house with their children.
Speaker 2: So--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And we got to get all of it. Economics, housing and the poverty out of the way.
Speaker 2: But speaking of mothers being in the house with their children. If you would have made that choice to be a mother in the house with her children, you wouldn't have been able to impact so many children.
Speaker 1: But remember now when I had my children, I had to stay out one year, one year.  And I nurtured them one year, although I was out subbing [substitute teaching].  I stayed out.  And see you couldn't go back to school.  And you couldn't stay in there till you had the baby.  And you couldn't go back the next day.
Speaker 2: So do you think we need to see more mothers staying out for a little bit longer?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.  Mm-hm.  Mm-hm.  Mm-hm.  And when I went back, I wasn't promised my job.  That's how come I had to teach in so many schools, because I was out twice.  You understand?  And each time, they wouldn't keep my job.  Then I had to go and start all over again.
Speaker 2: Do you ever wish you would've perhaps stayed out?
Speaker 1: No.  I think I stayed out a long time, be--I mean at the right time.  It was right for me.  But you would have to figure it out for you  because I didn't live close to my mother.  But I lived close to a mother.  That lady on the other side of Annapolis [Maryland].  And her name is Brown.  She's not related to us.  She lived across the street from me.  And when my baby--was time to go back to school, she worried me all the summer.  "Where you gone leave that little baby?"  And he had--was over on her porch all the time.  And she finally told me, "I will keep him for you."  And she kept him.  And she really adopted [children] Rachel and Phillip and Earl [Brown].  And then little Earl when he came.  And I was very, very fortunate.
Story_ID: 4238
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life Mrs. Brown, what stands out the most?
Speaker 2: There are so many things, but--and I have the highlights.  Of course, my birth.  I was fortunate to be born to those two people.  They were giants.  And I'm sorry that we don't have my mother's [Camsa Henson Burley] and father's [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] story.  And that's why you see me writing all the time.  And then my schooling was interesting because I had core sections.  And I had wonderful, beautiful teachers.  I was taught about black history.  I was taught the white history.  I can recite that to you just like I recited the others.  And that's what I told them when I went to school.  I learned your history now you learn mine.  And that's what I want with integration.  I learned theirs.  I know it.  And I want them to learn mine.
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd like to be remembered that everybody I touched, I tried to bring out or help them to bring out their greatest potential.  And I've done it with a lot of people.  They come here and sit here and tell us and that.  And then to tell children that, "The race is not to the swiftest, but it's to the one that perseveres and keeps on learning."  And that my favorite one is that nothing is impossible with hard work and the will and the motivation. That's what you don't hear, you see.  You got to motivate those children.  He's gone be sitting there.  And little [William] Cato Anderson answer, kept us--we were up on our knees, listening to him, telling us about how the Moors went into Spain.  And how those black people conquered all of Spain.  And oh that was the first we had heard of that.  And I had old world background in the fourth grade too.  But that's a fascinating story.  And then you tell me I don't know my history.  I--They can't even find Ann Arundel County [Maryland] on the map.  Don't ask them to find Chesapeake Bay [Maryland].
Story_ID: 4239
Speaker 1: And for people who are interested in a career in education, what advice would you have for them? Or what suggestions would you have for them?
Speaker 2: I suggest that we go back and make the tuition cheaper.  Let some of that money, that fifty thousand dollars go for tuition for teachers.  And I'm always talking about getting teachers.  And I belong to a teacher's sorority.  And my sorority took in five new teachers this--just this spring.  And I didn't get to the thing.  But I sent them my love.  And told them, "I'm so happy."  And they been telling me the last ten years, "Oh they don't want to teach, Mrs. Brown."  I said, "You stand up there and motivate them and make them teach."
Speaker 1: But does it concern you that we are in a teachers cri--shortage--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --around this country?
Speaker 2: And they're not paying them enough.  And I want them--as I said, "We got to work on the economics.  They've got to be paid.  I want them to be paid."  But I want them to be teachers and I want them to teach.  You know, I don't want any substitute in any room. And telling my child I can't--is that still on?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well I been preaching it so.
Speaker 1: Well tell me this.  Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Because history is life.  And education is life.  And you've got to know where you came from before you know where you're going.  And you got to put your feet flat in the ground.  And you got to go straight toward where you want to go.  And if you don't have your history, you're going to get off into integration.  All the vices and all of that.  Those--that's what they mean by the road. It had curves in it.  Has esses in it.  You have got to know how to put your foot firmly in front of you.  And you got to know where you came from in order to know where you're going.
Story_ID: 4240
Speaker 1: Do you ever wish you would've taken another career path that you would have chosen another career?
Speaker 2: I don't think--I told you we were destined.  Our father [Rudolphus Marvin Hall] wanted us to be teachers.  And another thing, he called us, "Miss Hall.  Miss Rachel.  Miss Ethel.  Miss Pauline.  And I think if--oh if I could just get in the high school.  And the teachers don't tell the children.  Just everybody one morning went in there and called those children 'Miss Somebody' and they wouldn't know that you had told them.  So you can't say it out loud.  It's got to be whispered.  And you would see a difference.
Speaker 1: What kind of difference?
Speaker 2: You would see a difference in their attitude.  The--first thing, they would look at you and see where you're coming from.  And see where you're going too.  And you call them no nicknames.  My sister Joyce--my niece Joyce had just retired.  They wanted to put her out, 'cause she wouldn't call the little girl, whatever her name was--what her nickname was.  And she said, "I'm not calling you that.  And go down to the Principal and tell her to take you out of my room."  "No I want you to teach." But I want you to call her by her nickname." (laughs)  We didn't call children by their nicknames.
Speaker 1: And what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: My legacy.  I would like everybody to know that I tried to inspire people.  Everybody I met to try to do their best.  And I would love to have some space on that road to peace.
Speaker 1: And when you think about your seventy-two years that you spent with your husband [Philip Brown], what do you think is the key to you all's success?
Speaker 2: I--we kid each other and tell each other we were just too mean to move out. (laughs)  But you see we had the same interests.  Both of us were teachers.  But of us knew how our parents worked.  Both of us knew that they had aspirations for us.  And they wanted us to do.  And to be.  And that's what we have tried to do.  That's what we tried to get over to our children.  And we're still trying to get it over to our grandchildren.  And it's, it's not easy.  But we enjoy every moment of it.  And I wouldn't give up one moment of it.  And I'm not giving up my breakfasts for anybody. (laughs)
